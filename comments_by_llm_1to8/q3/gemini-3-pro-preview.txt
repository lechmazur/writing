  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is anchored early with concrete details (shattered glass, collapsed beams, humid air, wet rot) and evolves through Elias's observation. The setting supplies the butterfly specimen, glass shard, wet leaf, and condensation—all of which constrain his focus and actions. Sensory selection reflects his scientific priorities (visual filters, macro lenses, stress fractures) and shifts as emotional distance collapses. The final image of fogged breath in damp air charges the closure beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the environment is tactile and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting constrains choice: the hard stone hides tracks, forcing Elara to wait for thermal revelation; the canyon's acoustic properties and temperature gradient are plot-active. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her glass-artist lens (molten silica, viscosity, ambient thermal layers). The frost patterns and residual wheel-heat function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single-scene window. The canyon does more than frame—it supplies the method of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Winterglass Conservatory is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (frozen aisles, crystallized flora, biting chill) filtered through Elian's heat-mapping visor, which reframes the setting as a "cacophony of desperate colors." The conservatory's cold and the orchids' stubborn heat constrain his intervention, and the glass containment wall becomes a tool he strikes to generate thermal blooms. Spatial choreography is clear (central exhibit, pedestal of ice, containment wall) and the setting's pressure is sustained through the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater library is vividly particular: "rotting shelves," "dissolved ink," "salt-crusted gears," and bioluminescent glow create sensory specificity. The broken lens as a recurring object—hummed at arrival, heavy in transit, slotted at climax—constrains the final choice and charges the closure image when its "prismatic edges" catch light. Spatial choreography is clear (atrium → central dais). The impossible physics are flagged early ("occupying impossible spaces"), establishing world rules. Minor deduction: the setting pressures atmosphere more than choice; Silas could plausibly have performed this act in any submerged ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta arbor is vividly established and recurs throughout, functioning as command center and ritual space. Sensory detail is selective—moonlight through lattice, biting wind, rustling leaves—and filtered through Elara's urgency. The arbor constrains logistics (high perch, cover of darkness) and charges the final image when Elara "turned back toward the valley," reweighting the space as both sanctuary and watch-post. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Twilight Viaduct is vivid and purposeful: "violet clouds," "luminescent vines," "foggy lucidity" establish atmosphere and the liminal transit space Silas seeks. The camera and Kwan Yin's Tear function as micro-setting that constrains method (he must work under the cloth, match breath to the spirit). The stone bench and moonflowers anchor spatial choreography. The setting charges the final image—motes drifting upward into twilight—without becoming mere backdrop. Reaches the 9-band gate (environment constrains choice, charges closure) but sensory selection leans visual; touch, sound, and proprioception are sparse during the high-pressure breath-matching sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living bridge is vivid and specific: banyan roots, fog-choked chasm, vines woven into hyperbolic knots. Sensory detail is selective (ozone, petrichor, vibrations rattling teeth) and filtered through Elian's urgency. The bridge's trembling and spatial distortion constrain the climactic act, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography at the convergence point—where exactly he kneels, how the vines wrap the fragment—could be more concrete. Micro-setting (vines, roots, fragment) does functional work at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned carnival setting is vivid and specific—sun-bleached teddy bears, petrified candy, lacquer-peeled piano—and the piano bench with skeleton keys functions as both setting and constraint, shaping the decode action. The space is clearly mapped with intruders rounding corners and glass shattering at the front. However, the shackle binding Elias's ankle to the foundation is established early but never becomes a spatial obstacle during his movements to the piano or wall-mounted archery equipment, missing an opportunity to let setting constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (aurora through ocean, polycarbonate walls, nutrient bath). The Ashen Forge is described extensively and constrains the ritual timing. Spatial choreography (workbench, containment unit, microscope, Forge) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the final image by juxtaposing "lush, desperate explosion" against "silent judgment of the sunken ships," linking environment to theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    The terminal transforms from verdigris ribs under amber sunset to emerald underwater radiance by moonlight, and these shifts directly enable Elara's work: she must wait for moonlight to develop the theft. The jar of moonbeams functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains her alchemy and charges the final projection. Sensory hierarchy is vivid and selective, and the green-tinted glass panes filter lunar glow into spectral hue, grounding the metaphysical in architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The control room's structural failure (groaning steel, tilting floor) directly constrains Elias's choice and forces the abandonment. Sensory detail is filtered through his glassblowing POV: furnace color shift (yellow to red), cracked leather texture, viewport sight lines. The annealing oven's immovability charges the final renunciation. Spatial choreography remains clear (blast door, gantries, mountainside slush) and the melt functions as both setting pressure and thematic mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted library's corroded console, exposed iron ribs, and freezing starlight create a tactile pressure that constrains Elias's moves—he winces at metal squeals, uses oblique starlight to read indentations, and the final shutter-slam seals him in embodied enclosure. The child's plaster cast wedged in gears functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic choice. Spatial choreography (center aisle, podium, console, overhead shutters) tracks clearly. The seashell's bioluminescent pulse and the shift from open sky to sealed dark charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ridge fort, storm, stones, and vellum booklet anchor setting vividly. The gale and courtyard exposure pressure Elara's ritual physically (wind threatens to steal the flake), and the evaporated sea in backstory sharpens the motif of retreat. The final gold flake on the map charges the closure image, transforming setting detail into symbolic weight. Sensory hierarchy is clear: visual (star, gold shimmering), tactile (calloused finger, charcoal snapping), auditory (gaps in wind roar), filtered through her oracle's purpose. Micro-setting (the booklet, the stones) constrains her ritual and shapes the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard anchors the scene effectively, with sensory specificity (ozone and regret, snow-dusted granite, biting wind) filtered through 734's cataloging perspective. The ice violin functions as micro-setting: its pulsing rhythm and physical coldness shape 734's interaction and charge the final disposal. Spatial choreography remains clear across the patio, and the temporal eddies add atmospheric constraint without obscuring movement. The environment does not force a tactical choice, capping the score just below 8.0, but it successfully pressures mood and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Crystal Forecourt, damp stones, singing pillars, and resonant acoustics anchor place and constrain the scene's mood. The brass lens is handled across multiple beats, its tactile weight and optical properties enabling the core revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: Mara's "sharp confusion and defensive anger" narrows perception to the tickets and lens. The post-rain shimmering surfaces and "held breath" hush charge the final image of trust restored. Spatial choreography (approach, hand extension, lens transfer, step closer) remains clear. The lens and tickets function as micro-setting that constrains choice and enables the climactic disclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Helix Maze provides spatial constraint and sensory texture ("blooming withering" scent, high walls that limit sunlight). The marble's physical properties—cracked glass, precise angle—directly enable the climactic light-refraction that alters the leaf's state and confuses the sub-prefect's sensor. Micro-setting (the flat paving stone, the narrow shaft of light) charges the final image. Selective detail (gnarled knuckles, canvas apron) reflects Elian's priorities without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gantry, magnetic nexus, and over-clocked capacitors constrain Elian's attempt and provide the means for his breakthrough. Sensory details—"bruise of indigo and violet," "icy warmth," "gossamer light"—are filtered through his professional and obsessive lens. The device's "mechanically warm" heat anchors the climax physically and charges the final contrast with biting cold. Micro-setting (the lever, the prism lenses) drives the key choice and the closing image (wrench in hand) reconfigures his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    The flooded pit, lanterns, submerged podium, and rusted box all constrain Elias's movements and enable key discoveries. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV ("cold liquid seeping," "glassy and hard as obsidian"). The water itself functions as both medium and obstacle, directly shaping the water-damage method and the final retrieval. Spatial choreography (pit, podium, submerged ledge) tracks cleanly across moves. The setting charges the final image of "drowned space" and "sunken cathedral of sound."

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain weather station and its quartz windows, holographic console, and auroral light provide vivid, purposeful anchoring. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting—a physical object whose empty margins enable the pivotal choice. Sensory details (violet and green auroral light, graphite-stained fingertip, brushed steel desk) are filtered through Elias's post-fever perception and serve the action. The spatial choreography remains clear, and the environment directly constrains the solution (analog manipulation of a digital oracle). The setting charges the final image with the auroral glow bathing the smudged flower.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tunnel and mill are vividly rendered—damp brick, rotted ties, beaded condensation on the valve wheel—and the setting constrains movement and discovery. The valve wheel itself functions as micro-setting: its sealed-right position is the physical proof Silas needs, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Silas's professional lens (structural weakness, pressure release, condensation as "cold sweat"), and the spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: vines, ferns, fractured ceiling, moss carpet, and the subterranean river all shape the decision to relocate. The obsidian refuge charges the final image with its black volcanic glass and bioluminescent cavern, constraining Elara's vantage and crystallizing her new role. Sensory detail—damp earth, mold, the river's "heavy, silent power"—is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clear throughout both locations.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with sensory specificity (arid wind, baked earth, pine, scrub brush, jagged horizon). The eclipse transforms the micro-setting (silvered light, razor-sharp shadows, temperature drop, shivering sagebrush), and this environmental shift directly enables the closure beat. The plateau and wheelchair staging are clear; the curl and guitar function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final moment. One minor slip: "gossamer corona of white fire" leans decorative at the peak beat without adding tactical pressure. Reaches 9+ threshold: environment (eclipse-altered light/temperature) decisively shapes the magic's surge and Elara's response.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reclaimed silo is vividly rendered with "spiraling gantries of rust," "bronze quiet," and a slanted floor that reminds of the planetary shift. Sensory detail is filtered through an atmospheric lens rather than urgent action, fitting the accumulative mode. The blackened hearth and tapestry constrain Elian's probing by concentrating the mystery in one location. The setting charges the final image: the silo's "eternal, dreamless vigil" echoes the opening and reweights the psychic-impression premise.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse lantern room and Fresnel lens are richly detailed (scarred oak desk, velvet-lined case, mercury bath), and the beam's rhythmic sweep marks time and atmosphere throughout. The microdot specs and hydraulic levers function as micro-setting tools that constrain and enable Arthur's final choice. The rocky island isolation and "after last orders" timeframe filter perception through Arthur's vocation. Sensory detail is purposeful (crash of ocean, particles igniting like stars), and the lighthouse evolves from cold-war fortress to comforting mystery at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment directly shapes the climactic act.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Dimensional Anchor's "ozone and suspended dust," "vibrating metal grating," and "muffled clarity" atmosphere are vivid and purposeful. The palette and its Vantablack glob constrain the entire exorcism, charging the final image when the paint splatters into "muddy ash." Spatial choreography is clean (priest kneeling, Keeper in lap, palette on floor). Minor gap: the station's role as a setting (dimensional anchor against "chaotic void") is asserted but never pressures a choice—it remains backdrop rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Glass Spire and frozen lake create a crucible: altitude and silence enable the experiment, the mirrored horizon phenomenon supplies the visual frame, and the glass itself becomes the notation surface and resonant membrane. The Nautilus shell (logarithmic spiral, golden ratio) functions as both symbolic anchor and functional tool that filters wind into tone. Sensory hierarchy reflects Silas's priorities—he notices thermal expansion of ice, atmospheric friction, the precise moment sun strikes surface—filtered through his obsessive focus. The final image (spire suspended in seamless sphere of light) charges closure by manifesting the metaphysical ambition in physical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing viaduct constrains Elara's path—she must trust the tablet to manifest walkways over the abyss—and the post-rain sheen, mist, and "darkening brightness" are filtered through her crisis perception. The droplet and ripple anchor the temporal frame concretely, charging the final synchronization. Spatial choreography (hovering six inches, leftward swing, boot-strike) remains clear across moves. Minor gap: the viaduct's procedural shifting is described but not shown altering mid-action in ways that force tactical adjustment, so its constraint is more atmospheric than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern's moss-lined ceiling, giant cured hides, and damp limestone walls create a coherent subterranean womb that amplifies vibration—directly enabling the ritual's tactile feedback loop. The workbench and turntable constrain Silas's method (he presses palms to the table's edge). The autumn-to-winter threshold mirrors the emotional shift but remains decorative rather than pressing a choice. Spatial choreography is clear (steps, workbench, nearest drum). The setting charges the closure by providing the resonant chamber that makes the emotional dam-break possible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard setting is vivid and purposeful: "purple shadows," "overgrown garden," "rust patterns and the grip of the vines" all filter through Elara's professional eye and guide her escape route. The aged iron and decorative ridge constrain her lateral traverse, satisfying the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography during the climb is clear and the environment charges the final image (mossy tiles, abandoned terrace). Minor: the "rogue quarantine zone" context remains somewhat abstract rather than pressing choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly rendered through touch ("cool floor," "damp, raw earth"), sound (hum), and evolving air ("heavy and viscous"). The grotto's rear wall—thickest, most ancient—functions as the site where time pools, directly enabling the climactic choice. Spatial choreography (kneel, scrape, reach the wall, pull away) remains clear throughout. The energy beings' shifting light charges the scene but remains atmospheric; the grotto itself constrains the final action when the rope smokes and he must choose.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken orchard, rusted tankers, and glass dome are vivid and purposeful. The mendicant's bowl constrains choice (scavenged resin enables the fire), and the bonfire provides rhythmic percussion that "snapped against the oppressive quiet." The dome itself becomes a resonant instrument, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, sensory detail is filtered through Elara's perceptive ears, and the environment directly shapes the violin's amplification tactic. Micro-setting (bare feet on concrete, vibrations traveling through the floor) enriches the moment without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    The amber grotto is anchored early and provides atmospheric texture ("honeyed gloom," "ancient, golden walls"), but it functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a constraint on choice—Silas could perform this procedure in any secluded chamber without altering tactics. The blotter petal and tweezers are handled on the page and integral to the action. The static-electricity sensing is a micro-setting element (embodied perception) that charges two beats: the opening panic and the final smoothing. The grotto does not pressure the choice or alter the outcome, so it remains in the mid-band despite vivid description.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Maritime Athenaeum—open-air, brass clips, teak chairs, stone trellis—is vividly particular and consistently filtered through Elias's professional eye (freight tonnage, dockside office). The setting provides atmosphere and frames the encounter but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the outcome. Spatial choreography (balustrade, carts, chairs overlooking harbor) remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (locket in her palm) charges the emotional peak but does not redirect action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and marsh reeds supply vivid sensory contrast (translucent chimes vs. light-drinking glass vs. organic decay). Spatial choreography is coherent across the crater's lip, the fracture, and the arbor. The reeds constrain Elara's final choice—she must use her softer medium to bridge the gap—and the arbor becomes the canvas for closure, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Minor descriptor recycling ("glimmering," "shimmering") and the vague timeframe slightly dilute specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop canal system, suspended water droplets, and spire lattice are vivid and selective. The frozen world's grayscale palette and "solid wall" wind support the time-sculpting premise. The pendant as recurring object charges the final image (searing hot) and the geological shudder beneath constrains her window. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor slip: "purple shadows of twilight" is a stock phrase that momentarily weakens specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern orchard, mosaic stone, and moonlight shaft are vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual spatially. The glass eyes and silver sap constrain the action's mechanics, and the final meadow image contrasts the "damp dark of the cave" to charge closure. Sensory selection is consistent but leans visual; the "sound like grinding teeth" is the sole tactile-auditory anchor in the peak beat. Minor: the meadow appears only at the end without prior spatial seeding, so its contrast feels declarative rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The municipal archives, crawl space infrastructure, and dawn-blue atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (sapphire hush, cold indigo seepage, strobing emergency lights). Spatial choreography is clean: ceiling beams → vent grate → service hatch → circulation desk. The tape's placement atop her stack and the vent's concealment constrain Elias's proximity choice, directly shaping the caching plan. The setting charges the final image: his shadow refuge versus the "warm yellow incandescence" flooding the library. Minor: the "ornate brass vent grate" detail feels slightly decorative given Elias's years of familiarity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse's "suffocatingly rich" oxygen and the rain-soaked trellis provide sensory anchors that guide Elias's movement from interior to exterior. The mossy trellis directly enables the final choice (he leans into it, moss cradles his spine) and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the two locations. Minor gap: the linden leaf's bioluminescent energy is vivid but its role as constraint could be more tactile in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Needle's tidal cycle, volcanic rock, ash dust, and the unearthed subway-coral convergence all constrain choice: rain trails guide Elias to the forbidden overhang, the rising tide threatens to reclaim the tunnel, and the artifact's location pressures the exchange. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (oily droplets carving ash canyons, the honeyed light of amber against storm gloom). The brooch as micro-object charges the final image. Spatial choreography (terrace → cliffside → northern overhang descent) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Singing Geode is richly anchored through sound (melodic humming, harmonies), light (bioluminescent pulse, high-contrast silhouettes), and geology (quartz formations, obsidian gloom, cave pearl's geological memory). The overlapping shadows—specific geometry of light and darkness—directly enable the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint. Sensory selection reflects urgency: Elara narrows to the pearl's "magical signature" and shadow intersection at peak pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (cross-legged center, pilgrim shuffles in, hands approach, silhouettes merge on pearl surface).

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ivory harbor after rain is vivid and purposeful: "slick and luminous under a bruised purple sky," "wet ivory stones," fog pushed back by sound. The herald's trumpet valve functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining Elian's choice (without it, the annunciator is mute). The valve's salt-pitted texture and the rusted manifold pressure the climactic beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's professional lens (chemical memories, steam pressure, frequency). The setting charges the final image—sun breaking through, wet stone illuminated—without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting moves purposefully from cracked pavement to abandoned train yard to the starlit vault in mist, each location shaping Elara's choices: the arrows direct her path, the chasm forces the dare with the punch tool, and the vault's crystalline containers house the climactic choice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("air tasted of ozone and finality," "thick, unnatural fog," "constellations of cold light trapped within the fog"). The phantom train ticket punch functions as both tool and key, constraining her method of crossing the void. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the impossible geography, and the vault's architecture directly enables the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tower is vividly rendered (wind, briny scent, stone floor resonating with whale thrum) and the whale migration below functions as both atmospheric anchor and thematic mirror. The magic square tile is handled in multiple beats and its grooved numbers constrain Elara's transcription method. The setting pressures her choice: the impending demolition creates urgency, and the sensory environment (whale vibrations merging with memories) charges the final image. Micro-setting elements (pedestal, star charts, ceramic tile) all contribute to the closure effect, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prismatic escondite—kaleidoscope of refracted light, walls warping, floor becoming rolling glass—constrains Elian's action by rejecting his presence (spatial mutiny) and supplies the metaphysical walls he breaches. The solar storm functions as both timeframe and environmental pressure, bathing the exterior in lethal radiation and forcing the breach. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (suppressed resonance, hushed thunder, black smoke) and filtered through dimensional awareness. The fragment's physical dissolution and the fissure's "cessation of geometry" charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting actively shapes the ritual and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The funeral-home prep room is vividly rendered—stainless steel tables, porcelain sink, trocar, chemical warmth—and the setting charges the tone ("deathly vitality") throughout. Spatial choreography is clear: Julian at the sink, Elena behind the suits, Vance entering and stepping to the table. The ink pot as micro-setting object constrains the key choice (Vance must sign with Julian's ink), directly shaping the closure beat. The environment sustains atmosphere and guides action without becoming a postcard catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bonsai mountaintop is vividly particular (miniature oaks/maples, twisted perfection) and constrains the scene by requiring pre-dawn silence and flat stone workspace. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through craft priorities: humidity check, star angle, fluorescent buzz "vibrating against her teeth." The lamp's "harsh, artificial light" against organic bonsai creates purposeful tension. The prism, gold leaf, and wet vellum function as micro-setting that shapes the ritual, meeting the 9+ gate partially. Small deduction: the "phantom city" shadows in the penultimate beat feel decorative rather than constraining a final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rust, salt air, groaning cranes) and serves as both shelter and constraint, shaping the protagonist's scavenging routes and ritual space. The tidal rhythm modulates the environment in a way that pressures the narrator's movements and sleep. The Maersk container shadow and the crack in pavement anchor key beats. The setting constrains choice (the narrator cannot leave the port's margin) and charges the final image of disappearing into "metal canyons," making it indispensable to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory on a cliff is vivid and stable; the rusted gantry, unvarnished cello, and grey static horizon anchor the apocalypse. The half-finished cello constrains Elias's method (he needs "the friction of something incomplete") and the painted seashell wedged inside disrupts vibrations, charging the final image when it sheds its artificial colors. Dust motes aligning along "invisible magnetic lines" integrates sensory detail with the ephemeral compass concept effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The raft city is vividly anchored: neon bleeding into water, stale popcorn mingled with diesel, swaying horizon, rusted pontoons. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional lens (fluid dynamics, winch/rope mechanics). The foundation stone constrains the climactic choice by defining legal center, and the graffiti canvas and perimeter barge are spatially clear. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from main tent to shadowy alleys to outermost barge. Minor gap: the tugboat captains watch "through binoculars from the outer perimeter" but their exact position and the mechanics of their response remain abstract, slightly reducing the tactile lived-in quality at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit summit constrains Elias's choices throughout: he must avoid radar detection, endure freezing cold, and wait motionless while drones patrol below. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—sodium light, gray dust, the cerulean chemical strip, diamond-white horizon—and filtered through his professional POV (crater inspector checking for micro-fractures). The final image of "harsh, sterile glare" replacing "pale and ghostly illumination" charges the closure by embodying the thematic loss in concrete environmental change.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-coated depot, brass-and-glass kiosk, cascading crystal basins, and haptic interface are vivid and specific. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, diagnostic station, door). The depot's soundscape (thrumming engines, anchor groans) and the shadow of the airship sliding across skylights provide sensory pressure that tightens the timeline. The crystal basins function as micro-setting, constraining Elias's diagnostic method and charging the final repair sequence. However, the kiosk interior does not alter any tactical choice—Elias could perform the same repair elsewhere with minimal adjustment—so the setting supports atmosphere more than it shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and "suspended breath of a predator" atmosphere establish a coherent spatial and tonal anchor. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "corrugated metal roof," "rime frost," "thick and clouded" glass. The viewport and condensation micro-setting constrain Silas's discovery action—he must exhale to summon the map—charging the final image. Minor gap: the falcon's physical staging (railing distance, sight-line) is vague, and the "ancient room" with "invisible magnetic fields" introduces unexplained world logic that isn't revisited or integrated into Silas's epistemic framework.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The limestone archway, cobblestones, and ebony tuning fork supply vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Silas's method and charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong: "heavy air," "wild hush," the fork "swallowing noise" and later "singing." Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The archway's groan and hum function as a micro-setting barometer that directly pressures Silas's timing and validates his intervention at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater temple setting constrains every choice: water density slows movement, oxygen scarcity creates urgency, coral-choked machinery forces manual labor. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "bioluminescent algae painted...in strokes of teal and violet," "low frequency vibration that resonated through the water." The altar functions as both setting and tool, its mechanical state directly shaping the climactic action. The final image of "lonesome splendor" charges closure by making the tomb welcoming. Strong micro-setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse prison setting provides atmospheric particulars—"copperlight repose," "black basalt," "curved walls"—and the lattice object becomes a tool that fragments perception, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single chamber. However, the setting's "strange geometry" and "fault line of reality" are asserted rather than demonstrated through concrete constraint on earlier choices, reducing its pressure role to backdrop until the exit moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (humid warmth vs. frost, venomous dew, black-barked apple tree) and constrains Julian's movement through the poisonous flora. The setting charges the closure image by framing the orchard's return to slumber as the magic fades at dawn, reinforcing the transactional finality. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the micro-setting (body heat attracting plants, glass pane reflection) anchors beats without becoming a postcard catalog. The winter fields outside function as tonal contrast but do not constrain a choice, so the timeframe element remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal canyon operates as a living constraint: the receding ocean exposes the workspace, "orchid solace" humidity enables the trance, and the moonlight guides needle placement. Spatial choreography—lowest docking ledge, opposing cliff faces, overlapping paths—remains clear and tactile throughout. The final stitched mesh transforms open air into a "suspended floor of silver and stone," charging the closure image with the environment's material presence. Sensory detail (wet rock, vanilla vines, groaning sandstone) filters through Elara's professional focus without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, specific, and purposeful: roots "weave through the yellowed bones," the "fissure high above where the olive roots entered" supplies light for reconstruction, and the blocked exit mirrors exile. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent, wandering, and final restoration. The sundial's placement "at the very heart of the orchard" and its requirement for light directly constrain Elara's task, charging the closure when "the beam hit the restored stone." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a quasi-archaeological gaze, though the piece tilts visual at the expense of scent and touch in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Golden Arcade at dawn is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "bruised light," "dormant holographic advertisements," "synthesized mahogany," "brass chute." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's priorities (the texture of paper, the coldness of brass, the friction against ebony). The ebony clipboard, fountain pen, and vellum constrain his method and anchor his resistance to the digital world. However, the setting does not force a choice or alter tactics—it provides atmosphere and thematic backdrop but remains largely static. The micro-setting (the tools) charges the final image slightly but does not reshape options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt meteorite dome, russet vines, thin cold air, and acoustic perfection ground the scene with sensory specificity. The loom, eternal-candle lantern, and spun-nebula filament function as micro-setting that constrains Lysa's method. The autumn decay motif and wind return in the final beat to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (hidden compartment, needle into flame, embroidery ripple) is clear and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth, houseboat on stilts, opaque windows, and moonlight through the skylight all anchor vividly and the skylight's beam enables the stone's healing—a clear constraint that shapes the ritual's success. The condensation on the glass is both atmospheric and functional, serving as the medium's message board. The setting pressure is modest but present; the moonlight's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atrium's mist, glass doors, and teak bench ground the scene immediately. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, then during rewriting) and charging the final transformation by grounding him "in the present moment." The clinical coldness giving way to warmth tracks emotional shift through spatial perception. Spatial choreography (bench, cast on knees, pen from pocket) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard is vividly rendered (damp air, wet stone, ghostly fruit sweetness) and the fog functions as a material constraint—Elara must treat it as "photosensitive emulsion," which directly shapes her method. The fresco fragment serves as a conductive key, grounding her interface with the knowledge network. Spatial choreography is clear (gnarled tree, suspended trails, cathedral of light). The setting charges the final image: the fog holds her work and then releases it, embodying the theme of beautiful futility without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Sound Wave Garden's acoustic geometry—concave steel petals, polished stone parabolas—directly enables the coin-toss and the nested awakenings. The "sweet spot of the parabolic reflector" is a concrete constraint that shapes the inciting action and the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("vibrations, a vivid thrumming of indigo and violent scarlet"). The hobo nickel, the graver, the boxcar, and the garden itself recur with shifting meaning across layers, and the final gravel landing anchors the return with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vivid—wet loam, pheromones, captive insects—and its biological noise explicitly dampens scanners, making it a tactical choice rather than postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean: ferns, intake valve, glass ceiling with searchlights, iron entrance buckling. The gourd seed's interaction with the ventilation turbine is concrete and alters the ending, lifting the setting into the 7-band. Minor slip: the "frayed tweed coat" and "spectacles" feel like costume rather than lived-in detail that constrains movement under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its spiraled ceiling gathers weather, its pearlescent walls resonate with Elias's voice, its calcium structure provides purchase for vines. The shift from "tomb to cradle" is embodied through temperature and humidity changes. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's priorities—sound, texture, scent—anchored in his ritual work. The environment charges the final image: moss cushions him as flowers breathe, completing the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Opal Library setting is vivid and specific: iridescent stone, high altitude, glass orchids growing from "accumulated breath of history." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (thin atmospheric winds, porous stone walls, opal floor). The wind chime and the cracked bamboo tube function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elian's repair choice and charge the closure when the restored note feeds the orchids. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The Archive is anchored early and the glass ink well becomes tactile setting through its faceted surface and magical properties. Spatial choreography (drafting table, door, Kael's travel bag) tracks cleanly. The "heavy air" and candlelight create atmosphere, but the environment itself doesn't constrain a key choice—the magic and ink well do the work. Sensory detail leans visual; the "hum through floorboards" adds texture but other senses remain underused.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amphitheater's thermal expansion ("the moment the building breathes") constrains timing and provides cover for sabotage, directly shaping Elian's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his professional lens: "shimmering waves," "deep, resonant groans," "metal singing beneath his boots." The surveyor's chain and pressure gauges function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across the gantry and control platform, and the volcano's residual heat is integrated into action rather than merely described.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The attic setting is vivid and purposeful: the skylight and dust-mote ritual directly constrain Elian's choice to launch the bird, making the environment essential to the climactic action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's POV (dry rot, germinating mold, amber light, convection currents). The "mapping the swirl of dust motes" micro-setting functions as both diagnostic tool and atmospheric anchor, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: trapdoor, spiral stairs, skylight, open window. The attic's altitude and air currents are not decorative but mechanically necessary for the payload and song.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drifting prism terrace, mahogany desk, and suspended old-world fragments create a vivid, specific space. Sensory details (refracted light, rough wood grain, translucent floor) anchor the setting and the desk's grain functions as a map that constrains Elara's investigation. The final step back gains spatial meaning from the established void. However, the physics of the terrace (how one moves through "chaotic winds of probability") remains abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered with "rusted corridors," "reinforced glass," and the plankton bloom deadline, and the ostracods' bioluminescence charges the final image directly. Spatial choreography is clear (observation dome, console, glass), and the setting supplies the miracle that reweights Elara's stance. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's bias (vertical abyss vs. celestial alignments). The body and glass as micro-setting constrain perception, and the fogged condensation from the shared exhale integrates atmosphere into the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The geode setting is vivid and specific ("violet quartz walls," "amethyst floor") and constrains choice: the wall blocks her path, the foam is time-sensitive, the scattered seeds form an arrow. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's cheerful-morbid lens ("rainy funeral where everyone secretly hated the deceased but loved the sandwiches"). The crater glass's vibration and the projections of light charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. Environment actively shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered—"sucking black mud," "rusted pilings," "salt spray and hot circuitry"—and the setting constrains Elias's setup (tide swell timing, structural sway). Micro-setting details (soda can rotation, floorboard unevenness, coin-pusher tilt from rising tide) directly enable the cascade, meeting the 9+ gate for choice constraint. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elias's analytical lens, though the woman's perspective is never embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.7)
    The twilight garden's "synthetic atmosphere," "bioluminescent hedges," and "artificial constellations" establish the dome-world efficiently and anchor Lyra's ritual against a controlled, sterile environment. The marble bench, glass stylus, and energy shield gaps all constrain her method—she must observe voids in the shield to align her tides, and the setting's lifelessness sharpens the contrast with the storm-lashed coast she seeks. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, path, perimeter gate). The final moment ("synthetic moss," "perimeter gate," "darkness") uses the threshold micro-setting to charge her departure. The garden does more than backdrop; it materializes the ban's sterility and her renunciation of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (gray vapor, wet sand, salt-crusted windows) and the tidal pool constrains Silas's ritual choice. The prism atrium functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when sunlight refracts through it. Spatial choreography is clean (jetty, rock pool, atrium). Minor gap: the interior of the atrium is never shown or handled tactilely; we see it only from outside, which slightly limits the embodied pressure it could apply.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The moonlit ridge, blackened trees, and scorched boulder anchor space vividly and filter through Silas's firefighter perception (thermal columns, Pulaskis). The porcelain box—a recurring tactile object—constrains his grip and charges the final image when opened. Sensory hierarchy (soot-stained jacket, wind bite, shale underfoot) is selective and purpose-driven, meeting the micro-setting test for choice and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is vividly rendered (tide-polished, ozone smell, basalt ceiling) and anchors the action throughout. The altitude gauge and balloon constrain Elian's method and charge the final image when the needle points past the red zone, signaling pure possibility. Spatial choreography is clean: the balloon ascends through solid rock turned to mist, the entrance recoils, moss color returns. The setting functionally shapes choice and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement despite some decorative phrasing in early description.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ivy-veiled passage, moss-muffled corridor, roofless library with jagged slate overhang, and the preserved hearth anchor spatial progression clearly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "frequency of abandonment," "rain and rot," ash "solidified over decades." The sonic emitter and headphones ground Elias's profession in tactile use. The hearth as micro-setting constrains the discovery method (excavation) and the film strip held to pale light charges the final revelation. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism parapet after rain functions as both setting and tool, constraining Elara's method and timing. Spatial choreography (terrace, balcony doors, oval mirror, sleeping dog) remains coherent throughout. Sensory detail—wet stone, lilac scent, violet sky—filters through the moment without tourist-catalog excess. The terrace as micro-setting charges the final image when Elara dissolves into the damp evening air, though the high city itself remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient terrace, twin moons, smoking valley, and mosaic tiles anchor setting vividly. Sensory detail is selective: heat, starlight, jasmine, cordite. The ebony clipboard and silver sheet are handled objects that charge the closure. Gate achieved: environment (the terrace as neutral ground during the celestial window) enables the ritual and the final image. Minor penalty: the "slow dance of celestial bodies" silencing weaponry is explained but never pressures a tactical choice on the page—it sets mood but doesn't constrain movement or force a deadline-driven decision.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The salt flat is vivid and particular: "blinding geometry," "jagged tessellated cartography," "broken porcelain plate." The thermal vents and fissure map constrain Vance's choice of placement site, directly shaping the release action and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his dual priorities (industrial efficiency, aesthetic mourning). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (the specific fissure) functions as the closure stage, elevating the score.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Silver Courtyard's snow and chill anchor the scene vividly, and the Prism Sanctuary's geometric construct supplies a concrete object for Elara's action. Sensory detail (cold pain racing up her arms, snow blasted away) is filtered through urgency and integrated into the unlocking beat. The courtyard's "alarming serenity" charges the opening and the final tempest, and the spatial choreography (Elara walks, stops, raises hands, pulls) remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (her trembling fingers on the spell-knot) constrains the method and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The decommissioned radar dome's "curved, acoustic tiles" and "vast acoustic space" actively amplify silence and shape the crowd's half-lit comprehension, constraining perception throughout. The swinging bulb provides a recurring visual anchor that charges the final static shadows. Spatial choreography is clean: booth, stage center, crowd positions track coherently across the reversal sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto setting is vivid and specific—"high-altitude bamboo," "jagged peaks that pierced the white ocean"—and constrains Elias's material choices (bamboo stalks, moisture-dependent knot). The moth wing trapped in moss and the final structure both use the environment to charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is clear: damp soil, thinning air, blushing sky. The environment's transience (moisture/drying cycle) mirrors the thematic concern and enables the metaphor to function as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rope's physical constraint (stiff with frost, requiring delicate manipulation) shapes Elias's method and the scene's tension. The aurora functions as both atmosphere and active force—its light carries physical heat that melts the bronze, directly enabling the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear: workbench, mold, crucible, rope, aperture. Micro-setting (the rope's brittleness, the crucible's placement) charges the final beats. One slip: "icebound sanctum under aurora" risks postcard generality in early description, but the piece anchors tactile detail (frost, plaster, tongs) that recovers specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bunker's moss, corroded wire, fungal growth, and "concrete ribs" create vivid tactile grounding. The storm's arrival pressures the timeline and the flooding hindsight/foresight narrows Elara's window. The red box hidden beneath rusted panels constrains her search and the wafer seal's brittleness charges the breaking moment. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, rotting leaf litter, wet concrete) reflects urgency and fits POV. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. Minor: the "fields of static and swirling starlight" dreamscape, while evocative, is less grounded than the physical bunker and risksPostCard generality, but returns purposefully to guide the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: blue-glazed brick corridors, obsidian floor inlaid with silver dust, brass gears and clockwork astrolabes. The high observatory dome both isolates Bel-ibni from the invasion below and provides the celestial access his ritual requires. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his utilitarian perspective (sacred oil conservation, threadbare robe, ozone and ancient dust). The magic square tile and chalk function as micro-setting objects that constrain action: he taps the tile three times to initiate the mechanism, draws schematics for three years' saved chalk. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The ziggurat's vertical structure—gates crashing below, quiet order above—charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The Soundless Sanctuary is vividly described (collapsing geometry, churning mercury floor, transparent walls revealing violet cosmos) but functions primarily as backdrop; sound nullification is declared yet never constrains a tactical choice—Elian initiates the "forbidden technique" without working around the silence. The brass cylinder is handled twice (withdrawn, pressed to wrist) but its physical properties (studded pins, broken stem) do not alter Kaelen's options or Elian's approach. Spatial choreography is intact (floor, distance, arm-grab) but sensory details do not filter through POV urgency or narrow perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the fog, freezing mud, and twilight frost constrain Silas's stance and breathing rhythm, directly shaping the ritual's success. The orchard's "thick fog" and "gnarled, dead trees" create atmosphere without catalog excess, and the "glass mountains" echo in the final crystalline transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (center of grove, boots in mud, sextant raised). The frozen mud anchoring Silas meets the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice), though the transformation to mirrored surface, while vivid, relies more on assertion than on micro-detail that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and specific, and the cathedral's vaulted skeleton provides spatial grounding. The beam, the rift's violet light, and the ribbon's grass stain deliver sensory anchors filtered through Elara's professional lens. The orchard's gravity-defying roots and the quartz eye's amber grid constrain her physical positioning and tactical options. The setting charges the final image (trees rustling thanks, beam patted affectionately) without becoming a postcard. Minor: the ozone-and-pears scent is evocative but does not recur or shape a later choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The astral orchard functions as more than backdrop: glowing boughs cause physical discomfort (radiation-like radiance, tooth ache), the C-sharp hum creates sensory specificity, and the spectral fruit becomes a "library of unlived lives" that pressures Elian's choice. The bathroom sanctuary provides tactile contrast (white tiles, steel mirror, ventilation drone) that enables his breakthrough. The pistachio shell as micro-object and the orchard's intensifying light both constrain and charge the final decision, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The geological-book architecture is vivid and purposeful: fossilized encyclopedias, ink-black ivy, paper-thin blossoms metabolizing forgotten words create a coherent world that constrains Elara's path and supplies the diary's taxonomic gap as the lever. Spatial choreography is clear through the spiral descent to the obsidian gate. The fungi on the golem's shoulder—unnoticed by the Traveler—directly enables the negotiation and charges the closure image, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carnival ship is rendered through vivid, selective detail: "rusting hulk," "warped deck," "ferris wheel looming mid-deck," "verdant mold," "vines of iron and oxidation." The emerald swatch card functions as both object and micro-setting anchor, cutting through fog and resonating with the mold in the atrium. Spatial choreography is clean—gangway, deck, concessions, iron door, atrium—and the atmosphere shifts from eerie to "blissfully aberrant" as Elara moves inward. The Garden's humid, soil-less verdancy constrains the encounter by offering only decay, not the living sister she sought, charging the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered with "rhythmic breathing of brass gears," "massive cogs," and the ceremonial rope as a tactile, functional object. Spatial choreography is clean: Elian approaches the central drive shaft, works on the rope, steps back. The setting constrains his work (the rope hangs between cogs, the door exists only in a frozen moment) and the final bell's resonance charges the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through an archivist's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen lake, ice fissures, and echo chamber stone all constrain Elara's final choice—she must be at this precise intersection of stress lines. Sensory details (thin air, ozone stink, misting breath) are filtered through her mapkeeper lens. The subterranean setting provides the necessary acoustic architecture. However, spatial choreography of the energy beings' approach could be sharper; "drifted closer" and "filling the tunnel" lack precise distance markers during the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Glass Humming Pavilion is vividly realized: transparent floor, dome, brass cradle, maintenance ladder, focusing lens—all constrain Elara's movements and choices. The "hum vibrating in her teeth" and "marrow of her bones" anchors physicality. The prism's placement in the brass slot, the manual crank, and the alignment with starlight through grime-streaked glass make the setting an active participant in the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the post-collapse ruin beneath her feet contextualizes the stakes without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting constrains and charges throughout: the crystal forecourt releases voices only after rain, the shadow measurement depends on atmospheric density, and the observatory's isolation mirrors the inward turn Elara records. The thermal stylus, ozone smell, and wet crystal are tactile and purposeful. The final image of "unmoving cloudscape" reweights the opening storm, making stasis tangible. Minor gap: the basalt obelisks and sundials are mentioned but their physical arrangement (distance, height) remains vague during the shadow measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Blooming Fortress is richly textured with specific, POV-filtered detail (wild thyme, vine-choked walls, moss-hidden tiles) and the oppressive dusk atmosphere directly motivates Elian's performance. The kerosene rag knot functions as a micro-setting object that enables the final action. Minor deduction: the humidity is described as "treacherous" but never demonstrably constrains a choice—Elian adjusts his powders off-page without dramatized friction or visible cost to the adjustment process.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    The grotto (limestone ceiling as fractured eye, tide pool with starlight and seaweed, starfish detaching) directly charges the closure by supplying the observational material through which Elara processes Kael's departure. The jade cicada's ridges and coolness ground her bodily under pressure. Micro-setting succeeds: the pool's incoming tide shift enables foresight of future years. Sensory detail is filtered through professional bias (purple sea urchins, swaying fronds) and the final tide metaphor integrates setting into the release speech. All three gates met with closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Xenial Trellis functions as hospitable constraint ("metal vines shifting gently to cradle"), and the body (stomach rising, marrow shift, palms over ears) shapes the ritual. The stratospheric setting pressures every sensory choice and charges the final image of descent. Micro-setting elevation: the doll's hollow eyes and the inversion's "buoyant, upward-falling ocean" anchor world rules and tactic. One small slip: "weeping cloud layer" and "ravaged earth" are vivid but not leveraged in the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is vivid and purposeful, its resonance properties integral to both the inciting problem (train whistle vibration) and the resolution (storm glass ripple mending micro-fractures). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's professional lens. The setting constrains choice by imposing noise-level vigilance and charging the final image with kaleidoscopic light, meeting the 9+ gate for environment participation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, skeletal chrome trees, and high eastern wall are vivid and purposeful. The ruby flake and smart-paint interaction create a micro-setting that enables the stairway reveal. Spatial choreography is clean, and the projection's instability adds urgency. The setting does not, however, force a tactical choice at closure—Elara climbs without environmental resistance—which keeps it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The burnt sanctuary under starlight constrains Mara's stance: ash "like winter snow," charred trunks, and "loaded emptiness" create tactile pressure that mirrors her internal state. The doorknocker ring is handled across multiple beats, its "cold metal biting into her skin" and final "dull, final thud" charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—soot taste, starlight intensifying—and the threshold's physical dissolution tracks causally with her release. Spatial choreography (cross-legged center, Elian stepping from oak, kneeling beside) remains coherent. The micro-setting of hands, ring, and ash operates as setting, directly altering the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and purposeful: indigo light, spongy moss, mycelium network thickness all ground the scene and contribute to atmosphere. The environment subtly constrains Elias's choice—he stops "where the mycelium network was thickest" to channel the quantum force, suggesting the farm's biology matters. The submarine porthole bolt functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image by becoming the diamond. Sensory detail (ozone, petrichor, humid air) is specific and filtered through the setting's underground logic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sepia reading room's curved mahogany walls are not decorative: they create the standing-wave resonance that shatters the crystal housing, directly constraining Elian's method. The brass crank handle, wax cylinder, and crystal casing all function as tactile, load-bearing objects. Sensory detail (dust-motes, golden shadows, metallic click, vibrating air) is filtered through urgency and scaled to narrative importance. The arched windows serve as the broadcast conduit in the final image, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with ionized soil, glass leaves, and the mossy iron grates; spatial choreography (pillars twist, floor ripples) tracks cleanly and the central tree's pulsing pod anchors the climax. The setting constrains Valerius's approach (he must trace geometric alignments, mimicking marionette gait) and the brass fastener on the leather strap becomes a tactile focal point at closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's urgent focus on the prize.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The file room and dust landscape are vivid and purposeful; the "chronological stratigraphy" of sediment is specific and POV-filtered through Elias's archival expertise. The micro-setting (dust on cardboard) constrains his method and charges the final image—he presses the file shut "to preserve the dust." The button, envelope, and oilcloth function as tactile anchors that alter his understanding and enable the addendum. Sensory detail is selective and professional-priority-driven, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the surveillance-heavy city, the collapsed warehouse refuge, and especially the Auric Lagoon constrain Elara's path and charge the final image. The toxic golden water is both obstacle and atmosphere, and the submerged causeway and rusted terminal are integral to the climax. Sensory detail is selective (cold air, thick liquid swirling, low thrum through water) and filtered through urgency. The puddle-reflection navigation and the lagoon's "spectral, golden luminescence" feel specific to this world and directly shape her tactics and the ending's visual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's bioluminescence and the prism atrium dominate spatial grounding. The saxophone as micro-object constrains the method (keys, bell, condensation) and charges the final image. Sensory details are purposeful: "quietly vivid" colors deepen shadows, adding "visual weight to the sonic void." The timeframe "as dewdrops form" is concrete and pressures the opening window. Environment and tool together shape the climactic tactic, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and earning high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered through concrete, unusual details: shelf fungus platforms, star-moss, black humus, and the oppressive ash falling like snow. Sensory specificity is strong ("sound like a breaking icicle," "mossy delight"), and the environment credibly constrains Silas's materials (windblown detritus, microscopic moonstone speck). The setting charges the final image when ash is reframed as "snow settling on a warm, safe home," a purposeful reweighting that shifts tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean waterfall and greenhouse ruins are vivid and constrain Silas's choices (shore→island gap→vine-swing solution). Sensory detail is strong: "wet decomposition," "dry, rustling blizzard," "icy spray." The stone pillar and bonfire ashes function as micro-setting that charges the closure (artifact hidden beneath ashes). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the environment directly shapes the peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rain-washed foundry is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (slate gray sheets, ozone and sorrow, ionic residue, brickwork shadows) and the central crucible constrains Elara's method. The micro-setting—crucible, burner, concrete floor, cooling furnace—functions as choice-shaping apparatus: thermal limits must be explored, the dissolution-site is spatially precise, and the final statue's position against the brickwork charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting's occupational detail (ceramic vessel, hyper-fluidity, blue flame) reads plausible and integral to the alchemical task.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Echo Gorge is anchored early with sensory detail (mists smelling of regrets, rock face, pebbles at his feet) and the setting constrains the encounter—the acoustic anomalies are integral to the harp method. The gorge's reaction (cold, pressurized air; spectral confessions arising from the depths) alters tactics and charges the atmosphere. The crocodile tooth functions as a micro-object that pressures the final turn. Minor gap: spatial choreography is clean but the gorge itself does not evolve causally after the General's release; no visible change in mist or temperature tracks his departure beyond "brightening."

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Ultraviolet Forest is vividly specific—flora absorbing "silent, screaming radiation," leaves shimmering in "frequencies that made his teeth ache," violet light with "no shadows, only varying degrees of intensity." The pewter mask strap and filtration unit constrain breathing and signal ceremonial penance. Body-as-setting is effective: proprioceptive hyper-awareness makes his ribs, shins, and neck into navigation tools. The clearing where "violet light coalesced into a beam of pure, geometric silence" directly charges the closure image, making the environment indispensable to the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Alchemist's Market is vividly anchored early with sulfur, lavender, wooden platforms, and rope bridges; the high-above-city setting is selective and purposeful. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Elian's method and charging the final act when its edges cool. Sensory detail (soot dissolving, cold spray, scream of bending metal) is filtered through Elian's professional perception and reflects urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the market's creaking slats ground the return from the painting's twilight. The setting guides choice: the lens enables the discovery, and the market's height subtly mirrors the distance from the mundane city below.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered—peeling wallpaper, tarnished gilt, cracked plaster murals, rusted console—and sensory detail (fluorescent buzz dying, mournful groan, dust patterns) is filtered through Elias's professional lens. The hydraulic stage lift and clockwork pilot mechanism constrain his method and charge the closure: the descending ceiling is both spatial event and thematic payoff. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does more than backdrop; it embeds the core concept ("cracks in the façade") in physical architecture and powers the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library and swirling clouds are vivid and purposeful. The crystalline branches, frost patterns, and iron press function as constraints and tools that shape Silas's action. The eastern precipice and transparent floor track cleanly through the rupture sequence. The setting directly enables the climactic choice: without the frost, whisper, and press, the destabilization cannot occur. Micro-setting (the press, the branch) charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and specific—"carved obsidian and gold leaf," "phosphorescent pollen" hours, chronal storms—and constrains Elian's final choice by supplying the visible Time as manipulable matter. The crystal shard, velvet pedestal, and mirror-covering ritual are micro-setting elements that charge the climax. The brocade-draped mirrors function as tactical props that enable the projection by preventing dissipation. One minor slip: spatial choreography of the "grand salon" lacks precision during the climactic arrangement, but the high arched window and central pedestal anchor the key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonance Chamber is vividly rendered with recurved walls, rafters, heavy iron doors, and a workbench, and the humming frequency and "tinkersong wonder" create a distinct acoustic atmosphere. The chamber's physical state (dust, oxidation patches) shifts visibly at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—Elias's choices are not meaningfully altered by the room's layout or resources. Micro-setting elements (tweezers, loupe, gears) are present but do not force tactical trade-offs, keeping the score in the mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail—"black and still as a mirror made of obsidian," "smell of the earth dreaming of rain"—and spatial choreography (narrow crevice, descent, sudden void) remains coherent throughout. The limestone cliffs and "hinged awakenings" geology constrain the action: Silas must find the specific fissure and provide the "sensory key" (the vial) to unlock the space. The rebreather apparatus and the vial function as micro-setting that shapes his capability and the final act. The factory valley frames the opening but does not return; the descent dominates and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed archway and its magnetic generator are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the scene spatially and sensorially (wind, spray, turbine throb). The driftwood sculpture and iron grating constrain Elara's physical actions, and the environment (sea spray, rain) serves as the projection medium. Sensory detail is filtered through POV and supports urgency. The setting does not evolve causally within the scene—it remains static backdrop once established—which limits the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Amber Pavilion is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: golden-tinted panes that transmute winter into autumn, the cathedral glass apparatus, and the spatial placement of the Moonflower. Sensory selection is strong ("soft and protective darkness," "frost recede," "cold iron of the frame"). The setting shapes Elara's attempt to view the bloom, charging the final image when she lowers the glass. One micro-setting element (the glass frame) constrains her perception and enables the revelation, meeting the 9+ quick test threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, scorched equator, and zeppelin frame are vivid and specific. Sensory detail is purposeful: "dry heat striking her face with the force of an open oven," "viscous black fluid," "bleached ribs from long-dead beasts." The debris—bone, oxidized metal, stones—constrains Elara's solution (she cannot speak, must use physical symbols) and charges the final beat when the lagoon solidifies. Spatial choreography (gantry → surface → shoreline → extraction) tracks cleanly. The floating library, while evocative, functions only as extraction anchor and lacks pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The paper lanterns, amber bottle, and cobblestones anchor the scene vividly. The bottle constrains her method—she must push psychic energy through glass walls with no opening—and the cobblestones become the target for shattering, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective: spectral glow, dark water, baking bread, wagon wheels on stone. The cove functions as a micro-setting that frames her isolation and the act of genesis, and the lanterns flare in response to the resurgence of life, tying environment to her action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard garden atop the skyscraper is vivid and purposeful: moss-covered pear trees, crumbling balustrades, star-blossom nectar in the cistern. The nectar's viscosity directly enables the climactic choice (immersion as stabilizer and acoustic medium). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting modulates from peaceful isolation to oppressive in the final line, charging the closure image. Gate met: environment constrains the key action and amplifies the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid and purposeful: glass ribs held by deep freeze, the swirling vortex, frost retreating into vacuum all constrain Elian's path and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (condensation-slicked walls, granular vibration like sand slipping upward) and anchored to POV without catalog sprawl. The vault's micro-setting (jars of beans, corn, squash) appears at closure, reweighting the space from survival archive to tactile repository of borrowed time. Spatial choreography is clean (rotunda center → vault descent), and the environment actively shapes the action (seal must be breached, door responds to imposed order). No orientation debt; the gate for 9+ (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is met.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The windblown sanctuary, thin air, and atmospheric monitor constrain Elias's actions and charge the closure. Sensory hierarchy shifts purposefully: wind howl drops to "vacuum of sound," ice crystallizes on the railing. The ancient iron frame and cathedral bell rope ground the setting in history and choice. Minor density: some passages ("sea of white vapor," "bruising purple shadows") lean decorative without tactical pressure in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orbital station is anchored through selective sensory detail—"low, resonant hum," "cold luminescence," "reinforced pane"—that supports rather than halts momentum. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, filtering perception and constraining Elara's ritual to this specific tool. The observation deck's viewport becomes the stage where body (fingertip tracing), tool (glass shard), and cosmic event converge to charge the final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scorched wasteland, desiccated apiary, skeletal supers, and dry well are vivid and selective, filtered through Elias's perceptive lens. The stained glass box—cobalt/crimson/amber, lead from bullet casings—constrains his ritual: he lifts it, gazes through it, and the colored shadows on the ground become his tool to force the woman back into mystery. Spatial choreography (clusters near the well, woman drifting closer, Elias stepping back) remains clear. The setting does more than backdrop; it supplies the relics (cathedral glass, apiary) that embody the tangled covenant and charge the final image of "honey sealed in a comb."

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Emerald Silo's verdant gloom, pulsing lights, and shifting walls supply concrete sensory pressure; the shard's rough ceramic and the scorched titanium capsule charge the final image and constrain Elara's choice to pocket it. Spatial choreography (apex → sub-basement → loading dock) tracks cleanly. The "toxic green skyline" and "heavy air" cue the altered reality without catalog excess, and the sudden clarity of glass at the end visually registers the conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lagoon anchors spatially and tonally from the first paragraph, and the drake's tail feather functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains Elian's ritual action across multiple beats. The final image—cobalt water as mirror holding the lost kite—charges closure by embodying the theme of incompleteness. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("bruised purple," "metallic glow," "shimmering greens and violets"), filtered through a consistent aesthetic lens. The setting modulates with the kite snap, introducing tension that Elian must reconcile, satisfying the Q3 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The temple orchard with living stone pillars is not postcard description: the pillars constrict as a "geological immune response," the stone transmits piezoelectric hum, and the architecture "groaned with sentient weight." This micro-setting constrains Silas's solution (he must bridge stone and wood via the mortar joints) and charges the closure when the pillar pulses with his heartbeat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ozone and wet earth," the hum "vibrated in his teeth," warmth flowing through copper into bark. The stone's animate properties are consistent and causally active throughout, meeting the 9+ gate test by constraining choices and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rainwashed basalt, bronze quiet, ozone-and-petal air, and overgrown sculpture path anchor the tower vividly and filter through Elara's clinical attention. The platform's copper-electric taste and the distant faithful crowds create spatial pressure that contrasts her rebellious route. The amber object constrains her final choice, charging the closure image when she releases it. Selective detail serves POV and momentum without catalog drag.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the blooming jetty choked with purple creepers and phosphorescent buds, salt-bleached timber, mossy railings that smell of "old rain and iron," and the grey, lifeless ocean. Sensory detail is filtered through Silas's professional attention (the cadence of bird calls, the precise spot where the veil is thinnest). The setting constrains his ritual—he must wait at the jetty's end, listen for the tern's three-note shriek—and charges the final image with the rising kelp weaving through "rusted skeletons of sunken war machines." Minor issue: spatial choreography is clear but the environment functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a resource or obstacle that alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: corrugated iron, cracked wasteland, flickering diode, amber glass shard. The workbench and the amber lens constrain Silas's decoding method, directly shaping his tactics. Sensory detail is strong (oxidized iron, copper tang, wax coating) and filtered through his bloodhound past. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The piece does not quite reach 9+ because while environment enables the action, it does not charge the final image as decisively as the leaf and cylinder do.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The time-dilation deck is not mere backdrop: "heavy, echoed silence," "low, dying note beneath her boots," and the temporally stretched star-ribbons all constrain Elara's ritual and charge her attempt to impose order. The compass applique—gilded thread shimmering in ambient starlight—returns with reweighted meaning at the pivot, anchoring her explorer identity. Spatial choreography is coherent (cross-legged on deck plates, squinting at viewing port), and the accretion disk's "geometric regularity" becomes the micro-setting detail that alters her tactic from comfort-sketch to cartography. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: chaotic swirls, blue-shifted glare, and the vibration underfoot all filter through her navigational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, frost dais, and churning violet sky are vivid and POV-filtered through Elian's purpose-driven attention. The brass pocket sundial lid is handled twice—once to confirm atmospheric alignment, again to validate the wrongness—and its resonance with the sky constrains the timing choice. Spatial choreography is clear (parapet, summit, grid, edge). The setting pressures the final action: the ice cracks under his boots as logic shifts, and the dissolving wards make the chaos physically present.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The whispering gallery constrains Elias's choices—its acoustics carry the sob that he transcribes, and the feedback loop forces him to act (clacking the kings). The Rotunda's dust becomes the medium for his archive, charging the final image when sunlight reveals the floor text. The Nomadic Penumbra functions as a temporal and atmospheric pressure (violet dimness, moving shadow) that tightens the window for his work. Spatial choreography is clear: balustrade, chessboard, floor. Minor gap: the Penumbra's mechanics (why it passes, where it goes) are asserted but not shown affecting a mid-scene choice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bookstore-mountain is vivid, tactile, and constrains navigation (mercury glass needed to see paths, dust-choked air, treacherous precipices). Micro-setting works well: the quill pressed in an atlas, the ledge of crumbling scrolls, the mulch of rotting paper all serve as functional terrain. The stone's "pulsing heat" and the golden roots stitching books together charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's need (the "dull gleam" caught by her glass, the "cold surface" resonating in bone) and the atmosphere of "hidden thunder" modulates from threat to heartbeat, supporting the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Spatial choreography is clear: fountain rim → market square → village archive → tapestry table. Sensory details (cool platinum, limestone, ozone-and-regret smell of the black thread, deafening droplet splash after silence) are vivid and selective. The tapestry itself functions as micro-setting; its frayed border constrains the method of solving the spell and the anchor knot charges the final action. The frozen village supplies atmospheric pressure but does not dynamically alter Silas's tactics beyond providing the puzzle's location. The ending reprise (droplet falls, smoke disperses) reweights prior stillness with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone canyon and pale spire are vivid and constrain the ritual's acoustic logic. Kaelen's perch on the "protruding knuckle of bone" provides spatial grounding and tactical advantage. Mist swirls violently in reaction, charging the climax. Sensory detail is strong (grey sky, white stone, "choir of ghosts") and filtered through the collective gaze, though individual POV specificity within the crowd is absent. The spire's smooth surface enables the refraction action, linking setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid sea and sinking workshop create vivid, body-threatening pressure: "floorboards dissolved into hissing sludge," "caustic fluid pressed against her shut eyes." Sensory hierarchy tracks urgency (vision shut, breath held, tactile sting prioritized). The statue's pockmarks and the silver charm function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent. The workshop gears reappearing as "golden clockwork of a preserved moment" at the climax directly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network constrains the journey and the wrong turn is causally motivated by grief-distorted perception. The hidden oasis—chimneylike fissure, circular tidal pool, dying beam—functions as micro-setting that charges the ritual and final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ancient salt and trapped air," "preternaturally still," "colors sang in the gloom." The shell settles on sandy floor, magnifying brushstrokes, and the changing light (fading beam) times the climax. Physical choreography is clean (ladder descent, sloping tunnel, kneeling by pool edge). The tidal pool as setting directly enables and charges the closure act.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt tiles and "deep, bruised cobalt" light create a charged atmosphere that mirrors Elias's emotional state. The gallery walkway provides the necessary platform for the beckoning action. Sensory contrast between harsh brine/diesel and impossible night-garden scent is vivid and purposeful. The Teeth as hidden threat adds spatial stakes, though the lighthouse interior could be more tactilely grounded in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station's failed hydraulics, exposed circuitry, frozen dish, and black rotary phone function as tactile constraints that shape Elara's manual workaround. The bronze censer foot bridges the circuit gap, grounding "spiritual electricity" and absorbing heat—setting-as-tool integration. Sensory detail (cold plastic, patina smell, frosting breath, ozone/incense mix) is selective and purposeful. The high-atmosphere isolation and ruined analog controls pressure every choice, and the final scent mixture charges the closure image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hanging orchard and ravine supply both atmosphere (ozone, suspension bridges, storm-battered) and constraint (precarious trees, isolation). The storm functions as external mirror to psychic chaos and physical timer. The antique glass eye, textbooks, and workbench anchor the ritual beat with tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling outside → retreat to cabin → ritual at chair). The setting does not directly constrain a choice in the middle act, limiting the score, but it charges the final image by framing Elias as isolated monarch of a storm-ravaged domain.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dock, spiraling copper lighthouse, and etheric tide are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Silas's professional lens. The flower itself functions as micro-setting, constraining his investigative choice and charging the final image when placed in the lantern room. Sensory hierarchy is strong: "swirling vapor," "humming faintly," "damp, salty air" all anchor perception. The setting subtly mirrors internal states (mist/isolation) without overt symbolism, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    The blooming cavern at midsummer is vivid and sensory (bioluminescent orchids, pale vines, ghostly green light, cold pressing waders, scent of ozone). The rising water constrains every choice and shapes the final crossing. The matrix chip's rectangular indentation in stone and the ants' path through microscopic fissure provide tactile micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean: waist-deep to chest to chin, ridge of stalagmites, rock wall. The environment is not postcard; it actively narrows Elias's survival window.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt grotto, bleeding starlight, ember geode, and freezing limestone create a vivid, specific setting that pressures every move. Spatial choreography is clear (ledge, slippery floor, final steps to the geode). The fireflies emerging from the ember grotto constrain the climax (biological light repelling cosmic corruption) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (freezing grip, sizzling drops, radiant heat). Minor note: "lacy menace" and "lace-like patterns of nothingness" echo without fresh reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Ember Nexus functions as more than backdrop: the "geometric canyons," "bruising purple" twilight, and "heavy" air with rising hum all contribute atmospheric pressure. The nautilus shell is handled twice (touched with resolve, then holding the sphere) and its spiral geometry constrains the alchemical method. Spatial choreography is clean—two figures at a workbench, tool arrangement visible—and the obsidian table, glass rod, and containment field are specific enough to feel lived-in. The setting charges the final image but does not force a mid-scene tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cabin's cold, birch bark scroll's texture, and dream's purple sun and liquid starlight are vivid and POV-filtered. The scroll as recurring micro-object constrains and charges the final image: "charcoal scratches loudly in the silence" embodies the act of forcing linearity. Sensory selection reflects urgency (cold vs. warm wind), and spatial choreography remains clear across waking/dream shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop is vividly rendered—"polyphonic dripping," "black mold blooming," "glass reservoirs"—and setting details are filtered through Elias's lost olfaction (he *would have* smelled cedar oil and copper tang). The screw's rusted thread and the clock's brass housing supply tactile, purposeful detail that constrains the repair choice. Spatial choreography (workbench, velvet counter, glass walls) remains clear and the fog outside charges the insular atmosphere, though the shop itself does not dynamically alter tactics beyond providing the problem object.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating platform, ozone-rich air, and crystallization process constrain choice throughout. The moss-covered surface, low stone table, and spatial specificity ground the ritual; the quartz encasing her forearm becomes the literal surface for the final act. The body-as-setting (crystallized skin) pressures every beat and the "virulent violet light that matched the bruised sky" charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: under stress, perception narrows to quartz crackle and lung burn.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive's "cavernous gloom," lignin smell, and floor-to-ceiling shelves create vivid spatial anchors. The copper wiring threaded through metal shelving units constrains Silas's method and charges the manifestation beat. The orchard hush and chainsaw roar bracket the ritual, adding temporal pressure that shapes Silas's choice to work now. Sensory hierarchy is strong—ozone, roses, frost burn on Elena's cheek—and filtered through professional (Silas) versus personal (Elena) lenses. The generator and filing cabinets vibrating under induced current integrate environment into action without postcard digression.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered—petrified moments, ozone and parchment, towering shelves curving into gloom—and the impossible geometry and kaleidoscopic sky anchor the cosmic dread effectively. The dictionary (mundane artifact, rigid definitions) serves as micro-setting that constrains Elara's choice at the climax, and the floor's invisible nodes guide her wandering path, making the environment an active constraint. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through cosmic urgency, though the piece leans heavily visual; other senses could deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fjord setting (steep cliffs trapping dusk, "terrifying glassiness" of water) constrains Kaelen's perception and charges the final image of the horizon as "serrated blade." The hydraulic station's sluices and grating are handled (key clatters on wet grating), grounding abstract metaphysics in tactile space. Sensory hierarchy shifts under pressure: twilight blurs during squint, air shimmers to reveal seams. The recurring horizon line moves from "comforting limit" to weapon, a transformation that drives the conceptual repricing. Body-as-setting: the key "vibrated up his arm bone," making the metaphysical breach visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mica lantern constrains perception and charges the final image by revealing "lucid contradictions"; the rainwashed library's paradox (wet/dry, silent/murmuring) pressures her interpretive method. Sensory detail is purposeful: "clover melancholy," "crushed greenery," mineral-clouded flame. The mahogany/twilight/rain setting is vivid and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography stays clean (platform→aisle→podium). The lantern's mineral layers function as micro-setting that enables her navigation, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subway utility tunnel, rusted booth, and glass harmonica disc are vivid and voice-filtered. The booth's "bleeding underground arteries" and "melodically haunted" switchboard anchor the premise. Spatial choreography is clean across beats. The glass disc constrains Silas's key choice (thumb pressure distorts the note to shatter the loop), meeting the 9+ gate. Minor slip: "static timeframe between the hum of streetlamps" is atmospheric but mechanically vague—no on-page consequence ties the grid's breath to his window of action.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The jetty's orchids, planks, and tidal pool constrain Elara's ritual: she must tilt a stone to divert seawater, and the flowers "catch the released emotional resonance." Twilight—the interval "between definitions"—enables the magic and anchors the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her archivist's lens (salt, pollen, "dark and briny"). The setting charges the final image when the jetty becomes a permanent archive of laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ivy-station setting is vivid and purposeful: looters tipping hats, vines holding up brickwork, the platform where Arthur organizes gauze. The moon rock's discard onto the tracks—where it "clattered indistinguishably among the earthly gravel"—charges the closure image by erasing its celestial status. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting constrains and enables the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure. Minor deduction: some descriptions ("polite anarchy," "benign virus") lean slightly ornamental in early paragraphs, though they anchor tone.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Ultrasonic Forest is vividly rendered through sensory specifics (screaming leaves, burning silence, thorny consonants) and the setting directly constrains choice: the narrow cosmic pause creates urgency, tree textures deliver clues, and the clearing's "absolute zero" silence is the story's spatial and thematic climax. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting, pulling her hand to bark and vibrating as the window closes. Sensory hierarchy reflects her blindness and skin-based language absorption, filtering the world through tactile and sonic particulars that shape every move and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly enables floating and channels distortion into the pen's work, constraining Elian's method. The library shelves, books, and exotic nib are handled across multiple beats (floating, unbending, tracing, glowing), and the nib's twisted then straightened state tracks cleanly. The ozone scent at the end registers environmental change. The anomaly charges the closure image (the hum, the lightened atmosphere) and makes the editing plausible within the established world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The luminous harbor, phosphorescent waves, and moonlight create a coherent sensory anchor. The vintage camera constrains Elias's method (no film, aperture/focus adjustments) and charges the final shutter-snap, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography (pier, dock, horizon) remains clear throughout. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias could perform this ritual nearly anywhere with moonlight and the advisor's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archive is rendered through concrete sensory detail: ancient paper taste, geo-thermal heat, twisted rebar sculpture, crumbling ventilation shaft, bone-crushing silence in the Rotunda. The setting supplies resources (the charcoal, the easel, the hidden alcove) and constrains movement (labyrinthine vaults, miles-deep descent). The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, its thread count and dye technique enabling Elara's deduction. The final image charges the space (the archive "exhales"), meeting the 9+ gate, but the occupational layer (arsonist skillset repurposed) remains suggestive rather than visibly constraining a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Sound Wave Garden is a vivid, specific micro-setting that constrains Kael's method (he must hit the perfect frequency) and charges the final image (the garden's bloom becomes the lagoon). Sensory details—the hum blooming into hyacinth, ozone taste, static electricity—are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's focused attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: examination table → tank rim → lagoon surface. The garden's synthetic foliage and the monitors' warnings ground the futuristic psychiatric facility in concrete, interactive detail that evolves with Kael's drumming.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The port setting actively constrains tactics: the aurora interferes with GPS, the magnetic storm powers the latch mechanism, and the container maze enables Elias's shortcut. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (Sector One → catwalk → Sector Four). The grounding rod and the Blind Box unit are handled concretely and shape the climax, satisfying the micro-setting standard and charging the final image with the storm's sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt dock, wet timber, ozone scent, and shipping-crane shadows anchor early and coherently. The antique lantern mechanism—brass gears, adjustable louvers, ventilation grate—constrains Elias's method: the dental mirror becomes necessary to navigate "narrow, angular recesses." The created light-pattern on black canal water charges the final image, making setting indispensable to closure. Micro-setting (dental mirror, louvers, industrial channel) functions as pressure and resource. Minor slip: "spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" tilt toward abstract mood-setting in places rather than filtering through tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic grotto functions as micro-setting that shields and enables the conspiracy, constraining their options (they must descend to escape surveillance). The cobalt fog, redacted fiction section, lodestones, and starlight skylight create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear: library → spiral stairs → grotto → city above. The environment charges the final image (mist now a "shroud covering…confusion"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's perception (metallic air, dust-moted skylight, vibrating quiet).

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered (kelp forests, waist-deep brine, iridescent sheen, sea grapes twining) and constrains action—Elian wades, Vane is lashed to a submerged bollard, the dock dissolves beneath them. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the urgency of rescue and transformation. The setting charges the closure: they hover in "chaotic blue," the island's absence becomes a spatial void, and the abyss replaces land. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The farmhouse and turbines ground the setting early; the turbines' strobing shadows and mechanical heartbeat create coherent atmospheric pressure. The dried bouquet functions as micro-setting and constrains the final choice—Silas whittles the stems to dust, a tactile act that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: dust motes, curly shavings, brittle stems are filtered through survival focus. Spatial choreography (table, pocket, floor) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (the hum rattling teeth, shadows pooling "like spilled ink"). Spatial choreography is clear as Elara approaches the first pillar, extends her hand, and steps between them. The quartz pillars function as more than décor—they amplify her connection and act as "tuning forks for the light"—which constrains and enables her technique. The setting charges the final image when the atrium is reframed as "a vessel where the infinite sky had been poured into finite form," satisfying the 9+ gate criterion that environment shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vitrified soil, obsidian flagstones, and smoky quartz pillar are vivid and filtered through Elara's painter's eye. The courtyard constrains the negotiation spatially, and the kiln signals the Glassblower's craft. The reed tongue—a small, tactile object—becomes the micro-setting element that charges the final beat by altering the quartz prison's state. Sensory hierarchy supports POV: she notices texture and grayscale ("honest bones," "jagged and erratic") over color, consistent with her condition.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly anchored with clerestory windows, glass canisters, acoustic damping, and golden shadows. The miner's carbide lamp lens is a concrete, salvaged object whose concave glass properties matter causally at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (dais, workbench, distance across the room), and the lens focuses dispersed energy into a tangible beam, directly shaping the final image and constraining Elara's solution.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Timeless Observatory is vividly anchored: "golden twilight that never darkened," "celestial charts on the ceiling remained static," "glass-walled sanctuary...miles beneath his feet." The charcoal-stained fingers, brass press with "low, thrumming vibration," and oxidized silver band supply tactile, tool-based micro-setting. The vellum stencil's purple hectograph ink and the match-flame illumination charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion. Minor penalty: the origami raven's mechanics (updraft spiral, coordinate delivery) are described but spatial choreography of its journey and the woman's arrival lacks intermediate anchoring—she simply "entered" days or hours later without transition grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight and industrial loft establish post-collapse atmosphere effectively; "wet concrete and acrid, metallic tang of onyx ink" is sensorially specific. The measuring tape functions as both tool and conceptual anchor, its "sharp, violent snap" punctuating the revelation beat. The yellow tape becomes "a small yellow warning that the dimensions of their reality had been artificially constrained"—object charges the final image. Spatial choreography (table, skylight, city beyond) remains coherent throughout. The cryptocurrency-crash timeframe pressures the scene's stakes by establishing why people seek Silas's tangible cards.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Lost Civilization Archive is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven sensory detail: "swirled with the glittering, suspension-held atoms of nostalgia," "soft, treacherous marsh of half-remembered lullabies," "amber-hued twilight." The environment directly constrains choice—Elara must perform the chaotic dance to avoid entrapment, and spatial choreography (obsidian floor morphing to marsh, the central rotunda, the bronze pagoda) tracks cleanly. The saffron veil functions as both protective tool and symbolic frame, filtering psychoactive dust and thus shaping her ability to navigate. Spatial elements (precipice, outer corridors, central rotunda) guide progression and the bronze pagoda charges the final image, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming library's "photosynthesizing verbs" and "phosphorescent spores" create a vivid, purposeful frame that reflects the story's theme of narrative as living archive. The river stone's "cold, geological patience" and "mineral lattice" ground the ethereal shadow-work in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, shelf, biography section), and the "golden, unceasing afternoon" tone modulates with Elian's regret at closure. The stone qualifies as micro-setting, constraining the shadow's capture and charging the final shelf-placement image. Minor gap: the cloud-world and dream-stream remain high-level placeholders; a single concrete detail of how the collective mind's infrastructure affects Elian's access or tactics would deepen necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The roofless workshop, silver mist, and starlight are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's professional attention (moss-glowing walls, galaxy of dust motes). The slate table and scalpel constrain the surgical choice; the chameleon's color shifts (stressed brown to teal to leafy green) function as embodied feedback that alters her tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting charges the final image (starlight gathering in the wound, mist cooling her brow). Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) satisfies the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    The observatory tower is vivid and purposeful: "stone room choked with bioluminescent moss and alien ferns," flagstones that must be broken, structural iron fusing with biology. The physical constraint of the floor actively shapes Elias's climactic action—tunneling is the only route to the source. The frosted hourglass, suspended sand, and glowing root-fusion charge the final image. Sensory detail (throbbing chest, leafy whispers, muddy hands) is filtered through pain and obsession. The tower's vertical isolation and dawn light frame the atmospheric "meteor hush" tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The projection booth is vividly anchored (ozone, acetate, carbon-arc projector, splicing table) and constrains Elara's method—she cannot use the lamp, so she employs tactile psychometry. The film strip functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure when it grows cold. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's psychometric focus (stale popcorn, heartbreak, wet ink). The phantom train station is extruded from her spatial imagination and populates the scene with embodied abstraction (pillars of regret), though it remains interior rather than physically navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora-lit archway, frost-covered stones, and Star-Loom anchor vividly. Sensory detail (cold lens, electric violets, thin air) filters through Elian's mystical perception. The brass device slides into snow—a tactile moment—and the archway hums during peak pressure, constraining his attempt. However, spatial choreography blurs: distances, exact positioning, and the relationship between Elian and the instrument after collapse remain vague, preventing micro-setting from fully charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing dune, silica petals, iron crate, and chess clock anchor the setting vividly and pressure the ritual through tactile detail (chiming petals, heavy brass, vibration of particles). The post-forest-burn timeframe and violet sky create consistent tonal constraint. The clock and crate recur with charged meaning at closure, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory selection is strong and filtered through Kaelen's duty-bound attention.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is vivid and purposeful: aluminum willows signal treacherous drops, iron oaks promise stability, and the navigation method (wind timbres) drives a key mid-story choice. The turbine constrains the climax by requiring the gear, and the setting's harmonic transformation charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong (hollow whistling, cello-like thrum, bioluminescent bulbs), and the bronze trunk/wire-vines are tactile. No major slips; the setting functions as both crucible and mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway setting is vivid and distinct: "flat-bottomed skiff," "cloudy cobblestones," thermal drafts, and the summit "jagged and accusatory" create strong spatial grounding. The ticket punch is handled twice (withdrawn, then used; raised again at the end), and the glowing star on the deck becomes a concrete object the man touches, triggering the twilight's deepening—this constrains his final choice. The mist itself is where he reaches to pull out his resolved will, charging the closure image. Setting actively shapes the ending rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, frigid staircase, and alcove are vivid and purposeful. The spiral staircase's discoloration becomes a micro-setting discovery that drives the plot turn. The bolt's physical presence (rusted, wedged in mortar, painful to extract) constrains Elian's action and charges the final image when pressed against his healing palm. Sensory detail (misting breath, burning fingers, frigid draft) reflects urgency and filters through his nerve-pain POV.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Silent Atrium is vividly rendered: dust-choked aisles, eroding marble columns, golden haze, weeping ceiling. Spatial choreography is clean (ground floor, floating mezzanine, spiral stairs). The setting charges the closure—crumbling roof reveals "cold lack of atmosphere," and Orel stands firm on the fracturing platform as walls peel away. The celestial gear imagery and the library "drifting between memories and nightmares" skew abstract; anchoring the astronomical mechanism or the library's physical suspension would push this into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The monitoring station is grounded early (metallic buoy, cramped control room, lower bulkhead, swaying with currents) and constrains Elian's investigation to sonar/acoustic tools within the confined space. The drowned world context (swollen oceans, cleared skies, stabilized weather post-ban) frames stakes without catalog excess. The torn atlas page functions as micro-setting object, anchoring the lost coastline physically on his console. The holographic projector's "three-dimensional topography" directly enables the climactic discovery, making setting instrumental rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The spaceport repair bay, stone circle, and hanging frigate core are vividly detailed and spatially coherent. Sensory selection is strong (ozone, rust, dried blood; low vibration rattling teeth) and filtered through the operative lens of the ritual. The bare feet and earth contact function as micro-setting, constraining Elara's movement and charging the final bridge between earth and machine. The "margin of daylight" time anchor is evocative and tied to the ritual's requirements, though its pressure effect is more atmospheric than tactical. Environment directly enables the climactic act, meeting the 9+ test for constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The volcanic hot springs constrain Elara's timeline (patrols closing in, boiling water as catalyst) and supply the unsealing mechanism. Sensory detail is vivid—"sulfurous steam," "crimson moss," "scalding pool"—and filtered through urgency. The final image (kaleidoscope irises, calculating soil pH) charges the setting's rebirth promise. Micro-setting (boiling water, obsidian rocks, moss) actively shapes the unsealing choice, meeting the 9+ gate, but spatial choreography of the descending guards is vague, capping the score at mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arboretum's glass walls, storm pressure, and cliff-edge position create a fragile/hostile binary that mirrors Elias's internal state and constrains his choices (he cannot leave; he must endure). The rusted lighthouse rails supply the mechanical whine that triggers the panic sequence, and the coastal scrub pine root—dug from the cliff face that morning—becomes the material anchor for the thematic graft. Sensory detail (loam, jasmine, salt spray, humid air) is filtered through Elias's priorities and the final image of "green things breathing in the dark" charges the arboretum as both refuge and battleground. The micro-setting (grafting table, photograph, knife) drives the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse library is vividly particular: rotting shipwreck logs, navigation table, great lens, stone walls groaning inward. The closing walls supply a concrete time constraint that forces the redesign action. The broken tarot box, fractured light-rope, and dissolving floorboards all function as micro-setting elements that Elias manipulates to create the chute. The final void—"cool, silent velvet"—charges the ending image and reconfigures "necessary darkness" from threat to canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wind-carved encampment, eclipse lighting, and gully dead-end are vivid and sensory. The disappearing ink's visual geometry (fractal mandala, black-to-white flash) charges the closure image and constrains Silas's lunge. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the confrontation. Minor gap: the artificial hummingbird's hover-threat and subsequent "confused circles" feel ornamental rather than integrated into the environmental pressure of wind and light.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Sub-Zero Athenaeum is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: glacial compression, blue-lit server monoliths, dormant copper cabling. The setting pressures Elara's choice by providing both the archive (discovery site) and the forgotten analog infrastructure (means of broadcast). Spatial choreography is clear—blast doors, Interface of Roots, ancient speakers—and the cold/warmth motif charges the final image. However, some description ("rows of blue-lit server monoliths standing like silent judges") tilts ornamental rather than constraining immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass dome, nutrient-rich loam, and grow lights establish a vivid micro-setting. The ballast sandbag's "ozone and altitude" scent and the "sky-touched sand" anchor sensory detail in purpose. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Elara's choice at the perimeter alarm—she can refuse entry because the dome is a controlled sanctuary—and the final paragraph's "density of peace" directly charges the stranger's reaction, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Sound Wave Garden is vividly particular—"resinous heavy frequencies," "black tulips" of bass notes, reactive air that "transliterates emotions into physical geometry"—and it constrains Elara's path: straight lines trigger defenses, forcing her erratic zigzag. The rail spike's "density of ancient, unrefined iron" is justified by world logic and becomes the anchor for the climactic catch. Sensory hierarchy fits the POV (acoustic focus, tactile cold of the spike, visual "diamond-hard clarity" at closure). The setting charges the final image when the "transliterated air" freezes the echo in a prism. Strong integration of micro-setting (spike as tool/anchor) and environment shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory setting is vivid and charged: "glass-walled rotunda," "horizon where the sky met a solid floor of cumulus clouds," and the "echoing" dome create a concrete container. The rosewood pen's cedar-and-iron scent and the velvet box ground object-work. However, the setting does not constrain Eleanor's choice—she could conduct this proof anywhere with access to the ledgers. The clouds and glass frame mood but do not alter tactics or charge the closure image beyond visual atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The laboratory's "silence...suspended" and "meteor hush" establish atmospheric pressure from the first line. The amber fossil functions as micro-setting, handled twice (arranging components, holding it up to light) and constraining the tethering act. Spatial choreography is clean: console center, screen, speakers, stylus interface. The room's warping geometry and shadow-stretching at the time-fold moment directly pressure Elara's window to act. The final amber-as-constellation image charges closure by making the laboratory's archive function concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lilac mist and weeping stone constrain Elian's medium choice—chalk is useless, so he switches to colored sand—a direct causal pressure. The grotto's acoustics are not merely described but weaponized through the tile flake, and the mandala's placement on damp floor matters at closure when the sand mixes to muddy brown. Sensory hierarchy reflects his artist's eye (vivid azure, shocking crimson) and the spatial choreography of kneeling, pouring, sweeping remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The plaza's details—crystalline debris, collapsed archway, mosaic stepping stone—constrain 734's choices: the stone pattern enables the metadata hack, the archway shelters the child. Sensory hierarchy reflects 734's machine POV (heat signatures, optical sensors, hydraulic servos). The shattered sky and nuclear winter pressure survival through cold and surveillance drones. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling weight dispersed on ice, blocking wind). The tessera and stepping-stone pattern charge the final image by completing a broken whole.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mystic orchard within the hedge maze is established early and constrains Barnaby's tactics: he manipulates sound echoes off hedge walls and uses the fractured timeline's visual glitching to smooth the seasons. The environment actively shapes his strategy and charges the closure when "ghostly paper lanterns" and "perpetual, blossoming spring" reweight Clara's perception. Sensory hierarchy is strong—Barnaby's synesthesia filters everything—though spatial choreography (Clara's position relative to the coin, the hedge walls, the trees) could be sharper during the climactic reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The studio's "velvet darkness" and "pitch black" constrain the light-painting method and enable the geode's refractive work. The red standby light and monitor anchor spatial choreography. The geode sliver is handled twice (taping, swinging) and its layered structure charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy fits: Mara notices "jagged" noise, Elias notices her tremor rhythm. Minor: occupational detail (aperture, shutter, long exposure) is present but not stressed under conflict; acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave environment is vivid and layered with specificity—"ionized iron," "piezoelectric resonance," "basalt ledge"—and the subterranean lagoon creates spatial pressure that requires the buoyancy drive to access the signal source. The fossil as micro-setting object charges the final tactile moment ("rubbed the raised veins") and returns with reweighted meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection reflects urgency appropriately, moving from active observation to heightened reception during suspension. Minor slip: the cave's "mystical" properties are told more than shown constraining a choice, but the setting overall shapes action and atmosphere without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse is vividly anchored with "petrified resin," "solidified sap," and bronze doors, and the buttons function as micro-setting that constrains the unscrambling method. The master hourglass in the center appears twice and its inversion charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (scent, echo bouncing, dim light), though tactile engagement during button-handling remains abstract. The cliff face outside operates as external anchor but does not pressure on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bluff, mist, and snow function as more than backdrop: the fog provides plausible deniability, the snow surface becomes the message medium, and the downdraft obliterates the codes, charging the closure. Sensory detail is vivid ("suffocating, endless mist," "wetly under his boots") and filtered through urgency. However, spatial choreography is occasionally vague (the precipice/edge relationship, the basket's exact position relative to Elias) and the "jagged wound in the sky" metaphor strains credibility as literal geography.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog-bound river crossing, obsidian carriage, and dripping tollhouse create vivid atmosphere and constrain the action: Silas cannot cross until the rain stops ticking, and the bridge's invisibility underscores the liminal stakes. Sensory details—misting breath, white exhale, metallic rhythm—are selective and purposeful. The yarn needle and the woman's "damp wool" regrets show tactile engagement. The setting charges the final image (invisible bridge, white void) and the timeframe (rain gutters) directly shapes Silas's departure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with skeletal hives, scorched earth, and faded lantern glass. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the thick air charged with memory, the shifting sun patterns dictating rim shape, the cooling twilight pressing temporal echoes. The micro-setting (the potter's wheel, the workbench, the slat-roof shed) constrains choices and charges the final image when the pot dries in cooling air. Spatial choreography is clear. Environment actively participates in the closure by trapping the echo as temperature shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fire escape, luminous harbor, rusted balcony, corroded mirror joints, and basement window across the airshaft all supply concrete spatial anchors. The gauge tooth's thinness and hardness are essential to slip between corroded plates without breaking the spring—tool specificity constrains the repair action. The oily iridescent harbor glow provides the light source that charges the mirrors, making setting a resource rather than backdrop. Sensory detail is selective and functional: "cold railing," "dry curl of red velvet," "grime-streaked window," "damp salt air." The five-story drop and airshaft geometry are clear. Minor gap: the old woman's basement apartment is described but never becomes tactile or interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Tidal Library, brass sundial, obsidian disc, and stone circle constrain Elara's ritual and charge the closure image. The atomically reflective surface functions as micro-setting that forces confrontation ("absolute truth of her physical form"), and the rising cloud-tide supplies temporal pressure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (cold stone, humming granite, blinding sunlight) and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across terrace → stacks → summit path → monolith ring → disc → return descent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lily pond, temple, and art installation are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (prismatic quiet, residual thunder hum, shallow puddles). The twig spiral's "perfect, calcified helix" and the "metal aperture" constrain the key action—size and fit matter causally. The storm's aftermath charges the atmosphere and the sculpture's whimsy contrasts the solemn intent, enriching tone. Micro-setting (the gap in the sculpture) enables the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radio booth (cigarette-scarred, mixing board, VU meters, oscilloscope) is vivid and grounds the technical action. The station's location on a ley line supplies the pivotal constraint. Spatial choreography is clear across desk, console, and window sightline. The booth's sensory specificity (stale coffee, ozone, dust) is filtered through urgency and charges the final cigarette-smoke image, which reweights "dust of the universe" thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shadowed nexus and encroaching architecture constrain Elara's choices throughout: the open-air acoustics are essential to her escape plan, the narrowing walls force the decision to play rather than flee, and the starlight's return signals the space's transformation at closure. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency—"brittle and cold," "grinding tectonic plates," the compass point dancing on the music stand—and the spatial choreography tracks clearly as the pillars elongate and walls rush inward. The roofless ruin's specific properties (open sky for sound to escape, stone boundaries that can mutiny) drive tactics and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry's limestone, slate-grey ground, and mist are vivid and selective. Spatial choreography (easel, canvas, Miller's position) tracks cleanly. The environment constrains the artistic process: Silas measures "the distance between a jagged rock and the horizon," and the quarry's geology becomes the canvas's texture. The ribbon fragment pressed against wet fixative is a micro-setting moment that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The station's moss-clad, corroded surfaces and "spongey dread" atmosphere are vividly rendered and tonally coherent. The copper nail slot, rusted console, and observation port constrain Elara's actions concretely: she must insert the nail and speak into the microphone to trigger the mechanism. The setting doesn't just backdrop but actively enables the climactic choice, meeting the high-band requirement for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain pullout, mist, and scaffold-wrapped bridge create a vivid, specific stage. Sensory detail is filtered through Silas's perceptual bias (ether/silver, wind rhythm, violet bioluminescence). The glass flake and plastic sheeting constrain the final choice: Silas must align them to perceive the glitch, and that perception enables his decision to play. The setting charges the closure image—bridge as "no longer broken, merely buffering"—without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus train is specific and consistently detailed (rusted wheels fused to rails, faded velvet, executive car), and it charges the final image when Silas steps onto wet gravel. The currency collection and railroad spikes function as micro-setting that constrains the dissuasion choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across train cars and the railyard. Minor limit: the office interiors (lion tamer's car, acrobat's carriage) are named but not engaged tactilely during the layoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    The celestial observatory is vividly anchored with copper machinery, sidereal clock, mahogany desk, and the dome framing the stars. The daylily-pressed telegram functions as emotional coordinate and charged object at the beginning and end. However, the dream-temple setting ("black stone suspended in a void of colorful nebulas") remains generic postcard description; spatial choreography in the dream is vague, with no tactile constraint on Elara's movement or choice. The variable stars pulse overhead but do not alter her tactics within the scene. Sensory detail is selective and often purposeful, yet the micro-setting does not pressure a decision or charge the final image beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The swirling orchard vortex supplies vivid, high-concept imagery ("branches interlocking like the fingers of drowning giants") and spatial choreography is clear as Kaelen leaps tree to tree. The seed and vines function as micro-setting tools that constrain his approach and charge the final image. Sensory detail is present (ozone, crushed fruit, panic) but leans heavily visual; the environment enables the climactic choice, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt sky "pressing down...like a bruised thumb" and the thicket smelling of "ozone and ancient moss" are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the post-acceleration world. The glade's vegetation and Elara's root-bound state constrain the encounter spatially; Jaren must step over pulsating creepers to reach her. The maze topiary clipping functions as micro-setting: its geometry expands in Jaren's mind, reconstructing the lost covenant and guiding his psychic navigation. Sensory detail (dry leaves skittering, cold electricity, oil-on-water shimmer) is filtered through urgency and serves the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: "pale tree roots snaked between yellowed ribs," "mossy skulls embedded in the earthen walls," "weeping sap of the root." Environment constrains the ritual—Elian must work within the bone-and-root matrix, and the orchard's resistance is spatial and sensory ("air grew thick," "roots groaned"). The bone-studded wall receives him at closure, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the specific root system cradling the magistrate's remains) shapes the choice and intensifies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quarry and trailer are vividly anchored with specificity: "luan mahogany plywood, likely 1970s stock," "stale tobacco and wet dog," rusted metal and swollen wood. The setting pressures choice through decay (humidity fuses components, forcing Elias to use brute force) and time (crusher deadline at noon). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elias's appraiser lens. The speaker grille cloth functions as micro-setting, constraining his authentication method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Magnetic Arbor constrains choice throughout: decaying orbit forces Elian to act, iron-rich soil and metallic roots enable the planting, and the weeping iron-willows signal stabilization. Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone and old paper scent at closure—and the arbor's pulse "mimicking a human heart" charges the final image. Micro-setting (the seed cradle, the soil bed) directly shapes the climactic action. All details are filtered through Elian's linguistic POV, with no tourist-catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Tidal Atrium is vividly anchored: brass archways, floor grates, rising brine, and the central forge all constrain Elian's movements and tools. The fisherman's creel and the crucible are tactile and purposeful. The "wintersun serenity" and "frozen white fire" sun charge the atmosphere without becoming ornamental. The setting directly enables the smelting action and the final image of the high shelf. Sensory detail—ozone, old roses, copper tang of regret—is specific and filtered through the librarian's task.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystal cave is vividly rendered (obsidian floor, jagged stalagmite apex, millions of refracting crystals) and the setting directly shapes the closure: Elias places the pearl on the central pillar, and the crystals amplify the light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("resonant hush that pressed against his eardrums like deep, dark water"), and the cave's physical structure constrains his action (the pillar is the only plausible anchor for the pearl). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The seashells are concrete objects that encode the sanctuary's memory, and their scattered presence on the floor adds texture. Minor: the "subterranean cathedral" descriptor leans decorative, and the setting could pressure an earlier choice to elevate integration further.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The station is vivid ("rusted awning," "tiled cavern," "drift of dry leaves") and the accordion as micro-setting is handled tactilely across beats. The graffiti mirror and the river bank constrain his choices: the phrase "The water always takes what is owed" becomes a map reference that drives the river descent. The river's "gray ribbon" and mud anchor the final beat. Sensory selection reflects urgency in the lavatory and slows at the river, creating purposeful rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing library, translucent marble, shifting panels, and mist are vivid and selective. The confidence man's watch constrains her method (she relies on its rhythm), and the environment directly pressures her exit choice ("walls groaned," purple light signals inversion). Spatial choreography is clear—archway, panel to the right, shifting floor—and the watch's heating functions as micro-setting that charges the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's midsummer setting provides concrete pressure (plant growth lust, sweltering July vs. supernatural frost). The ice violin functions as micro-setting, constraining Elian's choice through its preservation magic and cold. Sensory details are purposeful: humid air, overripe fruit, hissing coffee on ice. The spatial staging remains coherent throughout. Gate satisfied: environment (ivy, violin's frost) directly shapes the final transformation and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora create a vivid, coherent micro-setting; the "obsidian table," "emerald chip," and shifting celestial light are concrete and purposeful. The emerald chip constrains the method (soul-trap waiting to be filled) and charges the final image (the lattice spinning inside). Spatial choreography is clean; the tools and their states track across beats. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional focus, though the high register ("radiant hush," "bruised purple to neon teal") occasionally drifts toward postcard vividness without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Umbral Grotto is vividly anchored with sensory specificity ("vineyard hush," "bruised purple" sun, "unspun wool" clouds). The floating rock and Great Vines constrain Elara's movement and choice (she must climb the cedar to gain vantage, uses the hairpin as tool). The grotto's twilight atmosphere is filtered through her professional attention and charges the final image ("the hush of the grotto deepened, settling into her bones"). Spatial choreography is clear; the environment is lived-in and integral to both the opening and the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse gallery at dawn provides concrete spatial grounding (iron railing, salt-crusted glass, wind chimes overhead). Setting elements constrain action: the suspended chimes function as diagnostic tools, the western wall brass peg holds the cloak, the dawn light catches in the mirror. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (biting cold, violet horizon, howling wind). The micro-setting (body, tools, objects) charges the final image—Vance wrapping the cloak tighter as dawn bleeds through glass. The gallery's vertical remove from the dead campfire below establishes thematic distance from consequence, though this remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating platform, sycamore hush, canyon shadow, and magnetic grotto are vivid and purpose-driven. The water basin constrains the demonstration; the starlight transformation of ripples into "rings of silver fire" charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara and Kael sit opposite, the basin between them, the platform drifting into shadow. However, the "sycamore hush" recurs as atmospheric motif without material constraint on choice; it flavors tone but does not alter tactics. The grotto's theta-wave amplification is functional but slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ossified canyon, calcified ribs, and layered dust form a vivid, oppressive micro-world that directly constrains Silas's movement (ankles buried) and enables his method (hollow calcium structures as resonators). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the "vicious hum" of obsidian, the "sharp, resonant *clack*," and the visual map traced by crow flight. The setting charges the final image—"where the birds would refuse to fly" becomes navigational proof. Spatial choreography (tower, canyon walls, exit) tracks cleanly across the acoustic journey.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    The icebound spire's "brilliant dimness" and "paradox of illumination" create a vivid, contradictory sensory field. The permafrost, rime-covered gap, and altitude's crushing pressure constrain Elara's final act: she must shed the regulatory pack to complete the task. The keystone's rough granite texture contrasts with synthetic crystals below, and the folly's marble/basalt incongruity charges the closure image when the luminance pours out and stabilizes the arch against the gale.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The forgotten library inside the *Aurelia* anchors every choice: glass jars pulse with bioluminescence, anaerobic gloom preserves the archive, collapsed bulkheads guide his path. The brass key tag functions as lodestone and lock, constraining access. The violet ribbons swirl in murky water, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"low frequency that bypassed his ears and resonated directly in his bones"—and setting shapes both tactic (wandering through debris) and closure (the library's spectral glow frames the revelation). Environment is indispensable to the narrative's logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ambered observatory deck, the translucent resin, and the "crushing, uniform darkness" create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The coins (foreign, extinct empires) function as tactile anchors that constrain Hiero's method and charge the final image when he gathers them again. The sensory hierarchy—gold resin underfoot, cold metal tumbling, static bursts—reflects Hiero's professional focus and urgency. The environment subtly mirrors his isolation and the universe's contraction without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory functions as both stage and tool: brass gears adjust to catch sunset, prism array fractures light, the focal point positions the map. Dusk timing matters (amber rays, twilight work window, "cool blue of early night"). Spatial choreography is clean—dome, desk nearby, central array, table at end. The atlas page and scattered light constrain the crystallization method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("copper walls cooling," "brittle wax cylinders"). The recurring objects (recordings, atlas, jewels) charge the final image when the blank page holds a dozen sculptures. Gate satisfied: environment enables the action and shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Sapphire Viaduct functions as micro-setting and constraint: translucent masonry casts blue shadows, the high-altitude chill threatens evaporation, rising heat liquefies the stone beneath Elian. The dry basin and "dust where the last fish had gasped" ground the apocalyptic scale in tactile specifics. The bell itself—corroded bronze, jagged shards, golden scar forming—acts as immediate environment that Elian must manipulate drop by drop. The final image (geyser erupting from darkened ground) charges closure by making the viaduct the fulcrum between emptiness and return.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: "midnight ridgeway," "mirrored hush," silt-covered slope, algae-slick counter. The drought and receding water supply spatial constraint and urgency. The apothecary counter becomes a charged site where Elias arranges his final tableau. Micro-setting (the counter, the shard's placement) directly shapes the closure action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's curatorial lens, supporting tone and stakes without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard behind the waterfall is vividly anchored with strong sensory detail (fractured sunlight, moss-covered basalt, humid warmth). The setting provides atmosphere and the waterfall veil frames the starling observation, but the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or tactics—she could perform the same internal shift in any location. The frozen crystal's physicality (jagged teardrop, refusing to melt) is concrete and the final state (warm jewel) closes the arc. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly anchored (frosted steel, genetically modified ivy, glass leaves, star-dusted void) and the parachute buckle as micro-setting constrains the pivotal choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: Kael notices tactile micro-fracture invisible to eye, wind shear patterns, the "sharp sound" of the clip. The titanium retention clip on his belt serves as spatial resource that enables the solution. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the harness revision sequence. Does not quite reach 8+ because the arbor's pressure on choice is atmospheric rather than mechanically constraining the repair itself.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "floating rock dojo" and "void of the sky swirling with colors that did not exist yesterday" are ornamental; they never constrain a choice or supply a resource. Spatial choreography is vague—statues crumble "at the edge of his vision," but no geometry matters when Kael and Vane clash. The jar's bio-luminescent fluid is described but never handled or used as a tactical element. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping this category at 8.8 even before other issues; the orientation debt penalty from Q2 further caps Q3 at 7.0, which this score does not approach.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel constrains and enables Silas's ritual: curved concrete amplifies sound, creating the "infinite acoustics" necessary for his goal. The pull cord, oil-caked engines, and exhaust fog are handled tactilely and pressure the protagonist (vibrating marrow, horizontal tears in gale). Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Silas's desperate focus. The setting's recursive geometry and "viscous medium" reflect internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the choreographed movements among twelve blowers.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen garden functions as both setting and psyche after the guardian "interiorizes exteriors," creating a battlefield synonymous with soul. Micro-setting details constrain action: hemlock overgrowth in Philosophy, rhododendron shadows as cover, and the pendant's light cutting through mist all shape tactical choices. The fog-as-consciousness move early (end of paragraph two) pays off when the cultist lowers the pendant and "shadows embrace us both," making the final image spatially and emotionally coherent. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the swallowed landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Ember Nexus is vividly particular—crystallizing planetary heat, gray paralysis, creeping frost—and the cold actively threatens Elian ("frost creeping up his boots") as a live constraint on his work. The crucible, alchemical fire, and molten gold function as micro-setting tools that shape each successive attempt. The final image of the creature melting frost as it ascends ties setting directly to closure, charging the "frozen bloom" motif with thematic weight. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's alchemical lens without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    The suspended city over the Great Gorge is vivid and pressures choice through environmental threat (groaning towers, rising wind, deck plates vibrating). Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens (psi-gauge, hydraulic grease, brass inlay spark). The Hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting/tool and charges the closure by glowing rose and channeling silence into data. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (ladder → deck → console → fragment slot). The setting constrains her method (needs altitude and the relic's conductivity) and the "mechanical graveyard hosting a cosmic birth" image reconfigures the space thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spectral grotto, oily water, jagged stone ceiling, and starlight reflections are vivid and consistent. The empty hourglass and ship controls anchor micro-setting. The radio and hourglass constrain Elara's final action, and the setting shifts causally (grotto dissolves into city lights). Spatial choreography is clean. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional lens (brass railing, transmitter dials). The setting charges the closure image (warm sunlight, ocean spray) and the sideways-time conceit permeates the atmosphere without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Penrose Atrium's impossible geometry constrains Elias's task throughout: staircases twist back, walls slide past at non-right angles, the hovering triangle exists only through optical trickery. The setting supplies the paradox he must bind and ultimately erupts to consume him. Spatial choreography remains legible (center of atrium, vaulted ceiling, gallery floor). The final collapse—background rushing forward to consume foreground—charges the ending image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The benthic setting constrains choice: pressure gauges, the cartography dome, miles of crushing water, and the "claustrophobic blackness of the trench" all shape Harlin's predicament and charge the closure. The anchor-link functions as micro-setting, recurring with shifted weight from "paperweight" to prayer object. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"pitted, rough surface," "cold, biting weight"—and the ocean-as-volume versus folded-plane contrast drives the conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mist-clad atrium is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("air grew heavy," "weight of a thousand unsaid goodbyes") and the marble fountain provides spatial grounding. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. The glass ceiling becomes a directional anchor ("turned her body like an antenna") that shapes Elara's tactical movement during the climax. The professional context (contact tracer, lower bunkers, spectral contamination protocols) adds credible texture without exposition drag, and the twilight timeframe modulates sensory selection appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The undersea facility is grounded with vivid, purposeful detail: titanium hull, cooling pipes, server racks humming at teeth-vibrating frequency, the massive black cable pulsing with luminescence. The gold fleck in its vacuum-sealed glass case functions as micro-setting that constrains the central choice—Elias must retrieve and slot it to trigger the Return. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from submersible to airlock to central lab and back. The crushing dark and pressure differential embody both atmosphere and physical constraint, charging the final ascent image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The opal observatory walls and snow-covered dome anchor setting vividly, and the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that charges the closure. The shortwave receiver and sensor table provide tactile world-building. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain Elias's choices—the observatory is atmospheric but functionally passive. The final image returns to "opal reflections" but the environment itself doesn't shape the outcome, keeping this below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flawed diamond constrains his method (internal fracture as geometric key), the bone towers supply abrasive texture he must mimic, and the Tunnel of Echoes amplifies and strips emotion—all three elements shape on-page tactics and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "grinding, resonant hum that felt like sandpaper dragging against the eardrum." The canyon's acoustic dead zones and the birds' flight paths function as micro-setting that alters his approach. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underground garden is vivid and purposeful: "wet earth and secrets," "twenty feet of rock and permafrost," ferns and ivy establish a contained, lived-in space. The flint arrowhead is discovered in the loam, the phone hidden in ivy, and gravity's release scatters objects (watering can, dust motes) in a way that makes the ritual's mechanics feel spatial. The environment constrains and enables: Elias moves through the garden, retrieving the phone and approaching the specimen, and the final image of them "dropped gently back to the loam" anchors the closure in texture. Micro-setting (the phone, the loam, the ferns) charges the ending and shapes the ritual's execution, lifting the score toward high-7.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted sky-bridge, sickly yellow sodium lamps, bronze golems, and enchanted orchard are vivid and purposeful. The orchard's roots and suppression grid constrain the central conflict, and the scent of "crushed mint, wet soil, and ozone" charges the climax. The violin itself becomes micro-setting, its warmth against skin anchoring Elara's body in the moment. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout—above and below remain distinct, and the locust shell's fall tracks cleanly over the railing.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Cobalt Arcade's blue glass, skeletal pillars, and crumbling tiles anchor setting and atmosphere throughout. The rusted deposit box and blue tiles constrain the final action (kneeling, depositing the bottle). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: ozone, dust, static kiss, underwater glow. The setting is filtered through Elias's urgency and charged by the border tech. The final blue light ties back to the opening, charging closure without being overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned circus train, cattle-car oasis, and workshop provide vivid, selective detail filtered through Elias's craft-focus (petrified oak, moss pedestal, sequined masks). The halo fragment's "whispering gleam" and the misting hush create coherent atmosphere. The wind bell functions as micro-setting constraint: its resonance bounds the timeframe and forces urgency at closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (corridor, hidden door, oasis, return), though the "twisting corridor" and "vibrating air distorts perception" introduce slight fuzziness without dramatized cost. The fragment itself charges the final image when pressed into the horse's forehead, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rotunda with double-helix frescoes and mahogany desk anchor setting early, and the library hums as a sensory environment. The silk scarf functions as micro-setting: its hyperbolic folds constrain Elara's attempt and charge the closure when it slips, sealing the breach. Sensory detail (ozone tang, dust, shimmer) modulates with pressure. The young patron in tweed coat and thermodynamical limericks supplies texture without disrupting spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Whispering Archipelago is vivid and consistent: sentient geology, erosion prophecies, sea-cave syllables. The terrace, camera, palette, and stylus are all handled on the page, and the sun's position governs the sequence. The islands' vocal chorus during the climax charges the moment, and the palette's shift from glowing to dull white anchors the before/after. Micro-setting (palette, stylus, display) constrains the method and shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.7)
    The "Shadowed Nexus under starlight" is named early but remains a conceptual placeholder—"obsidian void," "nebulous color," "vastness of space"—without tactile anchors or spatial choreography. The first star functions as a trigger but does not constrain Silas's method or force tactical adaptation. Micro-setting via the lock of hair shows potential (it hums, frays, disintegrates) but its transformation is metaphorical rather than a physical constraint that alters choice. The Orientation Test is marginal: who and conceptual where are named by the opening, but the physical layout and distances remain vague throughout, preventing the setting from pressuring tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken dome setting shapes every choice: the iron ring above constrains light access, bioluminescent algae becomes the star map, and the mushroom's emergence in precise light is the physical key. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (groaning glass, damp loam, phosphorescent beam), and the spatial choreography of light through wreckage gaps is clear. The setting charges the final image when ships dissolve into starlit canopy. Minor: the artificial light for the apple trees is mentioned but never integrated into the light-detection mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's dust-laden shelves, diamond-tipped stylus, porcelain tea cup, and pedestal anchor Silas's workspace with purpose-driven detail filtered through his archivist lens. The prism's glass surface constrains his action (he must annotate fracture points, not open it directly), and the scattered shards at closure charge the final image when he kicks one toward Lenore. Spatial choreography (retreat until spine hits desk, forward march to prism) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail—settling dust, bitter tea scent, cracking glacier sound—supports atmosphere without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall, and dimensional void are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glowing mist, moss, cascading water). The transformed water (violet and gold) directly enables the graft and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a choice—Elian encounters no obstacle, no environmental friction—so it functions more as a stage than a tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prism sanctuary is established early and constrains action—the glass walls dissect starlight, creating the optical cage that reflects Elian's entrapment. The tapestry needle, hemp net, and mask function as micro-setting anchors; the net's brine and age are handled tactilely across beats. Sensory hierarchy (starlight, silence weight, heart-as-war-drum) modulates with urgency. The final image of "cold, unmoving light of distant suns" directly charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-scoured vault, vanished fresco, henge shadow, and dual-timeline footage create vivid micro-setting that directly constrains the solution (height coordinates via shadow, eroded lever invisible without comparison). Sensory balance is strong: damp chill, cold wet stone, stale incensed air. The vault's decay and the henge's permanence charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. One slip: "grayscale reel" and "high-definition survey" feel slightly generic within the rich textures elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library environment is rendered through specific, POV-filtered detail: pulp of dissolving literature hanging like gray fog, stagnant water preserving ghostly stasis, invisible viscous currents of psychic wreckage. The setting actively constrains Elias's approach—he must navigate emotional debris, push aside panic strands, isolate frequencies—making the environment integral to his method. The snow globe functions as micro-setting, its perpetual vortex charging the final image when the flakes settle under Elias's hand. Spatial choreography (docking, swimming, drifting past shelves, arriving at desk, returning to airlock) remains clear and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The misty courtyard, aerosol hiss, ozone scent, and ionized air create a vivid sensory envelope filtered through Elian's performer attention. The bolt plate's "density and specific iron composition" constrains the ritual's mechanics, and the "damp northern wall" supplies the grounding surface. Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard, wall, painted cog, hand on plate). The environment directly enables the climactic upload, meeting the 9+ constraint test, though the clouds themselves remain postcard rather than pressuring choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, elevator ascent, and shifting light through rime ice create a vivid, purpose-driven frame. Sensory detail—"kaleidoscope of refracted luminance," air pressure shifting in Elian's ears—is filtered through POV and tied to the puzzle-solving action. The goggles and diary function as micro-setting elements that constrain the解密 attempt. The solarium at the top charges the final image. Spatial choreography (elevator floors, external ice, internal light) tracks cleanly and the environment enables rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The brass telescope, sky gondola, and ambient physics (rarefied altitude, solar winds, static charge) constrain Elian's actions throughout. The gondola's riveted hull and curved glass frame his isolation; the telescope is handled twice (vernier adjustment, magnified observation) and enables the proof. The bruised purple cloud and radiant white light charge the final documentation beat. Sensory detail (cold metal biting fingertips, dusty starlight filtering through) is selective and purposeful, filtered through a meteorologist's professional attention.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    The hollowed redwood functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its curved bark ceiling is the canvas, the book safe provides the coin, and the physical enclosure creates the claustrophobia Elias seeks to erase. Sensory details (dust shaking from illusionary clouds, "heightened stillness," tactile coin grooves) are filtered through Elias's prosopagnosia—he notices texture and topography over faces. The demolition timeline creates concrete spatial threat. The tree-as-library charges the final image of opening sky beneath earth.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The airship's interior—cedar-scented nursery, dusty floor, round window—grounds action and constrains choice; Elara kneels, aligns the book, traces the hopscotch board. The starling murmurations function as both atmosphere and magnetic-anomaly signal, charging the environment with purpose. Spatial choreography is clear (starboard rail → stern nursery). The hopscotch board and phrasebook directly enable the closure discovery, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen library's tactile details (rime, glacial mirrors, stardust-clogged gears) constrain navigation and the final tool use. The "hauntingly bright" moonlight creates a physical obstacle (weight pinning gears) that Elara must dissolve. Spatial choreography is clear across entrance → rotunda → Astrolabe → veranda. Sensory selection reflects urgency appropriately (ozone cuts through stale air at the critical beat). The body and tools function as micro-setting that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating granite arches, dangling orchard roots, and atmospheric moisture create a vivid, coherent micro-setting that constrains choices (navigating thorns, avoiding rock slides, exposure to radiation). The watering bell and pump station function as spatial anchors during the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven ("bruised purples," "hissing through tiny apertures"), and the bioluminescent butterflies charge the final image without feeling ornamental. The environment directly enables the solution, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lighthouse, ocean bed, and pane of hush are vivid in metaphor but lack spatial grounding—no sense of room dimensions, distances, or how Silas physically interacts with the clock and pane. The puppet head's crack provides the most concrete detail and is used tactilely ("traced the rim...sharp history"), briefly constraining the encoding method. Sensory detail skews heavily visual and abstract (colors, glowing light) with minimal touch, sound, or body sensation. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 automatically caps Q3 at 7.0 per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, iron-barked orchard, and vent shaft all constrain Silas's choices and supply resources (the nut, the coil, the airflow). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: freezing saliva, salt spray, oil leaking from petrified wood, ice blooming on railings. The spatial choreography is coherent (three levels down, vent shaft depth, beach harbor). The final image—frozen birds, ice-covered walls—charges the closure by transforming the labyrinth into a "ruined painting" that embodies the story's graceless beauty. Micro-setting (body, vent, floating nut) all constrain key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The braided ravine is vivid and specific: "silver threads," "islands of sediment," "jagged granite obstructions," "pH of river water or soil." Sensory detail is well-filtered through Elias's chemical and musical lenses ("wet limestone and ancient pine," "recirculated atmosphere"). The river's hydrodynamics directly constrain the breakthrough choice—the foam divergence supplies the molecular metaphor—making the setting indispensable to closure. Spatial choreography (precipice to water to trail) is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Glass Orchard Library—silica trunks, glass leaves etched with verses, transparent limbs refracting chaos below—is vivid, internally consistent, and creates a charged atmosphere of integrated fragmentation. The brass scale, void-glass counterweights, diamond-edged scalpel, and bottled moonlight all supply specific constraints that shape Elian's technique. The glass apples in the final paragraph reprise the orchard motif and charge the closure image ("pruning the fruit back into blossoms"). Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is filtered through Elian's professional lens. The environment constrains choice (specialized tools required) and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The desert fortress, wet stones, and courtyard are anchored early. The coral pavilion's "frost-rimmed eaves" and subterranean chill create vivid, purposeful sensory constraint—Elara's gloveless touch transmits despair, shaping her choice to proceed. The tidal-pool formations function as micro-setting that guides discovery. However, spatial choreography of the excavation (spade work, bowl placement, exact body position during ingestion) remains vague, and the "false tide" metaphor, while striking, doesn't fully ground how water behaves in sand. The final image—fortress standing silent under drying sun—charges closure but lacks one concrete environmental detail to anchor the atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower setting constrains Elara's method (speaking tubes, escapement, pendulum) and charges the final beat when time is restored to natural flow. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—gear-toothed atrium, borrowed starlight, copper tubes—filtered through her urgency. The pinecone weight functions as micro-setting, its mass altering the mechanism's rhythm and thus the silos' capacity to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silica-rich gorge and moonlit canyon provide atmospheric grounding but function primarily as backdrop until the final paragraph when "the ground beneath her and the sky above dissolved into trembling waves." The broken mirror constrains her design choice (fractures trap "ghostly residue" vs. pristine reflection), meeting the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "low, resonant frequency," "air grew heavy, charged with the static." The canyon's "epochal shift occurring in the cities far beyond the horizon" situates the world without excess exposition, and the submarine origin of the periscope anchors a drowned-world history economically.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent moss pulsing with heartbeat, ionized air tasting of ozone, threshold effects as shimmering distortions. The grotto's oblique-angle luminescence and frictionless surfaces constrain navigation tactics. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the inversion and return. However, the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than forcing a choice that charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The siskin alder grove is rendered with purposeful detail—interwoven canopy, mossy roots, damp earth—that builds the "intensely quiet" atmosphere. The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting that directly enables the climactic action by refusing to absorb vibration. Spatial choreography is clean throughout: hedgehog at root, twisted ash at clearing edge, workbench, cleft in living tree. The setting constrains choice (Elian must wait for the omen, must find the right material) and the final image of siskins taking flight charges the breakthrough moment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic nexus supplies vivid sensory detail—static charge, auroras, vibrating purr—filtered through Elian's chess-tutor perception. The basalt worry stone functions as micro-setting, constraining his thumb and grounding abstract thought in tactile reality. The ridge and ley-line geography shape his mental grid, enabling the correlation that drives the climax. Spatial choreography (ridge, valley, shelter) remains clear; the environment charges the final image when the stars "lock into place" to confirm his deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The roofless workshop, stars, vacuum tubes, and oscillators anchor the scene vividly with sensory detail filtered through Elias's theatrical perspective. The tuning forks and oscillator constrain his method choices across the sequence. However, the setting does not pressure a choice or charge the final image beyond backdrop decoration; the fireworks erupt after the resolution is complete, offering visual spectacle rather than spatial or temporal constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    The treetop village setting and greenhouse constrain her project (confined air, relentless humidity, pulley-delivered supplies) and charge the final image: the swaying floorboards mirror the plant's "vibrating" energy. The wrapping paper is a micro-setting device that recurs with purpose, reflecting both the environment's limitations and her ritual. The "wildflower hush" sensory anchor modulates across the turning-of-the-tide shift, and the final silence "heavy with knowledge" completes the arc. Spatial choreography is clear; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock arches, reversed waterfalls, and the magnetic-storm Flux create vivid, purposeful constraints that shape Elara's navigation choices. The skiff's magnetic boots and the underside landing demonstrate lived-in spatial logic. Sensory hierarchy is strong: metallic air, thinning atmosphere, whirling silence, humming arrow tip. The broken arrow tip—a small recurring object—charges the final image by grounding the sonic energy into soil, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Stacks are vividly rendered through rust, corrugated steel, shifting mud, and narrow slit-sky, grounding the aerodynamic volatility in tactile detail. The setting supplies real constraints: anemometer placement, ladder climb to impact zone, buckling hinges that wedge the patch. The fog and "labored breathing of a dying giant" establish tone and pressure without ornament. The environment shapes Elara's tactical choices (sensor placement at critical junctions) and charges the final image (descending into gloom), meeting the 9+ gate for setting-driven constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered—translucent ceiling membrane, aurora bleed, temperature—and the amber music sheet glows with fossilized fire. Setting details are filtered through Elian's synesthetic perception (colors become sound) and serve the ritual's logic. The cavern's "sculpted hush" constrains the bell's function (silence curated over centuries) and the aurora's timing gates the action. Micro-setting (the crystal rope, the lectern) enables the climactic pull. Spatial choreography is clear; the cave's mouth channels the sound downmountain, directly shaping the story's central mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Thunder-echo range and Canyon hush are vivid and purposeful: the "avalanchingly quiet" silence creates oppressive pressure that Silas breaks with the flute, and the driftwood markers serve as functional tools that "hummed in sympathetic resonance." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency ("his blood pound loudly against his temples"). The gilded flute and charred driftwood constrain choices and charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting allowance for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The topaz walls casting "jaundiced, feverish light" and the halo fragment's "rhythmic luminescence" are vivid and purpose-driven, filtering perception through the Operator's experimental lens. The workshop functions as micro-setting: the press, gauges, and halo fragment constrain the ritual's mechanics and charge the closure image when the fragment dims. Spatial choreography (Operator before engine, Kael gripped in chair, fragment inserted into press) remains clear across moves. The vanishing stars provide a tonal and thematic frame that mirrors the extraction without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and purposeful: the summit's "unnatural stillness" and thin air sharpen sensory detail filtered through Elara's urgency. The pendant's proximity-triggered hum and the pendant floating in "charged air" demonstrate environment constraining the climactic beat. Spatial choreography (climb, summit, descent) is coherent, and the setting charges the final image by intertwining magic with sky.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quartz arbor is vivid and specific (jagged spires, gray mist, wet loam), and the crystallizing frost on the windshield supplies the key constraint for the prism method. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's mystic focus (pitted hood, mildew smell, fern-like frost structures). The setting pressures the ritual—cold air enables frost, arbor frames the supernatural—and the final image of melting patterns charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard and bamboo forest constrain the action spatially and the encroaching silence provides a ticking clock tied to environment. The jigsaw puzzle edges and the loom are handled objects that matter to tactics. Spatial choreography is clear: orchard, bamboo cage, clearing, loom, approaching void. The final image ("the orchard vanished, and the bamboo was gone") charges the closure by showing the setting consumed. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through urgency ("cold wind of cancellation," "heavy, metallic taste"). The environment actively shapes the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, mine shafts, and geode chamber are vividly rendered with selective detail. Gravity fluctuation and "surreal viscosity" are striking. The setting constrains Ewan's descent (he must use the silk spool, navigate unstable gravity) and the central geode is the fulcrum of closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from surface to core compresses quickly. Meets the 9+ gate test (environment constrains choice and charges the final image), but minor propulsion gaps and one vague phrase ("timeframe between understanding and confusion") hold it just below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay is vividly anchored: "oil-stained floor," "corroded roof," "skeletal remains of starships." The green glass shard functions as both object and micro-setting, vibrating hot and drawing blood to charge the closure. Sensory hierarchy is strong—"metallic taste of fear, velvet texture of nostalgia"—and filtered through Elara's professional lens. The bay doesn't actively constrain a tactical choice (she could perform this work anywhere), which keeps it shy of the 8+ gate, but the specificity and atmosphere are sustained without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lantern room is not postcard décor—it constrains choice (glass-walled trap, pressing shadows) and charges the climax (amber glow defies gray hostility). Micro-setting (stone cairn on windowsill, Fresnel lens, spiral stairs) all shape tactics: Elias climbs deliberately, finds the cairn, completes it. Sensory detail is selective and filtered (metal ringing like tolling bell, sea-floor hum through bones, soft radiating bloom). Minor slip: "haunted by accumulated psychic weight" risks abstraction, but the shadows "pressing against glass" and the oppressive atmosphere that "shatters" anchor it in embodied perception. The sea glass and cairn function as micro-setting and constrain the final act, pushing the score toward the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Emerald Lighthouse under stars is established early with faceted walls, circular chamber, central pedestal, and the glass wick mechanism that constrains Silas's ritual. The wick's "microscopic grooves designed to capture the cosmos" and the mirrors feeding stellar radiation are purposeful, not ornamental. The final shadow-casting over the metropolis directly charges the closure image, and the post-print-newspaper timeframe subtly filters Silas's detachment from outcomes ("he would never read the digital report"). Minor weakness: the "sleeping metropolis that glowed faintly on the horizon" remains generic; more specific detail would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating tea house, sun-angle geometry, chalk lines on tatami, and the morpho wing's structural color all ground the experiment in tactile specificity. The setting constrains Elian's method (altitude, rotation, light timing) and the final image—mist parting to reveal the valley—charges the closure by externalizing his success. Sensory hierarchy reflects dye-master priorities (light quality, refractive index, color mechanism). The body and tools (tweezers, crystal bowl, solvent) are handled concretely across beats, elevating this category.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stormlit tower, courtyard maze, and moonlight are vivid and purposeful; the environment supplies both the problem (quantified sorrow in the hedge) and the solution resource (moonlight for healing). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the vertical relationship between spire balcony and courtyard below could be tighter. Sensory detail is selective and often filtered through Elias's professional lens ("vegetative nervous system," "psychic mortar"). The sextant and hedge function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable choice, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but the storm itself remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly realized: mica window as "layered silicate that peeled back like skin," silver trees weeping glowing sap, shadow-root cloth. The mica window constrains the climactic choice—it's the only "point of permeability"—and the orchard's materials (sap, shadow-roots) directly enable the sun's construction. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the high-stakes moment, avoiding mere decoration. The micro-setting (greenhouse, specific aperture, roots where she collapses) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The worn wooden bench and plastic fern anchor the threshold spatially; the transformation into mahogany shelves and silver tree charges the final image. The Grand Central Atrium's "aggressively public" quality and the psychic-footprint mechanics ("shrinking his aura") constrain the hiding action. Sensory detail (wood grain, pale light, "rustle of turning pages") is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elian's empathetic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and selective: "rusted gap," "invasive ferns," "camouflage netting," "tatami mat" filter through Elias's priorities and constrain choice (the tea house's concealment shapes his approach, the brittle earth demands heuristic gentleness). The courtyard and tea house charge the final image—"overgrown branches" bracket the meal, reinforcing the precariousness. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The sensory hierarchy (wet leaves, dried herbs, caraway) reflects urgency and memory. Minor: the palace context could anchor more clearly in the middle beats, but it sufficiently pressures the guerrilla act.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Frozen Library setting is vivid and consistent: "quartz hush," rime on shelves, frigid breath, stagnant bruised clouds. The environment constrains action (cold, altitude, isolation) and charges the closure—"Outside, the twilight deepened, wrapping the spire in an eternal, quiet winter" mirrors Elara's preservation work. The brass resonance chamber, copper gauge, and obsidian desk function as micro-setting elements that shape the measurement process. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-room scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rotting pier, barnacle table, and salt-soaked gloom are vivid and constrain the scene—silence is enforced, visibility is poor, the tide clock ticks. Sensory detail is selective (brine, wet pilings, bruised-purple horizon) and filtered through Elara's urgency. The vial she conceals is body-scale setting that charges the closure. One slip: "dust motes dancing in the quiet chaos" at sunrise under a pier feels visually improbable and breaks the established damp-dark logic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lavender bluff under aurora charges the final image with terrestrially cosmic atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy is strong: ionized air via taste, ozone + lavender scent, bioluminescence layered with aurora light. The tin compass ring functions as micro-setting (object-as-constraint), guiding navigation when technology fails. Spatial choreography is clean (ferns → bluff → precipice). The environment directly constrains choice (standard navigation useless; taste-based sensing required) and the final setting (empty space between figures, aurora flare) charges the closure moment when Elara's light dims and her cloud forms.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with specific, non-generic detail: light that "bled from the stones," "mournful violets and deep, bruising blues," and the acoustic tricks of the deep earth. The quartz pane becomes a functional element at closure, filtering light through the charcoal to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (center of cavern, flat quartz on wall, hollow within). The cave setting constrains his choice (he must wait for silence, must use the quartz's phosphorescence) and the glow pulsing "with a rhythm that matched his own beating heart" directly charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, hydroponic lines, and sub-basement are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mildew, old ink, mossy wall). The zinc plate's tactile weight and raised backward text ground the climax. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (workbench → streets → service entrance → caged counter). The plate constrains Elara's reading (she must "focus intensely" and reread), directly shaping the closure beat and charging the final image of leaves as carriers—an elegant micro-setting payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment all constrain Elara's tactics and charge the final image—she must work at dawn, at altitude, with finite ancient ice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "prismatic intensity," "breath pluming," "resonance travel through her bones." Spatial choreography remains coherent across the sculpture's mechanics. The micro-setting (body, tool, ice) drives the closure beat when her hand touches the vibrating frame, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass dome, crystalline roses, and maintenance shed anchor space early and remain consistent. The "strangely organic" internals—pulsating tubes, muscle-like fibers—provide vivid micro-setting detail that charges the transfer scene. The desert wind and "slightly different sky" at closure ground the magnetic shift's aftermath. The box's "low, nauseating frequency" and the ozone-and-dried-earth smell of the shed are selective, purposeful details. However, the roses themselves (gypsum and sand, "a beauty that cut") are described but never touched or used to constrain Seven's choices; they remain postcard backdrop rather than a resource or pressure point that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The courtyard, wisteria, fountain, and iron pillar are vivid and stable throughout. The rusted mailbox and its cold iron surface anchor the tactile peak beat when Elara presses her cheek to it. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources under pressure—she moves freely among neighbors without spatial friction, and the foreman's breach of the gate arrives as narrated fact rather than a dramatized environmental test.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken laboratory setting (barnacles, bioluminescent algae, obsidian console) is vivid and constrains choice: the facility's defenses detect panic, forcing Elara to move with balletic precision. Spatial choreography is clear (airlock, central console, blast doors). The journal, dice, and console all function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional lens ("lyrical code breaker"). The environment materially shapes her tactics (embodied password, kinetic interface), meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt cathedral, gantry, supersaturated lake, and ceiling spikes constrain movement and shape every choice. The copper bowl and trowel function as micro-setting tools that alter tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful: "sound like breaking bone," "blue as a bruise," the "high-frequency hum of salt growing over lost time." The environment charges the final image (salt flats, flickering dock lights) and the gravity fluctuation directly threatens Elias with the spiked ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nocturnal brook and glade are rendered with purposeful sensory detail—"liquid obsidian," "damp ferns," "ancient stones"—that grounds the ritual in a specific micro-setting. The crane's origami wing functions as both tool and recurring object, its pale luminescence cutting through water and acting as a vacuum for chaos. The environment directly enables Elian's method (mapping silence via cricket chirps, trout splashes) and the final image depends on the wing drifting downstream. Spatial choreography is clean; the tranquil-yet-charged atmosphere modulates with the ritual's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop garden is vividly rendered (jasmine, ozone, wrought iron, ivy) and the meteor shower functions as both atmospheric pressure and thematic mirror to the building's precarious foundation. Spatial choreography is clear: parapet, bistro table, distance traversed. The seal—a physical object—constrains the final choice by its weight and symbolism, qualifying as micro-setting. Minor issue: the Victorian tenement below is described but never used to pressure a choice directly on this rooftop.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet garden functions as micro-setting and mental architecture, constraining Elara's ritual through "resonance structures" and "suspension fields." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: plush moss, crushed violets, static electricity. The setting charges the final image—textures dissolve as she syncs with waking biometrics, and the artificial twilight breaking signals her release. The seashell and stone act as tools that constrain the archiving action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sanctuary's cold, the clepsydra's drip, and the aurora's flare all pressure Elian's hand control. Spatial choreography is coherent (altar, basin, scroll, seal) and the pearl twilight filters perception throughout. The iron cylinder and rose thorn function as micro-setting—tools whose properties constrain technique. The marble hall and stalactites recur at closure to charge the final image, but the setting does not impose a second spatial constraint during the peak alteration beyond cold, leaving the 8.8+ gate unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Serpentine Nexus is vividly anchored—sandstone walls, starlight, "dark throat"—and the shell's "spiraled interior smooth as old bone" is concrete and tactile. The canyon's acoustics constrain Elara's method (she must sing low, modulate pitch, harmonize with background hum) and the setting charges the final image when the "reed-blown melancholy" shifts lighter after the secret transfers. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor gap: the "sleeping city" at the end is generic, and occupational detail (echo singer training, sensor wards) is mentioned but not shown in action, keeping the world slightly abstract at the edges.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glacier shrine anchors the opening vividly and the "candle-lit" detail recurs at closure ("the candles flared"), charging the final image with a sensory callback. Micro-setting details—"pelt of white fur," "borrowed starlight," "cold air"—filter through Elara's professional lens and shape the ritual's atmosphere. However, the shrine itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as stage rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clean, and the melted snow globe's physical properties (tear-drop shape, soot swirl) are specific and handled on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering parapet is vividly anchored through sound, wetness, fireflies, and moon-painted flagstones. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's philosopher priorities (hexagonal foam patterns, compound-eye geometry). The setting enables his ritual moves and charges the whistle beat, though it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Micro-setting (wet stone, drainage weeps, bamboo whisk) functions purposefully. Strong execution just shy of 8.0 due to the absence of environmental constraint that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wasteland orchard, electromagnetic barrier, and laboratory are anchored early and remain spatially coherent. Selective detail (ash-strewn earth, geiger counter, rusted airlock, skeletal remains) reflects POV priorities without catalog listing. The diamond in its magnetic containment unit constrains the climactic choice—Elias must repair the machine or lose the sanctuary—satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object constrains choice. Sensory selection appropriately narrows under urgency (vibration of floorboards, whining pitch of magnetic coils). Minor slip: "radioactive winds" and "electromagnetic barrier" are conceptually vivid but the functional interaction (how EM blocks radiation) remains vague, risking placeholder feel.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is vivid and purposeful: cobalt glass portico, steam-driven engines, clockwork starlings, rusted audio equipment. The blue glow bathes Silas repeatedly, and the portico rattles "with a sympathetic resonance that felt like the laughter of the storm," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (tower above clouds, valleys below, thermal monitors). The setting subtly mirrors internal loss—glass wall becomes prison, machinery turns against him. Sensory hierarchy fits POV (technical observer noting heat maps, audio signals). The cobalt portico constrains by separating Silas from the world he wants to shape and returns in the ending to underscore his exile.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral loft, sand-glass skylight, and dawn wind create a vivid micro-setting that constrains timing (the ritual requires dawn's acoustics). Sensory detail—violet mist, silver vapor, rust—charges the ritual beats. The environment directly shapes Elian's choice to act at first light, and the buried skyscrapers anchor the post-apocalyptic world without catalog exposition. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drift-ice marina, rime-crusted gantry, and brass console create a vivid, purposeful frame. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-tuned: "ozone and rot," "viscous" air, fillings vibrating from spectral scream. The key and horn mechanism constrain Elias's choices (mechanical force would shatter it), and the golden-to-blue light transition charges the final image. Micro-setting (bare fingers on iron, sound through sternum) functions as body-as-setting to enable the climax. No occupational missteps detected; the engineering idiom reads plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and purposeful, anchoring choice (the grounding lever, the ice's reflective resonance). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional POV ("invisible lines of power," "degrees of arc"). The "waxen crescent moon" and "blue sparks" charge the final image. The physical choreography (Elara at the ramparts, Kael to her left, the viaduct below) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered ("weeping wound," oppressive humidity, dripping water) and the lantern serves as a concrete focal point. The environment constrains choice: the damp air conducts the psychic overlay, the subsidence reveals the artifact, and the site's properties force Elias's classification decision. Spatial choreography (kneeling, scanner, boots in ripples) is coherent. Small cap: while the setting pressures the closure, some descriptive phrases ("loudly, uncomfortably alive") lean slightly abstract without altering the strong overall integration.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shop's "vibrant hush" and "suspended energy of a thousand silent springs" establish atmosphere that modulates with the drape-opening ("blinding vitality"). The clockwork heart as micro-setting object constrains the entire exchange and charges the final image when it beats in time with the music box. Spatial choreography (threshold, counter, workbench, window, pedestal) remains coherent throughout. The Q3 gate is satisfied: the heart and shop environment shape choice (Elias's decision to seek repair) and charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The acid sea, corroding workshop, and kaleidoscopic vision constrain multiple choices: Unit Seven must strip weight to avoid sinking, use the obsidian tip because steel is blunted, and navigate storms through fractured prisms. The buoy in the upper atmosphere charges the final image with specificity. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the protagonist's optical limits and mechanical priorities. The micro-setting (body as kite-frame, tool as stylus) functions as constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian console, server stacks, monitor drone, and "stagnant ocean" of profiles create a coherent digital archive. The mission patch functions as micro-setting, anchoring Silas through tactile detail and charging the ending when he grips it "until his knuckles turned white." Spatial choreography (console, drone hovering into peripheral vision, shadows of server stacks) remains clear. The archive's oppressive atmosphere supports the tone without excess decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes are vivid in the opening, but once Kaelen retreats into the metaphysical lighthouse interior the spatial grounding becomes abstract (dusty antique shop, curved walls, baroque frames). The crystal fragment and cheval mirror are handled across multiple beats and charge the closure image, qualifying as micro-setting that drives the reconstitution action. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but leans decorative rather than constraining choice at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly particular—"jagged, white vice," yachts trapped, "slurry of ice and mud"—and the cold, windborne environment anchors Elias's numbed detachment. The parasol tip is an object-as-setting micro-choice: its survival amid "crushing surge that had snapped steel masts" directly charges the closure image. Sensory selection reflects urgency and state: frozen docks, "weak winter light," "thermal shifts" groaning. The setting constrains his method (salvage work) and ultimately delivers the artifact that reweights his understanding, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber pavilion functions as micro-setting, visually charging the scene ("cage of autumn light trapping a creature of grief") and returning at closure when wind rattles the glass. The vineyard's fermentation scent and the autumn breeze anchor sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean: Elias moves from perimeter to platform to bench. The burned letter edge and autumn wind constrain and enable the final release, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting elements shape choice or charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "whisperfield calm" as physical weight, ceramic mask filtering "blinding reality," wind "screaming with unnatural ferocity." The kinetic parapet and shifting sands constrain his approach, forcing peripheral navigation. Spatial choreography is clean through the dune crossing and pavilion entry. The Murmuring Pavilion charges the climax directly. Minor gap: the ritual chamber's acoustics and stone textures could ground the consecration beat more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lavender field and rusted factory establish vivid, specific contrasts early, and sensory detail (floral oil, metallic tang, vines climbing) is purposeful. However, the environment remains decorative—no spatial constraint or resource alters Elian's tactics, and the "timeframe" as vines climb is observed rather than pressuring choice. The setting charges the final image with visual resonance but does not constrain action, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: "pale grey light...casting long, angular bars," "high clerestory windows," "acoustically perfect" rotunda. The crystal object constrains his choice—he must use its sonic reflectivity to amplify and purify his fractured speech—and the "Biography section" consumed by moss provides the physical proof that drives his testimony. Spatial choreography is clean (beneath dome, pivoting toward rotunda's dark center, aiming crystal). The library's acoustic properties and the moss's physical sprawl both shape his tactics and charge the final image of speaking "into the listening dark."

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Fog Sculpture Garden is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: VHS retaining walls, CRTs, driftwood bleached like bone. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's urgency—he scrambles, marks, follows—and the final crater's "profound" silence charges the ending. The driftwood and chalk constrain his navigation ritual, and the crater's magnetic-particle hum becomes the story's conceptual anchor. Spatial choreography is clean (pile, wall of CRTs, valley of iron, crater). The setting drives both the middle ritual and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting—cold iron floor, thin air tasting of ozone, white stratosphere below—is vivid and purposeful. The earthquake (foundations shaking, rivets popping, floor tilting) directly constrains Elian's movements and heightens urgency. The spinning clock hand creates "a small vacuum of heat near his face," a tactile detail that charges the climactic moment. Micro-setting: the camera body, jars of screws, and workbench anchor spatial choreography. The observatory's altitude and instability shape the final image: the moon breaching the horizon at the exact moment of mechanical and geological crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "radiant haven above the clouds" and the hermetically sealed tower establish a vivid high-altitude sanctuary, and sensory details (dust motes, starched sheets, antiseptic vs. jasmine) are filtered through Elias's professional attention. The vinyl shard functions as a charged micro-object that constrains Clara's grip and is ritually repositioned. However, spatial choreography within the room is vague—cello placement, bedside distance, and the panoramic window's relation to Clara's bed remain unclear—and the setting does not materially constrain any choice or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is vivid and specific: dark stone, mosaic tiles, velvet drapes, embedded silver circuitry. The clockwork key and the floor's conduits constrain Elara's actions across multiple beats, guiding her sequence of moves. The aperture's opening and the artificial light directly charge the closure image—shadows pooling beneath her feet. Sensory detail (ozone, old copper, violet spark) is filtered through her scholarly focus. The floating isle and twisted constellations frame the world's logic but remain backdrop rather than active constraint at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret garden and hedge maze are established early and serve as spatial anchors; the garden's atmosphere ("ancient roses watching") supports tone. The wooden body on moss and the tooth as physical object constrain Aris's diagnosis. However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—the doctor's metaphor-building occurs independently of environmental constraint. The space functions more as backdrop than crucible, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto constrains Elara's work spatially (damp limestone, slate workbench, cave mouth light) and thematically charges the closure: she retreats into earth to manufacture celestial light. The lapidary wheel, sea glass, and balance scale function as micro-setting elements that shape her ritual and final verification. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her craft ("frosted fragments," "hypnotic frequency," "cool tear of crystallized ocean") without postcard-catalog excess. The mist that erases the sky forces her retreat, directly enabling the scene's pressure and final illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The moss-covered servers, thawing stalactites, and drip-pattern arrow are selective and purpose-driven, constraining Elias's movement and discovery. The amber pendant (fossilized seed, protected vulnerability) charges the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clear: aisles, terminal, "two rows over." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's priorities (wet stone, ozone, sunlight shaft). The setting pressures Mara's hiding and supplies the artifact that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    The feral nexus in mist is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (ink bleeding to vapor, gelatinous narrative flow, swirling hush). Micro-setting qualifies: the shell fragment constrains Elias's extraction ritual and charges the final image when it glows with captured warmth. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the liminal setting, though the bridge and window are briefly sketched. The mist environment subtly mirrors Elias's uncertain creative state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arbor at dawn anchors early with concrete detail (filtered light, damp earth, trellis overhead). The vine tendril functions as micro-setting: Elian selects it from the trellis, grafts it into the machine, and its transformation (glowing, then spent) charges the closure. The prism and celestial alignment constrain the timing of Elian's action. Setting details—copper gears, crystal prisms, living wood—are woven through the protagonist's work rather than catalogued separately, and the verdant arbor's living qualities enable the organic bridge required by the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subarctic crater and withered orchard supply vivid, selective detail filtered through alchemical purpose: skeletal geometry, frozen slush, dead root hollow. Setting constrains choice by temperature and materiality (frost accumulates, vial shielded from cold) and charges the final image through the contrast of glowing copper in returned dark. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—knee-deep snow, kneeling workspace, pocketing the plate. The micro-setting of the root hollow functions as workbench, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (damp, polished stone; shaft of daylight; misting breath) filtered through Elias's technical focus. Spatial choreography is coherent across the nave, floor, and surface climb. The cavern's acoustic properties constrain his method (perfect stone walls, reflection angles) and the final image of a "dead" cavern stripped of echoes charges the closure. Minor slip: "the surface world" description leans toward elevated summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with specificity ("greening alloy," "oxidizing floor," "skeletal brass object") and the sensory details are filtered through Elara's professional focus. The kerosene burner functions as a micro-setting object that directly constrains her choice—she must align it with starlight to calcify the regret—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (cross-legged on floor, burner by knee, fissure above), and the "shingled hush" operates as tangible atmospheric pressure. Minor note: some metaphors verge on ornamental ("whalebone reverie") but remain tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    The skylight, kettle, and ash wood blank function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the boiling water imposes a ritual deadline, the wood serves as a vessel for grief transfer, and the rain-beaded glass brackets the scene's temporal and emotional arc. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's practical lens (rust, damp, ash smell) and the environment charges the final image—steam rising into shadows mirrors the "here and gone" motif with specificity. The loft's history (velvet capes, sequined leotards) roots the present without exposition drag.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Kinetic Lagoon is vivid and purposeful—charged mercury, knee-deep viscosity, invisible platforms constrain movement throughout. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Jaren's scavenger priorities. The camera wheel as recurring micro-object constrains his method and charges the final image when he spins it backward. Spatial choreography (wading, marching toward a crest, kneeling) tracks cleanly. Minor gap: the ghost's translucency is brief descriptor rather than integrated physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned spaceport is vivid and purposeful: terrazzo floor, confetti, gantry, and sub-flooring all constrain and enable Elias's moves. The sextant piece—a physical object—functions as micro-setting, its refractive properties shaping the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective (hissing air, ionized bloom, blue light over grime) and filtered through an engineer's priorities. The carnival detritus versus grand arches contrast charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal forecourt constrains the climactic choice—water unlocks vibration, Elian kneels on wet quartz, the hum travels through bone—and charges the final image when sun dries the stones and quiets their whispers, forcing his return. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: petrichor bypasses discipline to strike the heart, the amethyst vein hums felt rather than heard. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The micro-setting (body, wet stone, fingertips) functions as setting and directly shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Anchors who/where/when by line two (Elias, stern, twilight canal). The canal's oily water, brick embankments, and industrial skyline supply spatial coherence. The sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining the noon-proof choice and charging the final image when the shadow confirms his calculation. Sensory hierarchy is strong: mist "smelled of wet iron and ancient stagnation," cascading water "remarkably loud in the stillness." One missed constraint: the winch and cable tension shape tactics but the canal depth, current, or silt resistance never complicates salvage.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Golden Wharf setting is vivid and specific: snow on planks, rime-crusted hawser, frozen bollard, amber dock lights dampened by fog. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through Elias's philosophical lens ("luminous, muted path," "oceanic hush"). The fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting/tool that enables the decoding action, and the fog's thickening creates a subtle temporal pressure that threatens to "obscure his work entirely." The final image of fog swallowing the harbor charges the closure moment, and the cold numbs his fingers during the key task, satisfying the constraint test for the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Garden setting (shadowed, autumn, skeletal shapes, burning maple) is vivid and modulates with emotional charge. The thread—crimson silk against pale skin—functions as micro-setting, constraining the Countess's gesture (twisting until circulation slows) and charging the snap as a micro turn. Spatial choreography (veranda, hedges, garden walls) remains clear. The final image ("garden fully steeped in shadow," autumn air biting) anchors the closure in sensory particulars that deepen the tone of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The suspended palace on stalactites is vivid and purposeful, signaling precariousness that mirrors Valerius's existential suspension. The egg's "kaleidoscope of fossilized blues and greens" and the "smog-choked air" constrain the final outcome—environment directly kills the bird, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, workbench, incubator cushion) remains clear. Minor density: some description ("mineral tears," "quaking reverie") ornaments without pressing choice, but the smog-choked air is indispensable to the tragic ending.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The obsidian lagoon is vividly rendered and functions as more than backdrop: its darkness, stillness, and depth constrain the graft's mechanics and charge the final image. The volcanic sand's dual memory (fire and water) is specific and purposeful. The "kelp-drift peace" atmospheric layer integrates well, reflecting Elara's state. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, lowering the branch, hand hovering. The foreign coin's weight and the submerged stone anchor tactile reality. The lagoon's acoustic properties enable the humming closure beat, directly shaping outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is vividly rendered with "dry basins," "silent spouts," "debris of dried leaves and crumbling aqueducts," and the Grand Cistern setting is spatially coherent. Sensory detail is strong (cold stone, "sound like a cracking knuckle," golden vapor) and filtered through Elara's clinical lens. The stained glass box as micro-setting object constrains her method (can't use brute force) and charges the final image when it opens, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice and appear at closure. The "defiant hush" of the plaza subtly mirrors internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nebula garden is vivid and purposeful: "ribboned expanse," "violet dark," "freezing plasma drifting," all filtered through Xylos's sentimental lens. Sonar pinging and the crystallized hydrogen stalks constrain navigation choices. The rusted axle and the gear's fractal edge charge the closure image by enabling cold light. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the transit and installation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: "overgrown ferns," "dying violet light," "suspended amber," Monarchs "like breathing rust." The setting constrains choice meaningfully—Elias must climb the ladder to reach the ceiling moth, and the glass panes provide the surface against which he traces the ribbon. Sensory hierarchy reflects the gravestone carver's focus: texture (mossy floor, worn silk, condensation on glass) and visual geometry dominate. The micro-setting of the ribbon and ladder becomes functional rather than merely decorative, charging the final image when the tangled path on glass translates to stone.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "tidal obsidian ridge" anchors early and recurs as interior metaphor ("sharp ridges of the coastline below"). The clock chamber's heat, brass friction, and the pendulum's "terrifying momentum" pressure the action. The rake handle as micro-object constrains the method and charges the closure image ("inscriptions were worn down slightly, the wood burned dark"). Sensory detail is purposeful—"high-pitched whine," "tactile Braille of his regrets"—and filtered through Silas's professional and penance-driven focus.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt silo, suspended shrouds, and starlight filtering through the open roof establish vivid spatial grounding early. The pedestal, mechanical timer, and sovereign case function as micro-setting elements that constrain Silas's sequence of actions (he steps forward, manipulates threads, catches the falling object). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "thick and soft" air, "velveteen gloom," "blue air" charging the atmosphere. The setting charges the final image (tapestry framed within the silo's spiral) and the recurring "tenderly organized by hue and sorrow" detail reappears at closure to anchor the thematic repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Obsidian Spire, frozen lake, thin air, and basalt desk anchor the scene vividly and filter through Elian's professional lens (the lake as "shattered mirror," the spire's volcanic rock). The holographic projections and vellum constrain his choices—he cannot leave the desk, and the blank page demands his answer. The kingfisher quill's dual-element symbolism (air/water, thought/reality) charges the final act. Selective, purposeful detail supports the moment without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember alcove, shortwave radio, coat, and glowing manuscript all constrain choices (smothering the light to avoid patrols) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: orange geothermal light, damp air thick with memory fog, violet phosphorescence. The micro-setting of the desk and the mist outside shape tactics and the ending beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: the aqueducts and drones are mentioned but not fully integrated into spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery's "perspective lines...that recede forever" and the "impossible horizon" frame the mirage-of-safety concept and pressure Elara's search for permanence. The antique rocker functions as a live clock, its slowing rhythm constraining Silas's timing. The "pale stone tiles" provide the canvas for the charcoal work, making the scattering viscerally legible. Spatial choreography—Silas crouching, Elara on the stool, the rocker beside her—remains clear. The setting constrains the final choice (timing tied to the chair's stillness) and charges the closure image (dust drifting toward the vanishing point), meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sewer alcove, workshop floor, and sedimentary layers are vividly rendered ("geological excavation," "heavy clay," "brackish water") and constrain Silas's search through physical resistance—mud pushes back "with the weight of the ocean." The chronometer cog's uncorroded state matters causally, and the ticking travels up ventilation shafts to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dull glint of brass, damp brickwork), filtered through Silas's mechanical priorities. The post-plague ruins supply both obstacle (silt, trash, bone) and resource (the preserved cog), meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Velvet Library is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: heavy curtains, amber dusk, plush aisles, velvet linings that "vibrate" during the climax. The zither rosette functions as a micro-object that constrains and charges the final convergence (peering through it to mark the "focal point," then placing it on the podium as echo dies). Autumn leaves and falling motifs subtly mirror the theme of vanishing. The library's acoustic properties and velvet texture serve the method (subtracting noise) and shape the climactic beat, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rusted greenhouse constrains choice (shattered glass, ambient trauma absorption) and charges the final image (gap in roof, celestial violet light). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: red dust, acrid tendril taste, sap bleeding, vibrating warmth of the fruit. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting's decay directly pressures the plant's development, making the environment essential rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "bruised apricot" sky, nectar dusk, and tower's glass booth create a vivid sensory frame that charges the final image. The lacquer box—ancient, painted with storm clouds and dragons—contrasts purposefully with the steel tower and recurs with reweighted meaning at the reveal. Spatial choreography (spiral ramp, glass booth, transaction slot) remains clear. The amber light filtering through the tower's ribs constrains Silas's choice to force contemplation, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quiet bay, mossy stones, basalt rocks, weathered porch planks, and violet scent create vivid, purposeful anchors filtered through Elias's perception. The orris root functions as micro-setting: it constrains his ritual choice and charges the final image when "violet scent rising from the floorboards" confirms the sanctification. Spatial choreography is clear (water's edge → Victorian home → porch stairs → top step → road below), and the spring cold sharpens at closure. The sodium bulbs "daydreaming" and the "drift-line accumulated the ocean's rejections" show specificity and perceptual bias, meeting the 9+ test for environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater garden is not decorative: stone architecture houses the sleeping, coral eating into masonry signals decay and time, bioluminescent vines enable the cascading revelation mechanism. The ampoule's "foxglove-stained" purple-appearing-black detail is perception-filtered through crushing gloom. The structural weakness in the archway is both spatial anchor and plot keyhole, constraining Caelum's method and charging the final image of the "waiting room of thousands, paused in rock."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The infinite staircase is vivid and purposeful: "hazy vertical abyss," cold limestone, chalk lines, friction-less vacuum logic. The chipped die and chalk equations are tactile anchors that constrain Elian's method and charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (sitting step, standing, casting dice onto scribbled riser). The staircase's perpetual-motion logic is integrated into choice: it recycles exertion, forcing Elian to attack structural integrity rather than climb. The final rupture—color, memory, mundane world—reweights the setting as prison-to-portal with embodied texture (grainy fabric, rough warmth of doorframe).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse supplies vivid contrasts—saffron quiet against smog, ferns and orchids grounding Elian's isolation—and the glass pane serves as the literal canvas that constrains his method. The waxing moon's beam is a concrete anchor that enables the brush's luminescence, and the smog-choked cityscape below charges the final image when the distant light flickers through pollution. Spatial choreography is clean: workbench, rows of plants, glass wall, and the distant high-rise remain legible throughout. The greenhouse's humidity and ventilation hum add sensory texture without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto environment pressures the plot: frozen falls create silence and low humidity, thaw brings noise and destructive moisture. The opera lens filters glare to reveal fractures, and the dry culinary annex enables the bread solution—micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory details (cloying rosewater, phosphorescence, stone ovens) are filtered through Elian's cultured POV. However, the waterfall's mechanics and the refugees' spatial choreography remain slightly abstract; the community is described more than shown interacting with space.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and yoyo are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (Fresnel lens, "density that warped the wood," violet cascade). The setting pressures the choice by providing the lens mechanism and the ticking tide window. Spatial choreography (gallery railing, workbench, lantern housing) remains coherent. The hunger stone's presence and disappearance charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion that environment/object constrains choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The funhouse setting—rot-smell, wet sawdust, distorted mirrors, Hall of Giants—grounds action and constrains movement through paradoxical navigation. The opera cloak clasp (cold metal, weeping eye, tarnished silver) appears twice with tactile specificity and becomes the tether-anchor, growing "searing hot" at closure to deliver physical cost. Lingering luminance as micro-setting reshapes perception throughout, making "apparent holes" solid ground and enabling the trick. The mirror at closure serves as both spatial anchor and tactical resource, imploding inward to signal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Driftwood Orchard setting is vivid and purposeful: floating raft, grafted apple trees on shipwreck debris, hollow Great Trunk. Sensory detail is selective and mood-appropriate (ozone taste, salt-cured timber, spray lashing face). The setting constrains choice—Elara must use the hollow trunk as her instrument—and charges the final image when she touches its warm bark. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (body, tool, trunk) functions as setting and directly enables the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The turtle-city setting is vivid and purposeful: scutes constrain Elara's methodology, the fissure reveals gears (environment actively redefines reality), and the harsh sun creates atmospheric pressure throughout. Micro-setting qualifies—her "boots" anchor the spiral pattern that cracks. The Silent Watchers function as spatial pressure that drives both past (brother's expedition) and present action (whistle-blowing). Small gap: the interior of the city (timber frame, plaza) receives less texture than the shell and horizon, slightly limiting spatial immersion during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The station's sensory details (iron, damp earth, shattered glass, ivy choking girders) are vivid and filtered through Elara's historian lens. The ivy becomes a recurring motif that charges the closure: it actively constrains the Censor's position when Elara points to the cracked pillar, forcing him to see decay rather than shelter. The rosebush and fallen petal function as micro-setting elements that mark the timeframe and are crushed underfoot to signal resolve. Spatial choreography (tracks, bench, platform) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged pavilion supplies vivid, pressure-relevant detail: slippery cobblestones, the chest-deep water, the jagged fissure choked with barnacles and silt. The lantern on the plinth, the cold insistence of the waders, and the dull underwater thud of the dislodged stone all anchor Elias's body in the space and constrain his repair work. The crack's resistance and the suction-grip on the granite directly shape the central action (wrestling the stone free). The setting charges the final image by literalizing the sinking city and the flooded ruin, making Elias's preservation work spatial and tactile rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken city, bioluminescent algae, reinforced glass, and vibrating infrastructure create vivid constraint: the blackout's stillness enables fingertip detection of grooves. The stamp's prism mechanism charges the final revelation. Spatial choreography is clean (library tier, central pedestal, western wall). Minor gap: the "cavitating water pumps" and oxygen scrubbers are mentioned for stakes but don't pressure a mid-scene choice. Setting does constrain the climax (stillness required for decryption) and the final image (glass walls as metaphor and literal vulnerability).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating island tea garden, gravity-glass chains, and Glass Basilica create a coherent fantastical geography. The prism "vanishing from sight" when perfectly polished is a striking micro-setting detail that constrains his method. The paradox of descending-while-ascending pressures the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across cottage, garden edge, and upward trajectory. Does not reach 9+ because the garden itself (tea table, jasmine steam) remains largely ornamental backdrop rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The zero-gravity environment actively constrains action: tears suspend, he drifts rather than walks, objects float. The viewport and Geode function as tools that shape his method. The cooling breakers create a ticking time pressure that narrows his window. The "suffocating darkness" and "heavy silence" are filtered through his professional hunter's perspective as necessary conditions rather than obstacles. The final image of him gripping the "dull and inert" Geode against the bulkhead charges the object with the cost of his failure, and his hand closing on the override key makes the setting's systems integral to his next destructive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory and terrace are grounded with spatial detail ("crumbling stone skeleton," "debris that felt like the bones of history"). The "brilliant dimness" tone is sustained and the altitude/atmosphere contribute to the signal's availability, constraining the action. The drone and its haptic controller are handled concretely. The type foundry matrix chip functions as micro-setting object that charges the closure. Minor gap: the Pilgrim's spatial positioning and the console layout could be clearer during the extraction beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Cobalt Terrace's "geometric stones glowing with…bruised luminescence" and the "salt-slicked steps" anchor early and purposefully. The driftwood functions as micro-setting: its chaotic magic manufactures false memories that Elian must resist, directly constraining his search and sharpening the thematic stakes. The ocean's "sieved hush" wraps isolation around him, modulating tone and guiding perception. The watch hand "lodged in petrified oak" ties setting to closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and beach work. Minor gap: the terrace itself does not return or constrain the final choice; the beach does most causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-worn parapet and mist create visceral constraint throughout. The obsidian pedestal with gears becomes a functional pressure point when the lever snaps. Spatial choreography tracks clearly (opposite walkways, central mechanism, sheer drop). The brass drawer pull's physical properties (soft brass biting harder steel) become mechanically decisive at closure, elevating the object to setting-as-tool status.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal launch, fog, freezing surf, and weathered timber pylons are vivid and selective. The utility poles function as micro-setting that directly constrains his choice: they offer "a linearity that his fractured mind desperately craved" and replace celestial navigation. The transformer's electric buzz cuts through silence, grounding him in the mundane. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—panic narrows to the "dark, vertical slash of the next pole." The poles charge the final image, making the closure indispensable to this exact setting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid and specific, filtered through Elias's jaded curator lens ("dry, clinical appreciation of a museum curator inspecting a fake diamond"). Sensory details—glowing blue algae, electric blue water, damp rock—ground the final beat. The baseball's physical description ("delicately robust," yellowed leather, red stitching catching blue light) constrains the climactic choice: its tangible presence makes the sacrifice legible. The lake charges the final image by reflecting diverging timelines, turning setting into active thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The orchard's permanent moonlight and "pools of spilled ink" shadows establish surreal atmosphere early and frame the phoenix's fire as violation of stasis. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through urgency: "heat radiating through the soles of his boots," "aroma that smelled of memory and ancient starlight." The fortune slip and censer function as micro-setting objects that constrain his method. However, spatial choreography during the dive is vague—"slammed into the orchard" then "grip Elian's crystalized forearm" lacks precise blocking. The setting charges the final image (eternal bloom) but doesn't alter his tactical choices mid-scene beyond providing the stage.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The midnight glade and celestial plateau anchor space vividly in the opening, and the "frost-kissed turf" and "glowing grass" establish texture. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters a tactic; Silas could perform this ritual anywhere elevated and isolated. The porcelain saucer crack and the tablecloth function as micro-setting objects that charge the ending (the empty spaces he traces), lifting specificity. Spatial choreography is clear—kneel, spread cloth, pour ink, lay cards—but the setting remains postcard backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The *Cenotaph*'s patchwork construction and dying reactor hum create tangible atmosphere, and the blast door functions as a concrete constraint driving the entire arc. The "emergency lights" casting the shadow Elian stitches, and the "cold deck" he sits on, ground the ritual in spatial particulars. The ventilation shafts (scavenger evasion) and engineering sector anchor choices in layout. The setting charges the final image—"drifting into the impossible colors"—and the gravitational lightness pays off the established variable-gravity environment, though the "impossible colors" themselves remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The black sand, volcanic setting, and tidal pool are vivid and sensory-specific. The sand's heat forces Silas to stop "at this exact second," a constraint that shapes timing. The bottled bugs and their light constrain the climax by seeping into the sand. Celestial bodies frame the moment but remain decorative; the beach itself charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Luminous Fort, arc-lamps, photoreactive sundial compound, and bronze quill holder's internal rifling all supply tactile, functional detail that shapes Elara's method. The garden's "winking hush" atmosphere and the "deep thrum" of the Cradle provide sensory contrast to the harsh surveillance aesthetic. Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard, sundial center, gnomon mechanics). The sundial's grooves and the quill holder's rifling constrain the unlock sequence, charging the final action and meeting the 9+ test for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless ocean provide vivid, selective detail filtered through Oren's herder's eye. The basalt edge and magnetic boots ground spatial choreography; the painted rocks and star-dust vial are handled objects that constrain his tactical sequence. The aurora's "borrowed dawn" light charges the final image, and the environment actively shapes his capture attempt—magnetic field lines guide the eels, the precipice groans under neutronium weight. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: during the capture, perception narrows to vectors and the gauntlet; in stillness, he registers shadows and ocean.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stormlit observatory is anchored early and consistently pressures the scene: glass floor over churning clouds, lightning flashes, battering fury, barometric pressure drop that enables the chemical reveal. Sensory detail (ozone, alcohol fumes, toxic green dial, cold air fogging breath) is filtered through Elias's urgency and supports the storm/censorship metaphor without becoming ornamental. The darkroom timer and chemical setup function as micro-setting tools that constrain the procedure's timing. The observatory's isolation and storm condition directly enable the climactic act, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrains choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial anchor the scene vividly and supply concrete constraints (glass panes vibrating, sundial geometry). The Danish tin and mechanical arm function as micro-setting elements that shape Silas's decoding choice. Spatial choreography (blade trapped against glass) is coherent. The setting charges the final image—Northern Door as answer—raising the score into the 7-band despite some ornamental description (brook's "oblivious babbling").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library supplies vivid, purpose-driven details: jagged girders, broken spine of shelving, glass shards catching city-glow. The coffee tin's false bottom and the fissure in the foundation constrain their planting method and spatially anchor the climactic act. Moonlight flooding the rotunda at the calculated timeframe charges the final image, turning rust to silver and validating their work. The setting actively shapes tactics (clearing debris, packing earth into cracks) and provides the soil—literal and metaphorical—for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The doomed station and tidal arbor are vividly rendered ("bruised purple" sky, "cumulonimbus rolling silently beneath," "pale silver disc"), and the arbor's swaying platform and thin atmosphere create tactile pressure. The projector and clock function as micro-setting elements that enable the escape, and the spectral piano in the arbor charges the final image. However, the arbor itself does not constrain a choice after arrival—it serves primarily as sanctuary rather than forcing a tactical decision. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, though the station's collapse remains off-stage, reducing environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Ancient Ridge supplies vivid, multi-sensory detail (violet blossoms, ozone, bruised-purple air, cold granite, gritty dust) filtered through Elian's professional lens. The kaleidoscope is a recurring tool that constrains his verification method; the fissure in the rock becomes the sole viable planting site, directly shaping his final action. The monsoon's arrival pressures the timeline and participates in the closure image (rain "like a bullet," blurring the world). Spatial choreography is clear: ridge peak, orchids to the left, soft stone to the right, then the fissure. Minor: some setting details (silver city vision) serve thematic texture more than tactical constraint, but the overall integration of environment into plot choices is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The islet after rain is anchored early and purposefully: wet basalt, twilight, highest point. The bonsai functions as micro-setting, serving as the ritual vessel that constrains Silas's method (he must channel regret through its needles). The compass and lace are handled objects that charge the final image when the needles turn "ghostly blue." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cerulean regret," "rhythmically placid" water). The setting directly enables the ritual's mechanics and the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment/object constraining choice and charging the ending.

The setting meaningfully charges the final image of harmony restored in “the glass belly of the conservatory.” A slight density of description borders on lush for the word count, but it remains purposeful and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater city library is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone and stakes: “graveyard of dissolved ink and pulped paper” and the cracked dome under impossible pressure both anchor and charge the scene. Environmental specifics (rusted light mechanism, bioluminescent glow, psychic clamor) are filtered through Silas’s professional and metaphysical habits, rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The setting directly enables the resolution by housing the ancient beacon and the accumulated distress that needs addressing. It could push higher if the physical constraints of the dome and ocean shaped his tactics a bit more, but as-is the atmosphere is rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The terra-cotta arbor on the ridge, the valley below, the tents, the wind, and the treeline are all sharply evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s tactical concerns. The sanctions world is sketched economically but plausibly, with drones and embargoes inferred through concrete details rather than dumped exposition. The silver bell and the wind through the arches give the setting a strong atmospheric and symbolic charge at the end. The environment lightly constrains action (stealth, elevation) but doesn’t quite become a full-on tactical obstacle, which keeps this out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Twilight Viaduct in Bloom is richly imagined and integrated: the moss, violet clouds, and luminescent vines all reinforce the liminal, “foggy lucidity” of the piece and anchor the spiritual mechanics. The camera apparatus and Kwan Yin’s Tear function as tools embedded in the setting rather than decorative props. The environment meaningfully shapes what can happen (spirits manifest here; it is a bridge between worlds) and charges the final image as he goes in search of the next “spark on the bridge.” A slight bias toward visual detail over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered and deeply integrated: the banyan roots are both stage and instrument, and the final image of time’s texture as coarse, braided bark directly arises from the environment. Sensory details (fog, ozone, petrichor, trembling roots) are specific and charged, and the world’s rules (living bridge, hyperbolic growth) remain internally consistent. The setting constrains his choices—only this living, pliable architecture could be woven into a hyperbolic time-trap—so it meaningfully charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is vividly evoked—rotting floorboards, sun-bleached bears, jars of petrified candy—and its carnival detritus (piano bench, prize archery display) directly houses the cipher and master key. The chain to the ticket counter and the hidden vault beneath the floor turn setting into constraint, not just backdrop. Tone and atmosphere (gaudy decay versus precious life below) are tightly fused with the premise. This is rich and functional description, just shy of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly and precisely realized: the underwater greenhouse, the ring of shipwrecks, the aurora filtered through the ocean, and the Ashen Forge all cohere into a distinct, oppressive atmosphere. Environmental details are strongly filtered through Elara’s perception (e.g., aurora singing in minor keys) and consistently echo the thematic interest in catastrophe and memory. The shipwreck ring and burned-archive Forge aren’t mere postcards; they’re the literal source of her raw material and charge the final image of “grim harvest.” This integration of environment, tools, and stakes is excellent, though the physical setting does more symbolic than practical constraining of moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the verdigris ribs, emerald glass, underwater moonlight, and jarred moonbeams all feel of a piece and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment and objects genuinely constrain choices (she must wait for the light to change; moonlight and the crystal vessel are required for development). The final image—her heart beating in the green-tinted hall with the glowing jar in her lap—uses setting to charge the closure. A slight tendency toward decorative lushness in places is the only minor limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, original, and deeply integrated: the furnace, abandoned control room, and weeping glaciers are not just backdrop but direct constraints on Elias’s options. The Great Melt literally undermines the foundation, converting his studio into a liability and forcing the choice to leave. Details are filtered through his professional eye (glass colors, annealing oven, optically clear glass) and emotional state. The final image of him stepping into “weeping slush” and leaving a dome as a “transparent eye” strongly charges the environment in the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted, roofless library under freezing stars is sharply rendered and atmospherically apt, with environmental details (iron ribs, oxidized metal, exposed stacks) entwined with Elias’s phobias. Setting meaningfully constrains choices: open sky vs. tetanus-laced walls, the roof shutters slamming shut, and the ventilation shift to “clean, warm air” all directly affect the outcome. Objects-as-setting (the console, the child’s cast, the shell) feel embedded rather than decorative. This is rich, high-functioning worldbuilding without devolving into a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and economically realized: the gale, ancient basalt fort, evaporated sea, and marbled hush all feel specific and integrated with her task. Environmental forces (storm, wind, darkness, the last star) are not mere backdrop but actively shape her methods and the final image—the storm’s abrupt cessation and total blackness sharpen the closure. Details like “river-rounded stones,” “flaking gold leaf,” and the textural silence (“silencing the very dust”) feel filtered through her ritualistic focus. The only reason this doesn’t edge into 9+ is that the fort itself, while atmospheric, doesn’t significantly constrain or alter her choices beyond generic “exposed high place in a storm.”

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen courtyard, snow-dusted granite, “air tasted of ozone and regret,” and temporal eddies all combine into a vivid, specific milieu. Setting is well-filtered through 734’s professional lens—“scrub the timeline floors” and “facility needed the courtyard clear for a wedding re-do” embed world rules economically. The environment exerts light but real pressure (eddies threatening his gyroscope; the cold intensity of the violin; institutional need for a reset space by morning), and the disposal chute grounds the final image. It’s rich and purposeful without feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Crystal Forecourt, singing pillars, and rain-slick mirror stones create a vivid, coherent environment that strongly supports the mood and telepathic premise. Details like the damp air vibrating “like a held breath” are well-chosen and POV-inflected. The setting frames and amplifies the emotional exchange, especially in the final image, but it doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or options. Still, the specificity and integration with tone are well above average.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Helix Maze is vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory work (“blooming withering,” fermentation, new buds) that feels filtered through a working gardener’s eye. The environment meaningfully constrains tactics: high walls, the narrow shaft of light, and the placement of the vine on the stone wall all enable the marble’s focused effect. World rules (the luck meter, long-lived maze, political churn) remain consistent and unobtrusively embedded. The final image of the maze continuing its paradoxical cycle charges the thematic closure rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station, stratospheric altitude, bruised sky, and tethered gantries are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action. Environmental specifics (thin, bitter air; biting cold; magnetic nexus alignment at twilight) constrain the experiment’s timing and Elian’s physical experience. Tools and objects—the jury-rigged array, prism lenses, lever, and finally the wrench—anchor both the science and his identity in the final image. The setting feels lived-in and idiosyncratic without excess exposition, and it meaningfully shapes what is possible in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The flooded opera house is richly realized and never mere backdrop; water, rot, lanterns, and the sunken pit all shape what Elias can do and what he risks. The environment is used functionally—water enables the ink-alchemy, impedes movement, and conceals the metal box—while also mirroring the liminal, decayed grandeur of the story’s themes. Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias’s musical and liminal sensibility (“sunken cathedral of sound,” “purgatory of waiting”). The world’s slight supernatural rule-set (water stilled like obsidian, ink rearranging) holds consistent within this frame.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alpine station, aurora, and analog lithograph are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated into Elias’s perception and tactics. The environment is not just backdrop: the station’s optical scanners and physical console make the smudge strategy plausible and necessary, and the auroral light explicitly charges the final image. Details are economical yet atmospheric, with weather and height contributing to his isolation and burden. This is strong enough to feel publication-ready without notable setting-related slips.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly realized—the damp tunnel, abandoned tracks, and subterranean mill are described through Silas’s professional/obsessive eye and shape his tactics (navigating stress lines, minding structural weakness). The beaded valve wheel and the “thick” air of trauma both situate the scene and directly charge the final realization, so environment and object-as-setting clearly constrain meaning. Sensory detail is varied (sound of radio hiss, tactile condensation, phantom vibration in his boots) and thematically aligned. It stops just short of the absolute top band because environmental constraint remains mostly atmospheric rather than forcing a concrete physical dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: vines using books as trelliswork, fractured stone ceiling, moss carpet, and the obsidian refuge all work as more than postcard detail. Environment continually shapes perception and meaning—the overgrown library embodies slow forgetting, while the black glass hall and silent river reconfigure that decay into crystalline stasis. The recurring paper/stone/organic textures charge the final image of her watching from “the heart of the void.” This is a textbook case of atmosphere serving theme and closure rather than pausing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ridge setting is vivid and specific—the dusty plateau, sagebrush, shifting temperature, “razor-sharp” shadows—and consistently filtered through Elias’s ritualistic attention. The eclipse and environment materially shape the tactic (only during totality can the magic work) and charge the final image; without this setting/phenomenon, the story’s logic collapses. Sensory detail is strong across sight, touch, smell, and temperature and evolves with the celestial event. A slight tendency toward “poetic” description clusters in one paragraph, but it stays coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “reclaimed silo library,” “bronze quiet,” tilted room, and industrial hearth all feel textured and lived-in. World rules (displaced axis, broken magnetosphere) integrate smoothly with physical details like the slanted floor and rusted gantries. The environment meaningfully charges the imagery at the end, with the silo left on “eternal, dreamless vigil.” It rarely constrains concrete choices, though, functioning more as atmosphere than as a tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and Fresnel lens are vividly realized and integral: the room, beam, and mercury bath all directly shape Arthur’s available tactics and the final image. Occupational and technical details (lantern room, hydraulic levers, rotation governor) feel purposeful rather than decorative, grounding the climactic act. The sea and nightscape support the eerie, liminal mood without tipping into static postcard description. Setting clearly constrains what kind of “final message” he can send, which strengthens the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Dimensional Anchor, vibrating metal grating, cables, amp, and the Vantablack palette are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the action. The environment and tools meaningfully constrain tactics—this is an exorcism that could only happen with audio gear in a sealed, humming station. The charged setting pays off in the ending image, where the room’s silence shifts from oppressive to “natural, light, and breathable.” Atmospheric specificity is excellent without devolving into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Glass Spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and inseparable from the story’s premise: altitude, silence, and ice are functional constraints, not just scenery. Environmental conditions actively shape tactics (needing polished ice and perfect clarity) and charge the final image of a world turned into a seamless sphere of light. The Nautilus functioning as an acoustic tool embedded in this setting deepens the sense that place and instrument are a single apparatus. A touch more evolution of the environment across the scene (e.g., more interplay with physical risk) would nudge it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The environment is vivid, specific, and constantly active: the glowing viaduct, mist, static-charged air, and shifting stone respond to Elara’s movements. Setting directly constrains choice—the apparent void where she must turn left, the procedural bridge snapping into place, and the wet stones and puddle that anchor the final fusion image. World rules (procedural architecture from memory, fractured timelines) are consistently dramatized rather than explained. The final image of a “permanent, silent road leading home” is inseparable from the environment that has been flexing around her the entire time.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern, drums, limestone stairs, and antique equipment are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Silas’s tactile orientation, giving the piece a distinctive sensory palette. Setting is not postcard-like; the drum skins and stone actively participate in the ritual, becoming a “womb of resonance” and anchoring the final hand-on-drum image. Environmental rules (echo-dampening moss, vibration transmission) support the concept without clumsy exposition. Nearly every key beat is tied to a physical locus in the space, so the atmosphere deepens rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard at dusk, overgrown garden, brass instruments, and high walls are vividly rendered and directly shape tactics (balconies, ivy, rust patterns, risk of being silhouetted). Weather and atmosphere are integrated through Elara’s professional eye, deepening tone without feeling touristic. The city’s siege and quarantine context is more expository than dramatized, but the immediate environment does meaningful work in both action and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “cathedral of glass” greenhouse and its resurrected extinct flora are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory anxieties and professional eye. Key environmental elements—the glass floor, jagged ferns, containment unit, and moonlight—shape how the UV light and scent are perceived and charge the final image when the “crystal shadows vanished into the dark.” The setting’s logic (extinct plants revived, specialized sanctuary) holds steady and integrates gracefully with the speculative tech. This environment actively frames the stakes and thematics rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta grotto, red earth, and upper-atmosphere energy beings are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Silas’s sensibility, with strong tactile detail in the “damp, raw earth” and the sky as a “glowing ceiling.” Setting is not postcard; it directly shapes the premise (time pooling in desert recesses), enables the method (scraping clay strata), and charges the final image as he walks back under “indifferent starlight.” The rope also functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his choice. There’s little to fault, though a hint more interaction between the physical danger of the canyon and his procedure could heighten embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken orchard and ring of rusted tankers are vividly imagined and filtered through sound and touch in ways that feel organic to Elara. Setting elements actively matter: ship hull fragment for the flint, driftwood as fuel, the glass dome’s acoustics transforming into a “great, transparent cello.” The world rules (post-collapse, ash-dark, waterlogged) are consistent and charged without feeling expository. This environment strongly shapes both imagery and the closure beat, just shy of absolute top-tier only because a few descriptive flourishes verge on scenic “display” more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The amber grotto, resinous light, and cave textures create a lush, coherent atmosphere that pairs well with the alchemical/emotional premise. Sensory specificity (static on his skin, cooling air, silk rustle) is purposeful and filtered through Silas’s professional gaze. However, the grotto itself does not meaningfully constrain choices or tactics; it’s more a mood chamber than a pressure source. The final image glows, but the environment charges tone more than outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Maritime Athenaeum, open-air under the stars, with ocean wind and brass-clipped pages, is vivid and distinctive, filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The setting supports tone and theme—the harbor lights and constellations echo navigation, delivery, and enduring memory. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, but it does shape the final tableau (“chairs overlooking the harbor lights,” “as long as the stars are out”) in a way that charges the last image. A slight tightening of which details carry functional pressure vs. mere prettiness could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with strong sensory and tonal specificity, and details are filtered through Elara’s soft-vs-hard sensibility. Environment interacts with action: the glasslike terrain injures the boy, and the harsh mineral world makes her marsh reeds and hum feel charged in contrast. The arbor plus reeds in the final image powerfully reconfigure the space as shared territory, not just backdrop. It stops just short of 9-band because the setting mostly frames rather than materially constraining her tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: rooftop canals, the sleeping giant, and the vertiginous spire all materially constrain options (she must move by skiff, can only act during the nap, and the giant’s stirring directly threatens her). The rules of the world (giant’s breathing causing tides, time-freeze affecting environment but not the giant) are shown through action rather than dumped, and the grayscale frozen world is an effective atmospheric shift. The environment also charges the final image: the rooftop canals turned churning tide she rides to safety while the city “roars to life.” This is rich, purposeful worldbuilding that shapes tactics rather than sitting as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern orchard with mineral-fed trees, the solitary moon shaft, and the subterranean damp are all vividly particular and strongly filtered through Silas’s ritualistic mind. Setting is not postcard-only: the moonbeam’s angle and the subterranean isolation concretely shape how and when he can work, and the bright meadow vision gains power by contrast with the cave. The orchard as the site of both past disappearance and present experiment quietly charges every environmental detail. World rules (silver sap, mosaic shifting) feel consistent with the established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The archives, crawl spaces, vents, and flickering city form a fully inhabited, constraint-rich environment that dictates Elias’s movements and tactics. Sensory specificity is high and purposeful (the “sapphire hush,” “heavy velvet curtain that smelled of time,” the clerestory dawn) and clearly filtered through his infrastructural intimacy. The setting isn’t postcard-static; it actively shapes what’s possible (hatch placement, vent vantage, blackout cover) and charges the final exchange of glances. Environment and object-as-setting (the grid, the building’s guts) meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and functional: the Victorian greenhouse, oxygen-heavy air, storm, and mossy trellis all shape his physical experience and choices. Environmental details (hyper-oxygen, rain absorption, trellis and moss cradling his spine) are tightly tied to the metamorphosis and the thematic pivot from threat to nourishment. The recurring object-as-setting—the linden leaf—charges the final image. This is near top-tier work; a marginally more surprising or concretely grounded greenhouse detail could push it into true exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Needle, the toxic sea, the exposed subway tunnel, and the rising tide are vivid, specific, and mechanically involved in the action (the rain channels dictate his path; the tide threatens to reclaim the convergence). The filtration straw, brooch, and island isolation function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. World rules (water wars, toxicity, thirst economy) are efficiently embedded in sensory and spatial detail rather than infodumped. This is publish-ready atmosphere with strong functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The musical crystal cave and Singing Geode are vividly rendered (bioluminescent quartz, harmonic vibrations) and strongly tied to tone and mechanism: the geometry of light and shadow in this specific space enables the forces’ entry. The cave is not just a backdrop; its “bright darkness” and singing crystals echo and charge the final image of the glowing pearl in deepened shadow. Sensory detail is predominantly visual and auditory but purposeful rather than touristic. The only ceiling is that environmental constraint on choice could be pushed even further for absolute top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    The post-storm Ivory Harbor, slick stones, lighthouse base, and steam-driven annunciator are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action; environment and tool (the harbor machinery) genuinely constrain what Elian can do. Weather and wetness affect both atmosphere and the physicality of sound traveling through stone and fog. The valve and manifold function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image and are inseparable from the resolution. Minor reason for not going higher is that the wider world rules of this society remain mostly gestured at rather than fully textured, appropriate but not maximal at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, from “ozone” in the New Year streets to the rusted train yard and the “starlit vault in mist.” The environment constrains and enables choices: dead streetlights and the fog mark the threshold; the ravine forces the invention of the staircase; the crystalline vault shapes how truths are stored and confronted. Details are filtered through Elara’s geometric, pattern-driven attention, keeping description character-specific rather than touristic. The world rules (phantom punch, floating platforms) feel consistent within the dream-logic established.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tower above the crashing ocean, the wind, and the whale migration create a vivid, atmospheric setting that is tightly interwoven with theme. Details like the open arches, scattered star charts, and the altitude above the surf are specific and recur meaningfully, especially with the whales’ vibration merging with the memories. The environment mostly charges image and mood rather than constraining physical choice, which keeps it just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prismatic escondite between seconds, the solar storm, and the pocket dimension’s “spatial mutiny” are vividly rendered and consistently integrated into action, not just described. Environmental behavior (walls warping, floor turning to a glass sea, radiation pressure) directly constrains his options and escalates the ritual, culminating in the sanctuary’s destruction as the universe “tries to excise the cancer.” World rules—radiation, magnetic fields, dimensional fabric—are clear enough and stay internally consistent in a lyric mode. The environment also charges the final image, as the storm finally breaches and becomes the agent of his physical unmaking.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered—stainless tables, embalming sink, chemical warmth—establishing a strong, coherent atmosphere that supports the “deathly vitality” tone. Details feel filtered through Julian’s occupational familiarity, so the space doesn’t read like a generic catalog. However, the environment largely functions as mood rather than a constraint on action; the outcome would be nearly identical in another closed, clinical room. The ink pot, as a micro-setting/object, does more to charge the final image than the broader environment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bonsai mountaintop, fluorescent lamp, dawn sky, and silence of the sleeping town create a striking, coherent atmosphere that feels singular and lived-in. Setting is tightly woven into action—the bonsai shadows mimicking a phantom skyline and the altitude/silence enabling the work. Tools and environment (lamp, prism, flat stone, humidity, stars) actively shape her tactics rather than functioning as backdrop. The final image of her on the sunlit mountaintop with the charged page is deeply colored by this setting, giving it lasting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The port of towering containers, cranes, and tides is concretely rendered and tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, giving the setting both physical texture and emotional charge. The rising and falling tides, moving cranes, and “metal canyons” subtly shape time and mood, and the final image of the label in a crack amid lapping water feels grounded in that environment. This is not mere backdrop; the industrial maze and its debris are the story’s very medium. The only thing holding it just below the highest band is that the environment rarely constrains choice in a hard, tactical way—it mainly inflects meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory on a cliff, collapsing sky, half-finished cello, and painted seashell create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly matches the conceptual aims. Details are selective and purposeful—the unvarnished wood, flaking paint, grey static—rather than touristic. The micro-setting (instrument + shell) functions as an environment that literally channels and distorts truth, charging the final image as the shell sheds paint and the observatory walls fold inward. The broader environment doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, but it meaningfully frames his isolation and vocation as an observer at the end of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft city carnival is vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory texture (“stale popcorn,” “marine diesel,” neon on ink-black water). Setting actively constrains and enables choices: the city’s floatation and modular barges make the reorganization plot plausible, while calliope music masks the groaning pivot. The foundation stone chip functions as a micro-setting anchor that literally defines the legal center and charges the final act. A slight further evolution of how weather or water conditions complicate the operation could deepen the already-strong integration.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lunar environment is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Elias’s purpose: sodium-lit colony below, jagged ridge, freezing vacuum, drones, and the orbital mirrors all constrain his behavior. Details like the chemical strip, pressure suit, and regolith fractures feel both plausible and narratively relevant rather than touristic. The setting directly shapes tactics (no radar, no timers, extreme cold, elevation for the shot) and charges the final image of natural dawn versus artificial “sterile glare.” The recurring objects (camera, sand grain, strip) function as micro-settings and help power the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the mist-coated rail depot, brass-and-glass kiosk, laminar-flow crystal basins, and the soundscape of the airship all create a rich, coherent atmosphere. Details are well filtered through the premise (a blind mechanic using touch and sound), and the environment evolves—engines roar, anchors lift, shadows move. While the depot does not heavily constrain physical choices, ambient elements like the thrumming launch and reverberations do shape the temporal pressure and mood. Overall, the world feels lived-in and original without tipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The outpost, frozen lake, and heavy stillness are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Silas’s perceptions, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental specifics (rusted sill, rime frost, freezing pane, shifting ice like artillery) do more than decorate; they build unease and make the condensation phenomenon plausible and charged. The cold glass and abandoned, sealed space are structurally necessary for the central image and realization. While the setting doesn’t dramatically constrain his tactical options, it clearly charges the final image and underwrites the story’s mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient archway, cobblestones, gray noon light, and approaching storm create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The archway’s groaning and then humming directly track the stakes and outcome of Silas’s actions, effectively using environment as barometer and constraint. The tuning fork and stones together act as a micro-setting system that charges the final image of the “stones held” under his watch. World rules are consistent enough for this magical-realism frame and are learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater temple and quartz dome are vividly rendered with specific, sensorial detail (bioluminescent algae, brass and obsidian altar, coral-encrusted cables) and always tied to action. Environment constrains her choices—depth, pressure, invasive coral, and the need to physically disentangle cables all directly shape tactics and stakes, and the temple’s lonesome splendor charges the final image of her “glorious tomb.” A minor reservation is that some descriptive density verges on luxuriant, but it rarely stalls momentum and remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef, under “copperlight repose,” is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elian’s perception. Setting is not decorative: the reef causes the wreck, the prison’s geometry “sustains impossibilities,” and the chamber’s light and stone directly enable the metaphysical exit. The lattice, light, and impossible architecture converge in the final image to charge the escape with atmosphere and meaning. World rules are strange but coherent within the piece’s own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vividly realized: the contrast between the “biting frost” outside and the humid, venomous greenhouse creates a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like plants that “leaned toward his body heat” and briars that “bowed in her presence” integrate environment with character and status. The endless night and alchemical orchard concept feel specific rather than generic Gothic dressing. Still, the greenhouse rarely constrains tactics or forces choices beyond general wariness; it’s more atmospheric than functionally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the tidal city, red canyon walls, and “submerged metropolis” function as more than backdrop, directly shaping what’s possible (she can only work when the sea drains and the stone is exposed). Environmental details—the jagged rim, slick stone, vertical city, orchid solace humidity—are sensorially rich and filtered through Elara’s task. The world’s rules (architecture as tidal clock, kelp-steel thread petrifying in air) are consistent and learned via her actions. The canyon’s fissure physically constrains her movement and frames the final image, charging the scar with spatial and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly and economically rendered, with roots threading bones, damp earth, and filtered light forming a coherent, tactile space. Setting is not mere backdrop: the roots dictate her path, the fissure of light enables the sundial’s function, and the orchard’s vertical axis (sky–tree–root–bone) directly charges the final image of reconnection. Environmental details evolve in step with her actions (from exploration to reconstruction to activation) and mirror her internal shift from alienation to rootedness without feeling forced. The world feels both strange and plausible, with consistent rules.

    The setting is vividly and economically realized: the Golden Arcade, the ghostly holograms, drones, chalk-coded promenade, and brass chute all feel coherent and lived-in. Details are consistently filtered through Elian’s bias toward the tactile and obsolete, and the environment—particularly the physical mail chute and surveillance-saturated city—embodies the story’s core tension between analog privacy and digital control. Objects like the clipboard and the chute charge the final image and thematically constrain choice, even if they don’t produce overt action obstacles. World rules (AIs ignoring surface mail, chalk as camouflage) are clear and stable without resorting to clumsy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt observatory, meteorite stone, high-altitude vines, and colorless flame create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this world and to Lysa’s vocation. Setting details are well filtered through mood—the wind and resonance, the autumn signaling endings—and recur meaningfully at the end with the howling outside and shaking glass. The environment supports tone and theme more than it constrains concrete choices; Lysa’s actions would mostly function in another suitably mystical workspace. That slight lack of tactical constraint keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, ramshackle houseboat, and window condensation are vividly rendered and strongly tonal, with good sensory variety (humid air, temperature drop, visual gloom, tactile stone). Setting is integrated into action: the swamp journey frames the threshold, the houseboat’s interior shelves of unsent letters literalize the theme, and the window plus moonlight-charged shard drive the ritual and closure image. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices beyond mood and access, but the recurring objects-as-setting (shard, window) sharply charge the final beats. A slight tendency toward lush description nudges it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanatorium atrium, saline mist, and ocean are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elias’s perception, giving the scene a strong, unified atmosphere. The brain coral functions as micro-setting/recurring object, charging the final image and concretizing his mental state. Environmental details (mist against glass, hum of filtration) mirror and modulate the emotional temperature without feeling like a tourist catalog. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it effectively frames and deepens the internal action.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a standout strength: the ruined orchard and clinging fog are sensorially vivid and narratively functional. The fog-as-emulsion idea directly shapes her method and charges the final image of the fading light cathedral. The fresco fragment and studio also form an effective micro-setting loop between dream and waking. World rules (light-painting, knowledge network in roots) are consistently applied and filtered through Elara’s artistic mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Sound Wave Garden is strikingly specific—concave steel petals, polished parabolas—and the acoustic geometry is not just decorative but mechanically drives the plot. The mural-world and boxcar settings are quickly sketched yet vivid, with tactile and olfactory details (“smell of iron and stale tobacco”) that differentiate realities. The garden’s physical rules (reflection, resonance) constrain what can happen, culminating in Elian becoming the sound wave itself. A bit more evolution of the garden during/after the resonance would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is richly evoked—the humid air, wet loam, pheromones—and its properties (insect noise, turbine, glass ceiling) materially shape tactics and the climax. Setting details are filtered through stakes (noise to foil scanners, turbine as amplifier) rather than as static description. The world rule of thought taxation is consistently embedded via sensory markers like the throbbing temples and mental ledger. The final image of walking through the warped greenhouse “a free man in a world of broken calculators” feels inseparable from this environment and its tools.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gargantuan shell and later overgrown interior are vividly rendered and deeply entwined with mood and action: its acoustics carry the lullaby-magic, its walls receive the vines, and its transformation from tomb to cradle mirrors the internal shift. Details like “reef-shadow joy,” “pearlescent walls,” and weather systems inside the shell give the environment specificity without feeling like a static tour. The setting also charges the final image: a once-sterile cosmic husk is now a breathing jungle that shelters his new stance toward grief. This integration of place, ritual, and closure feels fully deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Opal Library above the clouds is vividly rendered and meaningfully constraining: altitude, wind, and “condensed atmosphere” directly dictate methods (acoustic repair instead of adhesive) and risks. The setting is filtered through Elian’s professional eye (orchids grown from “accumulated breath of history”), preventing tourist-list description. Environmental features evolve with the action—the fracture is “a wound in the air,” the repaired chime rebalances the space, and the final image of names raining down depends on the vertical geography. This integration of world rules, tone, and stakes is very strong and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Extinct Language Archive and the Veritas Aeterna ink are vividly realized and tightly integrated into action, not just backdrop. The environment meaningfully constrains choices: they are in a space where dead languages and dangerous truth-magic are physically stored, making Elara’s tactic both plausible and risky. Objects like the glass ink well and floating script evolve from atmospheric detail to pivotal tools that charge the final bridge image. Sensory specificity (hums, spectrums of violet and “dangerous gold”) supports a cohesive, uncanny atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action: thermal expansion, “the building breathes,” and shifting walls directly constrain timing and tactics. Environmental details (glow-lamp, subterranean vapor, masonry arches, vents) feel filtered through a machinist’s eye rather than touristic description. The setting meaningfully shapes options, especially the narrow window when expansion allows the ruse to work and masks the sabotage. The world rules are consistent and learned through use, not exposition, with only minor risk of sensory overload in the density of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The attic and bookshop environment are vivid and specific, with smell, light, and dust motes all deeply filtered through Elian’s sensibility. Setting actively shapes tactics: the skylight, drafts, and dust-mote mapping govern when Aero can fly, making the micro-setting function as an instrument. The vintage attic also tonally aligns with “blooming withering,” charging the final shared listening with a sense of fragile, curated decay. World rules (pigeons, capsule, attic drafts) stay internally consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “drifting prism terrace,” translucent floor, and suspended world-remnants are vivid, specific, and thematically aligned with fragmentation and collapsed distances. The mahogany desk functions as both locus of action and symbolic map of pre-shattered time, directly feeding the central revelation. Setting details are well-filtered through Elara’s perspective and return meaningfully in the final image as she steps back into that “hush.” While the environment does not physically constrain tactics much, it strongly charges the choices and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater research facility and surrounding abyss are vividly realized—“vertical abyss,” rusted corridors, pressure, and bioluminescent ostracods all feel sensorially and conceptually integrated. The environment is not just backdrop; the lack of visible constellations and the crushing dark are the very conditions that make this re-mapping of “stars” possible, charging the final image of a “living galaxy” around the dome. The station’s abandonment and rust subtly underscore themes of ruin and repurposed light. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that reinforces rather than distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The geode, violet quartz, phantom sea-foam, and refracted light are richly specific and tightly integrated into the action—the foam is the projection medium, the quartz wall becomes the implied gateway, and the geode itself is ultimately revealed as an inhabited graveyard. Detail selection feels character-filtered and tonally apt, never like a tourist catalog. The environment constrains options (she must work within the boundaries of foam, crystal, and light), and the final realization that she’s surrounded by “billions of trapped, happy souls” reweights the setting with a strong, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Tidal Arcade is vividly rendered—rotting wood, neon, sucking mud, and rising tide all create a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tide’s vibration is a functional plot device that triggers the entire chain, and the hybrid of salt and circuitry mirrors the story’s theme of ordered randomness. Spatial relations (railing, can, machine, surf) remain clear and are tactically used by Elias. This integration of environment with action and tone is close to publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The domed city, synthetic atmosphere, bioluminescent hedges, and false constellations are vivid and specific, creating a memorable, coherent world. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics: she must hide from drones, uses gaps in the energy shield, and the sterile stillness contrasts with the storm-torn coast she seeks. The moonstone stylus and her own body function as micro-settings charged with history and constraint. At times the descriptive density edges toward indulgent, but it remains legible and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor, the mist, Pearl Bay at dawn, the tidal pool, and the glass atrium are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Silas’s eye for surfaces and light. Setting is not postcard; dawn timing, tide-turning, and the reflective pool directly enable his method of seeking guidance and the climactic refracted-light “cathedral.” Environmental evolution (mist thinning, sun breaching, colors igniting) mirrors the internal shift without feeling mechanically symbolic. A slight overabundance of atmospheric phrasing is the only thing holding this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Blackwood Divide, burn zone, moonlight, and biting wind are vivid and consistently filtered through a firefighter’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The ridge and sky explicitly charge the ending—the moonlight catching soot and the stars “receiving” his translated pain—so environment deeply inflects the final image. Details like “narrow artery of silver dust” and “trees stood like blackened monuments” are specific and purposeful rather than generic. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it powerfully frames and amplifies the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tide-polished grotto, electromagnetic ocean, and multiverse-reflective walls are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elian’s sensibility. Setting is not just backdrop: the cave’s mirrors of parallel timelines ground the stakes and visually externalize the threat of stagnation, while the returning waves and revived moss charge the final image. Tools-as-micro-setting (the altitude gauge, balloon) are well integrated into the environment and world rules feel internally consistent. Though the grotto doesn’t tightly constrain his options, it meaningfully frames and reweights the action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: ivy-veiled passage, moss-muffled footsteps, roofless gray-sky library, and the preserved hearth all reinforce decay, abandonment, and memory. Details are filtered through Elias’s acoustic/empathic lens, so environment and tools (sonic emitter, clicker, ivy light) feel character-specific rather than touristic. The hearth and library concretely host the key discoveries and the ivy-filtered light charges the film-glimpse image at the end. The environment could constrain his choices a bit more (e.g., structural danger, weather) rather than functioning primarily as atmosphere and container.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly drawn and strongly integrated: wet stone, lilac, and the prism parapet are not just atmospheric but functional to the magic and its disruption by the bell. Spatial and sensory choreography are clear and purposeful, and the echoing terrace plus spring rain plausibly shape acoustics and refraction. Environmental details subtly mirror the internal situation (twilight, indigo light, transient droplets) without becoming heavy-handed. The final empty terrace with lingering rain scent nicely recharges prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ancient terrace, cracked stone, mosaics, smoking ruins, heat, and twin moons all shape tone and constraint. The celestial interference and violet light materially affect what is possible (no heavy weapons, ticking clock) and charge the ritual moment. Details like night-blooming jasmine mixed with cordite deepen the atmosphere and mirror the thematic blend of beauty and violence. Spatial and sensory anchors remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the salt flat as “broken porcelain,” the map of fissures, the geothermal vents—and it clearly constrains what he can do (how he travels, where the egg can survive). Environmental detail is tightly filtered through his sensibility as creator-destroyer of this landscape. Weather and terrain both shape and charge key choices, especially his selection of the fissure and the near-impossibility of the egg’s survival. The final image of white salt cradling the blue egg is both spatially clear and thematically loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Silver Courtyard under unmelted snow, the bone-deep chill, and the Prism Sanctuary full of swirling echoes create a vivid, specific environment that is tightly integrated with tone and stakes. The silent, frozen setting meaningfully contrasts with and charges the final image where sound and motion blast the snow away and tear through the enforced serenity. Details are filtered through Elara’s experience (robes like spilled ink, magical knot as tangled yarn), and the world’s rules feel consistent for the length. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the physical environment constrains mood more than it constrains concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The decommissioned radar dome and single swinging bulb are strongly atmospheric and integrated with the acoustic “echo” motif, amplifying silence and charging the final image. Details like curved tiles, concrete floor, and the pendulum bulb are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The environment shapes tone more than tactics—Silas’s choices would mostly be the same in another dark, resonant space—so it’s thematically charged but not deeply constraining. Still, the dome’s listening/echo quality nicely mirrors the story’s concern with what does and doesn’t “happen” in narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “verdant grotto above the clouds” is vividly rendered and consistently exploited: isolation, altitude, dampness for the friction hitch, the abyss below, and the changing sky colors all shape mood and meaning. The environment’s properties (moisture affecting the knot, wind threatening the structure, the absence of sufficient milkweed) directly constrain what can happen and charge the final image of collapse. Detail selection feels purposeful rather than touristic, with atmospheric elements mirroring the emotional and thematic stakes. This is nearly exemplary setting work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound sanctum under the aurora is vivid, atmospheric, and tightly integrated with the action: the architecture focuses celestial energy that literally powers the furnace. Details like the frost-stiff ceremonial rope and the open roof under churning lights feel specific and lived-in rather than generic. The environment actively constrains and enables choices (he must work with this rope in this sanctum to melt the bronze). The final image is charged by the contrast between cold world and the warm resonance of the bronze plate.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vine-choked bunker in a rewilded forest is rendered with lush, specific sensory detail—roots in concrete, ozone and rot, storm light like bruises. Setting is not just backdrop: the encroaching forest, storm, and decaying infrastructure make the bunker’s supposed safety obviously untenable and frame the lever-pull as opening to an already-claimed world. Environmental textures evolve with the pressure (hum → shrieking wind → anticipated flooding) and charge the stakes of the final act. The world feels internally consistent and tonally aligned with the story’s concerns about entropy and obsolete control.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reimagined Babylonian setting is vivid and specific—blue-glazed corridors, obsidian floor, brass gears, ziggurat height, ozone in the air—and consistently filtered through a practical astronomer’s eye. Environment shapes the action: he must reach the high observatory, use the sky’s alignment, and act while the city and palace transition between rulers. The palace and observatory feel physically navigated, not just “touristed,” and details like sacred oil and torches underline thematic frugality and decline. Setting could constrain a tactical choice one notch more, but it already strongly charges the final darkness and star-order.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Soundless Sanctuary is vivid and conceptually integrated: the nullified sound directly dictates tactics (no speech, requiring cellular memory), and the shifting geometry and violet cosmos mirror Kaelen’s inner upheaval. Environmental rules stay consistent and are revealed through action (the silent scream, the liquid floor). The recurring physical transformation of space (mercury floor, glass walls) charges the final image and reinforces the theme of mutable structures. Another small notch would require the environment to impose a more direct, tactical constraint beyond silence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly and consistently rendered: the fog-pressed orchard, freezing mud, twilight frost, and glasslike atmosphere all interlock with the story’s core concept. Environmental constraints (the need to plant his boots, the dangerous fog, the specific twilight shimmer) directly shape his tactics. The glass motif charges the final image—the whole world turned to “brilliant, hard light” and ringing like a crystal bell—with real conceptual weight. Detail density is high but generally purposeful and filtered through Silas’s craft-minded, glass-attuned sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned cathedral overgrown with a rafters-orchard is vivid, sensorially rich, and strongly POV-filtered (“ozone and rotting pears,” “vaulted skeleton”). Setting meaningfully constrains action (perilous beams, choking roots, high rift) and the magical environment’s rules stay coherent as the breach worsens then settles. The orchard/cathedral fusion also mirrors the theme of living cycles versus petrified vows, deepening resonance without heavy-handed symbolism. A touch more spatial consequence from the architecture in the climax could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard and lonely asteroid are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elian’s unease (“radiance that felt suspiciously like radiation,” fruit humming C-sharp). Setting is not postcard: the trees answer like pages, the asteroid’s isolation and the bathroom’s sterility both shape his tactics and mental states. The orchard-as-library reveal directly charges the final image and constrains choice: pruning lives via carving. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity; the only thing keeping it below a 9-band is that environmental constraints remain mostly conceptual rather than forcing a concrete, tactical compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain-bookstore environment is vividly and economically rendered—“fossilized encyclopedias,” ink-eating flora, rejected-manuscript golem—and consistently filtered through Elara’s linguistic/botanical eye. The setting directly constrains choices (e.g., toll of knowledge, flora feeding on forgotten words, the intestinal metaphor of the Library) and the final image of the mountain’s “quiet, satisfied hum” clearly reweights the whole space. World rules (mountain as immune, taxonomy as leverage) stay coherent and are shown rather than dumped. A minor limitation is that the spatial danger of the “narrative abyss” and ascent feels more atmospheric than tactically engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned carnival ship and its interior Garden are rendered with vivid, selective specificity—rusted ferris wheel grinding backward in time, mold “blooming with rust-colored flowers,” chains holding the ship as a “monument to trapped freedom.” Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, and the environment mirrors and amplifies her internal state without feeling like blunt allegory. The recurring contrasts of green (swatch card, verdant mold) against monochrome fog and decay charge the final image of her pocketing the card and walking away. The only thing keeping this just under the very top band is that the environment rarely constrains concrete tactics beyond mood and the narrative-thread trick.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The clock tower mechanism room, brass gears, and the ceremonial rope create a vivid, integrated environment that feels specific and lived-in. Setting isn’t decorative: the frozen instant, the disconnected “engine of history,” and the bell of the present directly embody and constrain the problem and its solution. The rope as a recurring, transformed object carries the final charge once the wax seal dissolves into it. World rules remain consistent and are learned through on-page interaction rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Harmonic Caves and frozen subterranean lake are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with plot—sound, stone, ice, and temperature all matter to how the conflict is fought. The environment constrains tactics (retreating to the coldest recess, reading fissures as “script,” using the cave’s resonance) rather than serving as a backdrop. Sensory detail (ozone stink, thin air, phosphorescent stone) is selective and filtered through Elara’s professional lens. The final image of heavy, almost material silence pressing on her skin shows the setting reweighted as both weapon and sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Glass Humming Pavilion, with its subsonic vibration, transparent floor, and rusted world beneath, is vivid and functionally integrated into every major move. The environment constrains tactics (maintenance ladder, brass cradle, cloud-choked sky) and charges the final image of a lance of light punching through the long-blocked clouds. Details are purposeful and filtered through Elara’s perception as a custodian and retrocognitive, not as a neutral camera. The pavilion and sky conditions are inseparable from both the mechanics of the plot and its emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and tightly integrated: “stormlit observatory,” “cloud-stone,” and the crystal forecourt that releases buried voices all feel lived-in and rule-consistent. Environmental features materially shape the scene: rare, complex rain unlocks memory; the solidified atmosphere justifies the shadow-divination method; altitude and isolation charge her solitude and burden. The recurring summer-quill and unmoving cloudscape culminate in a final image where the environment and tool explicitly charge the ending. A slight trimming of descriptive density in early paragraphs could give even more weight to the later, key images.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptionally rich: the “Blooming Fortress,” wild thyme, stone lions strangled by ivy, and the starless sky all feel tactile and thematically charged. Environmental factors like humidity directly affect his tactics, tying world detail to action. The overgrown fortress and floral imagery recur in the firework shapes, giving a coherent visual logic. It falls just short of the very highest band because the environment rarely constrains him under real pressure—it deepens mood more than it alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto, tide pool, and constellations are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s professional eye, with details like the starfish detaching and the Milky Way in the water doing thematic work. The setting doesn’t physically constrain choices much, but it deeply shapes perception and the metaphoric palette that leads to her acceptance. The recurring water and tide imagery charge the final “tide brings new things” lines with more than postcard atmosphere. A tiny pullback is that at times description flirts with decorative excess rather than pure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Xenial Trellis above the cloud layer, the bruised-purple sky, and the buoyant atmosphere under inversion are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment meaningfully shapes the action: the height, inversion, and living metal vines all constrain what she can do and charge the visuals of her floating ritual and heavy return. The recurring trellis as “gracious host” nicely doubles as a safety net and quasi-sacred site. Description is rich but mostly purposeful, avoiding generic sky imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drifting prism terrace, thin ether, and crystal vessel are vividly imagined and tightly integrated with the rules about sound and fragility. Environmental constraints (noise shattering glass, altitude where “thoughts become dangerously loud”) tangibly shape tactics and options. The storm glass’s interaction with the terrace lattice, and the final kaleidoscopic light image, charge the ending. A touch less decorative metaphor and a touch more tactile, non-visual detail would push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The world-building is vivid and specific: neon city, kaleidoscopic waterfall, chrome orchard, acid-scarred wall, and holographic mural all feel textured and coherent. Setting is not mere backdrop—the waterfall must be traversed, the orchard and wall house the mechanism, and the sunrise through the waterfall charges the final image. Details are filtered enough through Elara’s task-focus that they don’t read like a tourist catalog. A slightly tighter link between environmental danger (e.g., structural collapse, toxic atmosphere) and her on-page tactics could push this into truly elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ashen, starlit sanctuary is vivid and consistent, with concrete images (“forest turned to charcoal,” “ash that coated the ground like winter snow”) that feel lived-in rather than decorative. Crucially, the environment and the ring-as-object function as a micro-setting constraint: the burnt ground, fading threshold, and the ring in her lap together shape what choices feel possible. The final image—ring dropped into ash, threshold gone—shows the setting charging the closure rather than serving as backdrop. The only thing holding this just shy of higher is that the physical environment doesn’t much alter tactics beyond the symbolic threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered and tonally integral, from “indigo heartbeat” to the mycelium “humming with anxiety,” and it gives concrete stakes (the ecosystem might be flattened). Setting isn’t just postcard; the mycelium center determines where he stands and what’s at risk, and the mushrooms’ flare at the end acts as atmospheric closure. World rules about concepts becoming physical are consistent and shown rather than explained. It falls just shy of 9 because the environment shapes what must be protected more than it constrains what tactics are possible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and selective—“sepia reading room,” “swirling dust-motes,” “horn-rimmed acoustic device,” “curved mahogany walls”—and consistently filtered through Elian’s focused, reverent attention. Crucially, the room’s shape and materials (a “giant resonant chamber”) and the device’s construction directly constrain his tactics and enable the outcome, satisfying the environment-as-constraint gate. Atmosphere and worldbuilding (Imperial Archives, First Ascendant’s machine) are dense but not touristic; each detail either supports tone or mechanics. This is near top-tier work for this length, with no major extraneous description.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and integral: regret-fed glass trees, lead-and-silver bark, and the starless void all shape the rules by which the ritual works and the pod exists. Details are purposeful (regret in the soil, glass leaves, alchemical alignments) rather than decorative, and they evolve as reality shifts. The greenhouse and central tree concretely constrain action: he must move in relation to the trees, reach the bough, and manipulate the physical fastener. Atmosphere and world-building feel inseparable from character and theme, elevating the piece substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the file room, dust stratigraphy, and war-ruptured foster system all inflect what Elias notices and what he can do. The environment (especially the dust) is not just backdrop but an investigative tool that shapes his tactics and literally enables the discovery. The small, charged objects (box, file, envelope, button) are handled in tactile, concrete ways that align with his archivist’s eye. This atmosphere of fluorescent, bureaucratic quiet powerfully supports the theme without tipping into mere spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: broadcast towers, drone-patrolled streets, the puddle-map trick, and the Auric Lagoon all feel vivid and specific. Environment directly shapes tactics (the puddles as navigation, submerged causeway, toxic yet concealing lagoon) and charges the final image of her standing in golden, polluted water as the city’s light changes. World rules stay consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition. The atmosphere of toxic beauty and artificial civic harmony strongly supports the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto, fog, bioluminescent moss, and prism atrium are richly and specifically rendered, and they evolve with the action (colors becoming “quietly vivid,” shadows deepening as the hush thickens). The setting is not mere backdrop; the mist, damp, and strange light contribute to the ritual’s tone and to the final dimming after resolution. However, the environment only lightly constrains tactics—Elias’s choices would be similar in another sealed chamber, so the world feels atmospherically indispensable more than mechanically so. Still, the micro-setting does effectively charge the final image of him vanishing into the gloom.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly and economically realized, with the fungus shelves, star-moss, drifting ash, and canopy detritus all integrated into Silas’s work and ritual. World rules (the hush, the arbor’s magic, falling leaves as messages) are conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps. Environment directly charges the final image, where ash visually transforms into something like snow against the glow of the sapling. The specificity and tactile quality of the setting markedly elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean greenhouse and waterfall are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (“dry, rustling blizzard,” “smell of wet decomposition”), and the geography is clear. Setting consistently constrains action: distance to the pillar, black water, slick rock, and dangling vines all shape his tactics and options. The broken glass structure and sunken garden add atmosphere without confusion, and the waterfall/rock/vine constellation materially determines the climactic swing. This is rich, purposeful scene-setting that fully supports pressure and theme, only shy of the very top tier in subtlety of environmental-symbolic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-washed foundry, storm, crucible, and furnace are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and action—the gold literally hangs in the air where Julian broke reality. Environmental details like the storm-battered iron doors and “ionic residue” of magic support the tone and world rules without feeling like a tourist catalog. The foundry constrains the scene into a workable, tactile stage for a single ritual rather than a backdrop. The setting charges the final image but doesn’t quite become an active obstacle or resource that forces tactical change, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting of Echo Gorge is vivid and purposeful: mist that smells of “old regrets,” acoustic anomalies, and spectral confessions all support the premise and Elian’s tactics. The ravine’s echoing nature makes the misaligned harp and the confessions feel organic rather than decorative. Environment and atmosphere evolve with the action (cold pressure, rising mist, then a lightened gorge), mirroring the conflict’s progression. The setting stops just short of directly constraining specific tactical choices beyond sound-based methods, which keeps it from the very top band.

    The Ultraviolet Forest is sharply realized through specific, often synesthetic detail (ozone and burnt sugar air, screaming radiation, teeth-aching frequencies). Setting is not decorative; it dictates the mask, the penance, and the final clearing where “violet light coalesced into a beam of pure, geometric silence.” The environment literally constrains his tactics (filtration unit, needing to reach the brightest sector) and deeply charges the final image of him as a “component of the forest.” World rules remain consistent and are learned through his embodied experience, not dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Alchemist’s Market and the soot-blackened canvas are vivid, sensorial, and particular, with sulfur and lavender, rope bridges, and high wooden platforms creating a distinct vertical world. The lighthouse lens operates as a tool-object that both structures the magic system and charges the final cooling-image in his hand. Environmental details like the inexplicable wind at the climax meaningfully interact with the metaphysical act rather than serving as mere backdrop. The market itself could pressure choices more directly, but the setting is nonetheless strongly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The circus ticket office is richly and specifically rendered—peeling wallpaper, tarnished gilding, murals, dust patterns—and all of it is filtered through Elias’s technical, haunted gaze. Setting is not just backdrop: the office conceals the stage lift, the dust is diagnostic, the cracks in plaster widen with the building’s movement, and the ceiling itself becomes the locus of revelation. The atmosphere of faded spectacle and decay strongly supports tone and theme. Environment clearly charges the final image of the “descending truth,” meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Glass Orchard Library, cloud-sea, crystal trees, and frost-as-fingerprint of the “old universe” are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action rather than dumped as lore. Environment actively constrains and enables choices (he must find flawed frost within a curated climate; the library’s glass architecture makes rupture visually and physically consequential). The final image of shards raining into the abyss charges earlier details and underscores the thematic loss of safe, negotiable space. World rules feel consistent and legible despite their surreal nature.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the “baroque asteroid,” museum-world decay, and visible Time storms all shape both mood and tactics (covering mirrors, channeling the chronal beam). Details feel filtered through Elian’s sensibility rather than tourist cataloging, sustaining a coherent atmosphere. World rules for visible Time and superstition around mirrors are consistent enough to support the climactic mechanism. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual would deepen texture but isn’t strictly necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Resonance Chamber, the machine, and the chip are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s craftsman sensibility, with strong sensory specificity (“tinkersong wonder,” “choir of metal birds”). The setting does real work: the chamber’s acoustics and the machine’s structure enable the harmonic shockwave that repels the Covenant of Rust. World rules around rust as metaphysical decay and the stone’s judgmental light stay consistent and are conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps. A slight overrichness of metaphor edges toward ornamental at times but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the factory valley, limestone descent, and subterranean lagoon are sensuously and specifically rendered, especially through smell. The environment meaningfully constrains and shapes events—the iron-rich hills breaking the compass, the narrow crevice descent, the lagoon as the necessary medium for the ritual. World rules around “hinged awakenings” and industrial pollution versus ancient geology feel internally consistent. The final image—carrying a vial of the world’s “breath” back to a steam-ruled surface—is charged by accumulated environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly particular—storm-lashed Atlantic cliffs, a decaying archway, the throbbing magnetic generator—and every major object (generator, archway, storm itself) constrains tactics and enables the resolution. The prose filters environment through Elara’s artistic and practical sensibilities, so details feel both atmospheric and functional. The projected phantom map on sea spray is a striking, earned culmination of prior environmental specifics. It falls just short of the very top band because some description edges toward luxuriant for the pace, but it remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Amber Pavilion, amber glass, melting winter outside, and the salvaged cathedral window are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the amber glass and antique window literally condition what she can perceive, and the pavilion’s artificial autumn versus real thaw greatly charge the final image of her painting the hush of shadows. Sensory detail stays purposeful and thematically aligned. This is close to top-tier scene-grounding for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly imagined and filtered through Elara’s perception: the *Mnemosyne*, scorched equator, and especially the obsidian lagoon create a strong, specific atmosphere. Crucially, the environment constrains tactics—the psychic static and heat make speech impossible, forcing the debris-message workaround—and the lagoon’s transformation at the end charges the final image. Sensory detail (heat, mirage distortion, boiling fluid) works in service of mood and stakes rather than as decorative tourism. This is a major strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: Paper-lantern Cove, spectral lanterns over unmoving water, ruined coastline, and ghostly town architecture all reinforce the post-wish void and her isolation. Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s priorities (the lanterns’ refusal to burn out, the emptiness of windows) and tonally support the themes of persistence vs. oblivion. The amber bottle as a designed vessel for concepts is a strong micro-setting/tool that directly charges the final image. The physical environment doesn’t much constrain tactics beyond requiring solitude, or this might push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper, smog sea below, and oily cistern rich with star-blossom nectar are vividly specific and filtered through Vane’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard: the cistern’s dense fluid is structurally crucial (“the fluid becomes the needle”), enabling the central action. Environmental tone—the plush, suffocating silence—echoes and amplifies the narrative’s end-of-era mood. World rules (foghorn, oath-scribing, preservation practice) feel internally consistent despite their strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integrated: glass ribs held by deep freeze, the suspended birth-struggle of the hatchling, the vault as “earth’s womb,” and the granular, time-textured stone all feel distinct and purposeful. Environmental conditions (flash-frost welding the vault, cold threatening the last sanctuary, the atrium’s ice-glass geometry) directly shape what must be done and how. The micro-setting of the vault and its jars then refocuses the scale at the end in a way that charges the final pea image. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual description over other senses is the only real limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary above the clouds, the wind, ice, and archaic bell-frame are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through his professional eye and spiritual unease. Setting directly constrains choice—the mountain’s anomalous stillness and the exposed parapet make the siren blast feel like a sacrilege, charging the decision. The recurring rope, stone, and electronics create a micro-setting that fuses old and new and culminates in the final image of the rope’s gentle swing. A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the “forgotten silver needle” of the station, the dim corridors, and the observation deck all feel tactile and lived-in while matching the contemplative tone. Details like the station’s hum, the “obsidian viewports,” and the shard of lantern glass filter the cosmos through Elara’s sensibility rather than reading as tourist catalog. The environment and recurring object charge the final image: the outpost as altar, the dust as “holy ash,” and the glass as a personal relic that shapes how she sees the universe. While the station doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it continually inflects perception and meaning in a way that feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned apiary in a scorched wasteland is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: petrified honeycomb, stacked supers, and the dead Queen’s hive all inform Elias’s altar and the honey metaphor at the end. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it structures his ritual, channels the sun’s light through the stained glass, and charges the final comparison of stories to honey sealed in comb. World rules—ghost visibility, Veil tearing—are conveyed economically through setting rather than exposition dumps. The sensory focus is heavily visual but purposeful in a story about mute, visual “screaming.”

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Emerald Silo and the post-mathematical world are vividly and economically realized (“toxic green skyline,” “zero” as a hum, walls that nauseatingly shift). Setting is not mere backdrop: environmental instability and illogical storms define the problem, and the silo’s lights and glass literally reconfigure at the urn’s touch, charging the final image. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s temporal preoccupations, keeping the atmosphere coherent. A slight excess of conceptual description over tactile navigation keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lagoon, sky, and post-storm shoreline are vividly rendered with specific, sensorial detail (“cobalt,” “bruised purple,” driftwood, reeds) that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting is tightly bound to action: the lagoon literally provides the “ink,” the feather bridges water and air, and the final mirror-like water holding the kite’s image charges the last image. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned through practice rather than exposition. The atmosphere of heavy, post-storm stillness meaningfully underpins the thematic work on discord and harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the “temple orchard set within living stone pillars” and piezoelectric nervous system are not just decoration but the machinery of the plot and final image. Environmental specificity—the jagged stairs, salt spray, mortar joints, ozone smell—grounds the magic in tactile detail. The living architecture constrains and enables tactics (warring roots vs. constricting pillars, then “battery”) and directly charges the ending as Silas leans against warm stone. It falls just short of 9+ only because the broader island context and physical risk in the environment are more suggestive than fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, rain, “bronze quiet,” sculpture path, and alien ships are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptions, avoiding generic SF backdrop. Environmental specifics (dust, pollen, overgrown statues, slick basalt) are integrated into action and inference rather than feeling like a tour. The fly amber operates as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and constrains her symbolic choice. World rules around the Visitors and the Changed remain consistent and need no extra exposition at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, specific, and integrated with action: “salt-bleached timber,” “phosphorescent buds,” and “rusted skeletons of sunken war machines” all shape tone and visualize the stakes. The environment meaningfully charges the final image as the grey water becomes “a tapestry of living emerald,” making place central to the story’s transformation. Sensory detail is varied (smell of old rain and iron, sound of birds, texture of mossy railings) and filtered through Silas’s workmanlike perspective. While the jetty doesn’t constrain his choices in a tactical sense, it is inseparable from the piece’s mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly evoked (“rusted canyons,” “metallic beast,” “scorched atmosphere”), and the environment logically explains the silence, scarcity of technology, and reverence for relics. Setting details are tightly filtered through Silas’s senses and history (the omnipresent copper tang of the war, the uselessness of his nose in a world of rust). Crucially, the small objects-as-setting—the cylinder, amber shard, and waxed leaf—constrain his tactics and charge the closing image of silence turned anticipatory. The world’s ruin directly underpins the stakes of connection and the rarity of a surviving signal, which lifts this beyond decorative worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid: the time-dilation deck, the event horizon, and the temporally stretched stars are rendered with precise, character-filtered imagery (“as though a god had taken a wet brush…”). Environment is not mere backdrop; the singularity’s distortions directly shape her panic, her sketching attempts, and the core question of “True North.” The recurring compass rose functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, reframing the deck as a frontier rather than a tomb. World rules are consistent and legible without infodump, all in service of atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire, violet sky, and monumental chessboard are vividly rendered and integrated into action (slippery parapet, howling wind, cracking ice). Environmental details genuinely affect tactics and risk—he moves with “cautious abandon,” the wind threatens to throw him off, the board shudders when altered. The recurring atmospheric motif (wrong sky/violet light) escalates toward the climax, charging the final image as reality unravels. Description is lush but generally purposeful, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: the Grand Rotunda as whispering gallery, the city under Interregnum, and especially the Nomadic Penumbra all shape mood and options. The environment constrains tactics (he must stand at the acoustic center; the dust-coated floor becomes his medium) and strongly charges the final image (sunlight revealing the traced grief as the Penumbra passes). Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain-as-bookstore is vivid, coherent, and omnipresent, from “stacked octavos” and “petrified folios” to the rotting-paper mulch that receives the stone. Environment is not backdrop; it dictates navigation (mercury glass), threat (avalanche-like rumble), and the exact mechanics of the climax (planting the stone into paper so light-roots can bind the shelves). The final image of literalized “roots” knitting the library into a single, stable structure makes setting inseparable from the thematic resolution. This is elite-level atmospheric integration.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The time-frozen village, limestone fountain, solid smoke, and roiling clouds beyond the perimeter create a vivid, coherent environment that’s both atmospheric and functionally tied to the stakes. The "woven hush" and the Tapestry of Origins are integrated into action rather than feeling like exposition, and the final unfreezing of people and elements (droplet, smoke, voices) powerfully recharges earlier images. Setting actively shapes what’s possible (a sealed, preserved village under a weakening barrier). The only ceiling here is that the environment constrains mood and premise more than tactical detail in the climactic act.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bone canyon, vertebrae towers, and pale spire are strikingly specific and immediately orienting, with a strong, coherent aesthetic. World rules about sound and echoes are integrated into the environment and crucially shape the ritual, Kaelen’s tactics, and the climax. Atmosphere is thick and purposeful—the “forged hush” and mist-wrapped spire directly charge the final shattering of silence. At times the description edges toward luxuriant, but it remains functional rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The brass workshop and acid sea are not just decorative; they are the constraint that shapes every choice, from the urgency of the ritual to the impossibility of survival. Sensory details (shriek of gears, hissing sludge, stinging caustic fluid) are precise and tightly woven into action. The environment evolves convincingly as the workshop collapses and reappears thematically as “golden clockwork of a preserved moment.” The final sinking statue in the dark, post-workshop void is a charged environmental image that crystallizes the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quay, cave network, and hidden tidal pool are vividly, economically drawn, with strong sensory detail (barnacle-encrusted ladder, “chimneylike fissure,” preternaturally still water) filtered through Elias’s eye. The environment meaningfully shapes the piece: the hidden oasis enables the ritual, the vertical shaft of light frames the painting and farewell, and the tide’s eventual grinding of the shell charges the concept of “temporary eternity.” The final image of the shell on the sandy floor, magnified by clear water, depends entirely on this specific micro-setting. A small missed opportunity is to let the physical danger of the caves more overtly constrain his behavior rather than sit mostly as atmospheric threat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt lighthouse, storm-scrubbed dawn, fog, and the Teeth are vividly rendered and integrally tied to the problem and solution. Environmental constraints (heavy mist, failed foghorn, jagged rocks, storm aftermath) directly shape the tactics and make a “quiet” method plausible and necessary. Sensory specificity—especially the impossible garden scent over the ocean—deepens both atmosphere and theme. The setting also charges the final image of Elias on the gallery in the wind, recorking the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station, upper atmosphere, dead hydraulics, and the dish’s “paralyzed upward gaze” create a richly textured and specific environment that’s inseparable from the premise. Setting constrains action in meaningful ways (no computers, failed hydraulics necessitating manual cranking and the jury-rigged censer conductor) and charges the final image of her alone amid ozone and incense. Sensory detail is well-chosen—ozone, ancient frankincense, frost-breath—to sustain atmosphere without devolving into a tourist catalog. This is near top-tier work; the only marginal restraint is occasional descriptive saturation that risks feeling ornamental rather than purely pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hanging orchard in a storm-battered ravine is vivid, tactile, and integrated with Elias’s trade and isolation. Environmental details (ozone, loam, exposed roots, suspension bridges) are filtered through a forager-scientist’s eye and help frame his mental state. The storm and ravine exert soft pressure—pushing him indoors, mirroring psychic turbulence—without becoming pure backdrop. The glass eye functions as a micro-setting object that strongly charges the final state, though the orchard itself could slightly more directly constrain his choices to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a major strength: the opal dock, iridescent light, copper-and-clockwork lighthouse, and ocean of time are vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through Silas’s sensibility. Environmental detail supports tone and theme rather than functioning as static backdrop, with the lighthouse beam that “illuminated time” and the mist signaling temporal boundaries. The Edelweiss and the lantern room form a micro-setting that charges the final image and anchors the conceptual stakes. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it deeply charges the story’s metaphysics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subterranean cavern, orchids, solstice vines, and rising meltwater are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s urgency. Setting is not decorative: the seasonal bloom, bioluminescence, and geological “impossibility” all support the Doorway’s plausibility and constrain his options under flood pressure. The physical details of the wall, quartz veins, and indentation directly shape the final action. Environment clearly charges the final image of him stepping into light as the cavern drowns.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is the story’s major strength: the Spire, cobalt grotto, and bleeding starlight are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with danger and options. Environmental details (caustic drops dissolving stone, high-altitude cold, magma warmth) directly shape tactics and meaning, culminating in the ember grotto as literal and thematic shelter. The cosmos-window ceiling and sizzling starlight elegantly mirror the fragility of the firmament and of Isolde’s old order. Description stays purposeful rather than touristic, despite its lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Ember Nexus, geometric canyons, nautilus curl, and glowing fluids form a vivid, coherent environment filtered through Elian’s professional eye. Setting is not mere backdrop: twilight as a physical nexus and the spiral shell both underpin the method and charge the final image. World rules (emotional residues, cycling energy back) feel consistent and are conveyed through action more than exposition. It’s lush but purposeful, with no major white-room gaps or decorative tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain ranger cabin, wind, birch bark, and winter dark create a strong, tactile frame that contrasts with the lushly rendered dreamscape. Setting details are selective and charged, especially the bark scroll and stone grave, which recur conceptually to weight the ending. The environment constrains him into isolation and cold, making the act of writing by dim light feel pressured rather than neutral. The dream world’s specificity (purple sun, liquid starlight) enhances the “jaded wonder” tone without sliding into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The water clock repair shop and the fog are vividly, economically rendered, with details filtered through Elias’s altered sensorium (he recalls smells he can’t access, watches instead of sniffs). Setting is not postcard: the clocks’ dripping literally measures time and charges the final image, and the shop’s isolation inside the fog mirrors the intimate, sealed emotional space of the scene. Tools and objects (glass reservoirs, brass housings) tangibly shape what tactics are possible and how the screw matters. This is atmosphere doing double duty without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea platform and bruised upper atmosphere are vividly rendered and never feel like decor—the rising wind, basalt vibration, and coming storm all constrict her options. The micro-setting of table, tea bowl, ink, and her own crystallizing skin functions as a lived-in workspace that shapes tactics. Weather and altitude aren’t just backdrop; they define stakes (becoming a statue on a levitating islet) and intensify the final storm beat. Detail density is high but mostly purposeful, with sensory choices aligned to her atmospheric-magic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive is vividly realized—“lignin and neglect,” floor-to-ceiling shelves, paper vibrating under invisible fields—and it meaningfully interacts with the action by serving as the physical framework for Silas’s induction cage. The outside orchard and its impending cutting charge the air with a particular, offbeat menace that pays off in the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially smell (roses, ozone) and sound (generator hum, chainsaws). The environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, but it consistently deepens mood and method.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and conceptually integrated: “petrified moments,” the impossible geometry, and the kaleidoscopic sky all feel specific and in character with the piece’s logic. Environment constrains choices meaningfully—the non-linear floor navigation and the Spiral blocking the archway are not mere backdrops but active pressures. The mundane dictionary as an object-in-setting is beautifully leveraged to contrast with the vast, surreal architecture and charges the final image. A slight excess of abstract cosmic description over grounded sensory texture (e.g., smell, temperature) in later beats holds this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fjord, the hydraulic station, and the bronze pipes are vividly evoked and deeply integrated into the premise (time as volume/pressure vs. gears), with sensory detail that feels selective and purposeful. The environment and tools (pipes, sluices, water, horizon line) genuinely constrain what’s possible and make the “dry, geared” mantle-key intrusion feel charged. World rules around fluid vs. toothed time read consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The only thing keeping this just below the absolute top tier is that once the abstract geometry appears, spatial choreography thins a bit in favor of metaphysical description.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subterranean, bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s professional eye, from the “vector map” of the facility to the air system’s breathing-like cycle. Setting and tools (curtains, mesh filters, magnetic seals, air mix) directly shape what he can do and how transgression manifests. The fungal networks and spores are not mere decor; they parallel and challenge his idea of boundaries and charge the final image of mixed air and blue light. The environment feels indispensable to both mood and meaning, not a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the wet-earth platform, rainwashed solstice library, dry leather under warm rain, and the mica lantern all create a vivid, coherent otherworld. Details are sensorially rich and consistently filtered through Elena’s probabilistic, post-attack awareness. The environment is not just decorative; it teaches the rules of “lucid contradictions” and directly frames her confrontation with mortality. The final image of rain that never wets her skin charges both world and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway utility tunnel, hijacked phone booth, third rail, and “city’s bleeding underground arteries” create a vivid, coherent micro-world filtered through Silas’s work. Setting and tools (the haunted switchboard, copper wires, glass disc) directly constrain tactics—he must manipulate sound and current in this claustrophobic infrastructure to do his job. Environmental and tonal details (hum of streetlamps, rumble of late trains) mirror the emotional currents he’s channeling without feeling decorative. The final image of the slowing glass disc and pregnant silence effectively charges the space as a locus of ongoing, invisible labor.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and integral: the blooming, salt-scented jetty, tide, and twilight window are not backdrop but machinery for the magic. Environmental elements (orchid-covered planks, reversing tide, violet sky) constrain when and how the ritual works and then literally absorb the released laughter. The final image of the jetty holding the “warm, invisible blanket” of joy is charged and would collapse without this exact environment. Sensory detail is lush but still purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The disused ivy-choked station and “polite anarchy” of the looters create a specific, atmospheric world that feels lived-in and tonally coherent. Setting details (ivy holding the brickwork, trains that no longer run, rock clattering among gravel, music threading through the vines) are filtered through Arthur’s sensibility and support theme. The environment charges the final image—music in the dark station, the moon rock lost among stones—without becoming over-described. It could constrain physical choices a bit more concretely, but what’s present is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Ultrasonic Forest is vivid, original, and tightly bound to the premise—leaves as screaming syntax, trees emitting emotions in different languages, and the stillpoint as “absolute zero” of sound. Environmental rules are learned through action (touching bark, moving through briars) and they constrain choice in concrete ways. The forest and ring together charge the final stillness image and the “geography of her soul” conceit lands cleanly. Minor reason it avoids 9+: some figurative stacking verges on aesthetic display rather than always sharpening situational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is striking and specific: octagonal chamber, helical shelves, temporal wind, and the gravitational anomaly create an immediate, immersive atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The anomaly and the library are not just backdrop; they enable retrocausality and literally “suspend” him, and the environment’s shift from “heavy, suffocating” to “fresh scent of ozone and possibility” charges the closure image. Details are filtered through his sensibility as someone accustomed to cosmic scales, keeping the worldbuilding focused and tonally coherent. The micro-setting objects (pen, shelves, books) consistently interact with his purpose and the story’s themes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The harbor is vividly rendered—fog, phosphorescent water, rotting pier, moonlight—and consistently intertwined with action (the glowing horizon as staff, moonlight as “rhythm section”). The setting’s surreal luminosity supports the piece’s liminal, otherworldly tone and charges the closing image of the harbor’s enduring “song.” However, the environment mostly amplifies mood rather than constraining tactics or forcing specific choices. Its contribution is atmospheric and thematic rather than pressure-based, keeping this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Lost Civilization Archive is vividly evoked—the “ancient paper and geo-thermal heat,” the ventilation shaft, the Grand Rotunda—and these details are filtered through Elara’s priorities rather than reading like a catalog. Setting actively shapes the story: the hidden alcove, the long descent, and the archive’s “exhale” at the end all constrain or reweight her actions and the final image. Objects-as-setting (tapestry, statue, easel) are integrated into navigation and revelation rather than ornament. A bit more sense of physical risk or environmental constraint in the Rotunda itself could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Sound Wave Garden and the auric lagoon are strikingly original, sensorially rich, and tightly integrated into the story’s logic. Environmental rules (sounds becoming flora, frequencies shifting color and form) are shown through action—his tapping, the tulips swaying, the foliage erupting—rather than dumped as exposition. The setting meaningfully constrains tactics: only in a space where sound solidifies can his drumming hijack the procedure and make the sanctuary “real.” Occasionally the description edges toward ornamental lushness, but it rarely feels disconnected from pressure or character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The port labyrinth, aurora, geomagnetic storm, and container architecture are vividly rendered and consistently affect tactics (GPS scrambled, magnetic plate, folded catwalk). Setting isn’t just decorative: the storm enables the lock mechanism, the stacked containers define routes and shortcuts, and the maintenance infrastructure gives Elias asymmetric power. The recurring objects (iron rod, Zodiac Coin, maps) function as micro-setting tools that constrain choices and charge the final image of Elias vanishing into the folds. A small limitation is that the broader port city never quite materializes beyond the immediate maze, but at this length that’s acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: “bruised sky,” “cobalt dock after rain,” and the mechanical specificity of the harbor lantern feel tactile and charged. The environment constrains action—his solution must be mediated through this antique signaling device—and the final image of patterned light on black water directly arises from these physical particulars. Sensory detail stays purposeful rather than touristic and strongly mirrors the emotional state. The only limiter to an even higher score is that some descriptors edge toward ornamental rather than fully pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the “Cobalt Library,” redacted fiction section, fog like a “blue bruise,” and the magnetic grotto under a skylight all create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Crucially, the lodestones’ disruption of surveillance constrains tactics and justifies the clandestine gathering, and the library’s erased fiction mirrors the thematic war on ambiguity. The final image of mist around the library “covering the sudden, beautiful confusion of a waking city” recharges the opening weather description with new meaning. A slight cap comes from the city itself feeling more atmospheric than concretely navigated, but the micro-settings do real work.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly drawn and strongly integrated: the sublittoral fringe, kelp forests, and sea grapes physically enfold the characters and evolve as the water rises. The environment constrains choices (no dry land, dissolving dock, waist-to-shoulder-deep water), making staying literally impossible and charging the moment of detachment. World rules (nonviolent physics, vanishing island, ocean reclamation) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps. The final image—hovering where the island was, heading into the abyss—relies on this world-building for its force.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: turbines “scything” shadows over a derelict farmhouse and the mandated mask integrate world-building with mood and pressure. The bouquet and the mask function as micro-settings/objects that charge the final image—especially the bouquet’s journey from preserved mourning to dust. Environmental details are filtered through Silas’s situation rather than listed, and the industrial vs. decayed-rural contrast deepens the atmosphere. The turbines mostly operate texturally rather than as direct constraints on choice, which is the only thing holding this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich, specific, and deeply integrated: the cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade all actively shape what is possible in the scene. Light, shadow, and vibration are not decorative; they’re the mechanism of the poem and the transgression, culminating in the atrium as a “vessel where the infinite sky had been poured into finite form.” Environmental consistency and evolution (the cloud dimming, the hum deepening, shadows lengthening) are excellent. This world feels distinct and functional rather than postcard-like, though we don’t yet see the setting impose harder constraints or physical risks.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: vitrified soil, obsidian flagstones, the mirrored courtyard, kiln, and smoky quartz all both establish atmosphere and matter to what’s possible. The glass world’s properties directly constrain tactics—the shrieking reed and resonant quartz are not decorative but functional. The post-Phoenix environment shapes Elara’s perception (a grayscale masterpiece) and charges the final image of fragmented awakening in ash and glass. A slight expansion of how the broader world presses on this courtyard scene could push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly realized through selective, evocative detail (glass canisters of obsolete frequencies, clerestory light, “deep, golden shadows”). Setting feels filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional lens, not like a tourist catalogue. The environment meaningfully supplies the tools (the bells, the salvaged lens) that enable the climactic experiment and charges the final image as the shadows seem to “solidify.” World rules are consistent enough for this length and folded into atmosphere rather than dumped as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Timeless Observatory, with its golden twilight, static celestial charts, and glass height above the city, is vivid and atmospherically coherent. Setting is filtered through Elias’s function—observatory as both workshop and quasi-sacred remove—and the brass press and silver bench details feel purposeful. The environment meaningfully charges the premise (a sanctuary above the “gray sprawl,” from which he casts origami ravens into the world’s grief) even if it doesn’t tightly constrain minute-to-minute choices. The final image is more body-and-object centered than place-centered, but the observatory still frames it as a ritual space rather than a generic room.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, onyx ink, and repurposed post-crypto world are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Silas’s perception. The measuring tape and ink function almost as micro-settings, anchoring his methodology and charging the last image of “artificially constrained” dimensions. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does shape mood and conceptual stakes—this feels purposeful rather than ornamental. Sensory detail (wet concrete, metallic tang of ink) is precise and integrated without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: psychoactive “atoms of nostalgia,” morphing floors, and the saffron filtration veil all directly constrain her tactics and risk. The bronze prism pagoda and amber twilight rotunda provide a charged, memorable locus for the climax. Environmental rules (hallucinogenic dust, responsive terrain) are consistent and learned through her actions, not exposition dumps. The setting also meaningfully charges the final image: her brushing aside the clinging atoms and walking back into the shadows underlines the cost of what she’s learned.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “blooming library above clouds” is vividly rendered and integral: phosphorescent spores, verdant narrative vines, and shelves of blooming encyclopedias all filter through Elian’s sensibility. Setting directly shapes logic and stakes—the cloud-world’s lack of solidity makes the earth-brought river stone necessary as an anchor, and the library is where unbound shadows drift to hide among stories. The final image of the dark geode hidden between glowing, blooming volumes powerfully charges theme and emotion. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The misty, roofless workshop and starlit valley are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception (“galaxy of dust motes,” moss glow, nebula overhead). Environment is not mere backdrop: the open roof and starlight become part of the healing image, charging the ending with a specific, memorable atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, staying aligned with the story’s quiet intensity. The setting does more to charge theme and mood than to constrain physical options, which is the only thing keeping this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, bioluminescent overgrowth, and subterranean root are vividly realized and always filtered through Elias’s obsessions (e.g., coffee rings as maps, the tower as a wound). Setting elements directly constrain action: he must tunnel through flagstones; the tower’s fusion with the root makes retreat or simple repair impossible. Objects like the hourglass and telescope feel lived-in and become charged symbols rather than static props. A slight excess of atmospheric flourish in places keeps this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The projection booth is vividly realized in smell, sound, and function, and the 1940s station emerges organically via Elara’s gift rather than exposition. Crucially, the setting constrains tactics (the projector lamp would destroy the strip) and then charges the ending by making the lens the literal repository of love. Weather (“hushed thunder,” pressure drop) interacts with the ritual, reinforcing the liminal tone rather than sitting as backdrop. The specificity is rich yet purposeful, rarely feeling like cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elian—the aurora-lit archway, frost-covered stones, and thin air are all active, not decorative. The archway and sky aren’t mere backdrops; they hum, flare, and channel the torrent, directly shaping what’s possible. The final image of Elian paralyzed beneath the archway with “remembered stardust” beating in rhythm with the stars gives the environment real closing charge. A slight excess of cosmic color adjectives keeps it from feeling absolutely spare and surgical, but it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly woven into the mood: glowing silica petals that “chimed like broken glass,” a violet sky, and the iron crate form a coherent, lived-in dystopian landscape. Environmental details mirror and charge the stakes—the blooming dune sighing in relief and the flowers pulsing with his heart give the world a responsive, quasi-organic presence. The chess clock and crate also function as micro-settings, constraining what is possible and heavily charging the final image. The only mild limit is that the physical environment rarely constrains his tactical options; its role is more atmospheric than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through his perception (wind timbres, metal species, rusted turbine) rather than generic steampunk wallpaper. Setting actively shapes choices—he literally navigates by wind through different trees—and the turbine plus gear function as charged micro-setting objects. Environmental change (turbine awakening, new weather pattern, “pollen” of creativity) meaningfully charges the final image and mirrors the internal shift. A tiny limitation is that the broader world rules beyond this grove stay sketched rather than deeply implicated in his options, keeping it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Veiled Ridgeway, mist, salt, cloudy cobblestones, and abyss are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the liminal, almost maritime atmosphere, giving the piece a strong sense of place. The environment constrains action—indirect routes around stone pillars, a “station” in twilight, the abyss where the leash dangles—and the twilight and star physically and thematically charge the final beats. Sensory choices (salt, thermal drafts, waves) are purposeful and tied to the “shoreline lullaby” motif. A touch more evolution of the ridgeway as he changes (e.g., a subtle shift in how he perceives it after claiming courage) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress, blizzard, and freezing stairwell are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elian’s body and purpose. Setting actively constrains choice—the blizzard makes flight nearly suicidal—and enables the discovery (the dusty spiral staircase scar and alcove). The world-rule of enforced silence and the absent piano are made legible through physical details rather than exposition alone. Environment and recurring object (the bolt in his palm in the cold blue dark) meaningfully charge the final image, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Silent Atrium is richly realized—the marble dust, weeping ceiling, drifting-in-void location, and thinning wards are all concrete and sensorial. Environment is not just décor: dew from the ceiling enables the ink, the weakening wards during the constellation pause allow the spell to bite into reality, and the crumbling roof plus vacuum make the Pretender’s drifting fate tangible. Details are filtered through Orel’s reverent, custodial perspective, so setting and character interlock. The density of description comes close to excess at times but consistently serves tone and the mechanics of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sea level monitoring station, the tethered buoy, the holographic topography, and the drowned coastal road are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Elian’s professional gaze. The setting isn’t a backdrop; it shapes what he can do (hydrophones, composites, sonar) and what’s at stake (lost coastlines, new reefs). The recurring contrast between the old atlas page and the holographic seafloor elegantly anchors time and change. Environment and objects decisively charge the final image of the reef-encased road.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is a major strength: the abandoned repair bay, the ripped-up floor exposing planetary crust, and the ancient stone circle beneath industrial wreckage are sharply realized and thematically aligned. Environmental specifics constrain and enable action—Elara must stand barefoot on the stones; the frigate core hangs above, making the bay itself the conduit. Sensory detail (“ozone, rust, and the copper tang of dried blood”) and spatial relationships remain clear and evolving as power builds. The final image of blue glow bathing ruin and monoliths fusing past and future shows the environment actively charging the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    The volcanic hot springs, sulfurous steam, and screaming crimson moss create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting constrains tactics (she needs the geothermal heat as catalyst) and charges the final image of the child floating in the boiling pool. World rules stay internally consistent (moss telepathy, hovercraft, Reconstruction Council) and are delivered through action rather than pure exposition. A slight tilt toward less descriptive density under peak pressure could sharpen urgency, but atmosphere and specificity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum-on-a-cliff, rattling glass, and adjacent automated lighthouse are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with mood and plot—the wind’s whine is literally the trigger. Environmental details (humid loam, grow lights, cliff-face pine, rusted gallery rails) are specific and filtered through a plant-obsessed, trauma-sensitized mind. The setting meaningfully shapes options: his isolation, the mechanical “ghost” of the lighthouse, and the hostile weather all justify his mission and his reliance on interior techniques. The final image of him as guardian in this fragile lung of greenery feels inseparable from this exact place.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse library, glitching ocean, bleeding purple light, and mechanical lantern are all sharply realized and tightly integrated with the pressure. The setting actively constrains tactics: walls literally closing in, vertical architecture enabling the chute, and the tarot box as coordinate anchor. Environmental details evolve with events (shelves bleeding light, floor dissolving) and culminate in the charged contrast between blinding lens and absolute void. The world’s rules, though surreal, feel internally consistent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The wind-carved encampment, sandstone pillars, roaring gale, and brutal post-eclipse sun are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Silas’s UV-sensitive body and goggles. Setting does more than decorate: the gully provides a literal dead end, the wind shapes atmosphere and sound, and the sun is a persistent constraint that stings his skin and tears his eyes, charging the final image. Tools and micro-setting—the hummingbird drone, the rock surface, the ink mandala—operate as spatial anchors and functional environment. A touch more interaction with terrain in the struggle could heighten constraint, but as-is it already strongly supports tone and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Sub-Zero Athenaeum is vividly realized and tightly integrated with theme—silence, ice, and buried analog infrastructure all embody suppressed, “frozen” truth. Environmental constraints directly shape tactics: the glacial isolation, dormant speakers, and obsolete cabling make her workaround plausible and meaningful. The final image of changed silence in the library reweights the entire setting without feeling over-symbolized. Occasionally the density of description risks excess, but it rarely stalls momentum or feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dome, storms, and desert rose beds are vivid and specific, with sensory detail filtered through Elara’s horticultural focus (“microscopic tremble of a leaf,” ballast sand smelling of “ozone and altitude”). The environment constrains choices—the glass barrier mediates the encounter, the dome’s sanctuary status shapes her refusal to escalate. World rules (forbidden plant-morality science, post-Tower desolation) feel consistent and are learned through action rather than infodump. The final image of dense peace inside the glass directly leverages setting to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Sound Wave Garden and sleepwalking constellations are richly specific and entirely integrated with action: emotions reshape terrain, sonic plants react to movement, and stellar migration breaks patterns to open a tactical window. Sensory and conceptual details (bass notes as “black tulips,” air becoming “transparent glass” or “diamond-hard clarity”) feel both inventive and functional. The setting constantly constrains choices and culminates in a charged final image of the iron-wrapped echo against the quieted garden and receding constellations. Description is dense but remains legible and purpose-driven rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass-walled observatory above the clouds, the echo, the wind, and the ink-and-paper details together create a distinctive, atmospheric space that feels tailored to Eleanor’s psyche. The observatory’s height and isolation subtly underscore her remove from the “ink-stained fingers” below and deepen the mood. The rosewood pen and indigo ink function as almost-micro-setting elements, charging key beats and the final image. Still, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain her choices—its role is tonal more than tactical, which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds and the amber function as micro-setting and object-as-setting that constrain what’s possible: she must work at this specific console, with this fossil as organic anchor, in a place designed for echoes to die. Environmental distortions (warping geometry, stretching shadows) externalize the temporal fold and raise pressure rather than serving as mere spectacle. The final image of fractures inside the amber “like a constellation” elegantly fuses setting, object, and character history. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding could elevate it further, but what’s here is already publication caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering grotto, lilac mist, damp stone, and acoustic properties are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elian’s sensibility. Setting actively constrains choices: the slick stone makes chalk unusable, forcing the turn to colored sands, and the grotto’s acoustics enable both the problem (amplified chaos) and the solution (wave cancellation via the mandala gap). The lilac mist’s “unease” lifting at the end charges the final image with a clear environmental shift that mirrors the internal and acoustic resolution. A slightly narrower focus on a few key sensory anchors over multiple metaphors would sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“shattered sky,” nuclear winter, crystalline dome debris, mosaics—and consistently filtered through a machine’s sensorium. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics: the cold requires heat venting, the open sky exposes them to drones, and the plaza’s logged architecture enables the misclassification that saves the child. The recurring tessera and mosaic floor charge the final image and directly constrain the solution. Description is dense but purposeful, rarely feeling like idle spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carnival orchard within the hedge maze is lushly rendered through multiple senses and tightly integrated with the magic: echoes bouncing off hedge walls, ancient fruit trees threatened by time-static, paper lanterns rekindling history. Details are strongly filtered through Barnaby’s synesthesia, keeping the description purposeful rather than touristic. The setting also charges the final image (the wind as crowd-roar in the empty orchard), though it rarely constrains concrete physical choices in a way that would push this into the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    The light painting studio is vividly and economically drawn—the velvet darkness, the red standby light, the long-exposure camera—and its physical constraints (darkness, controlled environment, wand, geode) directly define what’s possible. The muscovite crystal as tool-setting fuses environment and theme, charging the final image. Details stay tightly filtered through the characters’ priorities rather than drifting into cataloguing. The only minor limit is that the wider post-collapse world is gestured at more than embodied, though that fits the chosen scope.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“Obsidian Grotto,” ionized air, tidal pillars, and the black lagoon all feel tactile and purposeful. The environment constrains action (the sheer drop, need for buoyancy drive) and enables the core phenomenon (piezoelectric, dream-conducting rock). Sensory detail is rich but not list-like, and it’s filtered clearly through Elara’s specialized perception (seeing “aurora of grief and hope” rather than mere limestone). The fossil as recurring small object also charges the final image by tying geologic time and pressure to her inner endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Amber Warehouse, solidified sap, and cliffs etched with prophecy are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s ritualistic work. Environment and objects (amber walls shaping the echo, the master hourglass at the center, the cliffs whose text fades) directly charge the final image and the stakes of his actions. The setting feels both tactile and mythic without drifting into generic fantasy décor. It meaningfully shapes what can happen here, especially the acoustic logic of the echo and the centrality of hourglasses to fate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Zephyr Bluff, mist, and snow are not mere backdrop; they concretely shape tactics (stomping codes in snow, using fog as deniability, the precipice as extraction point) and charge the ending image when the rotor wash erases the footprints. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (“silver hush,” “ground begins to weep”), consistently filtered through Elias’s tense awareness. Environmental evolution tracks events: mist whipped by downdraft, codes obliterated once the contact is made. The setting-object interplay (bluff/snow/mist/rotor) tangibly constrains and then wipes his plea, deepening the thematic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the fog-bound river, invisible bridge, obsidian carriage, tollhouse, and ticking gutters all work together to create mood and constraint. Environmental details meaningfully shape the terms of action—the bridge “too heavy” for contradictions, the mud that absorbs discarded layers, the gutters defining the grace-period clock. Sensory choices (fog, chill breath, metallic dripping) are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The final image of the carriage rolling into the white void recharges the established atmosphere rather than feeling newly invented.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated—abandoned hives, scorched earth, ghostly bees, and the oasis’s temporal anomaly all feel lived-in and coherent. Environmental details (the clay, the wheel, the glass, the thick air, the cooling of the day) evolve with the scene and mirror the conceptual stakes. The oasis’s rules—phototropic to kindness, fractured timelines—are learned through his embodied work rather than exposition dumps. The final image of the pot left to dry in that charged air clearly relies on the established environment to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the luminous harbor provides literal light, the salt air causes corrosion, and the fire escape’s height and angle make the mirrors’ geometry necessary. Environmental details are tightly filtered through Elias’s attention as a gardener-tinkerer, avoiding tourist cataloging. The mechanical “flower” of mirrors and the decayed rose are spatially and symbolically integrated with the harbor glow and the old woman’s buried window. The final image of reflected harbor light “blooming in the dark” is strongly charged by the accumulated setting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Tidal Library above the clouds, brass sundial, cloud-tides, and obsidian disc form a vivid, original environment that’s consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions. Setting does more than decorate: altitude preserves the books, the cloud-tide and sundial frame time/pressure, and the stone circle/obsidian disc materially structure the central ritual. Weather and atmosphere (thin air, rising clouds) charge the final image as she checks the encroaching “white sea.” The world rules are strange yet internally consistent and tightly woven into mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly evoked—the lily pond, Lotus Temple, post-storm light, and the whimsical installation all feel vivid and sensorially grounded. Environment meaningfully charges the final image: the pond reflections, temple walls, and sculpture become the canvas for the integration metaphor, and the spiral literally anchors light. The weather and moisture (“prismatic quiet,” “cloud bursts”) are not just backdrop but active tonal agents. Occasionally the descriptive density edges toward lushness-for-its-own-sake, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s perspective: the cigarette-scarred booth, stale coffee and ozone, humming ON AIR light, and flickering torches outside all pull double duty as mood and pressure. The university radio station and its geomagnetic ley line are not postcard details; they constrain tactics and are literally his only viable weapon. Cosmic and terrestrial atmospheres are interwoven in specific, tactile ways (oscilloscope, VU meters, patch cables) that culminate in the final image of cigarette smoke blending with “the dust of the universe.” World rules around the signal and transmitter feel coherent within the speculative frame, with no distracting inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly realized and functionally integrated: the roofless ruin, starlight, cold air, and mutable stone all constrain what Elara can do and intensify the claustrophobic pressure. The obsidian-and-brass organ and the wind chest are not mere décor; their physicality and acoustics are central to tactics and resolution. The moving architecture and grinding retreat of the walls evolve in step with the music, making environment and conflict inseparable. World-level elements like the “fallow period” and “dormancy of the earth” feel atmospheric yet still tethered to the central action rather than indulgent lore.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quarry, mist, and limestone are vividly rendered and recur in multiple guises (“geometry,” “furrowed hush,” “merciless rock”), giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; it concretizes the erasure of evidence and becomes part of the portrait’s composition, culminating in the final image of the mist reclaiming the space yet unable to obscure the art. Environmental specifics are selective and filtered through Silas’s perception as an artist, emphasizing angle, texture, and contrast. While the quarry doesn’t physically constrain action, it heavily charges tone and the conceptual stakes of memory vs. erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: moss-slick metal, “spongey dread,” and air tasting of “ozone and wet wool” create a highly specific, oppressive environment. The weather station and its consoles are not postcard details; they constrain the action and function as an altar/mechanism that must be used in a very particular way. The storm-as-flesh imagery and the porous blur between inside and outside evolve with the ritual and ship’s reappearance, charging the final image. World rules (Weeping, Silent Zone, experimental observatory) stay consistent and are learned organically through action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain pullout, shrouded bridge, mist, and scaffold wrap are vividly realized and integrated into action rather than serving as backdrop, with details like “white containment plastic” and “holy, artificial violet” doing real atmospheric work. The environment constrains what is possible—he must observe at a distance, interpret the bridge via sound and motion, and finally commit to driving across. The recurring objects (the glass shard, the plastic sheeting, the truck) are tightly woven into the final image and meaning. It stops just short of 9-band only because the physical setting never materially resists or complicates his choice beyond mood and vantage.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and specific—rotting velvet, rusted wheels fused to rails, lion tamer and acrobat cars—and consistently filtered through Silas’s sensibility. Setting directly shapes tactics (railroad spikes, cage-bar shadows, executive car ambiance) and infuses the psychological warfare with real environmental constraints. The final image of him stepping off the train into the wet railyard gravel recharges the opening and underlines the closure. This integration of environment with character and theme is a major strength, just short of transcendent because the space, while rich, doesn’t further complicate his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory and dream temple are vividly rendered—“heavy velvet quiet,” “black stone suspended in a void of colorful nebulas,” and the living inscriptions all create a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting is well-filtered through Elara’s professional lens (sidereal clock, variable stars as tools). The recurring star imagery meaningfully charges both the method and the final image of dispersed burden. The environment rarely constrains tactical options, though, functioning more as charged backdrop than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “swirling orchard vortex” and “bruised pulp” sky create a strong, integrated atmosphere that shapes action (Kaelen leaping along spinning trees). Sensory detail—ozone, crushed fruit, panic—feels selective and purposeful rather than touristic. World rules for magic and the vortex are consistent enough to support the scene without exposition dumps. The environment constrains movement and tactics, but doesn’t quite reconfigure the final image beyond serving as a dramatic backdrop, which holds it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich—the “saturated, heavy cobalt” sky, instant vegetation, and root-bound visionary convincingly evoke a post-accelerated world. Environmental details are filtered through Jaren’s perception and thematically mirror the time-shattered premise and human/nature tension. The glade and labyrinth imagery return at the end to frame a before/after, though the setting rarely constrains tactics beyond mood and symbolic grounding. Strong atmosphere and specificity, just shy of using environment as an active pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “catacomb orchard” is memorably concrete and atmospheric, with roots, bones, sap, and skulls all integrated into the magic system and the stakes of the barter. Setting is not mere backdrop; the sap, roots, and bone surfaces literally enable and constrain Elian’s tactics and the ritual’s mechanics. The final image of him slumped against the bone-studded wall in a tightening darkness feels charged by this environment. A slight broadening of how the physical layout threatens or aids him under stress could make it even more tactically present.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quarry and office trailer are sharply realized—silence as a “gaping, hungry thing,” stale tobacco, wet dog, luan plywood—all filtered through Elias’s technical, sound-obsessed perception. Environment constrains action (humidity fusing cloth to wood, the looming crusher deadline) and the decayed micro-setting mirrors his fallen status without overstatement. The speaker scrap as object-as-setting is meaningfully charged, becoming the locus where place, history, and his identity intersect. Spatial and sensory choreography remain clear and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Magnetic Arbor, iron-willows, magnetic soil, and cloud deck are vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Elian’s perceptions. The environment materially shapes choices: the failing orbit and lurching gravity force intervention, and the soil bed becomes the literal medium for Aris’s re-inscription. Recurring objects (the pedestal, the cradle of spun glass, the arbor’s trunk) charge the final image where Elian rests his hand and feels a pulse. A slight tendency toward lush description over functional constraint in a few lines keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Tidal Atrium, brass archways, rising brine, crucible, and titan gears are richly imagined and tightly woven into action rather than pasted on. Environment consistently shapes behavior—he wades, his gears strain, the tide’s timing dictates the work—and the forge and shelving literally anchor the premise. Sensory specifics (“ozone, old roses, and the copper tang of regret”) deepen atmosphere while remaining purposeful. The recurring winter sun and receding tide also charge the final image with a sense of static yet eroding time.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal cathedral, obsidian floor strewn with seashells, and towering stalagmite are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the action—Elias’s movement, the reading of shells, and the crowning all arise from, and are charged by, the environment. The setting is not postcard description: the crystals amplify the radiance, the stalagmite functions as a literal and symbolic pillar, and the subterranean cold shapes mood and perception. The piece almost reaches the very top band, but a hint more showing of how the physical constraints of the cave (access, danger, collapse risk, or similar) affect Elias’s tactical options would deepen its role beyond lyric backdrop plus amplifier.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vivid and purposefully filtered—rusted awning, ivy-strangled iron, tiled lavatory, and the gray river all mirror decay, neglect, and archival persistence. The environment is not mere backdrop: the lavatory’s graffiti actively guides his path, and the muddy bank and taped accordion charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tonal rather than touristic, especially in the river sequence. The landscape could constrain tactics more overtly, but it already meaningfully shapes mood and action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “glowing library in mist” and glass panels with shifting geometry are vivid, specific, and integrated with the rules of the world. The environment constrains her choices (must look away to read, must time movement with cycles) and the watch functions as a micro-setting tool that mediates space-time. Sensory detail is economical but evocative, with light and vibration doing heavy atmospheric work. The setting’s rules are consistent and directly shape the story’s central actions and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Velvet Observatory, humid midsummer air, clamoring ivy, and impossible ice violin create a vivid, sensorially rich environment that feels organic to the premise. Setting is not decorative: the midsummer growth frenzy amplifies the psychic noise, the humidity heightens the contrast with the frozen object, and the observatory’s containment charges the act of opening the glass case. Environmental elements (ivy, dawn light, preserved water in the violin) directly constrain and enable choices and heavily charge the final image of a world “wildly, uncontrollably alive.” This is immersive and purposeful without bogging down momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora light, and floating archipelago are rendered with striking, specific imagery that deeply support tone and concept. Environmental detail is filtered through Elara’s work—light on the obsidian table, the void below, the cosmic display above—creating a coherent, atmospheric space. Worldbuilding elements (entropic storms, mnemosyne-drive) feel integrated rather than dumped. The setting, however, mostly frames and charges the scene rather than directly constraining tactics, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Umbral Grotto above the clouds is vividly imagined and consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions (“vineyard hush,” “sea of white clouds…like a floor of unspun wool”). Setting is not decorative: the hanging cedar, floating rock, and height above the world all inform her tactics and the soul’s fear of the “drop.” World rules about the vines, pods, and between-lives space are conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps. The environment also charges the final image of quiet continuity and release, giving the ending real atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, embers, wind, chimes, and dawn light are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s purpose, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The setting is not merely decorative: the chime-filled gallery and the exposed height concretely enable Elias’s method and the ritualized stakes of “choose one to signal your intent.” Dawn as a temporal horizon subtly presses on the choice, and the final image of light bleeding through salt-crusted glass charges the ending. The piece achieves a strong sense of place without bogging down in touristic cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock, canyon, and magnetic grotto are vivid and integrated into action, especially when the grotto’s mineral composition amplifies theta waves and alters perception of the basin. The setting repeatedly inflects mood and meaning (sycamore hush, starlight on ripples) instead of serving as postcard backdrop. Environment directly shapes the core revelation by enabling the trance state and silver-fire ripples that Kael studies. It stops just short of 9-band because the constraints of the environment don’t quite force tactical choices; they mainly amplify the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bone canyon and endless echoes are vividly realized and tightly bound to the story’s acoustical logic; the environment literally makes his art possible. Details like “calcified ribs” and dust burying his ankles are not just decorative—they embody time, entrapment, and the resonance mechanics. World rules around sound travel and dead/active air are learned through action (crows’ movements, ricocheting arrowhead) rather than exposition. The canyon’s echo properties are what allow the old scream to persist and the final mapping to occur, so setting decisively charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, upper-atmosphere cold, and “brilliant dimness” are vividly rendered and consistently shape tactics (necessitating mist walking, threatening physical survival, justifying the folly’s special physics). The arch on the Needle’s peak becomes a charged micro-setting object whose restored state anchors the final image and reconfigures the world below. Atmosphere and specificity are excellent; the only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that a few lush descriptive passages tilt more toward lyric display than additional constraint or choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the iron pier, churning harbor, silted deck of the *Aurelia*, and the anaerobic, glowing library of jars all feel tactile and lived-in. Environment directly constrains options—he must navigate collapsed bulkheads, use the underwater library’s logic, and interact with jars as physical containers of vows—and the recurring contrast between sky lanterns above and bioluminescent promises below charges the final image. Details are filtered through Silas’s vocation and emotional state (curating the boundary between earth and tide, light and dark), avoiding tourist catalog description. The world’s rules (vows bottled in glass, accessed with a key-tag “signifying” authority) feel consistent and are revealed via action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: the ambered observatory deck, translucent resin, analog dials, and suffocating post-contraction darkness all shape the mood and actions (e.g., the coin sinking into the amber floor). The preservation bubble versus the crushed universe outside is both a physical constraint and a thematic frame for defiant memory-keeping. Details are filtered through Hiero’s task and expertise rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The environment and its objects (amber, console, coins) clearly charge the final image, though an additional moment where the physical constraints directly alter tactics would be needed for a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory is vivid and functional: copper walls, brass gears, prism arrays, and the focal point where the map is placed all directly enable the central magical act. Setting, tools, and time of day (dying sun) constrain his options and charge the final image of the blank atlas and glittering sculptures. Details feel filtered through his profession and grief, not like a neutral catalog. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics and the ending, qualifying it for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Sapphire Viaduct, the empty basin, the high-altitude chill, and the heating blue stone create a distinctive, sensuous environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Environmental conditions—dry air, dawn temperature, altitude—directly constrain Elian’s tactics with the lukewarm water. The recurring bell and the viaduct’s vantage point charge the final image of the geyser in the basin below. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that supports both mood and mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid, tactile, and thematically charged: the “midnight ridgeway at twilight,” silted slope, black water, algae-slick counter, and resurfacing roofs all feel specific and lived-in. The environment constrains and colors action (mud, darkness, and distance from the ridge, the chime’s silence as a cue) and is filtered through Elias’s curatorial gaze. Recurring images of water, reflection, and hush culminate in the final re-seeing of the town as a love story “reflected in the water,” clearly charging the closure. Description stays purposeful rather than touristic, with a strong atmospheric through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall are vividly evoked through multisensory detail, with recurrent elements (mist, apples, fractured light) woven into action rather than static description. The setting’s tone of “ancient freshness” mirrors the thematic fusion of old and new and charges the final breeze “that smelled of apples and eternity.” While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her tactics, it does subtly shape the ritual and the charged atmosphere of transformation. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong enough for high-band even without a hard physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “nocturnal arbor above the clouds” and ivy-choked bio-dome create a vivid, specific environment that shapes tone and plausibly constrains choices (no abort without being stranded, narrow atmospheric corridors). Setting details are filtered through Kael’s professional eye—wind shear patterns, glass leaves, titanium clip—rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The silence and altitude meaningfully inflect the pressure of the scene and the final image. The world-building is evocative without heavy exposition, though the arbor’s physical constraints could influence tactics even more directly to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The floating rock dojo in a sky of impossible colors and time-spasming statues creates a vivid, distinctive atmosphere that immediately frames the story’s philosophical combat. Temporal instability interacts meaningfully with events—Vane’s authority flickers and he is finally erased by a revised history—so the environment is not mere backdrop. However, the dojo itself and its physical constraints do little to shape tactics or body-level choices in the fight. The setting is memorably strange and tonally apt but could more directly pressure action to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nocturnal studio, storm aftermath, and brook create a vivid, moody backdrop that mirrors his mental state, and the terrarium/incubator details feel tactile and plausible. The corpse flower itself is a strong specific object, carrying both sensory charge (odor) and conceptual weight. However, the environment mostly serves atmosphere rather than constraining choices—his tactics wouldn’t meaningfully change in a different room. Still, the closing image of the studio darkened with the incubator glowing uses setting effectively to charge the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The echo chamber tunnel, end-of-time frame, and rusted leaf blowers are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise: the acoustics and physical confinement literally enable the attempt to liquefy silence. Details like exhaust fog, concrete curvature, and “viscous” air are filtered through Silas’s goal and grief, not offered as neutral scenery. The environment constrains choices (he must wield industrial machines in this acoustic cul-de-sac after time has ended) and intensely charges the final image of laughter within a grave-like space. World rules—physics bowing to memory, air needing violence—are consistent with the story’s own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and tightly integrated: “solidified silence,” frozen garden, overgrown Philosophy hemlock, and mist all feel lived-in rather than decorative. Environmental rules (light as edge, silence as frost, fog as mind-terrain) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. The environment constrains choices—light literally hurts and threatens the dreamlike ambiguity the guardian values—and the final image of the dimmed pendant letting shadows “embrace us both” is directly charged by earlier worldbuilding. Specificity and POV filtering are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Ember Nexus and frozen-twilight world are vividly realized, with images like “frozen bloom of arrested smoke” and crystallizing planetary heat giving the setting real presence. Environment and weather exert pressure—the deepening cold, creeping frost, and dwindling heat directly constrain time and heighten the stakes of each attempt. The crozier, crucible, and alchemical fire function as tactile, tool-like anchors rather than abstract props. While superbly atmospheric, the setting could push one more step into constraining tactical options at the climax to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“a skeleton of abandoned radio towers suspended over the Great Gorge” with wind, creaking metal, and rusted rebar all working together. Environmental features do exert some pressure: the dangerous climb, groaning city, and atmospheric density that interferes with the signal. The Hollywood star fragment and the city of Aeros feel like lived-in, coherent parts of the same world rather than decorative weirdness. While the place shapes mood and method more than concrete tactical choices, the atmosphere is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The spectral grotto, sideways time, and reflected constellations are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s professional lens on the ferry. Setting details like the whispering water, static-hiss stars, and empty hourglass feel integrated rather than touristic, and the environment’s rules (sideways clocks, suspended time) matter to the central problem. The grotto-as-navigation-chart and starlight/static correspondence are especially effective at fusing worldbuilding with plot. The physical environment could constrain her tactics a bit more directly, but atmosphere and specificity are high-level.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Penrose Atrium and optical illusion gallery are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise; twisting staircases, impossible triangles, and non-Euclidean walls all actively participate in the conflict. The environment’s rules (illusions gaining mass, repressed physics pushing back) clearly constrain what Elias can do and directly shape the climax as space erupts. Sensory detail—especially visual and tactile—is rich and purposeful, though other senses are used more sparingly. This is very strong atmospheric work, just shy of the very top band because the wider world beyond the atrium remains entirely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The benthic city and the crushing miles of water are vividly realized, with the pressure gauges, cartography dome, and trench environment all filtered through a navigator’s eye. The recurring object—the rusted chain link—functions effectively as micro-setting, embodying both history and his present confinement and charging the final image. The environment shapes the core stakes by making the night sky inaccessible and thus turning a mundane historical ability into a near-mystical quest. This is richly done, though the city itself remains more backdrop than an active system of constraints beyond atmospheric hostility and depth pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mist-clad atrium, marble fountain, and glass ceiling are specific, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Environment participates in action: mist coalesces into predators, the ceiling directionally focuses her search, and the atrium’s emptiness heightens vulnerability. Object-as-setting (hearing aid, photograph, velvet box) further charges the final image. The world’s rules (the hour when the dead call, lower bunkers, spectral contamination) feel coherent and are shown rather than over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The undersea facility, crushing pressure, and attached cables are vividly rendered and consistently constrain choices (no easy retreat, dependence on the umbilical, tidal shifts). Sensory detail is purposeful—hums, groans, temperature shifts—and filtered through a claustrophobe’s body. World rules around the Transmission Drive and cables remain internally consistent and are learned through his actions. The environment also charges key final images (glowing cable, fading station) rather than functioning as static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal-like observatory, snow-smothered dome, and sensor table create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the liminal “ghost in the machine” premise. Environmental details (thin high-altitude air, radio static, drying ink, iridescent walls) are filtered through Elias’s purpose and help stage the ritual rather than feeling like tour-guide description. The shard, ink, and sensor table act as a micro-setting that charges the final image when the ink dries and the shard is submerged. The observatory itself could constrain choice more concretely to reach 9+ but already feels purposeful rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon, bone towers, tunnel, and diamond are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the action; the environment isn’t backdrop but the very medium of conflict and solution. Details like the “jagged, calcified perimeter” and the birds tracing air currents are specific and sensory, with acoustics and geology directly shaping tactics. The setting meaningfully charges the ending: the altered wind through bone towers is literally the new archive. A slight excess of ornate description in early sentences edges toward decorative, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The herbalist’s underground garden, with “humid loam,” “twenty feet of rock and permafrost,” and floating ferns, is atmospheric, specific, and tightly integrated with the stakes (a secret refuge under a frozen world). The environment actively participates in the climax—gravity’s playfulness, objects drifting, the loam catching them on descent—which charges the ritual and final image rather than serving as static backdrop. World rules (frozen surface vs. strange subterrain, anomalies as shifting geometries) feel consistent and learned through action. A bit more tactile interaction with the garden as obstacle or resource during the ritual could push it into truly indispensable territory.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich, particular, and integrated: the rusted sky-bridge, sodium-lit orchard, bronze-and-wire golems, and suppression grid all feel coherent and tactile. Environmental features constrain and shape events—the statues’ patrols and acoustic policing, the concrete suppression plates, and the hidden sap/magic that the music reaches. Sensory detail across smell (“crushed mint, wet soil, and ozone”), sound, and sight builds an unmistakable atmosphere. The orchard and cityscape also charge the final image, where the environment itself becomes the agent of rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly evoked and functional: the Cobalt Arcade’s blue-glass ruin, the DMZ, drones, and forcefield all both color the atmosphere and dictate tactics. The environment directly shapes his movement (“navigation by linking absences”) and his physical sensations (ozone, static kiss), grounding the speculative elements. World rules feel consistent and are revealed in action rather than infodump. The final image of him in the dim blue hush, waiting for thunder, effectively charges the earlier atmospheric details without over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train, void, misting hush, and overgrown cattle-car oasis are vividly rendered and integrated into action rather than offered as static tableau. Environment constrains and charges choices: the liminal train world, the hovering tracks, and the bell’s sound-bounded reality all shape what Elias can do, and the halo’s light finally reconfigures that space. The recurring objects (bell, train, hush, fragment) strongly charge the final image. Descriptive density is high but controlled, maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Scientific Poetry Library is richly evoked with specific, idiosyncratic details (string-theory stanzas, thermodynamical limericks) that feel inseparable from the premise. The environment’s tone—cathedral, graveyard shift, drifting patrons—supports the thematic exploration of liminal spaces between science and art. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it does meaningfully charge the final image of Elara as gatekeeper between shelves and source. Integration is strong enough for high-band even without a literal environmental obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Whispering Archipelago, terrace, and sunrise are rendered with vivid, selective detail, and the environment is inseparable from the magic system (her talent is “born from the strange, resonant energies of the archipelago”). Setting actively shapes the moment: the islands encourage her, the dawn’s angle of light constrains timing, and the final quieting of the islands and ordinary tide sharpen the sense of after. The palette and tripod function as tools embedded in this world rather than generic props. The atmosphere feels cohesive and tonally aligned with the piece’s concerns about absence and ephemerality.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Shadowed Nexus, void, and star are vividly evoked and integrated with the action (gravity warping, floor dissolving, star as “keyhole”). Setting consistently supports tone and theme, embodying the liminal state between repression and release. Environmental elements materially constrain choice: she must look up at the star and cannot “stand on” her usual ground. A few images (“geometry of existence folded like heavy velvet,” “hush of cosmic possibility”) flirt with decorative excess but do not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is strikingly original and sharply rendered: a “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” whose physical geometry literally governs the magic. Environmental specifics (drifting wrecks, bioluminescent algae, glass dome under pressure) are filtered through Silas’s goals and directly constrain his tactics. The shipwreck “constellations” and the dome’s transparency are indispensable to how he opens the way back. A touch of description reads as decorative rather than strictly functional, but the overall integration of world and action is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Forgotten Library is vividly rendered—the dust, rot-resistant shelves of jagged mirrors, and the central prism—creating a distinct, charged atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Silas’s professional eye (shard-mirror archivist, diamond-tipped stylus, binding runes), which grounds the magic system without over-explaining. The environment meaningfully shapes the action and final image: the prism’s shattering, the glass shards, and the broom all arise from the material reality of this place. A slight ceiling comes from the library not constraining tactics much beyond being the obvious locus of his work and her prison.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and functionally integrated: the verdant parapet, void-fall waterfall, and soot-choked city below all matter to how Elian acts. The waterfall is not postcard scenery—it is the delivery mechanism that enables grafting and shapes his tactic of braiding essence into cascading water. World rules (waterfall between dimensions, shears cutting reality’s “skin”) are consistent and revealed through action rather than exposition dumps. The final image—radiant hush deepening on the parapet, colors plunging toward grey mists—feels charged by place and could not easily be relocated without breaking the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, glass “optical cage,” and brine-stinking net are vivid and tonally integrated, with sensory detail doing double-duty as mood and metaphysics. The environment constrains and charges the action: the glass refracts the psychic scream, the net provides literal silence as material, and the sanctuary becomes the “cage of light and quiet” that mirrors his own imprisonment. World rules about silence-as-substance and screaming masks emerge through use, not exposition. Nearly every setting choice either pressures the scene or reappears in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “rain-scoured fresco vault,” Scottish drizzle, collapsed roof, and contrast between damp ruin and “dark, dry staircase” are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action: the rain’s erosion literally erases the lever’s visible context and thus creates the puzzle. Environmental specifics (the henge’s shadow, the incensed air rising from below) charge both the mechanism and the final image. Setting clearly constrains perception and discovery, not just mood, satisfying the high-band test. This is one of the story’s strongest aspects.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken ship library is vividly and economically realized—“pulp of dissolving literature hung in the water like gray fog” marries physical, psychic, and thematic space with real specificity. The environment actively shapes the action: psychic currents and emotional threads are navigational hazards he must sort to reach the desk and the globe. The deep-sea setting, the wreck, and the library’s function as an archive are inseparable from the story’s premise and resolution. The final image of the snow globe and lightened library feels fully charged by the accumulated atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, charged with ozone and lightning, is vividly realized and strongly shapes both the method (storm-powered upload) and the tone. Environmental specifics—the wet stone, bruised purple sky, optical sensors in the wall—are consistently filtered through Elian’s attention and folded into action rather than sitting as postcard description. Weather and altitude materially constrain the plan: he must be exposed in this high place, at this moment, for the transfer to work. The closing image of the washed-out calm and dripping water recharges the setting as part of the emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “icebound spire above the clouds” and brass elevator are vividly rendered, with weather, altitude, and light working in tight harmony with tone and theme. Details like rime ice, refracted sunlight, and the solarium of glass and sky feel integrated rather than postcard-like. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it strongly charges the imagery of cold vs. warmth and height vs. intimacy. The environment feels specific, lived-in, and conceptually purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and constantly in play: the sky gondola, brass telescope, and impossible upper-atmosphere weather all feel tactile and integrated. Environmental conditions (drift in the ionosphere, psychic clouds, dusty starlight) aren’t just backdrop; they’re the medium of the memories and directly charge the final “library” image. Detail is consistently filtered through his professional and emotional lens, avoiding generic SF trappings. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment shapes meaning more than it constrains concrete choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Tree Trunk Library inside a condemned tenement is vividly realized and never feels like a generic “cool setting”; it shapes both possibilities (hidden safe, curved wooden ceiling) and stakes (dust falling from the illusionary clouds as demolition begins). Environmental detail is selective, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory priorities. The setting charges the final image—the opened sky under earth shaking—rather than remaining postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The antique airship, violet twilight, cedar-scented nursery, and dusty hopscotch grid create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elara’s professional and childlike sensibilities. Setting is not merely decorative: the ship’s rumored history, timbers, and abandoned nursery directly enable the discovery, and the environment (murmurations, magnetic anomaly, creaking hull) charges the final image of the pulsing sphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though somewhat weighted toward the visual. Overall, the world feels specific, lived-in, and thematically aligned with the act of reading hidden geometries.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: “frozen library above clouds,” “bleached ribcage of a leviathan,” and the briny wind in a place that’s never known the sea all create a distinct, coherent world. Environmental features meaningfully constrain action—the ice mirrors attack her psyche, the frozen interior shapes her navigation, the concentrated moonlight literally pins the gears, and the veranda view charges the final image. Details are filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional lens (tools, gears, celestial mechanism) rather than as a tourist catalog. The final hush of morning over the world below is both spatially clear and thematically resonant, with the environment directly reweighted by her success.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and constantly doing work: loose gravity, floating granite arches, and dangling-root orchards all directly shape stakes and imagery. The Nebula of Respite and the bioluminescent butterflies move from backdrop to active participants in the resolution, charging the final image. World rules remain internally consistent and are learned through observation and action rather than exposition dumps. This could edge even higher if more micro-level tactical interaction with the dangerous terrain were dramatized at the climax, rather than primarily evoked beforehand.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hidden lighthouse, the evaporated “ocean of history,” and especially the pane of hush and puppet head create a vivid, coherent end-times environment that feels particular rather than generic. Setting is integrated with action: the pane filters sound into color, then becomes the transmission medium and finally shatters; the lighthouse unspools as the work completes. The micro-setting of tools and objects meaningfully charges the final images (pane breaking, puppet dissolving, darkness no longer empty). The only ceiling here is that the lighthouse’s physical constraints don’t significantly alter tactics beyond metaphorical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, rusting orchard, oil-leaking tree, and vented “pneumatic heart” all feel integrated and lived-in. Environmental constraints (height, birds, frost, cursed fruit, gears) actively shape Silas’s tactics and the ticking-clock structure. The final image of frozen birds and an ice-sheathed maze reframes the whole landscape as a “ruined painting,” charging the ending. A touch more sensory range beyond the visual and mechanical might deepen atmosphere further, but it is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The braided ravine and river are rendered with vivid, sensorial precision and are tightly filtered through a scientist’s eye. Setting isn’t backdrop: the foam patterns, sediment “pauses,” and thin, cold air all shape his thinking and provide the literal mechanism of insight. The chrysalis, ravine, and river jointly charge the final image, giving the ending strong environmental resonance. This integration of physical landscape with interior and conceptual stakes is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Glass Orchard Library and its cloud-sea environment are vividly and consistently realized, with details like glass apples and etched leaves doing strong atmospheric and conceptual work. Setting is filtered through Elian’s professional and metaphysical concerns, so it feels lived-in rather than a backdrop. While the environment does not much constrain tactics, it palpably charges the imagery of erasure and parole and colors the final anticipation of customers. The specificity is high and tonally cohesive without lapsing into mere cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and textured—the "desert fortress after rain," tidal pools, and buried coral pavilion all feel specific and sensorially rich. Environment actively constrains and guides action: the rare deluge and resultant pools are the mechanism by which she locates the hidden structure, and the cold beneath the sand explains the preservation of remorse. Atmospheric tone and world rules are consistent, with the fortress’s physical state mirroring its psychic burden. It stops just shy of 9+ because the final image could lean even harder on a specific environmental detail as a charged object.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the astronomical clock tower, orbital mirrors, and sentient grain elevators are not just backdrop but functional machinery in the plot. The pinecone weight on the master pendulum literally constrains time, and the copper speaking tubes give a concrete channel for her song. World rules remain consistent and are revealed via purposeful detail, like the “borrowed starlight” and the tower’s gear-teethed atrium. While excellent, the environment could press back slightly more on her options to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moonlit canyon and silica-rich gorge are rendered with striking specificity, and the contrast between vast, quiet geology and the psychic storm generates strong atmosphere. The broken periscope mirror functions as a charged tool-object, returning in the climax as the “prism” that conditions what she can perceive. While the environment sets tone more than it constrains tactical choices, it does inflect the final image (canyon vibrating, ground and sky dissolving) in a way that supports the reconfiguration. A slightly tighter causal tie between this exact location and the ritual would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rich, specific, and tightly integrated with action: inverted gravity, frictionless tunnels, threshold seams, and bioluminescent moss all constrain or enable movement and problem-solving. The “serpentine grotto in mist” and “cliffside/floating archipelago” are distinctive and consistently applied; world rules are learned through what she must do, not exposition alone. Environmental constraints (time-limited inversion, need for oblique angles to see light, threshold surfing) shape her tactics and the plot. The density of description occasionally edges toward ornamental, but spatial and rule clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Siskin alder grove, the dead electric towers, and the living alder as resonant chamber create a vivid, integrated environment that feels tactile and rule-bound. The setting directly constrains action: he needs a living alder, a natural cleft, and the oppressive silence for the experiment to matter. Sensory and conceptual details (“silence…like deep water,” siskins as witnesses, moss, porcelain as relic) are filtered through Elian’s musical worldview. The final image—sound rolling through the grove, birds taking flight—recharges earlier atmospheric cues with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Hinterlands ridge, magnetic nexus, auroras, and static-charged air are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elian’s mind as both chessboard and code. Environmental features (cold, static hum, ley-line geography, twilight cycle) are not postcard garnish; they directly shape how he “plays” the valley and decode the silence. The basalt stone operates as a micro-setting object, anchoring abstraction in tactile ritual and charging the final image. World rules around the Covenant and magnetic spirits remain consistent and legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    The shadowed, roofless workshop under cold stars and the impending fireworks are vivid and tonally aligned with the piece’s quiet ritual. Setting details (tuning forks, vacuum tubes, dust motes) are filtered convincingly through Elias’s sensibility and integrated into his process. The environment, however, mostly supports atmosphere rather than constraining what he can do; the story would largely function in a different quiet room, though the open sky and fireworks do charge the final image. Overall, specificity is strong even if functional pressure from setting is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The treetop village, suspension bridges, greenhouse humidity, and pulley-delivered supplies are all vividly rendered and consistently influence detail choices (no parchment because of humidity; constant swaying as existential pressure). The corpse flower’s physicality and smell, plus the wax-treated wrapping paper, are sensorially concrete and filtered through Elara’s expertise and sensitivities. Environment directly charges the final image: the contrast between the ceaselessly moving canopy and the perceived “anchor” in the greenhouse closes the piece. Setting is not mere backdrop; it shapes the central thematic problem and its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: floating rock arches, inverted waterfalls, magnetic storms, and an “orchard planet” all feel specific and sensorially rich. The environment meaningfully constrains choices—Flux disables instruments, forces navigation by water, and requires landing on the underside of a rock. World rules (gravity inversion, magnetic disturbance, sonic concentration) are consistent and revealed through action. At times the descriptive density edges toward luxuriant, but it still serves atmosphere and stakes rather than stalling them.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Stacks are vividly realized—“rusty steel canyons” and fog-shrouded container corridors become an active, menacing environment. The setting isn’t just backdrop; it literally manufactures hazardous wind tunnels and shapes both the past crash and Elara’s current methods. Environmental constraints (fog, height, shifting containers, pressure drops) feed directly into the investigation and the final understanding of “how the city breathed and how it killed.” A touch less descriptive layering in early paragraphs might tighten momentum, but the atmosphere is rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and amber sheet are richly realized and tightly integrated into action—the environment literally curates silence, modulates sound into light, and frames his profession. Details like the ice-thinned ceiling, the “frozen cathedral” architecture, and the way sound fractures into visible ribbons give the piece a powerful atmospheric charge without losing clarity. The setting also conceptually charges the ending, where the hush rebuilds itself and his ongoing duty is framed against the cold, curated void. It stops short of 9+ only because the environment shapes premise and mood more than it forces specific tactical constraints in the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Thunder-echo range and canyon hush are vividly and economically realized; the acoustics, driftwood, dry riverbed, and charred markers all emerge through action rather than static description. The environment meaningfully constrains and charges choice: this is the one place where noise and silence matter at a quasi-physical level, and the final image of the hush transformed and the charred wood grounds the thematic shift. World rules for sound-magic remain consistent and are learned via Silas’s ritual rather than exposition. A few phrases flirt with purple (“acoustically violent gorge,” “avalanchingly quiet”) but do not seriously disrupt clarity or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: topaz walls, jaundiced light, and the vanishing stars create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details evolve with the action—the walls vibrate and glow brighter with psychic feedback, and the final image of the last star dying recharges the cosmic dread. While the workshop doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it absolutely charges tone and the closure image. The integration of world rules (halo fragment, seraph ruins) feels consistent and suggestive rather than expository.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, thin air, and jagged stone are vivid and filtered through Elara’s body and purpose; the environment shapes both the need to climb and the method of activation. Atmospheric detail is rich without becoming incoherent, and the celestial lights directly constrain the magic’s mechanics. The pendant as a recurring object is tightly tied to space (against her collarbone, then lifted into charged air). Some descriptions verge on lyric abstraction, but they still support tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quartz arbor, mist, wet loam, and frost are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s ritual frame, producing a charged, tactile atmosphere. Setting is not postcard: the cold of the arbor actively creates the frost substrate needed for the vision and shapes how the ritual works. The car’s mildew, rust, and glass all carry emotional and thematic weight. Environment and object-as-setting (frosted windshield, prism) clearly charge the final image of the car becoming “just a car again,” which lifts this score.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vivid, specific, and atmospherically rich, and the environment materially shapes the stakes as the silence eats its way inward. The loom, the jigsaw-raft, and the amber bead together function as a micro-setting that constrains Elara’s options—she is bound to this improvised machine in this small clearing as the world collapses. The final image of the tapestry rising from the vanished orchard directly leverages setting for resonance. At this length, the balance between evocative description and functional constraint is unusually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the orchard planet, drifting rock arches, viscous atmosphere, and crystal-wood core all feel particular and coherent. Environmental features actively shape choices (he must go beneath the crust via mine shafts; gravity fluctuations complicate his descent) and charge the final realignment of the arches. Details are generally filtered through Ewan’s task-focused perspective, with tools and stone foregrounded. The world’s rules (gravity wells, bartered awakenings) are sketched efficiently through action rather than expository dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered—dust motes, skeletal starships, oil-stained floor—and the sensory emphasis fits a “sensory map maker” perfectly. Details are selective and purposeful, maintaining atmosphere without bogging the scene. The setting acts more as emotional and conceptual pressure than as a tactical constraint, but the shard drawing blood on the concrete gives the environment a subtle, physical bite at the end. World rules around rifts and sectors are consistent enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the Fresnel lens stopping, the spiral stairs, the “glass-walled chamber” as trap, and the psychic weight of shipwrecks all shape mood and pressure. The haunted lantern room and storm aren’t postcard description; they crowd the characters, justify Thomas’s panic, and make Elias’s small flame feel hard-won. The sea glass as a micro-setting object literally charges the final image, coloring the room and redefining its atmosphere. A slightly broader sense of time/era or physical constraint on fixing the lamp could deepen realism but isn’t structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, storm, glass wick, and stellar beam are richly specific and consistently integrated with action rather than postcard description. The setting constrains choice (he can only work through this tower and its optics) and charges the final image where the lighthouse’s shadow literally “breaks the dawn.” World rules (bio-luminescent age, no print, ether travel) are sketched economically yet feel internally consistent. Atmosphere—emerald light under cold, unblinking stars—perfectly matches the eerie, quasi-religious ritual tone.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock tea house, mist, valley, and sunlight are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elian’s craft-focused perception. Setting is not ornamental: altitude and drifting position make the sun alignment possible and thus constrain his method, and the final image of mist parting to reveal the valley floor charges the thematic closure. Environmental details evolve with the action (light changing color and angle, lanterns swaying under pressure). The world feels specific and lived-in without over-explaining its physics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the storm, spire, hedge-labyrinth, quantified sorrow, and living oaks all feel vivid and integrated. Environment constrains action—he works at night, uses the storm’s lull and a moonbeam, and the hedge literally tears when the blockage is removed. Details are filtered through his maintenance-worker lens (e.g., “mundane miracle,” “plumber fixing a leak”), giving the place lived logic rather than postcard fantasy. World rules are consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the alchemical orchard and greenhouse directly supply the sap, constrain escape routes, and make the mica window the sole exit. Details like “air tasted of copper and ozone,” silver trees, and the abyssal void are strongly filtered through Elara’s perception and mood. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (the need to work inside, then use the single portal). It stops just short of 9-band because, while excellent, it doesn’t further pivot the final image beyond supporting the already-strong act of launching the dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Grand Central Atrium and the hidden bench/fern portal are concrete and economical, and the transformation into mahogany shelves and a silver, glowing tree is vivid without over-explaining. Setting is filtered through Elian’s sensitivity (the “aggressively public” space vs. the library’s soothing quiet), which ties atmosphere to character. The “hidden in plain sight” conceit meaningfully supports the paradox theme, though the library environment itself could exert more practical constraint on choices. Overall, place and mood feel specific and integral rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the overgrown palace, rusted fence, invasive ferns, camouflage netting, rationing logic, and surveillance drones all feel specific and lived-in. Details are consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a noticer of absence, so environment and perception reinforce theme. The tea house and courtyard meaningfully constrain options (concealment from drones) and charge the final image as a fragile sanctuary. Weather and season (biting wind, gray city) support tone without feeling generic.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Frozen Library above bruised clouds, the “quartz hush,” and the brass-and-copper apparatus create a vivid, coherent environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting is filtered through Elara’s professional lens, with tools and atmospheric conditions (cold, altitude, rime on shelves) woven into action. The final image—her alone among “millions of other frozen truths” in eternal winter—recharges the opening setting as a thematic container for entropy and preservation. The environment shapes tone and meaning more than concrete tactical choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial—the brine, barnacles, rotting pier, and shadowy pirate market are consistently filtered through Elara’s familiarity and comfort with such spaces. The “truce of hush” is inseparable from this under-pier market and directly shapes how negotiations happen, not just how they look. Environmental details (darkness, pilings, tide, first sunlight) evolve with the scene and constrain choices, especially her ability to vanish into the labyrinth once she succeeds. Description walks the line toward lushness but remains purposeful and integrally tied to action and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is outstanding: redwood root-votes, neural-woodland interference, and the lavender bluff under aurora all feel specific, integrated, and sensorially rich. Environmental rules (forest democracy warping magnetic fields) directly constrain tactics and justify the emergent compass, not just paint a backdrop. The lavender bluff and aurora are not mere postcards; they embody the “futuristic nostalgia” theme—orbital debris as stars, resurrected plants, and cosmic weather grounded in soil. This is near top-tier, with the only restraint being that the bluff itself doesn’t materially limit her options beyond staging the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly and economically rendered, with the self-emitting violet/blue light and quartz pane doing real narrative work. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it enables the ritual (the hollow in quartz, the backlit paper) and shapes the final image. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through Silas’s sensibility as an artist, keeping it from feeling like a neutral “tour.” A slight tendency toward lushness keeps it just shy of the very top band, but the setting meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly rendered and more than decorative: the dome, failing hydroponics, and plants are all tightly tied to stakes and Elara’s final tactic. Environmental details (chemical storms, mildew-and-ink sub-basement, mossy walls) are selective and filtered through her embodied experience. The plants as both civic infrastructure and future conduit for truth nicely charge the final image. A touch more evolution of setting during the climax could push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the whispering bluff, high-altitude wind, polar-sea iceberg, and hollow brass structure all feed directly into how the sound is generated and propagated. Environmental conditions (thin air, biting wind, sunrise thermodynamics) actively shape the action and make the mechanism plausible within the story’s rules. The iceberg and sculpture recur as charged objects, and the final image of the chimes across an empty sky is strongly grounded in place. A small gap is that the cities below remain a bit abstract; one more concrete, POV-filtered detail of their world could have deepened the atmospheric contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert rose farm under a glass dome is vividly realized and distinctive, with tactile, visual, and atmospheric specifics (“sterile air” vs. “scent of real dust”). The setting does more than backdrop: the dome’s fragility raises the stakes of the psychic storm, and its literal breaking enables Seven’s escape into the harsher, more authentic desert. Recurring objects—the crystalline roses, the shed, the box—are closely tied to his internal state and charge the final image. World rules (geomagnetic reversal, hermetic enclosure, synthetic caretaker) remain consistent and are inferred through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard, wisteria, fountain, and iron pillar are vividly rendered and integrated into action rather than sitting as backdrop; the mailbox-as-pillar is central to the plot and final image. Environmental details (dust shaking from ivy, machinery beyond the wall) effectively shape atmosphere and hint at pressure. That said, aside from the pillar, the physical environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices; the same story could mostly play in any communal yard. The setting’s tonal work is excellent, its functional constraint moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken laboratory and deep-ocean environment are rendered with vivid, selective detail (barnacles, bioluminescent algae, crushing pressure) that is firmly filtered through Elara’s perceptions. Setting constraints meaningfully affect tactics: the water pressure, stale air, and panic-detecting system make her bodily state part of the problem to solve. Key objects (obsidian console, hangman’s dice, the journal) function as a micro-setting cluster that shapes her actions and charges the final image. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, supporting tone and stakes simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The salt crystal growing chamber, supersaturated lake, and jagged ceiling spikes are vividly rendered and tightly intertwined with action and risk, not just decorative. Gravity pockets, salt crusts, and the dead whale’s vibrations all constrain movement and tactics, so environment is an active antagonist. Details like “cathedral of white sodium facets” and the coffee bowl in his hand serve both atmosphere and plot. The setting also thematically mirrors crystallized memory and regret, giving the final image extra charge.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The forest glade, brook, and nocturnal ambience are vividly realized and tightly woven into the magic—sound intervals, water, and stones all matter to his method. The setting’s sensory texture (liquid obsidian, rustling leaves as coded threats) strongly supports tone and concept rather than reading as postcard description. The stream carrying away the wing elegantly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly rendered and tonally apt, with details like “scratches on a developed negative” and the scent of jasmine grounding the surreal premise. The environment mirrors and tensions the theme—false celestial danger versus the real structural lie below—but it rarely constrains physical choices beyond providing a liminal vantage. The Victorian building’s presence as a “speaking” entity is conceptually strong, though it operates more as backdrop than active constraint in the scene. Strong atmosphere and specificity, slightly more aesthetic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet garden is vividly and economically rendered as both environment and mental construct, with details (fabric-moss, static in the air, buried resonance structures) that directly enable the ritual. The garden’s roots as “deep, cold storage” subtly but clearly make the setting a mechanism, not just a backdrop, and the twilight/simulation horizon shift charges the final release. Sensory detail is strong and POV-filtered rather than touristic, especially the tactile strangeness of the moss and the oppressive air. The only restraint on a higher score is that the garden constrains her tactically in only one main mode (the resonance archive) rather than presenting multiple, evolving pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Marble Sanctuary, aurora, ice, stalactites, and clepsydra are richly realized and tightly integrated into mood and action, never reading as a postcard tour. Environmental specifics constrain choices—the freezing air and dripping stone demand stillness and timing—and parallel the emotional clock of atonement. Tools and objects (the iron cylinder, the rose thorn, the clepsydra) operate as micro-settings that both enable and endanger the operation. The final image—“phantom scent of roses in the frozen air”—beautifully recharges earlier setting details to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Serpentine Nexus, sandstone walls, reed-blown air, and cosmic static are vivid and integrated into action, not just backdrop. Acoustic properties of the canyon and the shell aren’t ornamental; they directly shape her method and options, including the need to mask her intrusion with ambient cosmic noise. The environment charges the final image: extracting a voice literally grafted into stone recasts the landscape as a prison. World rules feel consistent at this length, with proper-noun economy largely under control.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cryospheric shrine and candlelit ice are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, and the recurring objects (snow globe, candles, ice) meaningfully charge the final image. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful, creating a strong sense of place that mirrors the story’s thematic concerns with preservation and entrapment. Worldbuilding touches like the global dream-share archives integrate smoothly without derailing atmosphere. The setting rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way, which holds it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly realized: the whispering parapet, post-storm wet stone, tiered sleeping city, and swarming fireflies together create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Details are strongly filtered through Elian’s sensibility (e.g., drainage weeps as “audible friction of the world turning,” rain-laden surfaces as grief), so world-building and character are fused. Environment shapes action in subtle ways—wet flagstones, moonlit paths, parapet height, and wind-driven whispers all inform his movements and perceptions. A touch of descriptive excess occasionally feels ornamental rather than strictly functional, keeping this just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, from “radioactive winds” battering the barrier to the “wasteland orchard” of impossible apples, and these details are filtered through Elias’s rational, technical gaze. The environment meaningfully constrains action: the electromagnetic shield, storms, and central lab device directly shape the stakes and tactics. The diamond and the orchard recur to charge the final image of him walking back through “the silent trees.” A slight excess of familiar apocalypse imagery keeps this just short of the very top tier, but it is strong and functional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is striking and specific—“stormlit observatory above the clouds,” “cobalt glass portico,” steam engines, clockwork starlings—and consistently filtered through Silas’s perspective. Environment and objects do real work: the tower’s altitude and isolation enforce his separation from the revolution he’s steering, and the portico’s rattling and blue glow charge the emotional beats and final image. World rules feel coherent and are learned through implication rather than clunky exposition. The setting doesn’t overtly constrain tactical options in-scene, but it deeply charges mood and the thematic divide between control tower and streets.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: the “feral loft beneath the dunes,” sand-glass skylight, and buried skyscraper spires shape atmosphere and the ritual’s acoustics. Environmental conditions (dawn light, desert wind through ruins) are not just backdrop but necessary components of the spell-like procedure. Objects-as-setting—the jars and music box—are tactile and repeatedly engaged, charging the final image of the rekindled song. The only ceiling is that the physical space doesn’t sharply constrain options beyond timing and isolation; it enriches more than it pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina, rime-crusted gantry, and ozone-and-rot air create a vivid, multi-sensory environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The cold, the ice, and the spectral pressure all constrain Elias’s choices (gloves off, full-body resonance, urgency as light fades). The lighthouse-as-machine and harbor-as-haunted body are tightly woven into action, not just atmosphere. Setting also charges the final image: a frozen, once-violent harbor now calmed under blue night.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly realized and tightly bound to the tactic—ice, altitude, grounding rods, and lunar position all constrain what is possible. Details feel filtered through Elara’s professional eye (lines of power, resonance, moon paths), avoiding mere scenic tourism. Weather and season are not decorative; the frozen lake and post-squall wetness are prerequisites for the plan. The final image of the broken viaduct over the ice and the “winter frost” revolution cleanly recharges the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel environment is vivid and oppressive, with humidity, dripping water, infrasound, and the lantern all integrated into action and perception rather than static description. The setting directly constrains both the hazard (psycho-acoustic resonance) and the solution (heritage-site closure), and the final image of the lantern as “sentinel in the dark” is charged by what we’ve learned. Professional perception (scanner, structural physics) filters description in a character-specific way. World rules about water tables and infrastructure feel consistent and plausible at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The antique music box repair shop is vividly rendered—“cathedral of stopped time,” “golden gloom,” dust motes in sudden light—and it feels intrinsically tied to the premise. The environment isn’t just decorative: the shop’s specialized tools and other music boxes enable the heart’s reactivation, and the final image of the beating mechanism is inseparable from this setting. The light through the newly opened drapes physically alters the room’s atmosphere at a key turn. World rules around clockwork hearts and resonance engines feel consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The acid sea and decaying gears-and-cogs workshop are richly evoked and functionally constrain options: corrosion creates a ticking clock, and the junkyard cathedral provides the specific materials and risks that shape tactics. Environmental and object details (kaleidoscope, obsidian arrow tip, upper-atmosphere buoy) are recurrent and charge the final image rather than feeling like postcard scenery. World rules stay intuitively consistent despite the surrealism, and the setting’s menace and wonder mirror the thematic ascent from refuse to rarefied silence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The archive’s physical and metaphorical framing (“profiles drifted like shipwrecks in the dark,” “obsidian console,” the hovering drone) creates a vivid, tonally unified environment. Setting details are filtered through Silas’s professional and emotional lens, and the mission patch functions as a meaningful micro-setting object that charges the final image. World rules about deletion vs archiving are coherent and shown via discovery rather than exposition. A bit more tactile interaction with the physical space under pressure could further root the climax, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse orchard above grinding ice floes and the cluttered interior full of mirrors, clocks, and letters are richly specific and tonally precise. These details are well-filtered through Kaelen’s consciousness and support the metaphysical premise without exposition. The environment symbolically charges the final image (the grinding ice seeming to stop), though it rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics. Strong atmosphere and consistency justify a high score despite mostly thematic rather than practical pressure from setting.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid, specific, and thematically charged—the frozen surge trapping yachts, groaning ice, and wind all echo his suspended state. Environmental details are consistently integrated into action (trawling debris, numbness from the cold) rather than feeling like a backdrop. The parasol tip functions as a charged object-as-setting that concretely reorients his understanding and anchors the final image against his chest. Weather and texture (wind, ice, slurry, reeds) shape both mood and what he can do, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tonally unified: mist, fermentation on the air, the “amber pavilion” of aging glass, and the sleeping vineyard form a coherent atmosphere that mirrors and supports the emotional arc. Environmental elements participate in the closure—the bus’s absence, the cold, and the wind through the pavilion that carries off the burned letter charge the final image. Details feel filtered through Elias’s connection to the land, integrating occupation with mood. This is a major strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is vivid, specific, and tightly interwoven with action: whisperfield calm, kinetic parapet, and the Murmuring Pavilion all constrain choices and tactics. Environmental details like vibrating stone in his teeth, wind that must be parted by conjured clearings, and shadows wrapping the knowledge feel purposeful rather than decorative. World rules (illusions that break the mind, sentient stone requiring intent) are consistent and learned in motion. This is publication-grade atmosphere; only slightly broader sensory range and evolution of space under pressure would move it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are rendered with strong sensory specificity (floral oil, metallic oxidation, vines climbing, iron skeleton) and are tightly interwoven with the ritual and the final image. The environment genuinely constrains and charges the action: the ruined machinery must visually align with the photograph’s arc, and the final sculpture-like ruin-in-bloom is what makes the ending land. This integration of setting with theme and closure is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library at dawn, the ruined dome, bioluminescent moss, and sound-perfect architecture are vividly rendered and tightly woven with Elias’s perceptions. Setting is not just backdrop: acoustics enable his choice to testify, light progression mirrors his cognitive “seeing,” and the moss’s physical sprawl embodies the thematic challenge to linear text. The crystal functions as a micro-setting/tool, shaping how he can act within the room. This is nearly exemplary; the only small gap is that the environment constrains less than it enables—there’s little sense that the space could resist or endanger him.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Fog Sculpture Garden and its trash-topography are rendered with striking, purposeful specificity—VHS walls, towers of tires, CRTs, driftwood, chalk—creating a palpable, original environment. Setting is not merely decorative: the decaying videotapes and magnetic hiss directly embody and literalize the story’s thematic concern with memory’s erosion and charge the final image. Environment and objects genuinely constrain and shape behavior (he must navigate the landfill and use found driftwood to compensate for his forgetfulness). This integration of place, texture, and concept is sophisticated enough to reach the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Spire, the thin ozonic air, the groaning mountain, and the brass mechanism are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action—the quake, altitude, and precarious hatch all constrain his choices. Tools and environment (the spinning hand, jars of screws, telescope tube) shape tension rather than sitting as backdrop. World rules feel consistent and are learned through use, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Radiant Haven above the clouds, the glass walls, and the medical machinery create a distinctive, atmospheric micro-world that’s strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Sensory detail—especially the impossible “scent of hope”—is purposeful and thematic rather than decorative. The environment, however, mostly colors mood rather than constraining action; this could nearly occur in a more conventional hospice without changing choices. The cello and vinyl shard function as charged objects that do some of the work “setting as constraint” might otherwise do.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the floating isle, nocturnal observatory, and twisted constellations directly condition what Elara can attempt and how the machine behaves. Details like “tides” of magic that erase short-term memory and the post-spoon, circular logic of power are integrated into her tactics rather than feeling like ornament. Tools and environment (the brass key, silver circuitry, dome aperture) constrain action and culminate in the charged final image of shadows pooling beneath her under the artificial sun. The atmosphere of hushed, strange, post-logic decadence is strong and consistent, though it could press a bit harder on her body and senses in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hedge maze, fog, and secret garden are vivid and tonally apt, giving the scene a liminal, fairy-tale atmosphere that suits the changeling premise. Details like the moss bed, ancient roses, and boxwood layers feel specific and consistently filtered through Aris’s perspective. However, the environment mostly serves mood and symbolism rather than concretely constraining choices—this could largely play in any secluded room. Still, the sense of hiddenness and ritual approach through the maze subtly charges the final sanctuary-like confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The serpentine grotto, wet sand, mist, and tide-harvested sea glass create a tactile, coherent micro-world that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Setting is fully filtered through Elara’s priorities as a “star watcher” forced below ground, so the cave and fog mirror her inner displacement from the sky. Crucially, the damp stone and saline air participate in the conflict, becoming tools she uses to ground herself when panic hits. The final image of a “constellation” of safe lights in the dark leverages these environmental elements to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moss-eaten data center is vivid, specific, and multi-sensory—wet stone, ozone, stalactites, condensation—and it’s continually used (Elias gardening, Mara nesting, the breached roof causing the pivotal drip pattern). The setting is not a postcard; it actively shapes tactics and imagery, culminating in the amber/seed and moss as living rebuttals to the dead grid. Environmental logic stays consistent and carries thematic weight without overt explanation. This is very close to top-tier work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “feral nexus in mist,” the river-like narrative current, and the rainy bridge are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s writerly consciousness. The environment meaningfully constrains action: he must fight the current of the plot, wade through the “gelatinous flow,” and rely on the shell as an anchor between mist-space and scene-space. The mist’s hush and the echoing screams of abandoned characters concretely mirror his guilt and artistic violence. The charged reprise of the nexus and the glowing shell at the end gives the setting real weight in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The verdant arbor, dawn light, damp earth, and celestial mechanics are richly rendered and consistently filtered through Elian’s practical-mystical gaze. Setting is not postcard-only: the arbor supplies the vital vine, the trellis constrains his options, and the timing of moon and sun governs his tactics. Environmental details (dewy morning, valley air, filtered light) evolve with the action and charge the final image of a changed atmosphere in the valley. The world’s magical rules (moonlight translated via living wood and prisms) feel coherent and are learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly rendered and thematically apt, with cold, dead trees and crater rim mirroring the frozen, residual pulse Silas seeks. Details like the knee-deep snow, blackened branches, and discarded organic debris are not just decorative—they become tools and anchors in the ritual. The environment imposes physical conditions (cold, isolation, twilight) that color every action even if they don’t strongly constrain choice. Setting and atmosphere are a major strength and charge the final image of him leaving with the orchard’s heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marble cavern is richly imagined and tightly integrated: its acoustics, stone geometry, and single shaft of daylight all directly shape Elias’s method and are necessary to the “harvest of echoes.” Sensory detail is purposeful rather than touristic, and the environment evolves—from echo-charged cathedral to “mere geology”—in sync with the plot turn. The outside “wounded season” and snow give temporal/atmospheric counterpoint that charges the final image. This is high-level setting work, though the lushness sometimes leans toward aesthetic pleasure over additional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and deeply integrated: the bronze grotto as ribcage, the frost line, meltwater, and fissure are not mere decoration but frame how the magic works (requiring a beam of starlight, the timing of snowmelt). Sensory specificity is strong—pressure of silence as “shingled hush,” the damp chill, oxidizing floor—filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment constrains options (she must align the burner to the cosmos through the fissure) and charges the final calm. It’s excellent atmospheric worldbuilding that also shapes action, though it stops just short of using the environment to force a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the rain-beaded skylight, converted loft, old circus costumes, and battered kettle all feel lived-in and emotionally charged. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s history (the loft as former troupe storage turned sanctuary) and echo the themes of transience and endurance (rain as ghost applause, winter-hardened tree in the ash). The environment and objects meaningfully charge the final image: the rain-blurred outside world, the kettle, and the wood block all reappear with reweighted meaning. The only thing keeping this just short of the very top is that the physical space doesn’t significantly constrain her choices beyond mood and temporal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Kinetic Lagoon, invisible air platforms, and halted Carousel are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Jaren’s perceptions, creating a distinctive atmosphere. World rules—static rain, frozen sky, captured stories—remain coherent and are learned through his movement and tools rather than exposition. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (lagoon as trapped energy mirroring his trapped regret, camera wheel as micro-tool/setting-object), even if it constrains tactics only lightly. Detail density is high but rarely gratuitous, maintaining immersion without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport layered with carnival detritus is vividly realized and tightly filtered through Elias’s professional and ideological gaze. Environmental systems (drainage, pneumatic lines, hologram array) directly shape tactics, and the final star-map over trash is a charged, memorable image. Specifics like terrazzo, faux-velvet ropes, and synth-cotton candy efficiently build atmosphere without clutter. The setting feels indispensable rather than skin swapped onto a generic ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the Soundless Sanctuary, glacial hush, quartz plaza, and post-storm petrichor all filter through Elian’s sensibility and directly mirror his inner conflict. The environment does real work—silence and crystallized sound define both his role and the forbidden draw of the forecourt, and the rain physically unlocks the vibrations he seeks. Weather, stone, and architecture evolve with the action (from wet resonance to drying silence), and the final image of sun drying the stones charges the closure. At times the density of description flirts with overload but rarely stalls momentum, staying mostly in service to mood and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight barge canal, oily water, brick embankments, and industrial skyline are vivid and integrated into action rather than pasted on. Environment and tools (winch, barge, radio, sundial) constrain his tactics—night work, dawn deadline, solitary salvage—and the sun’s ray plus canal setting charge the final image. Sensory detail is strong and purposeful, though a touch more evolution of the physical environment as the scene progresses could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Golden Wharf, snow, fog, rope, and harbor are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly supports mood. Environment and tool (the fulgurite, the rope) are deeply integrated into action, not just backdrop. Weather and cold subtly constrain his movements and perception, and the final “oceanic hush” image recharges the whole setting. This is publishable-level atmosphere with only minimal over-lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the hilltop estate, shadowed garden, harbor, and encroaching winter all mirror and pressure the emotional state. The autumn garden and decaying marble are not postcard details; they’re woven into action (lengthening shadows, falling leaves as surrender) and culminate in the house “inhaling” at the end. Seasonal and spatial constraints (last ship, stranded for winter) add a subtle but real situational pressure. The recurring garden imagery charges the final image with a rich, elegiac weight.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: an obsidian palace hanging from stalactites over an abyss, trembling with subterranean gears and smog-choked air. Environmental conditions directly constrain the outcome—the toxic atmosphere and mechanical world kill what he revives—so place is not just decorative but determinative. Details like the palace swaying on chains and stalactites weeping “mineral tears” both mirror and pressure Valerius’s suspended state between past and future. This integration of atmosphere, constraint, and theme is exemplary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the obsidian lagoon, dunes, migrating clouds, and volcanic sand aren’t postcard backdrop but the operating conditions of the ritual. The lagoon’s darkness, stillness, and density, plus the sand’s origin (fire and water) directly constrain the method Elara uses. The final image—the lagoon humming, coin clicking against submerged stone—leans on these environmental specifics to charge the closure. Sensory detail is lush yet coherent, with a strong, unified atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “City of Forgotten Fountains” and the Grand Cistern are richly specific and integrated, from “dry basins and silent spouts” to “psychic plumbing” and dust as currency. Setting isn’t backdrop; the dead fountains and clogged infrastructure directly mirror and motivate Elara’s task and thinking. The paused geese and bruised twilight sky charge both the opening and closing images. Environment constrains choice (no water, no brute-force solution) and charges the final release, though there’s still a small sense of ornamental flourish in places.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Nebula Garden is rendered with vivid, idiosyncratic specificity—“ribboned expanse,” “shedding petals” of plasma—and these details are filtered through Xylos’s sensibility. The environment is not just backdrop: its silence, thickness, and hidden crystal “stalks” justify the sonar method and shape his navigation. The setting also meaningfully charges the final image, as the same garden becomes coldly luminous rather than burning. A slight bias toward visual and metaphorical description over tactile constraint keeps this from the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse, dusk light, overgrown ferns, glass, and butterflies are richly specific and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a carver and mourner. The environment actively shapes action (ladder to ceiling, condensation on glass, moth at the pane) and charges the final image with the last migration flight. The ribbon and tools also function as micro-setting, constraining what he can do and how he learns. A slight risk of over-lush description is kept mostly in check, and nearly every detail contributes to tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: the tidal obsidian ridge mirrors his inner fracture, while the tower’s hot, friction-thick air and machinery feel lived-in and constraining. Crucially, the micro-setting of the pendulum and clockworks directly shapes tactics—he cannot stop the clock, must work within the swing, and must physically interact with the bob in a hazardous way. Details are selective, atmospheric, and colored by Silas’s professional and moral obsessions rather than reading as a tourist catalog. The environment’s tone (unforgiving, sharp, black glass and brass) consistently supports the thematic weight of guilt and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly imagined and integrated: “velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo under stars,” and the spiraling spectrum of shrouds create a distinctive, coherent world filtered through Silas’s gardener sensibility. Environmental details (hanging memories, organized by hue and sorrow) align with the work he’s doing and mirror the thematic concern with categorizing grief. The world rules—lives as tapestries, echoes in threads—are absorbed through action rather than exposition and remain internally consistent. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, which keeps it just below the very top tier, but it powerfully shapes atmosphere and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Obsidian Spire, thin air, and frozen lake are vividly evoked and tonally aligned with Elian’s isolation and the starkness of his choice. Environmental details are well-filtered through his perspective as a data-driven, quasi-mystic bureaucrat. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete options; the decision could almost occur in any sealed office with a view, so atmosphere outweighs functional pressure. The recurring objects—the vellum, quill, obsidian—do charge the final image even if they don’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and integral: the ember alcove, geothermal vents, and mist are not just ornamental but shape tactics (hidden heat pocket, fog that may reveal or conceal the glow, drones sweeping for signatures). World-building details like the “story famine,” nutrition blocks, and Silence Brigades are specific and coherent, taught through action rather than infodumps. Environmental elements recur to charge key choices, especially the risk of violet light bleeding into the fog. The density of description sometimes leans lush, but it remains purposeful and grounded in Elian’s priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, endlessly receding floorboards, marble bowl, and antique rocker create a vivid, idiosyncratic space that’s integral rather than decorative. Setting actively constrains action: the rocker provides the temporal trigger; the stone floor and powdered ash enable the ephemeral portrait; the vanishing point absorbs the scattered dust in the final image. Details are tightly curated and filtered through the ritual’s mood, supporting the “metaphysical architecture” without overexplaining it. This environment directly charges the last image of dust drifting toward infinity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ruined port city and sewer underworld are vividly rendered with concrete, purposeful detail (sedimentary layers of “plague-ridden bone, rotted velvet, and industrial rust”). Setting is tightly bound to action: the breached sea walls create the silt layers he must dig through; the sewers enforce his exile from the priests’ “purified” surface; the ventilation shafts carry the ticking upward, literally transmitting his heresy. The environment doesn’t just decorate but channels the thematic clash between buried mechanics and surface myth.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Velvet Library, its heavy curtains, and the autumn outside are richly specific and consistently filtered through Elian’s artistic sensibility. Environment and object-as-setting (the rosette, the velvet walls) do more than decorate: the thick walls, the absorbing fabric, and the rosette’s aperture all shape how sound can exist and be focused in the room. The recurring contrast of muffled city noise and interior potential charges the climax. This is near top-tier atmospheric work, though the library stops short of overtly constraining physical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted greenhouse, twin moons, and sensory-laden “emotional terroir” build an atmosphere that’s both specific and thematically charged. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s culinary and mnemonic sensibility (composted books, shredded love letters, trauma-soaked soil) in a way that directly affects the plant’s behavior and his tactics. The celestial alignment and broken roof are not just pretty; they enable the explosive growth and the final charged image of him in the rusted shell awaiting sunrise. This is rich, integrated worldbuilding with clear constraints, just shy of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    World-building is vivid and specific: “bruised apricot” sky, “nectar dusk,” drone beehive hail, and the steel Lightning Collection Tower all feel particular and coherent. The tower isn’t just backdrop; it houses the (nonexistent) fix and offers the view that charges the final image. Details are filtered through Silas’s sensibility, pairing technical elements (hive mind, backup protocol) with sensory, almost devotional attention to light. The environment meaningfully shapes both options (tower as only control point) and theme (clear sky after drones) without feeling expository.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quiet bay, sodium streetlights, mossy stones, and Victorian house are vivid and sensorially specific, with the environment consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting and object-as-setting (the porch, the root, the streetlights) actively charge the final image, especially the root left as a “sentinel” and the lights surrendering to dawn. Weather, tide, and architecture all echo the thematic concern with silence, decay, and liminality without slipping into blunt allegory. The setting doesn’t quite coerce specific tactical choices beyond enabling the root’s presence, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater city garden is vividly and economically rendered—the pressure of depth, overgrown plaza, stone figures with sea fans like “misplaced lungs,” bioluminescent vine, and mirrored sarcophagus architecture all feel specific and integrated. Setting is not postcard-like; it directly supplies the means of revelation (vine, crack, mirrors) and shapes tone and stakes (a graveyard that is actually a nursery). World rules for the foxglove-slumber and stone-vault bodies are consistent enough for this length. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of Elara moving toward the dais with the ampoule.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The infinite staircase is vividly and economically rendered—“hazy vertical abyss,” “boundless confinement”—and clearly constrains options, forcing Elian toward conceptual rather than physical escape. Details like chalk on limestone, thin air, and the void’s silence create a strong, oppressive atmosphere aligned with the theme. The environment also participates in the climax, shuddering and crumbling as the logic fails, so setting is not static backdrop. A slightly broader sensory range or evolving environmental detail under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The smog-choked city and fragile rooftop greenhouse are vividly rendered and meaningfully opposed, with the greenhouse’s elevation and glass wall functionally enabling his city-wide “inscription.” Environmental features (smog, altitude, moonlight piercing soot, condensation on glass) directly shape his tactics and the story’s climactic image of light answering light. Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, with the “saffron quiet” and industrial haze reinforcing tone and theme rather than serving as mere ornament. World rules feel internally consistent for this low-tech/magical hybrid.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto city, frozen waterfall, rose-scented decay, and dry oven-lit annex are intensely specific and sensorial, with details always POV-filtered through Elian’s curator’s eye. Environment is not postcard backdrop: the waterfall’s thaw and the resulting humidity directly create the central problem, while the ovens and dryness enable the solution. The contrast between rosewater perfume and toasted grain in the final act gives the setting a thematic as well as physical role. This is top-tier atmospheric work, just shy of flawless because a few rich details verge on luxuriant rather than necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the rocky island, jagged shoreline, hunger stone, and Fresnel lens all shape what Elias can do and charge the final image. The lighthouse isn’t just backdrop; its lens and height are integral tools for amplifying the latent radiance and affecting the tide. Sensory detail (brine, exposed decay, storm clouds, screaming wind) supports the bleak, uncanny tone without losing spatial clarity. The final image of the blazing light and submerged stone crystallizes the story’s stakes through environment and object.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The funhouse is vividly realized with tactile, olfactory, and visual specificity—“wet sawdust and ancient, crystallized sugar,” the Hall of Giants, the distorted mirror—and all of this is filtered through Elias’s altered perception. Setting meaningfully constrains tactics: he uses the maze and the lingering luminance to choose paths and test the ground, and the mirror as the literal interface with the void. The final image of the funhouse as “just an empty ruin” reweights the earlier grotesquerie and charges the setting with thematic resonance. World rules for the post-resuscitation distortion stay consistent and are shown through sensory experience rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, original, and deeply integrated: the driftwood orchard, shipwreck grafts, Great Trunk, and storm-lashed ocean all constrain and enable Elara’s tactics. Environmental forces (wind paths, waves, the hollow oak) materially shape how her resonance works and how the storm is diverted. Sensory detail is rich and mostly purposeful, with weather and sea state continually affecting action. Line by line it leans lush, but the world feels coherent and lived-in rather than like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the sun that “flayed” the city, the silica ocean, and the turtle-shell architecture are not postcard details but actively shape mood and possibility. The shell surface and its spirals function as a micro-setting that literally encodes the plot’s revelation, and the city’s precarious perch on living/machine beasts frames the offering logic. Environmental constraints—the heat, absence of shadow, slow lurching movement—reinforce “sunwashed dread” and Elara’s sense of entrapment. The final image of the “artificial sun” beating down on her recharges earlier imagery and clearly charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    The disused railway station, ivy, shattered glass roof, and rosebush are vivid, sensorial, and filtered through Elara’s analytic perspective, creating a strong, lived-in atmosphere. The environment is not mere backdrop: the ivy and cracked pillars actively structure her argument and charge the final image, and the stalled “train of history” metaphor reweights the entire setting at the end. Spatial orientation (tracks, bench, pillars, rosebush) is clear, and the physical decay mirrors the political decay without feeling like a generic ruin. This is near–publish-ready setting work; what keeps it just shy of the top band is that environmental constraints remain symbolic rather than shaping physical tactics in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the story’s great strength: the sinking district, the skeletal Grand Pavilion, chest-deep water, barnacles, and hydraulic cement are all vividly tactile and filtered through Elias’s professional eye. Environment constrains action (wading, clearing the fissure, dealing with algae and suction) and mirrors the thematic decay without blunt symbolism. Tools and objects (lantern, inkwell, vial, trowel) are integrated into both atmosphere and plot. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the setting, while beautifully drawn, could press his choices even harder than it does.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater metropolis and forgotten library are vividly evoked through specific, purposeful details—bioluminescent algae, reinforced glass, cavitating pumps, subtle floor vibrations. Setting is not just backdrop: the blackout and resulting stillness literally enable the decryption, and the sunken, lowest-tier location underscores both physical and social depth. Environmental cues mirror theme without feeling forced (noise vs silence, artificial light vs faint organic glow). World rules are consistent and legible at this length, though a hair more tactile interaction with the environment under oxygen threat could have pushed this into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the floating tea garden, blinding light, gravity-glass chains, and Glass Basilica all cohere into a lived-in metaphysical environment. Details are filtered through Elias’s priorities (updrafts for flight, Basilica as prison), and the world’s rules (shadow detachment, descending-while-ascending) are shown rather than explained. Crucially, the environment and objects (garden edge, wind, Basilica) charge and shape the final image of the crane “diving downward to fall upward,” satisfying the 9-band gate for charged setting even if not quite flawless. A slight excess of ornament in some descriptive phrases is the only minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Floating Observatory, zero-g, cooling breakers, and viewport aren’t just wallpaper; they actively constrain tactics and timing—he needs silence, darkness, and the brief breaker window to access the “unhappened.” The Geode and viewport act as micro-setting anchors that charge the final image of him grabbing the override key. The physicality of the environment (ticking metal, groaning observatory, tears floating) keeps the abstract physics grounded. A touch more tactile interaction with the station’s threat (e.g., hinted risk to his own survival) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “bruising purple” sky, crumbling observatory, and “bones of history” all feel specific and filtered through Elara’s gaze. Environment and tools (mountain altitude, observatory dome, telescope, receiver, drone) directly constrain her choices and enable the final act of decoding. The “brilliant dimness” motif nicely fuses atmosphere with theme and reappears meaningfully at the end. A tiny limitation is that weather/altitude discomfort could have been used even more to exert physical pressure, but what’s here is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: the Cobalt Terrace, the salt-slick steps, the “psychic refuse” driftwood, and the “sieved hush” of the ocean all reinforce the story’s mood and stakes. Environmental elements actively shape the experience—the driftwood generates false memories and the uncanny beach becomes the medium of his penance. The gold watch hand as found object then charges the landscape with conceptual weight. This is just shy of the very top tier because the environment constrains emotion and perception more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The parapet, mist, storm-worn stone, and void are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Silas’s attention, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The setting does more than decorate: the isolated, crumbling tower as neutral ground underscores the precariousness of the truce, and physical conditions (slick stones, wind, the boy nearly collapsing) shape on-page action. The obsidian pedestal and its gears provide a tactile, spatially coherent locus for the climax, dovetailing with the drawer pull as a tool-in-setting. While the environment could constrain tactics even more directly, it already meaningfully charges the final image and worldfeel.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and functional: fog, freezing surf, and the coastal grid all materially constrain and guide his choices. The environment shifts from ocean/sky (his old domain) to the “man-made constellation” of poles, directly charging the central metaphor and final image. The recurring objects—the compass, kayak, utility poles, and wires—are well integrated and reappear in the ending as charged elements, not mere scenery. Sensory detail (smell of brine/decay, transformer hum, scraping hull) is selective and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered and tonally apt, with strong sensory detail (“inverted cosmos of stalactites and radiant moss”) that feels filtered through his jaded eye. The setting is not mere postcard; it becomes the Oracle/Source that visualizes branching timelines and receives the sacrificed baseball, directly charging the final image. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned through action (the lake “began to swirl” as an active presence). A touch more tactile interaction—how the cavern’s physical constraints affect his body or movement—could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard and its “permanent moonlight” and ink-like shadows are vividly specific and tightly filtered through Elian’s experience, generating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details like the heat through his boots and the immovable shadows deepen the sense of suspended time and high stakes, rather than feeling like a catalog. Tools and micro-setting (censer, powders, sky) are integrated into action rather than stopping it. The orchard’s rules are more atmospheric than constraining of choice, which keeps this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is not mere backdrop; its “choking beauty,” cold starlight, and isolation mirror and intensify his emotional state and the theme of unreachable time. Environmental and object details (frost-kissed turf, glowing grass, porcelain saucer, ink) are filtered through his ritual focus and charge the final image of him pretending the answer is “still hidden in the clouds.” The world’s numinous rules (ink as reality-seeping agent, sky as judge) remain consistent and legible. The setting meaningfully shapes the concept of cloudbound repentance and the impossibility of physically retrieving what he seeks, which is why it reaches the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Cenotaph is vividly evoked as a “recycled spaceship cobbled together from the rusted hulks” with the dying reactor hum and blast door anchoring space and tone. Environment constrains options: he hides from scavengers in vents, does the ritual on the cold deck, and must literally float to the door. Objects-as-setting (Kwan Yin’s tear, the blast door) meaningfully charge the final image. The world’s larger war-torn history is sketched just enough to support the mood without turning into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and celestial conjunction are rendered with strong sensory specificity and integrated into action (bare feet forcing a stop, the tidal pool mirroring the stars, the groaning mountain responding). The environment materially shapes the plot and the final image: without heat, tide height, and volcanic threat, the coincidences and payoff would not cohere. World rules (bioluminescent bugs soothing magma, tectonic plates “listening”) stay internally consistent in a mythic mode. A slight trim of metaphor density in description could further tighten momentum without sacrificing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Luminous Fort, its oppressive floodlights, the twilight sky, and especially the photoreactive sundial are vivid and purposeful, not decorative. Environmental rules (the lamps, the blackout, the UV-reactive paint, the hidden gnomon grooves) directly constrain and enable Elara’s choices. The setting evolves with the plot—the garden’s atmosphere shifts, the Cradle’s hum replaces the usual generators, the fort’s light changes meaning at the end. World specificity feels integrated rather than dumped, with the fort’s architecture and surveillance grid charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated: the tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless earth, magnetic boots, and sky-eels all constrain what Oren can do and how he does it. World rules (no friction, magnetic field lines, dense star dust) are dramatized through action rather than dumped, and the aurora/eel environment literally supplies the resource he must harness. The final image—aurora flaring over a briefly stable circle on a sliding ocean—charges the environment with thematic weight. Description verges on lush but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit observatory, glass floor, and churning clouds create a vivid, specific, and atmospheric setting that is consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Weather, height, and the glass dome aren’t just decorative; they synchronize with the “masks slip” hour and charge the final image of lightning illuminating scars on paper and sky. Sensory details (ozone, ether fumes, toxic green dial) are purposeful and never feel like a tourist catalog. The environment’s constraint is more thematic than logistical, but it’s strong enough to power the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vivid, concrete, and filtered through Silas’s priorities, with good sensory contrast between the tranquil outside and violent interior. Crucially, setting and objects constrain tactics: the shaft of light, the atrium’s glass, and the sundial’s geometry are all necessary to decode the message and to trap Kael’s blade. The recurring needle tin and sundial charge the final configuration of bodies and options in the space. World details feel coherent and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined library and “violet bruise of the atmosphere” are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with the skeletal roof and moonlight charging the final image. Setting is not mere backdrop: the fissure in the foundation dictates where seeds go, and the decayed library becomes the literal medium of their resistance. The environment’s transformation into a “living library” tightly couples place and theme. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual could push this even higher, but the atmosphere is already rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings—the doomed transit station and the tidal arbor above the clouds—are vivid, specific, and tonally unified, with details like “bruised purple” sky and “tides” of cumulonimbus doing double duty as atmosphere and metaphor. Objects-as-setting (piano, projector, clock) strongly charge the environment and constrain the options available. World rules around the pocket dimension depending on the projector’s bulb are clear and meaningfully limit time. The final image of darkness as applause is heavily charged by the sensory groundwork of light, horizon, and cloud-tides.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly textured and specific—the “spine of the world,” bruised-purple air, opera-singing orchids—and clearly filtered through Elian’s professional gaze. Environmental rules (shifting reality, need for “objectively real” soil, approaching monsoon) are consistent and matter directly to his choices. Weather and terrain constrain him: he must discern true granite beneath seductions before the storm erases everything. The ridge, the kaleidoscope, and the fissure where he plants the seed all charge the final image rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The breezy islet after rain, wet basalt, and cerulean sky are vividly rendered and consistently refracted through Silas’s emotional state. Objects-as-setting—the compass, lace, and bonsai—are integrated into the environment and charge the final image (blue-tinted needles, quiet sea holding secrets). Weather and sea are not just backdrop; the “tides of remembrance” literally rise to his boots and deliver the voices, tying setting to the magic’s mechanics. The only slight cap is that the physical landscape doesn’t much constrain his options beyond providing isolation and proximity to the sea.

    The setting is vivid and functional; the rising tide creates necessary urgency that constrains the exchange. The juxtaposition of the industrial subway tunnel and the natural reef creates a striking, specific atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the specific interaction of bioluminescence and shadow is integral to the plot's turning point. However, the initial description relies on heavy adjectival stacking ("symphonic resonance," "obsidian gloom") that distances the reader before the mechanics engage.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "bruised purple sky" and "wet ivory stones" establishing a melancholic atmosphere. The environment exerts some pressure on the mood, though it could more directly constrain the protagonist's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric details like "ozone and finality" and the "starlit vault" effectively establish a tone of urban magical realism. The setting actively frames the metaphysical stakes, though the "arrows in the pavement" element reads a bit literally against the more surreal backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, effectively using specific details like "grey giants" and "briny scent" to ground the mysticism in a physical reality. However, the opening relies on standard descriptors ("wind howled," "crashing surf") that could be more distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    The personification of the setting ("holding its breath," "rejecting his presence") creates a vivid, reactive environment that functions almost as a secondary character. The "rolling sea of glass" is a strong, specific image that grounds the abstract sci-fi concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    Specific details like the "porcelain embalming sink" and "chemical warmth" ground the scene effectively. However, abstract descriptors like "sterile world" and "paradoxical tone" tell the reader how to feel rather than evoking the atmosphere through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, contrasting the "organic elegance" of the bonsai with the "ugly and utilitarian" lamp effectively. The atmospheric details of the dawn transition anchor the magic system well, though the description occasionally veers into slightly purple territory ("blooming labyrinth").

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is realized with vivid, textural specificity ("fluctuating canyon of red and blue metal"), effectively grounding the surreal existence. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's life and movement, though the description occasionally drifts into abstract summation ("vaults of erased histories") rather than sticking to sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, from the "unvarnished spruce" to the "pale calcium" of the shell. The atmosphere of dissolution effectively mirrors the internal stakes, though the "closing pages" metaphor leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength, blending industrial grit ("wet iron") with specific, imaginative mechanics (the water-refraction basin). The sensory details effectively ground the protagonist’s blindness in a tangible, haptic world, though the "mist-coated" opening leans slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but the mechanic of the story's resolution; the temperature differential between the "frozen lake" and the "rusted outpost" physically enables the condensation map. Sensory details like the wire frames biting the nose and the "heavy, suspended breath" create a visceral, specific atmosphere that constrains and charges the action.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Auditory details are specific and grounded (the groan of the archway, the resonant thud of the boot), effectively supporting the central mechanic. However, visual descriptions lean toward generic atmospheric markers ("gray light," "ancient archway," "wild hush") rather than distinct, idiosyncratic textures that would anchor the ghost town more vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is visceral and functional, with the water pressure and "calcified knot" directly constraining the protagonist’s actions. The shift from the chaotic ocean noise to the "gathered hush" creates a vivid, atmospheric beat that serves the climax.

Specific details like the "single meteorite of blue stone" and "filament of spun nebula" ground the fantastical elements in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly heavy, sensory details like the "singing spirits" and "root-choked channels." The atmosphere supports the mood well, though the description occasionally slows momentum with adjective-heavy phrasing ("opaque with grime and secrets").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and well-rendered, with specific sensory details like the "saline mist" and "hum of filtration systems" grounding the scene. The environment supports the mood effectively, though the shift to a "lotus-hearted ache" feels like an abstract imposition rather than an organic outgrowth of the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmospheric description of the orchard is vivid ("ghostly sweetness," "neon blue"), establishing a strong visual sense. However, the use of technical metaphors ("knowledge network," "database," "interfaced") clashes sharply with the established ancient, spectral tone.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Sound Wave Garden is an evocative and functional setting that actively drives the plot mechanics. The sensory details in the mural layer ("colors were not pigment but vibrations") are vivid and specific. The "void" layer is slightly less distinct, leaning on abstract geometry, which prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful; the "humid, claustrophobic aisles" and "scent of wet loam" effectively ground the abstract threat of telepathic scanning in physical sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Extinct Language Archive is rendered with vivid sensory details, particularly the visual and auditory manifestations of the magic. The setting actively participates in the plot, though it occasionally feels more like a stage set for the spell than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "breathing" of the volcano is not just atmospheric but integral to the plot's mechanics. The physical details of the amphitheater and the machinery are vivid and constrain the character's choices meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is excellent, specifically the use of the dust motes and skylight not just as atmosphere but as a tool that constrains the climax. The "blooming withering" scent anchors the sensory experience, and the attic's drafty nature creates tangible physical stakes for the release.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is evocative and specific, anchoring the surreal "drifting prism" with the tactile solidity of the mahogany desk. The sensory details of the wood grain ("concentric rings," "knot where a branch had once struggled") are excellent, providing a necessary counterweight to the abstract nature of the void.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The underwater environment is rendered with vivid sensory detail, grounding the abstraction of the protagonist's profession. The shift from "crushing darkness" to the bioluminescent display creates a strong atmospheric turn.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is imaginative and actively constrains the action (the geode, the fading foam). However, the description leans heavily on visual lists of colors ("violet," "iridescent," "chartreuse") rather than tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is well-integrated; the tide, the rotting wood, and the specific vibration of the pier are not just backdrop but active mechanical components of the plot. Sensory details like "salt spray and hot circuitry" effectively ground the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting effectively contrasts the "synthetic atmosphere" with Lyra's internal desire for the "chaotic winds" of the past. The bioluminescent hedges and artificial constellations ground the scene well, though the environment remains largely static and does not actively pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, grounding details like the "crystallized cloud" and "gray vapor"; the setting of Pearl Bay at dawn is integral to the central image and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with consistent burn-zone imagery. Some descriptions lean toward the purple ("narrow artery of silver dust," "agonizing grace"), but the setting effectively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like "ozone," "electromagnetic static," and "wet stone" establish a vivid atmosphere. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop for the magic system rather than constraining choices or applying pressure. The "parallel timelines" are visual dressing rather than a spatial or temporal mechanic that forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric details ("ivy-veiled," "moss") establish the tone well, but the physical logic of the setting contradicts the plot artifacts (the dry diaries in the wet ruin). The acoustic topography is introduced vividly but fades into the background during the central discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the "prism parapet" and wet stone vividly grounding the magic system in specific physical details. The sensory environment actively enables the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct but relies on sensory clichés ("scent of night-blooming jasmine and cordite") and purple description ("moons completed their kiss"). The environment provides a backdrop but does not uniquely constrain the characters' tactical choices beyond the weapon-silencing plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "blinding geometry" and "tessellated cartography" create a vivid, tactile environment that feels distinct. The setting is functional, not just decorative, as the specific thermal vents dictate the protagonist's movement and the egg's placement.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "alarming serenity" and the snow that "did not melt" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the theme of unnatural stasis. Sensory details—cold, silence, the vibration of the spell—are well-chosen and specific. The setting actively contributes to the mood of oppression before being shattered.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is utilized well; the acoustics of the "decommissioned radar dome" and the "soft scratch of wood" create a tangible atmosphere that supports the quiet tension. The lighting and spatial details ("ragged proscenium," "curved, acoustic tiles") ground the abstract performance in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    The damp grotto and the specific mechanics of the moisture-dependent bamboo knot are vivid and ground the story effectively. However, the atmosphere relies too heavily on pathetic fallacy ("embarrassed pink," "sky holding its breath"), which detracts from the otherwise sharp physical details.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "drifting prism terrace" and the "feral" silence of the ether are evocative and imaginative. The sensory details ("ribbons of color," "kaleidoscope of warm ambers") effectively ground the fantastical setting, though the physics of the train whistle at that altitude strain credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "peeling paint" interface is a distinct and creative visual, but the broader setting relies on standard sci-fi modifiers ("neon," "ferrocrete," "chrome"). Description often lists visual attributes without allowing the environment to constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Exceptional integration of setting and tools; the projector's limitations (lamp would burn film) constrain the method (psychometry), and the booth's geometry physically maps onto the vision. The environment actively shapes the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively grounding the mystical tone. However, the description leans toward the abstract and adjectival ("swirling canvas," "shadowed rapture") rather than specific, tactile grounding that would heighten the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific; "silica petals that chimed like broken glass" is a standout sensory detail that grounds the surreal concept. The "oxidized monolith" and "violet sky" create a cohesive, desolate atmosphere that supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is depicted with vivid sensory details, particularly the auditory navigation method, which grounds the surreal setting. However, the environment feels more like a passive backdrop for the protagonist’s skills than a source of genuine pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established with strong, moody sensory details ("tasted of salt and ancient rain," "cloudy cobblestones"). While effective, the "liminal mist" is a standard trope for this genre, and the landscape primarily serves as a symbolic backdrop rather than a source of concrete, physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting acts as an antagonist; the "cobalt masonry" and "freezing draft" actively pressure the protagonist and constrain his movement. The verticality of the turret climb physically manifests the oppressive hierarchy. The sensory details—cold stone vs. burning hands—create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere that serves the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot, providing the physical components (dew, celestial alignment) for the magic. The atmosphere of "graceful collapse" is well-rendered and supports the tone effectively. The library feels like a participant in the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is established with strong sensory economy; the "groaning" station and "visceral smell" of memory create a cohesive atmosphere. The interplay between the cramped interior and the digital vastness of the hologram effectively anchors the stakes. The atlas page serves as a potent physical anchor connecting the drowned world to the lost past.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functionally anchored but relies on genre clichés ("ragtag resistance," "ozone," "copper tang of dried blood"). The juxtaposition of ancient stones and high-tech is visual but lacks tactile or interactive depth beyond the vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is well-integrated; the volcanic heat serves as the necessary catalyst for the plot, not just backdrop. Sensory details like the "sulfurous steam," "bubbling mud," and "obsidian rocks" effectively ground the high-concept action in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sensory environment is vivid and active; the "shuddering" glass and "teeth chattering" frames directly pressure the protagonist's state. The setting is not merely a backdrop but an antagonist that triggers the crisis. The contrast between the violent gray ocean and the humid, blooming interior perfectly supports the central theme.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, active, and integral to the plot; the "glitch" is visualized effectively through the stuttering ocean and knotted light. The environment physically constrains choices and provides the tools for the protagonist's escape, satisfying the criteria for high integration, though some descriptors lean toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pairing of the protagonist's albinism with the specific moment of the sun returning creates excellent, organic tension. The environment acts as a ticking clock and a physical assault, constraining action and coloring perception (goggles, monocle) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and thematic; the "tomb of eternal frost" mirrors the suppression of truth. Sensory details like the "blue-lit server monoliths" and "breath pluming" effectively ground the high-concept premise in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details like the "ozone and altitude" smell of the ballast create a vivid atmosphere. However, description occasionally veers into redundancy, such as the "engraved quiet that seemed physically carved."

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "Sound Wave Garden" is realized with high-concept sensory density that directly constraints action (e.g., the need to zigzag and control emotions). The environment functions effectively as both setting and antagonist, grounding abstract concepts in tactile danger.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively mirroring Eleanor’s detachment through the "solid floor of cumulus clouds" and the silence. Specific sensory details, like the cedar smell of the pen and the wind buffeting the glass, ground the abstract intellectual conflict in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "meteor hush" and the "insect trapped within" provide excellent sensory anchoring that serves the theme. The atmosphere effectively blends the sterile (console) with the organic (amber, cry), though the "warping geometry" description feels slightly generic compared to the vivid specificity of the amber and the stylus.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting integration is strong; the dampness of the grotto actively constrains the protagonist's tools (rendering chalk useless), forcing the shift to sand. This is a high-quality use of environment to shape tactics. Some descriptions ("bruised and tender lilac") lean purple, but the functional role of the setting is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the "minaret mosaic" and "shattered sky" provide the literal tools (the tessera, the cold) for the plot's resolution. The "chipped patterns" on the ground constrain and guide the protagonist's lifesaving tactic, acting as a micro-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric description is the story's strongest asset, creating a vivid, immersive world through the specific lens of the carnival orchard. The synesthetic details effectively ground the supernatural elements in sensory experience, though the density sometimes threatens to overwhelm the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "light painting studio" is not just a backdrop but a constraint that dictates the action (darkness, shutter speed). The "raw, jagged muscovite geode" is a highly specific tool that physically shapes the story's resolution and thematic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and functions as a specific lens for the story, blending the physical (limestone, salt) with the technological (bio-electric residue). The "Obsidian Grotto" and the verticality of the lagoon effectively constrain movement and necessitate the specific action (floating).

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, particularly the "discarded punctuation" of the buttons, which grounds the magical work in specific, tactile history. The setting actively provides the tools for resolution. A slight reliance on standard fantasy tropes ("Amber Warehouse," "petrified resin") limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "jagged wound" of the bluff and the "silver hush" creating a cohesive, vivid atmosphere. The mist serves as a functional constraint, isolating the protagonist and heightening the tension of the helicopter's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "obsidian carriage" and "white exhale of the water" create a cohesive, if familiar, gothic atmosphere that anchors the scene. However, the setting largely serves as a static backdrop rather than an environmental force that constrains the coachman's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, successfully grounding the abstract timeline concept in the physical tools of pottery (kick-wheel, clay). The sensory details of the "scorched wasteland" versus the "memory of sweetness" effectively establish the mood, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and functional; the "oily, iridescent sheen" and "salt air" directly impact the plot (seized joint) and imagery. The environment constrains the protagonist's actions effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "Tidal Library" and "Sun-Drinkers" offer vivid, specific imagery that anchors the fantasy setting well. However, the sudden introduction of "atomically reflective" and "quantum perfection" creates a jarring anachronism against the backdrop of scrolls and brass sundials.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details are vivid ("bruising purple and gold," "damp marble"), establishing a cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting primarily serves as a static backdrop for the action rather than exerting pressure on the protagonist's choices. The "Lotus Temple" is rendered effectively but acts largely as a container for the prompt's required art installation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is grounded with distinct, sensory-rich details ("cigarette-scarred booth," "ozone," "stale coffee") that effectively evoke the desired atmosphere. The physical space of the booth serves as both a constraint and a tool, anchoring the cosmic conflict in a tangible reality. However, the external chaos of the "Ascended" and "Silencers" feels generic compared to the specificity of the booth.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting acts as a dynamic antagonist, with the "spatial mutiny" providing concrete physical pressure. Sensory details like "calcified moss" and the "obsidian and brass" organ are vivid and specific, grounding the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is brilliantly integrated; the quarry is not just a backdrop but the artistic medium itself, merging geology with anatomy. The environment actively constrains and defines the protagonist's method, charging the final image with texture and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmosphere is palpable ("wet wool," "ozone"), anchoring the reader in the rot. Specific details like the "green-crusted copper nail" add texture, though adjectival density sometimes slows the read.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, blending the tactile ("smelled faintly of ether") with the surreal ("violet" bioluminescence).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is excellent, actively shaping the plot through the use of railroad spikes and the train's atmosphere as weapons to resolve the central conflict. The sensory details ("rotting velvet," "burnt ozone") are vivid, specific, and thematically cohesive, grounding the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting details—copper machinery, sidereal clock, daylily-pressed paper—are vivid and effectively ground the surreal elements in a physical reality. The transition from the observatory to the dreamscape is visually clear, though the "dream temple" environment leans slightly toward generic fantasy imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "catacomb orchard" is a vivid, constraint-heavy environment that actively pressures the protagonist; the bone-roots aren't just scenery but the interface for the magic. The sensory details (yellowed ribs, weeping sap) ground the abstract ritual in visceral textures.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Exemplary specificity; the "Tygan fret cloth" and its technical weave are not just flavor but the central constraint that forces the protagonist's physical action. The sensory details of the trailer (stale tobacco, wet dog) effectively ground the high-concept scavenging in a gritty reality.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "Magnetic Arbor" is rendered with excellent specificity; details like "weeping iron-willows" and "magnetic soil" effectively blend the organic with the mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Tidal Atrium is a vivid, imaginative space anchored by sharp sensory details like "cold gold" and "salty brine." The fusion of library, ocean, and forge is executed with high specificity, grounding the metaphysical concept in tangible, physical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting contains vivid concepts (seashells on obsidian), but the description relies heavily on generic modifiers ("shimmering depths," "oppressive weight"). The environment is described rather than experienced through the specific friction of the inspector's task.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting details are vivid and filter well through the protagonist's heightened sensitivity ("tiled cavern," "rusted awning"). The environment feels lived-in and tactile.

The integration of the watch as a tool for measuring the architecture effectively bridges the physical setting with the character's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The contrast between the sweltering, noisy observatory and the silent, frozen violin creates a palpable atmosphere that heightens the stakes. The environmental pressure—heat and screaming ivy—functionally supports the climax mechanism, making the setting an active participant in the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the metaphysical work in a concrete physical space with the "obsidian table" and "aurora light." The environment provides texture but falls short of imposing strict constraints on the protagonist's tactical choices; the "entropic storms" act as background radiation rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "bruised purple" light and "unspun wool" clouds create a vivid, specific setting that grounds the fantasy elements. The physical reality of the grotto is tactile, though the "vineyard hush" opening leans slightly into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details are strong and specific ("rusting railing," "salt-crusted glass"). The setting actively participates in the diagnostic phase (wind chimes) and the atmospheric pressure (cold) aligns with the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "ambered observatory deck" and the "resin that encased the station" create a distinct, tactile atmosphere that effectively grounds the cosmic scale. The sensory details of the crushing darkness and the specific textures of the coins prevent the white-room syndrome common in sci-fi settings.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory is integral to the action, with gears and light refraction driving the ritual rather than serving as a backdrop. Specific details like "trembling indigo lines" and "brittle wax cylinders" effectively ground the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly ornamental, sensory details ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "moss-covered basalt"). While the environment provides atmosphere, it functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "nocturnal arbor" with its "glass leaves" and "frosted steel" creates a distinct, cold atmosphere that heightens the tension. The silence is not just background but a constraint that pressures Kael’s reaction, forcing him to work without verbalizing the danger. The sensory detail of the "micro-fracture... screaming to his sensitive fingertips" is vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)

This category is the story’s strongest asset, merging atmosphere with narrative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and actively pressures the protagonist, with the creeping frost serving as a ticking clock. While vivid, the description occasionally leans into purple prose ("solidification of time") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting of Aeros is vividly realized, mixing industrial decay ("rusted rebar," "hydraulic grease") with the ethereal. The use of the Hollywood star fragment as a physical anchor for the magic adds a specific, memorable texture that constrains the scene's logic effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "sideways clocks" and "spectral grotto" provide some distinct visual imagery that establishes a surreal atmosphere. However, the setting often relies on abstract telling ("whisper ancient, forgotten secrets") rather than concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Penrose Atrium is not merely a backdrop but an antagonist that actively constrains the protagonist; the moment the "stairs that led nowhere now led precisely to him" demonstrates exceptional integration of setting and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is visceral, with the "rhythmic breathing" of the city and the "pitted" anchor link providing excellent sensory grounding. The transition from the claustrophobic dome to the "unfolded horizons" is handled with vivid spatial clarity that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "yellowed" hearing aid and "crumbling edges" of the photo provide excellent tactile grounding. While the specific props are vivid, the broader "mist-clad atrium" relies on generic atmospheric tropes that feel less distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending high-tech claustrophobia with archaic specificity. The "codex margin illuminant gold fleck" is a brilliant, grounding detail that anchors the sci-fi premise in tactile history.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, blending the "sterile cold" of the observatory with the "iridescent hues" and "pungent" ink. The sensory details ("heavy snow," "jagged triangle") effectively ground the metaphysical elements of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary constraint and instrument of the story; the specific acoustic properties of the bone towers dictate the protagonist's method. The tactile descriptions ("hollow femur," "calcified perimeter") ground the high-concept premise in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "underground garden" is rendered with tactile specificity ("wet earth," "yellowed plastic," "humid loam"). The claustrophobic, subterranean atmosphere effectively pressures the scene and contrasts with the "cosmic" release at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "sentient geology" and "liquid garnet" light provide vivid, specific imagery that grounds the magical realism. However, the setting primarily serves as a supportive backdrop (the islands "encourage" her) rather than a source of pressure or obstacle, limiting its integration into the plot's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "Shadowed Nexus" and "obsidian void" create an abstract, white-room effect disguised as darkness; there is little tactile or specific grounding beyond the lock of hair. The setting operates as a metaphorical stage rather than a physical place that constrains or pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is vivid, atmospheric, and integral to the magic system. The physical environment directly constrains the method of solution (broken constellations), creating a strong fusion of place and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "forgotten library" with "rot-resistant shelves" establishes a solid atmospheric baseline, and the micro-setting details of tea leaves and diamond dust are excellent. However, the specific simile of the "empty playground swing" feels spatially dissonant with the antique, fantastical library setting, momentarily disrupting the atmospheric immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct but relies on high-fantasy abstractions ("void between dimensions," "soft, internal light") that lack tactile grounding. While the spatial relationship between the parapet and the world below is clear, the descriptions are often decorative ("verdant," "radiant") rather than functional elements that constrain the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is active rather than static; the "prism sanctuary" and the "accumulated silence" function as physical forces that constrain Elian's movements ("pressing against his chest"). The sensory detail of sound deletion—"vacuum that swallowed the ambient hum"—is executed with palpable specific weight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the rain's erasure of the fresco creates the central problem. The contrast between the "rain-scoured" ancient stone and the digital screens provides a specific, atmospheric texture that grounds the forensic work.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric detailing of the sunken library ("pulp of dissolving literature," "gray fog") creates a vivid, immersive sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting imagery ("frozen lightning," "misty void") is vivid and establishes a clear atmosphere, though the mechanics of the world feel somewhat convenient for the plot. The physical environment serves as a functional backdrop but does not actively complicate the characters' efforts beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The atmospheric imagery is strong, effectively evoking a surreal, melancholic end-times setting ("ocean of history evaporated," "pane of hush"). The specific tactile details of the puppet head ground the otherwise abstract metaphysical surroundings.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric blend of organic decay and industrial menace is vivid, anchored by strong sensory details like the freezing saliva and copper wings. The setting actively pressures the protagonist via the encroaching frost, though the spatial geometry of the labyrinth itself could be used more tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is excellently integrated; the braided ravine and river dynamics are not just backdrop but the active engine of the protagonist's insight. The specific hydrodynamics ("divergent path," "eddy") mirror the chemical solution, making the environment indispensable to the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)

The sun shaft, wall height, and marble angle are spatially tracked; environment constrains the decisive tactic. One hairline slip: “blooming withering” is repeated verbatim, a micro-loop that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Station, gantries, capacitors, and bruise-colored sky are filtered through mechanic eyes; tool-as-setting constrains every move. The magnetic nexus is not just scenery—it is the pivot the prism array must lock to, charging the climax. Cold biting face vs. vibratory capacitor heat creates the requested icy-warm duality without branding it in dialogue. Spatial choreography is flawless: no impossible positions during the lever pull.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Flooded pit, rotting proscenium, and lantern shimmer are filtered through Elias’s musician eye (“weeping velvet railings,” “submerged music stands”). Brackish water as mirror and lock constrains his tactics: stillness must be broken to release the map. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track distance from rail to podium. The micro-setting of the antique program—handled, soaked, transfigured—charges the final image; remove it and the closure collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alpine dawn, quartz windows, graphite smear, and auroral palette are filtered through a meteorologist’s selective attention—temperature, light refraction, particulate matter—making setting a tool that constrains the sabotage method. Micro-setting victory: the empty margin of a lithograph becomes the breach point the scanners watch. Spatial choreography is clean—hand moves to paper corner, scanner zooms, probability waves visibly loosen. Final image of smudged hellebore under violet light charges the reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel’s damp brick, rotted tie, and iron pipe are not backdrop but instruments: the valve’s droplets mirror Silas’s guilt, the gravel records his sole intrusion. Sensory hierarchy obeys a trespasser’s priorities—sound spikes before visuals, smell of mold before color. Micro-setting excels: the wheel’s condensation becomes the entire moral mirror. Entry to 9-band blocked only because temperature/weather never actively constrain tactics; environment is reactive, not adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are not backdrops but instruments: the swelling river forces the folding act, the glossy shore mirrors her fragmented/whole reflection. Micro-setting (the paper swan) literally transports, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is strict—damp earth, grey light, bioluminescent glow—each detail filtering through Elara’s archivist senses. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible moves across the folding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sage Ridge is sketched with spare, choice-driven detail: locked wheelchair brakes against incline, temperature drop that “plummeted,” sagebrush “shiver.” Sensory hierarchy is biased toward Elias’s therapeutic attention to micro-shifts. Only the eclipse filter keeps the environment from fully constraining tactics; the ridge stays backdrop rather than an obstacle that could fail or be lost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The silo as vertical iron lung, slanted hearth, and oxidized gantry is tactile and lived-in; every step Elian takes is a negotiation of rust and tilt. The tapestry’s shimmering dragons re-enter the final image, recharging the earlier description with magnetic grief. Environment constrains choice: the slanted floor makes gravity “wrong,” guiding Elian’s kneel and the probe. Micro-setting (body + tool) fuses with macro-setting to charge closure—no caps touched.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lantern room, mercury float, Fresnel lens, and ocean granite are filtered through Arthur’s tactile profession—dust motes igniting like “microscopic stars” is a POV-specific marvel. The lighthouse setting actively constrains the climax: only here can one man hijack a coastal beacon to broadcast analog code. One slip: “after last orders” is named but never exploited as a ticking clock; the hour stays atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the loop pedal, amp knobs, and vibrating grating function as both tools and topography; their tactile states (red LED heartbeat, ozone taste) directly constrain ritual tactics. Palette-as-portal evolves from cosmic hole to ash puddle, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible reach or cable snarl. Misses 9.0 only because “Dimensional Anchor” remains a suggestive label rather than an environment whose architecture is weaponized.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass pane, fossilized shell, and mirrored-ice horizon are not backdrop but instruments that literally constrain and enable every beat; the shell’s spiral channels wind into audible tone, the horizon’s vanishing line reconfigures spatial logic, the grease-pencil score is the tactile map that must be erased by sunrise. Body-as-setting is equally active: forehead against freezing glass, ear to shell, teeth buzzing with chord. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no drift in scale or position from spire apex to lake surface. Final image recharges every prior sensory filament into one refulgent sphere.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing viaduct is not backdrop but an active procedural antagonist that reconfigures under her step; the wet cobblestones and lightning sky constrain visibility and timing. Micro-setting (tablet, droplet, her floating coat) doubles as tool and clock, charging the final ripple image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: six-inch hover, left swing over abyss, definitive thud track cleanly. One tenth off only because granite-to-marble shift, while vivid, is a single glancing detail never exploited again.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Limestone dust, moss-lined vault, and drum-skin resonance are filtered through touch-centric deaf perception, turning cavern into womb. The antique turntable becomes a micro-setting that literally constrains the final action; without its mass the needle could not transmit torque. Seasonal rustle is named but never alters clock or tactic—decorative—hence capped below 9. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    The courtyard micro-setting constrains every move: the decorative ridge dictates the lateral route, the ivy provides concealment, the ruined instruments below supply the visceral cost. Dusk purple shadows mirror interior eclipse without overt symbolism. Tool-as-setting (brass instruments) is tactile and choice-driving. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass cathedral, UV-ignited pollen, and respirator straps all constrain the final gesture. The greenhouse’s humidity and spatialized scent function as proximate antagonists, forcing the mask-off decision. Micro-setting (crystal vial facets, iron case latch) doubles as tool and totem. Setting detail is selective—no tourist catalog—filtered through an olfactory-centric POV.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Terra-cotta grotto, rope, and clay wall function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics: the damp layer alone permits temporal contact; the rope’s length limits the spiral. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and grit, filtered through poet-perception. Starlight vs. alien glow externalizes the inner fork in the final moment, charging the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sunken orchard, oxidized tanker-ribs, and salt-tolerant apple micro-ecology are irreplicable; remove any piece and the resonant frequency changes, breaking the climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s ear-dominance: sound of settling steel precedes visual catalog, ash-smell before color. Environment dictates tactics: she kneels on concrete to feel vibration, chooses driftwood for percussion, times bow stroke to dome’s glass hum. Spatial choreography tight: fire-circle centre, hull fragments as flint, audience shadows between trunks—no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is not backdrop but instrument: resinous walls mirror the manufactured warmth inside Elara, and the cooling air cues the scent’s diffusion. Tactile handles—silver tweezers, sealed jar—ground the counterfeit chemist’s ritual. Light shift from honeyed gloom to synthetic glow physically marks the emotional reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Maritime Athenaeum is sketched with selective sensory anchors—limestone balustrade, brass-clipped encyclopedias, salt wind—filtered through Elias’s freight-eye hierarchy of detail. The library’s open-air architecture literally enables the encounter and charges the closing invitation; removing the breezy, star-lit deck would break the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. World rules stay consistent; no occupational over-exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystalline orchard is never backdrop; its razor ground slices the boy’s knee and its glass roots trip him, forcing Elara’s pivotal kneel. The obsidian arbor drinks light, literally darkening the workspace where she must feel, not see, the tag—environment as tool. Spatial choreography is flawless: precipice → fracture lip → rising arbor, each move tracked without drift. The final image conjugates body, tool, and place: reed cage on volcanic glass under silent sky—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal system is not backdrop but bloodstream—water as city-blood, sky as ceiling—filtering every perception. Micro-setting (the pendant against sternum, the iron lattice at the spire’s peak) constrains the final uncaging act. Sensory hierarchy obeys illustrator priorities: color, line, translucence. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible moves as she climbs paralyzed stonework.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: its iron-fruit stains tongue-memory, its stalactite drips set the only clock, the cracked mosaic is literally the map Silas must solve. Micro-setting (the stepping stone) constrains every tactical move; the moon-fissure is a live aperture that decides when ritual can begin. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: geologist’s eye for fracture patterns, father’s tongue for metal of loss. Final meadow flash is charged by contrast—sunlit verdure re-prices the orchard’s perpetual dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Body-as-setting (crawlspace ribs, copper pipes) and the tape shard itself constrain every tactical move; dawn color shifts mirror the stake of visibility. Selective sensory hierarchy—lint scent, valve rust—filters through Elias’s custodial gaze. The library’s velvet hatch and flickering streetlamp are reused, not catalogued. Environment directly enables/cache-blocks the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Victorian greenhouse, oxygen-thick air, and rain-slick trellis are filtered through Elias’s plant-biased perception; the trellis literally supports his final stance. Micro-setting (leaf, moss, fevered skin) constrains the surrender. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: touch and proprioception dominate, sight narrows to leaf and moss. No orientation debt; anchors set within first 100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Needle’s volcanic ash, oily rain, and sheared limestone actively funnel Elias to the northern overhang; terrain is antagonist. Micro-setting—the brooch’s honeyed light against storm-bruised sky—charges the final canvas decision. Sensory hierarchy obeys insomnia: grit in eyes, salt skin, sound of surf never blunted. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across slick descent and ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The musical crystal cave is not backdrop; its “sharp, high-contrast silhouettes” literally enable the shadow-bridge mechanics that admit the entity, so environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the sonic motif (“symphonic resonance,” “melodic humming”) is POV-filtered and tied to agency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the hand-off moment; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivory Harbor’s wet stones and salt-pitted brass function as micro-setting: the valve’s fit into the rusted manifold literally enables the climax. Weather-purged dawn and resonant dock stones mirror internal thaw, charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks clean from pier to lighthouse; no tourism excess.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The starlit vault literally supplies the only treadable surface; without its mist-constellations Elara cannot advance, so setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. Earlier, the collapsed train yard and dead street-lights funnel her toward the ravine, grounding the fantastical vault in palpable industrial decay. Sensory selection stays tight: ozone on tongue, cold iron oscillating to spirit, starlight as footing—never a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prismatic escondite, obsidian shard, and storm-racked exterior are never backdrop—they actively resist or enable Elian’s drill. Micro-setting (rolling glass floor) forces him to stay cross-legged, tethering action to place. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: visual refraction gives way to haptic thunder vibrating “in his teeth.” Lost 0.4 because spatial choreography of the magnetic torsion is hand-waved; we feel the storm but don’t track where the breach sits relative to his body.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stainless steel tables and porcelain embalming sink ground us in tactile sterility; ozone scent of ink gives the uncanny lift. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, tray, door tracked. The prep room’s chemical warmth vs. rainy chill externalizes the deathly vitality tone. Ink as micro-setting constrains the final choice—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bonsai mountaintop reframes the portable lamp as alien intruder, constraining Elara’s micro-movements; the fluorescent buzz as micro-setting charges the final texture. Sensory hierarchy stays anchored to her artisanal eye; spatial choreography never falters. One of the few elements that would break if transposed.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted container canyon is not backdrop; its shifting walls literally redistribute the narrator’s sleeping shadow and supply the only raw material for memory. The poison label’s curl, the pallet’s underside, the crack in pavement—micro-settings—constrain every action and charge the final image. Tidal rhythm acts as clock and antagonist, dictating when walls move and when monuments can be sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory gantry, rusted ribs of the instrument, and flaking shell paint form a micro-setting triad that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows Elias’s physics-trained eye: vibration > sight > taste of salt air. Spatial choreography is clean—gantry, workbench, shell-slot, bow—every beat keeps bodies and props trackable. Weather is not backdrop but the dissolving horizon that forces the timing of the final retelling.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    The carnival-flotilla is not backdrop but tool: drift, drag, winch-access and anchor-points dictate Elara’s graffiti syntax and final stone placement, charging the closure. Sensory triage—diesel, rust, lacquer—tracks her engineer’s gaze, keeping description tethered to tactical priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit summit is more than backdrop: vacuum cold limits suit time, jagged ridge dictates tripod placement, low gravity shapes the slow cerulean crawl of the chemical timer. Sodium-lit colony below serves as moral counter-pressure, making Elias’s turn-away act legible. Micro-setting tools—tripod, vacuum seals, hourglass grain—constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selectivity (fogging visor, gnawing teeth-ache) stays in POV filter without tourist excess.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Mist-coated rail depot” is re-anchored viscerally through smell of wet iron and the groan of lifting anchor. The brass kiosk becomes a micro-setting that constrains movement—its threshold literally slows frantic travelers. Water-filled basins function as both tool and environment, dictating diagnostic choreography. Final image of shadow sliding across skylights syncs external change to internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and thick viewport glass are not backdrop—they shape the only possible experiment (condensation map) and charge the final image. Micro-setting (spectacle wire, ledger, breath-tracked glass) constrains Silas’s choices. Sensory hierarchy is atlas-editor: angles, frost patterns, grime on glass. No credibility strain; weather and spatial choreography remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Limestone span, ebony fork, and cobblestone acoustics function as micro-setting that directly constrains Silas’s method. Selective sensory focus—sound of groaning stone, vibration in chest—keeps detail purposeful. Weather (“wild hush”) mirrors tension without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clean as Silas intercepts baker then miners; no floating bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    The temple’s coral-choked console is not backdrop but the antagonist she must physically defeat; the dome’s pressure literally narrows her perception to “black edges.” Micro-setting (crystal vial) constrains the final act by serving as the transmission medium. Sensory choice favors urgency—taste of wine hallucination under hypoxia—rather than tourist catalog. Environment charges the closing image: the beam punching through stone and water she will never leave.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment functions as mechanism: the lighthouse’s “fault line of reality” enables both the lattice’s resonance and the gravity-defying escape. Copperlight repose and metallic stillness are filtered through Elian’s sensory panic, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is tight—curved wall, narrow door scuffs, hovering inches. Setting details (driftwood lattice, basalt reef) return to charge the final vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse as predator—leaves “lovingly venomous,” briars bowing only to the ghost—functions as an active obstacle and mirrors Julian’s paralytic need. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and temperature, congruent with a body seeking cure. Spatial choreography stays clean: bead raised, tendrils retreat, ghost glides through brick. Environment does not merely adorn; it constrains every step, qualifying for the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Red canyon, draining sea, kelp-steel filament, and the illustration plate recur as constraining objects; the mesh floor created from them charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight—vanilla humidity, moonlit needle-flash—filtered through Elara’s obsessed perception. Spatial choreography tracks her spirals without drift; the labyrinth’s verticality directly shapes her footfall-stitching tactics. Micro-setting (the plate) and macro-setting (bridging chasm) both alter options, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but topography that dictates movement: roots force her route, bones force delicacy, blocked exit forces return. Sensory economy favors damp-earth olfaction and finger-on-bone tactility over visual catalog. The olive root that cradles a skull functions as “tool/setting hybrid,” constraining her gentle excavation style and charging the final image when the same root-system feeds the restored dial. Micro-setting qualifies; no contradictions or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Golden Arcade’s vaulted dawn, brass chute, and echoing click anchor every beat; the ebony clipboard doubles as micro-setting that literally supports the vellum and symbolically supports Elian’s stance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—visual gloss gives way to触觉 friction of paper and pen. Setting constrains choice: only this slow conduit lets the message escape the digital net, so environment shapes tactics. Final image of letter sliding into chute fuses place, object, and stake in one compressed charge.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Meteorite dome breathing, thin air, cobalt glass, and eternal-candle heat as memory render a tactile micro-setting; the loom and lantern constrain every tactical move, charging the final image. Autumn decay scent threads through without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mangrove channels root-choked, humid air vibrating with singing spirits—every detail is filtered through Julian’s guilt-warped perception. The houseboat rises “on stilts from black water,” a tactile threat; grime-opaque windows mirror his emotional opacity. Micro-setting success: the granite shard’s cold weight against his palms anchors body-as-place. Final image recharges setting: he steps back into the singing spirits now overheard as chorus to the letter he will write—environment presses the next act.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium is not backdrop: it mirrors Elias’s suffocation, then flips to blanket at closure, participating in the reconfiguration. Micro-setting rules: the plaster palimpsest literally guides finger movement and constrains rewrite choice. Sensory selection is POV-true—salt film, teak bench, filtration hum—none generic. Could reach 9+ if one physical detail (temperature, saline grit) had altered the pen-stroke tempo, but still exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog-as-emulsion is the micro-setting that directly constrains tactics; wet-stone rot scent is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from studio floor to dream-orchard to dissolving cathedral. Environment charges the final image—fog’s refusal to hold light forever is the visible price. One hairline slip: “electric energy” is slightly generic beside earlier precise smells, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The acoustic garden’s parabolic petals are not backdrop; they compress Elian into 2-D pigment and later collapse the void back into gravel. The nickel itself acts as micro-setting, its skeletal grin constraining the final philosophy. One minor slip: “indigo and violent scarlet” edges toward palette listing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse as micro-setting is superbly textured: humid aisles, captive insect roar, pheromone fog that jams telepathy. The turbine intake becomes the decisive spatial pivot, constraining the seed’s use and charging the final image; only the exterior city geography remains vague, but that vagueness serves the fugitive mood.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    The calcium-cathedral shell, meteoric dust, and bioluminescent vines are not backdrop but instruments: every tendril climbs because his voice vibrates the calcium; the postcard must decompose inside that exact fern to seed the next cycle. Sensory triangulation (reef-shadow light, off-key wind, perfume of night-blooming jasmine) mirrors the tonal shift from tomb to cradle. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the postcard-as-object and fern-as-cradle directly constrain the final surrender. Density never stalls momentum; each detail either feeds the alchemy or sharpens the solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Opal stone corridors, silica vines, and high-altitude wind are filtered through Elian’s professional caretaker gaze; every sensory note either feeds or starves the orchids, so description never stalls action. The bamboo tube’s fracture and blue acoustic weld act as micro-setting that directly constrains the repair choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility errors. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the sound itself, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ink well’s refracted candlelight and the humming floorboards concretely constrain choices—Elara must grab the strands before the glass shatters. The archive itself is sketched with two sensory strokes, then used as acoustic resonance that enforces honesty, turning setting into active pressure. Micro-setting (gloved hands inside glowing syntax) functions as the final bridge image. Meets the 9+ gate: the ink well’s changing state directly charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    Volcanic amphitheater is not scenery but tool: thermal expansion timetable dictates the heist window, masonry groans supply diegetic countdown, brass chain hidden from electronic eyes embodies low-tech evasion. Details filter through machinist POV—grease, vapor, iron counterweight sway—guiding every tactical move. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the chain-as-tool constrains the final milimeter of axle turn.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Attic as micro-setting constrains every beat: updraft through skylight dictates capsule engineering; dust motes become barometer; book-ladders determine spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s pigeon-trained ear—coo overrides creak, mold over perfume. Tool-integration: aluminum capsule and meteorite density hinge on attic’s fickle draft. No static catalogue; every detail either enables or threatens flight. Final image of lofted bird recharges attic’s vertical axis, making the setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its translucent floor and refracted motes pressure every move—she must “slip between cracks” or be blown out of existence. The navigator’s desk is not backdrop; its grain is the map she physically navigates to locate the breach. Weather is inside the wood, not outside—an elegant inversion that keeps description purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean; the single retreat step is tracked against the terrace’s shifting light.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Vertical ocean horizon, rusted corridors, and the dome’s dissolution into living galaxy are specific, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s sky-trained eye. Micro-setting of the console and feather constrains the final gesture; placement on cold metal is tactile pivot from relic to offering. Pressure, darkness, and plankton bloom behave causally, guiding choice (wait, watch, release). Setting never décor—every described surface either resists or enables the harmonic calling of the light.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The violet quartz geode is tactile—jagged floor, aperture, refracted star-tern shadow—and actively pressures action: the quartz wall blocks narrative completion until emotional conjecture supplies the missing frequency. Phantom sea-foam functions as micro-setting, its popping clock driving urgency. Sensory selection skews visual, but the humming glass adds dental vibration, justifying the visual dominance. Environment, body, and tool converge in the final image: glass in pocket, cave now known as inhabited tomb.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arcade’s rusted groans, salt circuitry smell, and swaying pilings are tactile, selective, and directly enable the climax via mechanical vibration; environment is not backdrop but fulcrum. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: bishop arc, can roll, woman stride, token cascade—all measured in degrees and feet, never floating. Light-level shifts (shadow → neon flash) mirror emotional voltage, yet avoid overt symbolism. The “calculated wilderness” idiosyncratically fuses decay and precision, constraining Elias’s options and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight garden is rendered through tactile micro-detail—synthetic moss, false constellations—whose artifice mirrors Lyra’s alienation. The body itself becomes micro-setting: the forearm’s dermis as cosmic parchment constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is tight; breathless stillness against remembered wind keeps the oceanic longing alive. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no prop drift or impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is not backdrop but instrument: the wet sand, tidal pool, and mist directly enable the stone-cast divination and constrain timing—shift any element and the ritual fails. The harbor’s optic vocabulary (salt-crusted windows, discarded lenses) fuses with Silas’s profession, so setting and character are co-woven. Spatial choreography is clean: boots sink, stone arcs, rings collide with mossy edge, sun breaches horizon. Final image reuses every earlier fragment of glass and vapor, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The moonlit ridge and burn-scarred terrain function as micro-setting: loose shale that must not be dislodged underfoot, porcelain glaze that mirrors exoskeleton of keloids—both constrain his ghost-like stride and the final scattering. Sensory hierarchy is firefighter-specific: breath-plume, heat-kiss, ash weight. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating objects. The environment’s refusal to offer purchase or forgiveness charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    From first sentence the ozone-grotto anchors; micro-setting (brass gauge, Möbius ribbon) constrains every beat. Sensory palette skews electromagnetic and tactile—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is spotless: tether release, basket swing, balloon breaching rock-to-mist all track cleanly. Final image of vibrant moss regaining color is charged by prior gray stagnation, making environment co-author of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment is not backdrop: the ivy-veiled passage constricts movement, the moss carpet muffles his footfalls and thus his sonic readings, and the roofless library exposes the hearth to the sky—each detail alters acoustic behavior and forces tactical adjustment. The hearth itself functions as micro-setting, constraining excavation space and hiding the archive of atrocity; its ash and moisture are handled tactilely. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s profession—sound texture comes first, smell of rain/rot second, visual last—so detail never feels touristic. Final image charges the setting: the same corridor now “screams,” re-weighting every prior sonic map.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Wet-stone lilac air, droplet-lens parapet, and echoing terrace are filtered through Elara’s painter-eye; each sensory pick is立刻 exploited to bend light. The prism parapet literally constrains the spell mechanics; its post-rain state is the enabling resource. Spatial choreography is immaculate—body, mirror, dog, bell track cleanly. Micro-setting (mirror surface, vibrating droplets) charges the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terrace is economically anchored in smoke-heat-jasmine-cordite; the twin-moon light literally disables weapons, constraining every tactic. The cracked mosaic tiles underfoot mirror the fractured factions, and the violet convergence recharges the final image. Micro-setting (clipboard as mirror) also constrains the signing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat is not backdrop but crucible: the jagged cracks literally guide his kneel and determine the egg’s incubator; the setting constrains the only possible action. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vance’s elite POV—Italian leather, velvet coat—yet the same salt scars his skin, fusing luxury and penance. Final image reuses the porcelain plate metaphor, now charged with life/death stakes. Micro-setting qualifies: the egg-filled fissure becomes the entire world in the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The snow that refuses to melt is a lived, rule-setting detail that later obeys causality when the shockwave blasts it upward. The Prism Sanctuary is handled twice: first as looming cage, then as exploding engine of liberation—its glass/spell texture constrains her method (untangling, not bashing). “Silver Courtyard” is proper-noun economical, reused four times without clutter. Spatial choreography is clean—robes trail, guards flank, semicircle holds—no floating bodies.

    The radar dome is not postcard backdrop; its acoustic tiles swallow the drunkard’s shout and later amplify the scratch of retreating puppets, so the environment literally shapes the audience’s perception. The swinging bulb acts as a micro-setting clock, slowing to stasis at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Silas notices silk, velvet, ink metaphors—calligrapher’s vocabulary. One minor slip: “concrete floor” appears only at the end, risking a spatial hiccup, but the prior tile image keeps the dome image coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto’s altitude bamboo, swelling twine, and blushing color progression constrain every beat: moisture levels dictate the knot’s lifespan; thinning air fatigues the monarch; the tower can only exist here. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elias’s esoteric realism—he notices scale-dust, not tourist vistas. Micro-setting (moss, wing, knot) functions as props that charge the final collapse. One hairline slip: “white ocean of the stratosphere” is geologically off—stratosphere is above, not around, peaks—but the poetic license is brief and does not taint closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sanctum’s open roof, violet aperture, and frost-stiff rope directly constrain the casting ritual; geometry is the fuel. The punched card functions as micro-setting, every perforation a future note-hole that dictates bronze flow.

Final image—the ringing bronze—fuses body, tool, and environment into one resonant object.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: roots block exits, damp moss dictates crawling, fungal growth hides the console. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—ozone taste precedes visual sky, reflecting a survivor’s priority. The red box’s wafer seal is a tactile object whose brittleness becomes the hinge of choice. Weather and structure evolve beat-to-beat: storm wails, ceiling flakes, seal snaps—environmental stakes stay causal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reimagined palace is evoked through tactile specifics—blue-glazed brick, silver-dust obsidian, brass gears—filtered by Bel-ibni’s miserly eye. Micro-setting dominates: the chalk stub, the conserved oil, the tile’s heft constrain every move. Spatial choreography is clean; torch, chalk, tile, candle are tracked without drift. The observatory itself becomes the tool that births the rift, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Soundless Sanctuary functions as micro-setting: nullified acoustics force intimacy and enable the silent transfer. Mercury floor and glass walls supply visual metaphor without stall; spatial choreography stays clean as bodies tilt toward wrist contact. Grounding achieved by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Ruined Orchard District” is economical and sensory, fog pressed soundless, trees gnarled dead—minute particulars build without catalogue. The sextant’s bent brass and frost diamonds on twigs are micro-settings that constrain tactics: he must plant boots to stay tethered. Spatial choreography is clean—boots, mud, sextant angle track across the grove. Final mirrored surface is earned through causal accretion, charging the image; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cathedral-orchard is more than backdrop: roots audibly split timber, scent of decay narrows attention, and the beam-width stage forces Elara’s perilous kneel. Micro-setting beats—ribbon as child-lost relic, peppermint pocketed—constrain tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across beams, satchel, and vortex. Missing one sense return (smell after fix) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The astral orchard is not backdrop but active archive—“leaves rustled with the sound of turning pages”—a setting that literally rewrites his options. The pistachio shell functions as micro-setting: its blank curve becomes the territory where causality is negotiated. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s curator eye: radiation-bloom, C-sharp hum, polished-steel mirror. Environment constrains the final image: the weeping-light tree points him back to the habitat, forcing the carve-or-die choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the star: fossilized encyclopedias as footholds, ivy of ink, paper fungi in joint cracks—each detail doubles as world rule and tactical surface. The “unheard symphony” motif is taught early, escalates at the gate, and subsides into satisfied hum at exit, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (the diary, the golem’s paper skin) constrains Elara’s method and final gambit. Spatial choreography is flawless; no two objects occupy the same imagined space.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    The emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting: its color slices the monochrome fog, guides her steps, and finally reweights the garden’s oxidized green into a mirror of her own veins. Ship’s decay is tactile—velvet curtains “tattered,” decks “softening under boots”—and constrains her path, forcing narrative incantations to keep corridors solid. Ferris wheel grinding backward externalizes the inverted time-frame; the mold-coated atrium literalizes the womb. Environment actively shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mechanism room is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail—brass breath, grease on palms, rope fibers—never a catalog. The clock-tower itself functions as micro-setting: the central drive shaft physically constrains how Elian must kneel, twist, and press the wax, so environment shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy tightens under urgency: first the frozen watch, last the pure bell, sound becoming the restored heartbeat. One minor slip—“shimmering masonry” is atmospheric but not re-anchored spatially—keeps this just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-setting—crack patterns in ice—functions as topographic map and tactical interface; it literally steers the tap that triggers the counter-song. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she smells “ancient dust and ozone stink,” ignores visual décor unless it vibrates. The frozen lake’s density mirrors the eventual “hammered repose,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → tap → bloom expands → beings dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass floor, brass cradle, rusted gears—each object is handled, not catalogued, and constrains the final alignment. The pavilion’s hum becomes a bodily metronome that times every move.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystalline forecourt is not backdrop; its wet lattice releases the raw material Elara needs and its evaporation withdraws it, forcing her to commit. The basalt obelisks’ shadows literally measure the psychic barometer, integrating setting into tactic. Environment constrains the final image: the unmoving cloudscape she “loves fiercely” is the last dynamism she’ll ever see. 9+ gate cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fortress-as-garden constrains every move: creeping vines dictate fuse placement, humidity is an enemy that rewrites chemistry, stone lions become launching pads. The kerosene knot itself is micro-setting—handled, swung, extinguished—its soot pattern on his palm the final image. Sensory hierarchy filtered through pyro-artist eyes: scent of thyme = fuse risk, color of tile = formula. Environment shapes tactics; no postcard tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Grotto, tide pool, and jade cicada function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the starfish drift literally mirrors Kael’s exit Elara must accept. Limestone eye, Milky Way reflection, and seaweed tangle are filtered through her chronicler gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless: thumb in pocket, eyes on water, voice finally released upward. The cave’s acoustic echo literally amplifies the final line, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Xenial Trellis functions as both environment and tool: its silver vines actively cradle Elara during inversion, constraining her posture and enabling the harvest. Cloud layer, thinning air, and bruised-purple sky are filtered through her claustrophile’s awe. Spatial choreography is clean: the upward-fall is tracked from ankle release to waist-grab back to ground. One elided detail—how she descends from miles-high lattice to “ground”—is smoothed by mythic tone and does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism terrace is no backdrop; its groaning panels and kaleidoscope sunset directly pressure the choice to deploy the vial and then refract the closing peace. Sensory economy is ruthless: one color spectrum, one low-frequency hum, one expanding drop. Micro-setting (glass floor, control deck) doubles as crucible and tool, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    City’s wet ferrocrete, oil-slick coolant waterfall, acid-stained wall, chrome skeleton-trees—each tactile detail doubles as choke-point or tool: orchard supplies the key fruit-energy, wall mural literally births the stairs. Spatial choreography flawless; orchard perimeter, eastern wall, stair apex track cleanly. Ruby flake’s crystallized code-memory is micro-setting that cuts open reality, constraining her only path. Final matte-black throne overlooking ruins is image that recharges all prior neon rot with sovereign clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The burnt cathedral of ash under cold starlight is not backdrop: the soft ash receives the ring, swallowing its sound, literally charging the final image. Distance, texture, temperature are filtered through Mara’s bone-deep fatigue; she notices what matters—ash like snow, iron’s bite, silence pressing on eardrums. Spatial choreography is clean: cross-legged center → Elian kneels → both stand → ring falls → empty palms under stars. Environment constrains the choice: no planks left, only ash to receive the anchor she relinquishes.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is not postcard scenery; its indigo heartbeat mirrors escalating anxiety and provides the spatial choreography for the ritual center. Sensory hierarchy favors ozone taste and spongy moss under boots—details that guide stance and movement. The submarine bolt functions as micro-setting-as-tool, its implosion DNA charging the final image. Spatial logic holds: altar stone, rows of fungi, bolt placement all remain trackable across the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sepia reading room is rendered through tactile friction—dust motes in golden light, viscous air, brass socket click—each detail filters Elian’s prizewinning attention and literally guides crank speed via echo. Micro-setting triumph: the curved mahogany walls are not backdrop but active acoustic mirror required for the climax; remove them and the physics fail. Sensory hierarchy obeys urgency: sight narrows to the cylinder, sound becomes the hidden gauge, touch translates spring tension into revolution count. No extra scaffolding; every detail is recruited into the resonance engine.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse is not backdrop but prosthetic: glass-leaf chimes, ionized soil smell, and weeping-lead trunk all dictate Valerius’s footfalls and final reach; the pod-as-micro-setting charges the closure image. Environment materially constrains tactics—misalign a step and the ritual fails—satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is near-ideal for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    File room as micro-setting constrains every move: canyon-narrow aisles, fluorescent grid, the “negative space in the grime” that literally funnels attention to the anomalous box. Selective sensory hierarchy—dust motes over sound, cardboard pores over visual sweep—mirrors an archivist’s prioritization of trace over spectacle. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the envelope is stapled to the back cover, so the tearing motion and metallic clink of the button land with tactile certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lagoon’s toxic shimmer is not postcard beauty; it stains coat and skin, constraining her to stand in it while the broadcast fires—setting literally charges the final image. Puddle-map is a micro-setting tool whose geometry of neon+star dictates every alley step, fulfilling the “tool constrains choice” gate. Drone scanners and submerged causeway are tactile, lived-in, never listed; spatial tracking is flawless. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: she smells rust, feels viscous drag, sees inverted city—details selected by urgency, not tour.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto’s wet stone, brass condensing, and color-shift from sickly glow to bruised indigo are selective, sensory, and tied to Elias’s attention. The prism atrium acts as both looming antagonist and acoustic trap, its glass panes refracting the hush; this dual use satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elias circles, keys click, lights pulse. Minor waiver: “spaceship crashed from a different dimension” is visual shorthand, not tactile, but the total atmosphere overpowers the glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating ash-cloud arbor is not postcard backdrop; shelf-fungus workbench, star-moss patch, and wind-borne detritus constrain Silas’s physical reach and supply ritual materials. Micro-setting—the seed circle—functions as altar and crucible; removing it breaks the ritual logic. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: tactile dampness first, visual glint of moonstone second. Final blue-glow sapling reuses setting element (moonstone) now embedded, charging closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sunken greenhouse, glass skeleton, and black mirror-pool are filtered through Silas’s tinkerer eye—he notices rusted joints, petrified roots, the ladder’s aluminum shear. Vines and ash constrain the final tactic and image. Sensory economy favors smell (wet decomposition) and touch (soot under nails). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cleft descent to island landing. The waterfall’s lightless reflection charges the compass reveal and the theme of unreadable direction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Foundry is rendered through heat, ionic residue, and the ceramic crucible—tools that literally constrain choice. Rainwater sluicing across blackened floors supplies both atmosphere and cooling counterpoint to the captured-sun crucible. Micro-setting (the invisible “spiderweb cracks” of ruptured reality) functions as the true stage; the gold fills this negative space, so environment directly shapes the final image. The industrial alchemical details stay accurate enough for the 600-word scale and never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Echo Gorge is rendered through acoustic micro-details that directly shape tactics; the harp’s dissonance is inseparable from the stone acoustics. Mist, twilight, and temperature drop are filtered through Elian’s practiced eye, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ultraviolet forest is not backdrop; its violet intensity literally strips skin and psyche, constraining the final choice to stand still. Body-as-setting functions likewise—floating ribs, axis rotation—charging the closing image. Micro-setting (pewter strap) bends under grip, soft-metal property paying off when Kaelen distorts it to remove the mask. Sensory hierarchy skews UV and proprioception, exactly what a torture-upgraded nervous system would prioritize.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Alchemist’s Market is evoked in four precise strokes—sulfur, lavender, groaning wind, creaking slats—then kept alive through Elian’s goggle-adjustment and the prism’s chill. The lighthouse fragment functions as micro-setting: its salt-corroded edge cuts his finger-tip of attention and literally bends the light that reveals the storm. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or prop positions. Final image recharges the motif: the cooling lens in chill evening air externalizes the internal cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ticket booth, hydraulic valves, plaster clowns, and grime-layered counterweights are delivered through Elias’s technician gaze—tools, proximity, material behavior. Dust ripples and brass gears provide micro-setting that directly shapes his diagnostic choices. Echoing cracks widen as counterweights wake, welding atmosphere to event. The “weightless burden” is an intangible setting element that finally lifts, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass orchard library is not backdrop but engine: transparent boughs store mutable histories, so cracking them rewrites reality. Micro-setting (iron press, bottled whisper) constrains every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; shards track across the fall. Frost patterns function as both forensic clue and sabotage tool—irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Baroque asteroid, phosphorescent hours, and velvet-mirror mechanics are sensuously specific and filter through Elian’s poetic bias. The micro-setting of the grand salon—mirrors, brocade, singular ray—constrains the climax; environment literally shapes the refraction that rewrites history. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Resonance Chamber is not backdrop but antagonist—its walls, rafters, and iron doors visibly corrode or re-bloom under the harmonic assault. Micro-setting (the master gear’s empty socket) literally accepts the stone and decides the world. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s craft: brass pins, spring steel tension, “choir of metal birds.” Tool-as-setting constrains and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rebreather filters, copper casing, black mirror-lagoon, and limestone “hinges” are not backdrop; each constrains action or enables the final harvest. Petrichor is rendered as ancient chemical ghost, then as planet’s birth-scent—specific, irreplaceable. Spatial choreography tracks body, compass, vial, jar without drift. Micro-setting (cracked compass glass) functions as setting-as-tool that charges the final image when it warms. No sensory checklist; each sense appears once, under POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    The storm-beaten archway is not backdrop but tooling: iron grating becomes sculpture mount, concrete lip becomes launch rail, turbine vibration becomes metronome for trance. Micro-setting—glass slide, cedar roots, arc lamp—constrains every tactical move. Spatial choreography flawless: we track distance to cliff edge, wind angle, beam projection plane. Final image (phantom map suspended in spray) recharges every earlier sensory thread.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber pavilion glass actively transfigures winter slush into perpetual autumn and supplies the literal filter that enables the discovery; spatial choreography is clean as Elara leans, presses, lowers.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment, body, and tool all constrain choice: the gantry rig governs descent; the obsidian’s liquid heat distorts air and destroys sound, forcing the debris-code tactic; the diary’s leather surface becomes the only writable medium. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (archivist’s cataloguing gaze on bones vs. rusted iron). Final image of cold black rock recharges the earlier liquid mirage, locking the cost in place.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Spectral glow…unmoving water” and “friction of a wagon wheel on cobblestone” deliver selective, sensory particulars that mirror her urgency; the lanterns refuse to burn out—an environmental rule that later flares in response to her act, charging the final image. Micro-setting (bottle) literally contains the future, constraining her choice to shatter it. Proper-noun economy is tight; no geography drift. Entry to 9-band blocked because lanterns’ causal feedback is mentioned but not shown altering her tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cistern’s star-blossom nectar is not mere garnish; its viscosity literally enables the listening act and then swallows the evidence—setting as tool. Spatial choreography stays clean from orchard balustrade to cistern lip; no floating props. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vane’s archivist bias: acoustic absence first, then tactile brittleness, then olfactory bloom-oil. Only the city below remains a smoky void—acceptable given POV isolation, but keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Icebound atrium constrains every move (cold limits breath, glass limits escape) and the acorn-cap micro-setting becomes the tool that flattens chaos; starlight witnesses the theft, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The wind-blasted parapet, iron frame, and bell rope are not backdrop but instruments: the rope literally enables the final safety move; the cured epoxy on the sensor is the physical gate that grants agency. Sensory hierarchy (thin air, cathedral-hemp texture, capacitor hum) is filtered through a technician’s priorities. Environment constrains the climax—absolute stillness is the rare condition he refuses to violate—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orbital outpost is rendered through Elara’s janitor-eye: she notices dust on sensor arrays, the obsidian viewport’s smudges, the low hum that “purrs.” The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting—its amber filter literally recolors the galaxy and constrains her perception during the climax. Sensory economy is strict: only touch (cold pane, warm shard) and sight (clinical blue → amber bloom) are needed; sound is the slept-panther hum that modulates tension. No credibility breaks; vacuum physics respected.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Abandoned apiary with petrified comb and silica sand is tactile and lived-in; Elias’s boot crunches provide micro-setting anchor. Spatial choreography is clean: clusters of ghosts → dry well → altar of supers → lifted box; distances track.

Final image of “clear and sharp” glass recharges earlier distortion, passing 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lagoon, bruised twilight, and metallic edges are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elian’s poet-eye; setting constrains the ritual—only post-storm water holds the needed “ink.” Spatial choreography is clean: driftwood cluster → feather location → kite drift path all track. The lagoon surface becomes the final mirror that holds the lost kite, charging the closure image. Weather is not backdrop but medium; water color and wind shear directly enable/hinder the weave.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: the living stone pillars’ constriction literally breaks saplings, forcing Silas’s copper bridge. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-specific—he notes “salt-smoothed leather,” “ozone and wet earth,” the “low-frequency piezoelectric hum”—details that matter to his diagnostic eye. Spatial choreography is immaculate: ladder, spool, mortar joints, coil around branch, green spark, all track cleanly across the single scene. The final image—warm pillar pulsing against his back—recharges every prior description of cold stone, proving environment constrains choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Basalt slickness, alien-ivy-strangled statues, copper air: selective sensory triangulation keeps POV academic-detached. Micro-setting (fly amber handled twice, finally discarded) constrains final choice. Bronze-quiet motif modulates from atmospheric to thematic at closure. Rain-washed tower surface directly enables amber’s audible crack on impact; qualifies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming jetty is not postcard scenery; its phosphorescent creepers literally guide Silas’s hand placement and frame the precise drop zone. Salty rails, oily water, and rusted war skeletons are filtered through his re-vegetative obsession—he smells “clean salt” only after the kelp ignites. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track boots on timber, gloved grip on satchel, the downward arc of pods, the upward spiral of spectral kelp through sunken tanks. Environment constrains the final image: the living tapestry overtakes the war wreckage, recharging the motif of roots consuming metal.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settlement is rendered through scavenger optics—corrugated iron, oxidized iron, dry rot—objects that double as tools (amber bottle shard becomes lens). Micro-setting triumphs: the phonograph grooves act as terrain, the wax-coated leaf as map; environment literally steers decryption. Spatial choreography is flawless; every object stays tracked from bunker to workbench to final overlay. Only the wider wasteland remains slightly generic, preventing a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observation deck functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: the gravity hum, the blue-shifted glare, the cold deck plates against her knees all veto escape and force the sketching ritual. Jacket-as-tool inherits the same work: rough fabric, gilded thread, and inherited scent tether her to filial duty while rewriting its purpose. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible camera moves—so the deck, body, and jacket fuse into one continuous pressure chamber. Final image charges the jacket’s compass as the new true north, qualifying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    The icebound spire is not backdrop; its slippery parapet forces cautious footwork and the chess-grid fractures underfoot at climax, literally breaking the old world. Violet sky and ozone scent are filtered through Elian’s exhilaration, never tourist catalog. Brass lid, frost dais, and wind-tear all constrain movement and cue the swap beats; environment charges the final image of horizon-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering gallery is not postcard backdrop: its acoustic curvature literally stores the city’s panic, then expels it when the kings collide. The chessboard micro-setting (missing pawns) constrains the final image—Elias studies the empty squares, confirming the cost. Violet twilight from the Penumbra is filtered through Elias’s crisis-trained eye: “luminous absence” is both physics and worldview. Spatial choreography clean: boots drag, dust etches, sunbeam lands on the text.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tottering book-mountain is never backdrop; shelf integrity, sliding lexicons, and paper-mulch under fingernails steer every step and final plant. Mercury glass acts as micro-setting that literally reframes chaos into path, charging the closing image when it trembles at the new rooted shelf. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory—perfect for a seer who “reads” with skin. One minor over-ripened adjective (“dust-choked”) but otherwise economy and POV filter hold.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Market-square still-life, suspended droplet, and ozone-scented knot anchor orientation early; the tapestry’s ragged border becomes the micro-arena that literally constrains his final tactic. Environment charges the last image—smoke loosens, water falls—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bone-canyon and pale spire are not backdrop but coercive technology: their echo mechanics literally force Kaelen’s tactic and determine the climax. Sensory cues (weight of silence, vertebrae towers scraping sky) are filtered through communal fear, never tourist catalog. Micro-setting qualifies: the spire’s surface refracts rather than reflects—this physical twist enables the entire conceptual payoff. Spatial choreography is clean; Kaelen climbs, speaks, observes result, then descends.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Brass workshop groaning like a dying leviathan” anchors sound, scale, and doom in one stroke; acid sea, green vapor, and dissolving floorboards stay tactile and causally active. Micro-settings—stone cheek, silver charm, burning cloth—direct Elara’s fingers and ritual alignment. Spatial track stays clean: she hovers, plunges, sinks in coherent vertical geography. Final image of glowing statue sinking constrains any hope of rescue and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cave is not backdrop; its “sloping tunnel that smelled of ancient salt and trapped air” and the chimney beam literally constrict vision and force the circular pool as the only site where the ritual can occur. Micro-setting tools—the barnacle ladder, the slick basalt, the magnifying water—constrain body and choice: Elias must kneel, must paint fast before light dies, must release because he cannot carry water home. Spatial choreography is exact: we track his descent, the missed gallery, the claustrophobic squeeze, the sudden aperture. The final image charges the pool itself as setting-object; without its magnifying property the smile could not widen and the conceptual re-weighting would fail.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt tower, porous cork, and night-garden scent are not backdrop but technology: each constrains how Elias can act. Micro-setting triumph: the vial’s “ancient, porous cork” literally filters his fear, turning body into lighthouse apparatus. Spatial choreography is flawless—gallery walkway vs. lantern room vs. bridge miles away—tracked without exposition dump. Weather shift (heat wave → storm → raw dawn) is causal, not decorative: it kills the horn and births the mist that demands the whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Starlit station’s frozen altitude is rendered through breath-frost and “steel beams supporting” silence; the broken dish’s upturned paralysis mirrors Elara’s locked gaze. Bronze censer foot acts as micro-setting—its patina darkening under heat—constraining her grip and filtering grief. Sensory hierarchy narrows to ozone/incense under crisis, widening to spectral birds only after tension releases. Final image of clear sky reconfigures the sky as memory, not void.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ravine orchard is not a postcard but a tactical shelter whose suspension bridges creak under storm wind, forcing Elias to retreat indoors for his experiment. Micro-setting inside the cabin—workbench cleared of dried fungi, storm rattling boards—mirrors the internal procedure of gating empathy. The antique glass eye itself functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid: its milky violet iris and cold heft constrain the occlusion ritual and charge the final image. Environment, body, and object all co-produce the decisive hush.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal dock of solidified light is not backdrop; its hum decides when twilight ends and night becomes “impenetrable,” forcing Silas inside. The lighthouse beam that illuminates time rather than space is a Chekhovian tool whose rule is paid off when the flower is placed “near the main gear,” literalizing the shift from navigation to commemoration. Sensory economy is surgical—triple-lens spectacles, oxidized copper, velvet scrap—each returns in the closure. Micro-setting (the brittle petals) constrains the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Subterranean orchid cavern, waist-deep meltwater, and the brass Q matrix constrain every move; remove any and tactics collapse. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s profession—draft angle, ozone scent—while cold water keeps attention narrowed. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track water level against chest, the ant column’s exact ridge route, the rectangular hollow in stone. The final image—portal mist versus drowning flood—recharges every prior sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Lacy menace” wind, viscous star-blood that sizzles stone into lace-like nothingness—tactile specificity mirrors internal erosion. Cobalt crystal frequency and magma geode heat constrain tactics: only summer-heat repels cosmic corrosion. Spatial choreography clean: ledge → precipice → cavern mouth → ridge geode; droplet miss-by-an-inch tracks. Final image reuses “lace” as annihilation pattern, now held at bay by firefly lattice—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ember Nexus is more than postcard: its energy lines audibly rise, bruising-purple color shift marks the sun’s vanishing, and the nautilus shell on the bench constrains every physical action. Spatial choreography is flawless—shell, palette, aperture, sphere all track. The final image is charged by the environment’s color/time shift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Scroll and charcoal function as micro-setting that constrains the final act; mountain cabin supplies cold, wind, timber to counterpose the dream-heat. Ozone tang / purple sun are vivid yet filtered through jaded dream-architect perception, never tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shop is lived-in: humidity clings like a coat, fog presses the pane, cedar oil and mold are handled while characters move. The midwife screw acts as micro-setting that constrains the final mechanical fix. Single-shard scope favors this density; environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Platform, tea bowl, crow quill, and quartz skin function as micro-setting that literally constrains every movement. Sensory triage under amber twilight and approaching thunder narrows perception to survival tools. Spatial choreography is pristine: cross-legged → table → arm → flakes falling onto basalt. Final image of rain on newly exposed skin charges the entire atmospheric setup.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lignin-and-neglect air, grime-streaked windows, copper coils threaded through shelving—details are filtered through Silas’s technician gaze and constrain every tactical move. The perfume bottle’s cloudy glass and viscous residue become micro-setting that literally traps memory; its final emptiness recharges the closing image. The archive’s silence is not backdrop but resource: it is weaponized into a pressure cooker and then annihilated by the chainsaw roar that syncs with the spiritual collapse. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, generator, vapor, and shelving track cleanly without impossible drift.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The temple is a micro-setting made from ‘petrified moments,’ a body-scale tool that literally bends under footfall rules; its curvature dictates the non-linear path that saves reality. Ozone and parchment smells are filtered through Elara’s cataloguer senses, grounding cosmic scale in sensory breath. The environment thus constrains tactics and charges the final image—floor stitched, sky re-starred—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fjord cliffs, wet grating, and brass key form a micro-setting trilogy that constrains motion and charges the final clatter. Selective sense filter—damp chill, groaning pipes—mirrors Kaelen’s narrowed perception. Horizon line mutates from comforting limit to “serrated blade,” a reweighting that nails closure. Missing 9.0 only because station hydraulics could be one tactile beat sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop; its living pulse and mycelial disregard for blueprints directly motivate Elias’s conceptual breakthrough and supply the tool (laser grid) that he weaponizes against his own walls. Spatial choreography is immaculate—tripwires, curtain, receiver, vents track cleanly across every move. Sensory hierarchy follows Elias’s intrusion-detector bias: angles, airflow, mesh aperture sizes over color or smell, giving lived-in authority. The mushroom glow becomes the story’s lighting rig, bathing the final image with the same spectral hue that opened the piece, meeting the 9-gate requirement that setting charge the final frame.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-washed library is not backdrop but tactical environment: dry books under open storm generate the core contradiction that forces her surrender. Micro-setting of the mica lantern charges the final image; its opaque panes make the impossible legible. Spatial choreography is clean—platform dissolves into cobblestones, shelves stretch into twilight—no impossible jumps. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: mathematician notices Euclidean-defying floor-etchings first, clover-melancholy scent second.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Condensation on the spinning glass, voltage meter spike, and wet-shadow tunnel texture coil around the moment of intervention; the booth’s iron guts and third-ral Reply grit constrain Silas’s reach and charge the final stillness, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The jetty’s orchid-choked planks, salt-pollen haze, and violet bruise of sky are not backdrop but reagents—petals “sigh” open to absorb the released laugh, turning biology into archive medium. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the loose stone she tilts is both tool and topography, its new angle enabling the entire chemical rite. Sensory economy is ruthless—every scent or color later reappears as emotional data. Only the refusal to let weather obstruct her ritual keeps this from 9; storm or wind could have tightened cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivy-strangled station and pyramid of gauze constrain staging and metaphor; the moon-rock’s clatter among earthly gravel re-prices value in a tactile, visually sharp final image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ultrasonic Forest is not backdrop but pressure chamber: frequencies carve skin, density shifts force lunge/retreat. Redwood bark delivers Sanskrit shock—setting literally speaks. Micro-setting bonus: the platinum ring’s cold weight anchors spatial choreography inside darkness. Stillpoint clearing earns its name by cancelling every prior frequency; environment charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The octagonal chamber, DNA-shelving, and gravity anomaly are sensuously anchored and directly enable the causal edits; the nib’s satellite metal is a micro-setting that constrains the unbend action. Selective detail—pages fluttering from the deep past—filters through Elian’s POV and charges the final “ozone and possibility” image. Meets the 9+ gate: tool charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Harbor is introduced as “rotting wood” and “phosphorescent waves,” concrete sensory specifics that also serve the theme of beauty-in-decay. The vintage camera operates as micro-setting: aperture ring, shutter click, and viewfinder geometry constrain every tactical choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—camera pans follow her gestures, distance tracked via framing. Weather (fog, moonlight) is not backdrop but active collaborator—moonlight bends to her hands, fog swallows identity—meeting 9+ gate. No anachronisms; world rules (silence → music via gestural notation) are taught through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Lost Civilization Archive is no postcard; its geothermal breath and paper-dust air actively pressure Elara’s stealth and shape her predator grace. The micro-setting of the vandalized canvas functions as a second environment: the “geological layers” of red paint literally constrain how she can intervene—any attempt to remove paint would destroy the hidden image. Spatial choreography is flawless: rebar-statue arm → ventilation shaft → alcove → miles-below Rotunda track cleanly without teleport. Only reason not 9+: the tapestry fragment is handled twice but never evolves physically (no new tear, no staining), so it charges the final image conceptually rather than concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Port container maze is rendered through Elias’s kinesthetic knowledge (corrugated canyons, magnetic plate humming), never catalog. The folded map functions as micro-setting that literally bends space; storm aurora charges the final image when the rod stills the latch—environment constrains tactics and recharges theme.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt dock’s wet timbers, ozone air, and brass lantern constrain every move: the railing props her knuckles, the grate limits mirror access, the tide stabilizes the geometric projection. Micro-setting—the lantern’s louvers—literally rewrites the visible world, charging the final image. Weather is not backdrop but catalyst: the storm’s aftermath glosses the canal into a projection screen. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cobalt Library, magnetic grotto, and mist-soaked skylight are not backdrop—they disable surveillance and enable every tactic; lodestones literally bend signals, cradling the king inside them is only possible there. Dust-moted starlight reappears in last line, reweighting mist from weather to ideological veil. Micro-setting (ivory king) becomes monument of defiance. World rules stay consistent; no exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Sublittoral fringe” and “waist-deep brine” anchor body and place early; kelp as lover’s fingers, whale-song vibrating watery molecules—each detail is sensuous, selective, and directly pressures the choice to detach. Dock-to-silt could use one sentence of causal foreshadowing to hit the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Turbine shadows as industrial scythes, knotty pine sap bleeding onto fingers, browning petals that crumble audibly—every sensory pick is filtered through Silas’s survivalist attention. Micro-setting (table, knife, bouquet) becomes the entire moral arena. Wind-farm energy is not backdrop but the heartbeat that justifies the Happiness Mandate. Final image of dust on a scarred tabletop recharges every prior tactile cue.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment (cobalt atrium/frozen lake) and tool (quartz colonnade) literally constrain every move: stepping into shadow projection is the forbidden act. Micro-setting (her body as conduit) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—she notices vibration frequency, cloud shade, ink-like shadow—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her distance from pillars, the lake beyond glass, the precise patch of floor where sky and stone blur.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The vitrified courtyard functions as both arena and tool: its mirror-surface reflects Elara’s plant layout, enabling silent bargaining; the same surface becomes resonant sounding board for the reed. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—gray tones, glass crunch, the reed’s ugly buzz—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography remains clean: Glassblower leans, nudges, scoops; Elara kneels, places, blows. Final image of dust-covered Silas recharges the “imperfection” motif, crystallizing theme.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Laboratory of Lost Sounds” is more than postcard: its acoustic damping swallows voices, forcing Elara’s tactile workaround. Carbide lens, velvet stand, and the prism-song construct are handled, not catalogued. Golden shadows return in the final image, mirroring the amber light that becomes touch.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory’s golden twilight and static star-charts act as both metaphor and physical constraint—timeless altitude isolates, enabling his alchemical apostolate. Brass press, loupe, charcoal stains supply tactile micro-setting that literally compresses grief into gem; environment shapes the final projection surface (her skin-as-sky). Spatial choreography stays clean: raven spirals down, woman climbs up, ash enters press, light exits prism. Ozone scent and updraft are selective, never tourist-catalog, and echo the electrical charge of resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    The loft’s wet concrete, acrid ink, and skylight rain are filtered through Silas’s surveyor eye; every surface is measured, never admired. The measuring tape itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains every tactical move. Spatial choreography is exact—tape tab clicks against mahogany, ink blooms across velvet—so bodies and props never drift. Setting charges the final image: the yellow tape a warning that reality’s geometry is rigged.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The psychoactive dust, lullaby marsh, and bronze prism are not backdrop but tactical hazards that force her jerky choreography; the twilight rotunda’s amber hush provides the final charged poise. Spatial logic is clean—no impossible jumps—and every sensory pick is filtered through the saffron veil’s protective bias.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library-as-setting actively constrains action: drifting narrative vines, phosphorescent spores, and mossy floor guide Elian’s stealthy gait and determine where shadows can hide. The river stone’s “geological patience” is tactile counterpart to the airy archive, embodying the weight the cloud-world lacks. Spatial choreography is clean; stone and shadow track logically from bench to shelf. Micro-setting success allows 9+ reach; capped at 8.9 because one spatial cue (“between two blooming encyclopedias”) could be slightly sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower floor becomes a surgical table—flagstones, grout, iron spine fused to root—every chip of stone alters Elias’s tactical options. Bioluminescent moss and frost-etched glass constrain visibility and time perception, charging the final image where dawn light hits exposed root. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: surgical pain narrows perception to cold ceramic, grit under fingernails, root-thrum against skin. Micro-setting (hourglass, pry bar, coaster) doubles as topography and divination tool, directly shaping the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The booth’s ozone/acetate chemistry is not mere perfume; it supplies the solvent that allows the psychometric transfer. The carbon-arc projector’s crystal lens becomes the micro-setting that ultimately stores the nebula, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—film, palms, glass, shutters track cleanly. Weather drops pressure outside in synchrony with internal pressure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Apex world, aurora arch, and Star-Loom are concretely handled, spatially tracked, and constrain choices (thin air, frost stones, lens cold). Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis to immediacies of touch and sound. Final image reweights setting as conduit, not backdrop. Slight risk of purple in “swirling canvas of electric violets” but paid off by closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.4)
    The glowing dune, iron crate, and brass clock are not backdrop—they are the only environmental tools that can host the archive; each surface constrains how Kaelen sings the lullaby. Silica petals that “dimmed as the danger passed” evolve with the beat, proving the setting is reactive, not decorative. Spatial choreography is microscopic yet flawless: knees, crate, clock, sand, tongue—every shift tracked. Final image of pulsing flowers locked to heartbeat satisfies micro-setting charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment constrains every move: aluminum willows warn of drops, iron oaks promise footing, wire-vines snag coat and redirect path. The gear is micro-setting that charges the final image when its hidden slot re-prices the forest’s ontology. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—philosopher catalogs timbre before color. No exposition dumps; world rules emerge through tactile navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Veiled Ridgeway is never catalogued; instead, salt-tasting mist, cloud-cobblestones, and thermal drafts act on the body and boat, steering choice. The ticket punch and star fragment function as micro-setting, their metallic and luminous textures constraining the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean—skiff, prow, tiller, deck track without drift. Environment is not backdrop; it is the medium through which courage is physically retrieved.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt masonry, dizzying spiral, freezing draft, and bolt-as-micro-setting all constrain the climb and color the final image. The fortress drinks warmth, the stairs tighten like a noose—metaphors obey POV panic rather than decorative flourish. Spatial choreography is flawless; trunk, bolt, and body stay tracked. Environment actively resists sound and thus choice, charging the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.3)
    The powdered marble haze is both atmosphere and countdown: every breath inhales the library’s death. The weeping-ceiling dew is the literal solvent for rebellion; the drifting roofless void becomes the Pretender’s throne. Setting is not backdrop but ammunition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Compressed, tactile detail—“solitary metallic buoy,” “cold steel of the lower bulkhead,” “silt layers that confused the automated systems”—anchors reader inside a functioning oceanic instrument. The station’s swaying chains, drowned sky, and calcium-rich concrete are not backdrop but catalyst: they supply the exact substrate the super-coral hijacks, turning setting into antagonist. Final holo-image of the road-become-reef recharges every earlier sensory scrape; micro-setting (hologram projector, torn atlas) charges the closing reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The half-open hangar doors, ozone-stale air, and groaning rafters anchor pressure before any line of dialogue. The circle’s low frequency “rattled the teeth”—tactile specificity that later justifies the resonance engine. Opera glasses recur as tool and talisman, their mother-of-pearl iridescence flaring against rusted steel, charging the final blue-white bloom. Spatial choreography stays clean: she steps over dismantled frigate parts, soldiers above on catwalks, drive core hanging directly over monoliths.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hot-spring heat, sulfurous steam, and dissolving amber constrain every beat; the milky-gold pool literally catalyzes the unseal. Spatial choreography is flawless—boots, satchel, kite-fabric, embryo—each object tracked across scalding ground.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass-and-iron greenhouse acts as micro-setting that literally constrains every choice—leave and die of exposure, stay and tend fragile life. The grafting knife and bio-luminescent orchid are tools/objects that charge the final image; their tactile states alter tactics (delicate slice, binding tape). Salt-spray vs loamy air mirror inner storm/stillness without overt symbolism. Only minor spatial drift: “central grafting table” appears without prior anchoring, but choreography recovers by the splice beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse library is not backdrop but tool: the grinding walls tighten breath, the bruising-purple light throbs bones, the broken box anchors the coordinate system. Micro-setting qualifies—the box and the beam of fractured light—both constrain tactics and charge the final leap. Spatial choreography is clean: horizon shatters, walls close, floor dissolves in sequence. Environment literally crushes choice, passing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sandstone pillars, wind howling “like a dying god,” goggles against UV—every detail is sensory, selective, tied to Silas’s hunter filter. Micro-setting of the mandala-stain literally rewrites space, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate: cornering in gully, ink hitting rock, Silas lunging through empty air. Weather and light actively punish the albino skin, constraining exposure time.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glacial roof pressing temples, copper wires “buried deep within the facility’s bedrock,” and the toggle’s friction are not backdrop but tools that enable/disable her final move. Cold is both literal and ethical—her act melts physical and social frost. Micro-setting (the toggle, the paper in glove) constrains the choice; library snow-load mirrors systemic weight. Final image reweights the same cold as “terrifying warmth,” a Conceptual Repricing that lands the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass dome functions as both setting and stakes—its membrane is the literal last skin between life and storm. Ballast sand, a micro-object, constrains the ritual and later re-enters the closure as the literal weight of memory. Spatial choreography is clean: kneeling, pouring, breath ghosting over thorns, sheathing knife, all track without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s cultivator bias—she smells ozone in canvas, feels loam instead of recoil, hears irrigation clicks before wind.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Sound-Wave-Garden is not backdrop but antagonist: every footfall triggers reactive flora, the rail-spike’s density is required to defeat acoustic buoyancy, and the final diamond prism is born from garden rules. Sensory selection is urgent—bass notes “like black tulips” against waders, cosmic static tails—never touristic. Micro-setting (iron spike) constrains tactics and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Observatory above clouds is more than postcard: the glass walls refract her isolation and the indigo ink literally mirrors the sky, bonding setting to tool. Spatial choreography is pristine—her walk from precipice to chart table to phone is tracked without a single floating prop. Micro-setting triumph: the cedar-iron scent of the pen roots us inside her father’s ghost. Weather stays atmospheric rather than tactical—no gust slams the dome to raise stakes—so it never quite constrains choice, capping entry to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber-as-micro-setting directly constrains the climax: its resin must absorb the waveform or the loop snaps. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—“ink-stained fingers,” “meteor hush”—and evolves with pressure, narrowing to the insect’s phantom shudder. No surplus geography; the laboratory is sketched only by console hum and shadow stretch, never catalogued. Sufficient constraint on choice to clear 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto is not backdrop; its weeping stone refuses chalk, forcing the sand pivot that drives climax. Mist color (bruised lilac) threads through emotional register and retreats only when silence is earned—setting as active constraint. Micro-setting object—the tile flake—changes temperature state to signal closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean: knees, satchel, thumb-sweep track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plaza is not scenery; it is a database of broken tiles, wind vectors, and heat signatures that 734 must re-code to keep a child alive. Shattered dome shards glint “prismatic reflections that mocked the darkness,” a visual that also mirrors 734’s own forbidden glitter of empathy. Micro-setting inside his palm—the tessera’s turquoise—becomes the pivot that rewrites reality. Spatial choreography is flawless: tread placement, wind-shadow geometry, sensor cone of hunter-drones all tracked without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)

The tarot coin doubles as micro-setting—its paint shift under merged timelines physically rewrites fate. Spatial choreography is clean: echo bounces off dense walls, laughter swells from 1924 to now without地理 drift. Environment constrains the final image: ghost bowing under healed boughs that will never again bear his name.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Velvet darkness, dim red standby, and black backdrop function as micro-setting that constrains movement to millimeters. Muscovite geode is handled, re-handled, and final-image charged; its pearlescent lattice becomes the literal environment of the photograph. Spatial choreography stays clean—camera aperture, taped crystal, chest-to-back breathing—no impossible positions. Sensory selection narrows to touch and monochrome light, matching crisis perception.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cave operates as micro-setting: ionized air taste and piezoelectric resonance are not backdrop but active agents that amplify sleeper dreams and constrain her drift. The fossil’s mineral lattice literalizes the “factually mystical” rule, charging the final image when she rubs it to quiet “racing synapses.” Specificity is irreplicable—removing the salt-iron taste or limestone aurora would collapse the synesthetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber warehouse, petrified-resin air, and solidified-sap walls are not backdrop; they deaden sound and force Elias to use buttons as tuning filters, so environment directly shapes tactic. Spatial choreography is clean: shelf → workbench → master hourglass → cliff outside. Micro-setting qualifies: the jar, buttons, and master glass function as extensions of the warehouse, each constraining the sonic experiment. Final image of blank stone recharges the amber enclosure, closing the sensory loop.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bluff’s jagged-wound metaphor, silver hush, and thaw-weeping ground filter every action; the mist both enables the cipher veil and later erases it. The pillbox micro-setting serves as tactile extension of setting, constraining the hand and choice. Spatial choreography is clean: stomp angles tracked, downdraft erases code, basket rises. Weather directly alters tactics—fog for concealment, rotor-wind for erasure—qualifying for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The toll-house gutter becomes a micro-setting that literally times the scene; fog density shapes the choice to stay or cross. Obsidian carriage and bone needle are tactile, weight-bearing objects, not scenery. Sensory hierarchy stays inside Silas’s ambient skin—he feels air displacement before seeing anything. Only minus: riverbank mud is generic; a sharper sensory hook there would hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The skeletal hives, red clay, and slat-roof sun-beams are continuously woven into action—clay rises as light shifts; glass reframes memory. The bee-yard’s “memory of sweetness” is a sensory ghost that guides Silas’s gentleness, satisfying the 9+ gate: setting constrains the final choice not to force the vessel. Spatial choreography is clean; wheel, bench, and glass stay tracked. One microscopic slip—“scorched wasteland” is repeated verbatim; a fresher descriptor would nail 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fire-escape grate, the oily harbor sheen, and the gauge-tooth’s calibrated steps are not backdrop but equipment: each constrains how Elias kneels, pries, angles. Mirrors and moonlight form a second, mechanical flora whose “bloom” depends on salt-air physics and micro-adjustments. Space stays coherent: five-story drop, air-shaft width, basement glass—every optic angle is tracked. Final image reuses the opening water-light motif, now weaponized into a beam that reconfigures the gloom it once merely mirrored.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal library, brass sundial, and obsidian disc are not backdrop; they constrain movement (cloud-tide laps at steps), measure pressure (sundial hums), and force the decisive self-confrontation (mirror). Micro-setting (the terrace stones’ cold) acts as emotional barometer. Final image of rising white sea recharges opening vista with new meaning. Only the Sun-Drinker valleys remain slightly generic—keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lily pond, temple, and mirrored sculpture are not backdrop but aperture: the hollow in the sculpture literally demands the organic spiral, constraining her final move. Moisture-laden air narrows vision to prismatic ribbons, guiding her attention to the gap. Micro-setting inside the installation’s wire throat decides the beat. Weather residue (puddles, bruised sky) is filtered through her ink-stained urgency, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cigarette-scarred booth, ozone-laced air, and flickering torchlight outside compress inside/outside tension into sensory economy. Micro-setting—patch cables, VU meters bending against plastic—functions as the only weapon Elias has, directly constraining the climax. Ley-line detail is brief but causal, not tourist. Spatial choreography is clean: glass window, master fader, oscilloscope all track. Final smoke curling toward ducts re-anchors the body in the room after cosmic scale, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian organ, starlight, and contracting stone are viscerally sensed and directly constrain her tactic—she needs open-air acoustics. The “shadowed nexus” is more postcard than lived-in, but the organ-as-micro-setting charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: walls inch inward, compass point dances, exit gap narrows then widens. Meets 9+ gate via tool/organ that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quarry’s slate-grey ground, jagged rock, and mist are not postcard scenery—they constrain Silas’s easel placement, supply the charcoal dust, and mirror the cold void he paints. The ribbon-as-micro-setting is handled twice: first as relic, finally as fused artifact that alters the portrait’s truth-status. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Silas notices texture, stability, reflected light—never faces. Final image is charged by the quarry’s persistent geometry and the ribbon’s tactile memory, reweighting the cold case stake.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment acts as crucible: sodden moss on rivets, ozone-wool air, and the corroded console slot constrain every move and supply the ritual interface. The copper nail itself becomes micro-setting—its green crust and conductive click anchor the technological-spiritual hybrid. Weather is not backdrop but sovereign antagonist whose “bruised, swollen flesh” clouds literally bleed away when petitioned, reweighting the world. Spatial choreography holds: bulkhead → console → microphone → observation port, all slick distances preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mountain pullout, plastic-shrouded bridge, and wet-plate shard all constrain attention and final image; the scaffold-flutter code literally channels the revelation, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Silas’s professional ear/eye bias, fog and ether scent braided through action. Spatial choreography is tight—truck seat, ravine, dashboard shard all track. Minor over-wrought phrase (“asphalt…glowing with residual heat”) is forgivable amid dense, purposeful texture.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned circus train is not backdrop but tactical environment: cage-bar shadows and ozone scent directly enable Silas’s psychological ambush. Body-as-setting appears when the repo men physically hesitate at the threshold, proving the space constrains their choice. Recurring object—the satchel of hyper-inflated bills—re-enters the final image, charging the closure with conceptual cost. High-band gate cleared: environment shapes tactics and final image.

    The observatory’s copper silence and the dream temple’s black basalt are sharply etched, each detail filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze. The daylily’s ghost-orange hue and the Cepheid’s breathing light reappear at closure, reweighted from burden to shared energy. Spatial choreography is clean: desk → ocular → dream steps → courtyard → rising dust. Environment constrains method—only the star cycle grants entry.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Swirling orchard vortex is never static description; it tightens physics, supplies the stepping-stone path Kaelen needs, and dictates the seed’s geometry of attack. Apple-crush scent and ozone narrow perception under crisis. The floating root system he balances on functions as micro-setting that constrains the final reach. Environment directly charges the closure: once the vines straighten the curled light, the lake’s surface becomes the resonance plate that carries the confession away.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt sky is not scenery; its bruised hue is a lingering symptom that forces permanent twilight and justifies the psychic overload felt by characters. The yew clipping literally contains the maze, so the micro-setting (a 3 cm twig) functions as the entire topology that constrains the climax. Ozone scent and silver-lined knuckles tether the speculative frame to bodily experience. Environment, tool, and body together charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but surgical theatre: roots cradle bones, sap demands payment, skull-lined corridors squeeze movement—every environmental detail constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Sensory economy is strict; half-lit glow and marrow-fed fruit are re-used, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: Elian kneels, carves, presses card to sap—no impossible positions. Micro-setting (burned tarot card dissolving into golden light) becomes the vector that reconfigures destiny, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Limestone quarry’s swallowing silence is an active force that shapes the stakes; the trailer’s luan plywood and dog-stench micro-setting mirror his porous psyche. The grille cloth’s basketweave is not wallpaper—its 1968 dye pattern is the forensic key that rewrites Elias’s future. Spatial choreography clean: crouch, knees pop, frame twist, stumble back—bodies and distances track. Weather omitted but irrelevant; environment already supplied by acoustic decay of a place that once “made noise.”

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arbor itself functions as micro-setting: magnetic roots, iron-willows, console dials are not backdrop but circuitry Elian must re-grammar. Temperature drop, ozone scent, metallic dust tactilely braid grief with engineering stakes. Spatial choreography is clean: cross-legged → pedestal → soil bed; no impossible props. Cloud-deck altitude subtly governs the ticking-death clock. Missing 9 only because orbital decay physics is poetic, not precise enough to constrain a later tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Brass archways, viscous soul-brine, bamboo creel, and grinding titan gears are tactile and POV-filtered; the creel’s woven lattice constrains the scoop-and-smelt sequence, charging the final ingot. Spatial choreography is immaculate—water rises, Elian wades, crucible glows, tide recedes. Micro-setting (creel, gears, body) actively constrains choice, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crystal cave acts as both cathedral and battery: its geometry refracts the final light and literally enables the climactic connection wave. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s professional eye—weight, chemistry, structural integrity—so every observation also pressures his decision. The obsidian floor of fossil shells is not backdrop; it supplies the story’s recording medium. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous movement toward the stalagmite.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy-choked station, mirror-etched glass, and mud that sucks his boots are filtered through a cartographer’s eye; every detail constrains the next move—graffiti as map, riverbank as terminus. The taped accordion functions as micro-setting, its failing bellows dictating the timbre of apology. Sensory hierarchy obeys urgency: smell of damp plaster, metallic scrape of initials, final cold water on skin. Environment directly shapes tactics and charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing library is atmosphere incarnate: light-breathing marble, bruised-purple shift, mist that erases exits—every detail pressures tempo and choice. Micro-setting mastery: the watch’s heat and ticking stand in for looming walls, constraining the final pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Velvet Observatory anchors by word 20; midsummer humidity and climbing ivy constrain every beat—noise, scent, temperature work as active antagonists. The ice violin’s micro-fissures and supernatural frost are tactile, not catalogued. Final transformation uses setting: melting slush pools around ankles, repurposing the very pillars the ivy strangles. Environment directly enables and then embodies the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto is not backdrop but instrument: infinite drop below forces Elara to work without net, aurora light supplies the unstable palette for the final illusion. The obsidian table, the shifting bruised-purple→neon teal, and the mnemosyne-drive’s jagged glow all constrain how she can move and see. Micro-setting qualifies: the emerald chip functions as portable cathedral—its lattice visible in the aurora at the end, recharging the opening “radiant hush.” Spatial choreography clean: corpse, brush, chip, her body remain tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    “Umbral Grotto above the clouds” is immediate, sensory, and causal: the bruised-purple light, the mossy floor, the floating cedar whose roots “cling desperately” supply both perch and peril. The vineyard hush and “sea of unspun wool” clouds are atmospherics that also double as metaphors for memory/unformed life. The pin’s oxidized copper catches the violet light, charging the final image when it re-enters her hair. No detail is tourism; each constrains tactical choice (climb, cut, release) and tracks spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse itself functions as micro-setting: rusted railing constrains stance, salt-crusted glass refracts dawn light onto the mirror shard. Wind-chime orchestra is a tactile prop that constrains Elias’s method and Vance’s choice; iron rods beaten flat echo Vance’s worldview. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—Elias notices silk cuffs, Vance the violet horizon—no tourist catalog. Environment directly charges the final image: dawn gray indifference versus the dark textile Vance clutches, a concrete, irreplaceable contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting triumph: the basin of water becomes the entire crucible; its rings constrain the only possible revelation. “Sycamore hush” and “dry rustling peace” are selective, sensory, and thematically coherent. Spatial choreography is flawless—pebble, water, starlight, and two bodies tracked without drift. The floating platform stays atmospheric backdrop; it never pressures choice, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bone-tower canyon is not postcard backdrop; its hollow acoustic ribs are exploited as the literal instrument that enables the climax. Micro-setting (the obsidian arrowhead) functions as navigational stylus and is handled repeatedly, altering tactics each time. Sensory hierarchy obeys aural urgency—every visual note (crow arcs, calcium glare) is filtered through sound-propagation stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless: the arrow’s ricochet path is trackable, and the distant femur strike is credibly audible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound spire is no postcard: wind “bit,” mist walking tears stamina, permafrost bruises knees. The brilliant-dim paradox (pale starlight brighter than sun) is filtered through Elara’s mage-perception and charges the final white flare. Spatial choreography is clean: pack slides “into the abyss,” stone slots into “jagged, rime-covered gap.” Environment constrains the climax—only at this altitude does the arch “accommodate impossibilities”—so the setting directly enables the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library is not backdrop but tool: the anaerobic gloom preserves the jarred vows, directly enabling the color reveal. Spatial choreography is clean—weights, silt deck, double doors, brass vibration in teeth—each detail filters through Silas’s professional attentiveness. The sky lanterns above contrast the depths, recharging when their glow refracts in the water around the opened jar. Micro-setting (brass key tag) literally unlocks the stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ambered deck, translucent resin sucking at boots, and swallowed gold coin create a micro-setting that literally ingests value—this constrains the final gesture and recharges the “money of ghosts” motif. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: under the droning prophecy Hiero notices only the cold discs and the vanishing coin, a credible narrowing. World-rules (reverse-time signals, analog console) are taught through action, not exposition. Spatial choreography stays clean—console, dials, floor, coat pocket track unambiguously.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory is never described for its own sake; every brass gear and dying sunbeam is filtered through Silas’s intent. The copper walls cool “as the sun dipped” – temperature as emotional barometer. The map’s worn indigo where “her fingers had once traced” turns parchment into a tactile relic. Final image of blank page + sculptures is spatially exact and stakes the whole transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Blue-shadowed viaduct and evaporative dawn air are selectively filtered through Elian’s peri-mechanical obsession; the bell-as-micro-setting constrains every droplet placement, and the final geyser recharges the same sapphire light, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting even though broader geography stays sketchy.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The midnight ridgeway functions as both vantage and moral ledge; every step downhill is a literal and ethical descent. The mirrored pools blur sky and mud, forcing reader and Elias to question what is memory and what is mirage. The apothecary counter, slick with algae, becomes an altar whose surface refracts the final meaning. One hairline slip: “twilight” is named twice at the edges, slightly overworking the liminal lighting.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nocturnal arbor is not backdrop: the glass leaves, frost, and star-dusted void physically constrain visibility, sound, and time. Titanium clip, ivy controls, and G-force rules all shape the fix. Setting is taught through Kael’s pattern-seeking perception, never inventory. Closure is charged by the moonlit parachute against that void—environment re-weights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating rock dojo is not backdrop but tactical arena—its shifting statues mirror Kael’s crumbling identity and force stillness-as-defense. The glass jar acts as micro-setting: handled, rewired, electrified; its glow colors the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys machine POV: colors “that did not exist yesterday” are data anomalies, not prettiness. Spatial choreography is flawless—blade passes through after-image, energy vectors tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bay-window studio, brook audio, and terrarium micro-setting constrain every move; Elias can’t leave the room until the seed performs. Sensory hierarchy obeys his puzzle-designer bias—magnetic locks, narrative arcs, incubator thermometer—never tourist catalog. The “sullen heat” of the seed and “acrid odor” at emergence are tactile and plot-critical, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: envelope → table → terrarium → glow in corner, no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tunnel’s damp concrete curvature, viscous air, and gasoline haze are filtered through Silas’s synesthesia—sound is tactile, wind is time—so setting constrains his tactic: only twelve blowers can macerate this specific silence. Spatial choreography is clean: semicircle → center → knees; exhaust vortex occludes exits, tightening claustrophobia. Micro-setting (frayed pull-cord, ancient oil crust) doubles as character mirror. The final image (nursery of light) reconfigures the same geometry, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen garden is not backdrop; its “solidified silence” and “thorny briars” of sentences actively constrain movement and mirror the guardian’s mental state. The pendant’s cutting light is a micro-setting object that literally reshapes perception—forcing the guardian to squint and re-evaluate tactics. Spatial choreography is clean: from underbrush to Philosophy section overgrown with hemlock, bodies and fog remain trackable. Environment, body (ribcage ache, fur ripple), and tool (pendant) all charge the final image where shadows “embrace us both,” satisfying the 9-gate constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight lattice and crystallizing veins are not backdrop but tactile obstacle—frost climbs his boots, magmatic glass cracks underfoot—choices are constrained by proximity to heat-sinks and cooling magma. The crucible and crozier function as micro-setting: every hammer blow and solvent drop alters the ambient cold, turning the bench into a battlefront. Final image recharges the setting: the ascending liquid sun melts the arrested smoke horizon, proving environment can be re-ignited. Sensory hierarchy obeys alchemist priorities: color of oxidation, viscosity of melt, smell of forbidden parchment ash—never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pink terrazzo shard is micro-setting that constrains choice—only it completes the circuit and later cools as proof of success. Wind-groaning girders, hydraulic grease, psi-gauge create tactile lived-in texture without catalog excess. Spatial choreography is tight: ladder → deck → receiver slot → pocket. Meets 9+ gate by charging final image, but a few catalog adjectives (“swollen,” “rusted”) are familiar; stays at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The brass rail, oil-dark water, and sideways-sliding watch-hands are tactile, pressure-filtered tools that constrain her only possible tactic: audible time. Spatial choreography stays clean as bodies flicker and the deck lurches; no impossible positions. Star-reflections on water evolve from pretty backdrop to navigation grid, directly guiding her dial adjustments—setting qualifies as micro-setting that charges closure. Spectral grotto never lapses into postcard; every detail either resists or enables the radio-frequency breach.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Penrose Atrium is evoked through kinesthetic geometry—walls that slide, stairs that loop, painted eyes that watch—details filtered by Elias’s fevered selectivity. Micro-setting triumph: the sinew thread and Elias’s lapel needle act as portable terrain, constraining every knot he can or cannot tie. Sensory economy favors heat, wet tension, and humming teeth; tourist-catalog description is rigorously pruned. Spatial choreography remains coherent even as space folds; the final white line image recharges the gallery’s earlier “infinite recesses” with obliterating compression.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cartography dome, pressure gauges, and rusted chain link function as micro-setting, each constraining or enabling the sensor hack. The chain link’s cold bite in palm vs. phantom Orion in lens creates tactile vs. cosmic scale tension that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: veteran submariner notices pressure flicker first, then starlight clarity. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mist-clad atrium is rendered through motion (swirling, coalescing, recoiling) that directly mirrors conflict beats; glass-ceiling location cues the decisive antenna-turn. The velvet box, fountain rim, and yellowed plastic hearing-aid provide micro-settings that constrain tactics. Sensory selection stays inside Elara’s tracer bias (ozone scent, static roar). The final image (blurred child on photo) reuses the visual motif with re-weighted meaning, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Crushing depth is rendered through “crashing hush in his bones,” “metallic shriek,” and the pulsing cable viewport; sound and pressure dominate, matching POV bias. The titanium corridor, server racks, and vacuum canister are tactile, lived-in, and choreographed without drift. Spatial logic holds as Elias moves console→port→airlock. Environment directly constrains the mission: tide shift will snap the umbilical, gold must stay to anchor Return. Final image of station fading into black recharges the abyssal atmosphere with an earned chill.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Observatory dome, snow-muffled silence, conductive ink’s metallic reek—each detail is filtered through Elias’s engineer-bureaucrat perceptual bias and constrains his next move (cold forces gloves off, thin air tightens throat count). The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting: its weight and edge dictate sensor placement and bridge analog-to-digital. Spatial coherence never wavers; camera tracks from dome ceiling to black table surface to throat-pulse without drift. Final image—inky hand, ticking artery—recharges the opal shimmer motif with new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bone towers, femur spire, and diamond micro-fracture are tactile, operative, and directly enable the sonic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Underground garden’s loam, drifting watering-can, and suspended ferns constrain the ritual space; micro-setting doubles as tool-set. Arrowhead and phone are handled, tracked, and charged. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s cryptid-hunter gaze—smell of secrets, gravitational flip in the gut—anchoring the surreal in tactile specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sky-bridge, sodium lamps, and bronze golems are sketched with industrial specificity; the orchard’s “crushed mint, wet soil, ozone” triad gives instant sensory vector. Micro-setting—the locust shell on the rail—constrains her moment of commitment and literally falls into the revolt, charging closure. Spatial choreography is flawless: reader tracks her height, the downward drift of sound, the upward surge of vines. Environment directly enables the climax by supplying both acoustic conduit and rebellious biology.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arcade’s blue-glass underwater glow, the electromagnetic kiss of the forcefield, and the rusted deposit box are all tactile, selective, and filtered through Elias’s courier eye. They constrain movement (timing dictated by scanner lag) and charge the final image with color. No spatial drift or impossible geography. Micro-setting rule met: the storm-bottle as handled object alters every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ribcage train, iron bars strangled by orchids, and the sawdust-to-moss pedal shift are irreplicable micro-settings that directly gate the halo fragment; remove them and the wrong-turn mechanics collapse. Body-as-setting (calloused palms, searing light) constrains the handling choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: carpenter notices grain, varnish vapor, blade-sound of glassy halo. Final image reuses the “misting hush” as golden twilight—environmental evolution that mirrors internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The library as micro-setting constrains every move: mahogany desk, rotunda shadows, thermodynamical limericks—all filter through Elara’s poetic-science idiom. Silk scarf doubles as portable setting/object that materially alters the room’s geometry at climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys her odd-hour solitude—narrowed to scent, sound, texture—then widens into cosmic vista without losing spatial coherence. Setting charges the final stillness once oceanic void reseals.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sentient-archipelago rules are learned through action (wind-whisper syllables, limestone mutter) and directly enable the sunrise theft; setting constrains her only window and tools. The watercolor palette becomes micro-setting whose empty ceramic charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows her curator-of-silence bias—sound and light dominate, smell/taste omitted—filtering perception through vocation. Spatial choreography on the terrace is immaculate: tripod, camera, hand-over-display, stylus strokes track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Nexus is evoked through gravity-warp and star-prick rather than tourist-catalog nebula; the body itself becomes micro-setting when the floor dissolves and footing becomes the scarce resource. The lock of hair functions as portable, re-weighted environment—first a tether to fear, finally “light” and song—meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: the woman’s narrowed perception under vertigo filters out everything but the star and the ribbon’s fray. One 0.1 dock for a faint echo of “velvet” folds, a touch shop-worn, but the image is immediately re-specificized through gravitational distortion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dome is a pressure-cooker character: glass groans, bioluminescent algae pin-prick the dark, “twisted grey” apple trees breathe. Every sensory pick is filtered through Silas’s folklorist eye—shipwrecks read as “broken constellations,” mushroom as “white, fleshy anchor.” Spatial choreography is flawless; we track his knees in damp loam, finger on vibrating cap. The final image—rusted keels dissolve into starlit campus quadrangle—re-uses the same iron ribs to reconfigure sky and memory, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Forgotten Library is no backdrop; dust settling on mirror-shards mirrors the slow accretion of Lenore’s resentment, while the prism’s pedestal spatially choreographs Silas’s retreat-to-desk-to-stylus advance. Micro-setting—the tea cup’s curved ceramic—becomes the diagnostic tool that dictates the next causal move. Environment constrains choice at every step; without the reflective shelves the shadow-exile conceit collapses. Final image of glittering debris recharges the initial dust motes, closing the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The parapet-waterfall–void construct functions as micro-setting that directly constrains the grafting action; every descriptor is filtered through Elian’s orchardist perception.

Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s map-framer eye: visual precision first, then kinesthetic vibration. No spatial drift; weather affects action (wet stone, dripping hand) without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sunken library is tactile, selective, and biased through Elias’s archival gaze; every sensory note (stagnant water, pulp fog) feeds his analytic goal. Micro-setting object—the pristine snow globe—literally constrains the final choice and charges the image. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → swim → desk → globe → ascent. Professional sub-details (vector of swirling snow, stylus notation) are sparse but sufficient for this beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-slick courtyard, ionised air, and rust-flowered plate constrain every move—spray angle, grounding, timing. Micro-setting (bolt plate) literally channels the lightning and final image. Sensory hierarchy is musician-biased: electromagnetic hum > visual. No orientation debt. Gate satisfied: tool charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The brass elevator cage, frost-laminated shaft, and refracted sunbeams are not backdrop but instruments: the rack-and-pinion rhythm paces the decoding beat; rime glare supplies the spectrum that unlocks the silver ink; glass solarium provides the sky-filled casket for the secret. Goggles act as portable prism-setting; diary paper and velvet cushion are micro-territories handled in tactile beats. Spatial choreography is immaculate—reader always knows hand, lens, page, light angle. Final image reuses the glass-and-sky motif to crystallize Elian’s willed silence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sky gondola is evoked through cold brass, riveted hull, and dusty starlight—details that constrain movement and focus perception. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the telescope and inkwell function as tactile extensions of Elian’s body, altering tactics (adjusting vernier, dipping quill). Selective sensory hierarchy (metallic cold, granular luminescence) mirrors emotional constriction. Spatial choreography is impeccable; no impossible moves or floating props. The ionospheric rules are learned through action, never dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hollow redwood is not backdrop but tool: its curved grain becomes the canvas, its bark hides the coin, its ceiling becomes the sky. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s haptic bias—sound is vacuum, light is secondary, texture is everything. Micro-setting (the coin’s micro-grooves) literally enables the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless: ladder, chalk, dust fall, rumble, sit—every object tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Airship timbers, magnetic anomaly, and the cedar-scented nursery constrain tactics (where she kneels, how light manifests). The dog-eared page acts as micro-setting that literally slots into the floor, altering her next move. Sensory filter stays tight—copper groan, viscous air—never catalog. Final sphere is charged by its first physical anchor inside the ship, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen library is not postcard backdrop—it actively forces tactics: ice-mirrors refract her fears, the dome’s “sterile, blinding whiteness” literally pins the gears. The clockmaker’s gear assortment functions as micro-setting, its brass teeth meshing with ancient iron to decide the climax. Every sensory pick is POV-filtered: ozone cuts “stale, frozen air,” briny wind evokes impossible sea-longing. Spatial choreography is spotless; bodies and tools track cleanly across the rotunda.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating granite arches, root-dangling orchards, and misty void are filtered through orchardists’ practiced eyes; the ceramic bell’s micro-perforations become the pivotal constraint that literally tunes the sky. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—narrowed to wind howl and vibrating soles—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse, pane of hush, and broken puppet head together function as a single micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move: the pane absorbs sound to be re-emitted as emotion, the puppet fracture provides the topographic map for encoding, the lighthouse apex is the only launch point. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—visual muteness, tactile porcelain edge, violet resonance—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is pristine: Silas stands, leans, dissolves; walls turn to mist; no impossible positions. One notch below 9 because the world rule for “pane of hush” is introduced more through metaphor than through one concrete demonstration of its sound-eating property in action, but the lyric pattern is taught so early that the slight abstraction is forgivable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cliff-labyrinth is never described panoramically; instead we taste salt, hear copper wings tick, feel oil ooze from bark. Micro-setting triumphs: the rusted vent shaft becomes the crucial artery that delivers the override. The iron orchard’s thorns and leaking oil constrain Silas’s movement and mirror his infection risk, charging the final image of the frozen, ruined painting he surveys. One slip: “granite wall” appears twice in adjacent clauses, a tiny spatial echo.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The braided ravine is not backdrop; its hydrodynamic eddy literally supplies the chemistry metaphor that solves the plot. Micro-setting (cupped palm, crushed protein dust) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a polymer chemist who notices pH, limestone scent, carbon bonds. One hairline slip: “granite obstructions” appear without prior geological cue, slightly teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass orchard, silica trunks, cloud-sea below—details constrain tactics (only updraft entry, no ground access) and charge the final image when moonlight refracts through the same branches that announce customers. Micro-setting of the counter and its objects (lead-dulling ring, anonymity locket) function as topography of regret that Elian must traverse with scalpel and moonlight. Sensory hierarchy favors cold, brittle, resonant textures that mirror the emotional stakes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from counter → scale → book → flask → door-bell without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert fortress, wet stones, and subterranean coral pantry are not backdrop—they force her shovel, guide her thermal reading, and supply the toxic ingredient she must metabolize. Micro-setting (iron bowl, frost-rimmed eaves) constrains the final alchemical act. One hairline slip: “mountaintop” vs. dune topography could nag geologically picky readers.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock-tower gears, copper speaking tubes, and iron pinecone are tactile and constraining: the pinecone’s mass literally alters temporal flow. Micro-setting—the counter-balance chain—dictates the stakes moment-to-moment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Elara notices “rivets rattling,” not tourist gloss. One minor slip: “borrowed starlight” stays poetic but never feeds back into choice, keeping it just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The moonlit canyon is not backdrop but resonator: its “silver scar” and “low, resonant frequency” physically feed the mirror’s refraction, charging the final image. The broken periscope mirror functions as micro-setting; its spider-web fissures dictate the synaptic path Elara must carve into herself. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: an engineer notices silica content, fracture angles, spectra, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography holds—she stays on the ridge, tools in lap, body grounded—environment constrains every move.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment, body, and tool converge to constrain motion: threshold-effect seams provide the only traction, the chronometer’s ticking literally bends physics, and the bioluminescent moss angles its light only when observed—each detail directly shapes how Elara moves and sees. The grotto’s “breath” and “stone intestines” texture the climb with visceral specificity. Final image reuses the luminous moss, now overhead as the “fire of protection,” to re-charge initial anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grove is rendered as a living instrument: mossy roots, gray canopy, silent siskins, the porcelain cylinder wedged into a cleft—each detail later vibrates in the final note. Micro-setting (body + tool) dominates: the stress-cracked block, the ceramic’s cold ribs, the gut string’s tension—objects whose physical properties dictate the climax. Weather is the absence of wind, a restraint that makes the single strum seismic. Spatial choreography is flawless; no tourist catalog; every noun earns its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Magnetic nexus is not postcard backdrop but active pressure: static-charged air, boot-sole purr, and time-window before “next phase” tighten choices. Body-level micro-setting (stone dent, coat collar) functions as tool and tactile anchor that charges the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual auroras filtered through eyelashes, auditory silence mapped like chessboard—mirrors tutor’s pattern-seeking brain. Spatial choreography is minimalist but coherent: ridge → valley → shelter vector tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    The roofless workshop under cold stars is immediately anchored and filters every action: open sky lets sound escape, forcing Elias to hunt for silence rather than noise. The vacuum tubes’ amber glow and drifting dust motes are tactile, lived-in, and economically selected. Crucially, the setting supplies the final image: fireworks light the coat into “crimson glory,” recharging the earlier velvet texture and fusing outer night with inner triumph. Environment does not constrain tactics beyond atmosphere, so the 9+ gate is just missed.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canopy humidity, wax-paper canvases, and the greenhouse’s sway act as tactile constraints; the corpse-flower spadix becomes the micro-setting that charges the final drawn image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting detail is selective and sensory: rusted skiff, metallic air, roots groping upward. The floating rock arches and reverse waterfalls are not backdrop—they steer every tactical move and finally cradle the sapling. Environment literally inverts to create the climax; removing the amphitheater would collapse the closure image. Meets 9+ gate: setting constrains tactics and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Stacks act as both terrain and antagonist: creaking metal dictates her ladder route and spawns killer vortices. Fog, rust, and saline gloom are filtered through her engineer gaze; every sensory pick serves the aerodynamic hunt. The patch micro-setting re-weights at closure, meeting the 9-gate almost fully.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: translucent membrane gauges aurora, crystal rope is tactile trigger, amber sheet stores extinct sunlight. Synesthetic cross-modal detail (color-into-sound) filters every line through POV bias. Final image—the appreciative hum inside the rebuilt hush—recharges the cavern as both prison and cathedral, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    The limestone spine, dead-air gorge, and charred driftwood are tactile and specific; the acoustic properties directly constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the reed flute) doubles as tool and emotional anchor. Selective sensory economy keeps momentum while still evoking altitude, dust, and dying light.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Topaz walls cast jaundiced light that literally colors every beat; the halo fragment’s heartbeat is a micro-setting that constrains the machine’s action. Stars winking out externalize the empathy drain, turning cosmos into countdown timer that charges the final blackout. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Operator at flywheel, Kael bolted to chair, brass gauges between. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the feverish hue subsumes other senses thematically, so the imbalance reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aurora-lit ridgeway is not postcard scenery; it defines thin air, cold that “felt like a knife,” and electrical hush that primes the sympathetic vibration. Spatial choreography is clean—summit circle, pendant in palm, light shooting upward. Micro-setting of the pendant itself (“delicate dragonfly-wing… suspended on woven silver”) constrains her posture and becomes the literal fulcrum of action. Environmental pressure tightens tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz arbor’s jagged spires and suspended mist are not backdrop but active sound-dampener and chill-generator, literally staging the hush that enables refraction. Station wagon, boots in wet loam, and glass prism function as micro-settings that constrain gesture (Elias must kneel, Mara must peer). Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: damp cold is felt on skin before visual spectacle. Only the arbor’s geology remains slightly abstract—no quartz-specific hazards—keeping this just shy of 9.0 environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The orchard floor “tasted of lost years,” the bamboo cage “rattling,” the bead holds “fossilized laugh”—all sensory, all POV-filtered. Micro-setting is the loom itself; its wooden frame becomes the raft’s hull, constraining the final launch. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track from clearing to encroaching white wall to airborne tapestry without drift. The environment is not backdrop; its erasure is the ticking clock that forces the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rock arches and gravity wells are not postcard backdrop; they pressure the choice to enter the shafts and later realign to confirm success. The mine shaft’s shifting gravity narrows tactics—Ewan must trust illusion-born silk instead of iron. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (soot, thread slide, boot thud) under smith-biased attention. Final azure light recharges the opening image of drifting arches, now frozen, tying setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bay’s corroded roof, oil-stained floor, and skeletal hulks are filtered through her sensory vocation—metallic taste of fear, pressure like deep ocean—so environment constrains her trance posture and anchors the shard ritual. Micro-setting (the glass shard) doubles as tool & wound, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no ghosted props. Only the faintest pulse of extra visual detail keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lantern room as glass trap, granite cairn as micro-setting, and storm-pressed glass conspire to constrain every move; the sea-glass’s final placement literally alters the physical layout of the “letter.” Sensory triage favors wind-whine and metal toll over visual clutter. Spatial choreography is immaculate—crate, stair, sill, hand, boot-heel match strike—no floating bodies. Environment charges the closing image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, glass wick, and storm function as micro-setting: the wick’s grooves and total-internal-reflection physics constrain every move Silas makes, charging the final image. Stars, mirrors, and atmospheric pressure are filtered through his exultant perception, never catalogued. Spatial choreography is tight—wheel, aperture, beam, shadow tracked cleanly. Weather is not backdrop but medium: the storm is literally steered, so environment shapes tactics and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating rock tea house is not backdrop—it supplies isolation, altitude, and rotating floor that calibrate the experiment. Micro-setting of wing ridges and solvent viscosity constrain timing and gesture. Valley-mist vapor literally parts to mirror revelation, charging final image. Sensory selection favors dye-master priorities: color, light, refraction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The broken sextant functions as micro-setting that constrains every key move: mapping dreams, twisting screw, channelling moonlight. Storm-lit tower supplies immediate atmospheric pressure but remains secondary to the tool. Sensory selection stays tethered to Elias’s professional eye. Environment and instrument jointly charge the final image—mercury light sealing the hedge—passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-body-window triad is spatially coherent and constrains every beat: only the mica pane allows egress; only the silver trees bleed photonic filament; only her scorched hands can shuttle. Sensory economy is biased to metallic tastes and ozone, mirroring the alchemical premise. The final image—“lattice of burning gold and violet”—recharges the micro-setting of her upturned face, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Grand Central’s “aggressively public” anonymity and the silver-fruit tree function as mirrored micro-settings that actively filter who can be seen. Body-as-setting (shrinking psychic footprint) literally constrains the crossing tactic. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: commuter worries fade, ink shimmer and wood grain sharpen. Final image of glowing fruit recharges the plastic fern, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment-body-tool triad drives every choice: brittle earth dictates the gentleness of his fingers; camouflage netting forces the ceremonial uncloak move; rye crust’s audible crack becomes the communion bell. Palace courtyard constrains tactical path (thorn labyrinth) and charges final image with imperial decay versus insurgent green. Micro-settings (seed packet, bread knife) handled in motion, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Frozen library, brass chamber, and velvet case are not backdrop; the cold literally shortens the energy half-life and forces Elara’s tempo. The rime falling from shelves after the resonance hum is a tactile cue that the world itself reacts to her probe. Micro-setting (obsidian desk, copper gauge) constrains every micro-gesture. Final image of twilight wrapping the spire recharges the opening “eternal, quiet winter” with new weight now that the vows are archived.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brine-soaked pier, barnacle table, and creeping dawn are selective, pressure-filtered details; the watch-fob’s flaking gold reweights meaning at climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across feints and lunge.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lavender bluff is not backdrop; its pollen scent mingles with auroral ozone to make “terrestrially cosmic” a bodily condition that skews navigation and forces Elara to taste the air. Micro-setting—the tin ring—acts as both compass and ballot slot, its expired snack-box origin anchoring the antiquated-future nostalgia. Spatial choreography is pristine: root-hum drift west → ion taste spike → ring tremor → precipice arrival. One 0.1 deduction: orbital satellites are named but never re-engage in choice or closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cave is not backdrop but tool: the quartz pane’s inner glow literally provides the only light source for the charcoal strokes, constraining installation method and final image. Phosphorescent color palette (“mournful violets and deep, bruising blues”) mirrors Silas’s grief, charging the portrait’s spectral effect. Spatial choreography is flawless—stalactite echoes tracked until silence, body placement relative to quartz frame, shards inserted into hollow then paper affixed. Sensory economy favors urgent immediacy: acoustic horizon, tactile charcoal rasp, visual quartz bleed—no tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bruise-yellow sky, mossy wall, mildewed archive, and wire-mesh counter are filtered through Elara’s artisan eye; each sensory pick pressures her next move (the plate’s raised backward text literally demands her crafts-person’s gaze). Environment never lectures; it keeps shrinking her options until the final pivot. Micro-setting (the jagged zinc edge) constrains the climactic read. Dock 0.3 for a stray adjective stack (“immense glass dome…sprawling greenhouse city”) that momentarily blurs scale.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment, body, and tool are one integrated system: the wind-blasted bluff’s temperature and altitude govern melt-rate, which in turn governs the brass lever timing; the sculpture itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—wind-burn, prismatic glare, bone-borne resonance—filtered through her professional tuner perception. No exposition dumps; world-rules (telepathic consensus, seasonal muteness) are learned through action and limitation. Diamond-hard fulcrum and containment chest are reused anchors that evolve causally with the melting ice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Glass dome, crystalline roses, and ozone shed function as micro-setting that constrains the psychic burn; their shattering pays the cost.

Setting charges final image: AI ink dispersing upward through water equals her freed memory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The chamber’s “gleaming silence” and supersaturated lake are not backdrop but hazard: jagged ceiling spikes, ankle-snapping wells, and salt crust that crunches like bone force Elias’s crouch-and-step tactics. Micro-setting extends to the copper bowl whose weight anchors him when gravity flips. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—he attends to vibration, crunch, breath-mist, never visual gloss. Final image of dock lights “flickering welcome” recharges the opening lamps, proving environment can reconfigure emotional stance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glade is rendered through touch, temperature, and acoustic micro-detail; the brook’s surface-tension shift even becomes the final image. Environment directly supplies the tool (water) and the medium (sound waves) that Elian weaponizes. Missing a 9-point only because the “nocturnal haven” itself never endangers or limits him—it is stage, not antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rooftop garden framed in wrought-iron & ivy plus meteor-light functions as micro-setting that literally showers the scene with apocalyptic pressure; the antique seal is handled, turned, and finally claimed, so object-as-setting qualifies. Sensory triage—ozone, jasmine, iron cold—tracks Silas’s narrowing attention. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies & props stay located. Environment directly shapes the final choice: under falling fire, the sky itself demands a decision about what will hold.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Velvet garden twilight is tactile, odor-bound, and constrains the ritual—moss provides friction for shell-press, static charge cues resonance alignment. Shell acts micro-setting/tool that channels sorrow and absorbs heat; its spiral interior is re-noticed under stress. Spatial choreography clean: bench → field → crystallized tableau → stone at feet. Environment mirrors internal transition from lush entrapment to gray release.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    The roofless Marble Sanctuary is not backdrop: its ice enforces Elian’s slowed pulse, the aurora’s flare threatens visual distraction at the precise instant the graft must land. Micro-setting objects—clepsydra drips, wax seal, iron cylinder—operate as tactile levers of plot. The rose thorn harvested from burned gardens carries ancestral DNA of the old queen, charging the final image with phantom scent. Setting constrains every move; remove the freeze and the forgery timeline collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gorge operates as both instrument and prison; spiral geometry of shell → spiral fault in stone guides the tactical modulation of song. Micro-setting (the shell’s heating hollow) constrains the final sealing act. Sensory economy favors sound over sight, matching POV bias. Starlight and reed-wind supply tonal melancholy without tourist clutter; every environmental cue is filtered through geological acoustics that determine success or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glacier shrine is not backdrop; its crushing silence and ice-sculpted exit-frames echo the boy’s bulkhead door, constraining Elara’s cartography of dreams. Candle-lit ice glow and “borrowed starlight” are sensory, selective, and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is flawless: globe tracked from scorched liner to fur-covered altar. The micro-setting of the warped sphere itself functions as charged environment in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    parapet’s drainage-weeps, moon-lit flagstone game, and whisk-carved tines all constrain tactics and charge closure. Firefly season’s humidity is causal: it keeps insects airborne for the sphere trick. Sensory hierarchy is philosopher-net-mender: mesh geometry in foam, wind harmonics in stone. No static catalogue; every detail is handled or stepped on.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The electromagnetic barrier, ash-laden boughs, and pulsing diamond are selective, sensory, and tied to choice: the orchard’s micro-setting literally keeps Elias alive while pressuring the calibration gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The loft’s sand-glass skylight and jar-lined walls constrain every motion; distance is measured by how far Elian can reach without upsetting a vessel. Spring-rain vapor and violet lullaby mist function as micro-setting, coating the gears and altering the acoustics in real time. Spatial choreography is flawless—knees, crank, jars, light beam tracked across the single continuous scene. The one missing twitch for 9-band: we never feel the temperature of the dune-cooled air on skin.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting pressure is literal: drift-ice slabs grind hulls, forcing the brass console to seize; the marina’s acoustic groan becomes the obstacle Elias must tune into. Cold brass, wool coat, and the key’s iron/bone composite are handled tactilely, their temperatures tracked across beats. Golden sunset → bruise-colored → blue night keeps time and reweights the “old bruise” motif at closure. Micro-setting (key as severed finger) charges the final image; environment shapes tactics, satisfying 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Basalt ramparts, volcanic stone boots, and the shimmering conductive sheen are selective, tactile, and causally active: the wet metal is the vulnerability that Elara weaponizes. The frozen lake is not backdrop; its phase-change alters physics and stakes. Micro-setting victory: the iron lever’s cold weight against Elara’s palm constrains the timing of the final act. One hairline slip—“immense body of water” is slightly generic; a single glint of moon on the ice-sheet would have secured 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tunnel’s dripping water, conductive mud, and infrasound spikes are not backdrop but active hazards that amplify the lantern’s psychic field, directly shaping Elias’s tactics and the fatal mechanism. The lantern itself operates as micro-setting—its rust flaking under gloved fingers catalyzes the memory overlay, then remains anchored in the final image as sentinel. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel, scan, brush, stand, upload—all moves track against the subsidence pool and rail geometry. Environment literally resonates into the protagonist’s body, fulfilling the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)

Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The workshop-acid-sea functions as antagonistic environment: every creak lowers the launch window, the green slush literally eats the floorboards that become the runway. Kaleidoscope-as-lens and obsidian arrow are micro-setting tools that constrain perception and inscription choices; removing either breaks the flight logic. Sensory selection is POV-tight—violets/amber fractals noticed only because they reveal updrafts. Final image of gold-layered silence reuses the buoy introduced paragraphs earlier, fulfilling 9+ tool-charge test.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The obsidian console, hovering drone, and stagnant ocean of profiles are sketched with terse, evocative strokes that feed the claustrophobic tone. The mission patch functions as micro-setting, its coarse fabric grounding Silas’s attention and later whitening under his knuckles, charging the final horror. Spatial choreography inside the server farm stays coherent; bodies and machine parts track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lighthouse-as-antique-shop is a fresh micro-setting whose dusty mirrors directly constrain the tactic of timeline hunting; the cheval mirror’s corner placement dictates the final refraction angle. Orchard salt-spray and grinding ice supply auditory immediacy that tightens the “weighted breath” window. Spatial choreography is flawless: shard, reflection, and council table track cleanly. Environment charges the ending image: the beacon-light from the fragment literally replaces the lighthouse beam, stopping the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but crucible: the frozen vice literally traps boats and metaphorically traps Elias in deferral. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting whose survival logic rewrites his death-logic. Cold is filtered through bodily consequence—numb skin, phantom marrow pain—guiding his final stance. Spatial choreography is clean: rake, slush, fractured hull, tent exit track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber pavilion glass recurs as both trap and filter, shaping the final image when wind rattles it as the letter escapes—qualifies as object-setting that charges closure. Mist, fermented air, and dry-leaf crunch are selective, POV-filtered, and woven through action rather than catalogue. Spatial clarity is maintained: platform, bench, vineyard beyond. One micro-slip: “heavy and damp with the scent of fermentation” is sensory but leans toward abstractions “heavy,” “damp”; still, it anchors mood without halting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The desert is rendered through motion—tremor in the boots, wind that screams, sand that gives way to stone—rather than static catalogue; the Pavilion’s sonic interrogation is a lived body-feeling in the teeth. The ceramic mask and silver-dust circle are micro-settings that constrain action: look sideways or die, speak truth or be crushed. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the dunes → buried bridge → spiral archive → buried again track cleanly. Only the “whisperfield calm” label threatens to abstract the sensation, but the next sentence re-anchors it as physical weight, so the world rule stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lavender–ruin hybrid is irreplaceable: its scent, color, and climbing vines physically guide Elian’s alignment ritual and charge the final sculpture image.

The micro-setting of the map case and the photo as tool satisfy the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The library’s acoustic perfection and the crystal’s micro-setting as sound-prism actively constrain tactics—Elias must speak *into* the dome and *through* the glass. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a man who has not spoken in decades notices dust, silence, the weight of air. The moss is rendered through motion (“devouring…singing”) rather than visual catalog. Final image of charged air is micro-setting reweighted. Misses 9.0 only because spatial choreography of the rotunda center is lightly sketched; a single line of distance/proximity would have pinned it.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog, VHS walls, and salt-bleached driftwood are never backdrop: fog curates visibility, tapes emit the audible decay he pursues, driftwood becomes the memory he cannot hold. Each sensory layer is filtered through Elias’s haptic bias—he touches more than he sees. Final image of magnetic particles dissolving re-charges every prior tape mention. Micro-setting (chalk nub, crumbling cassette) constrains the last gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    The failing clock hand itself functions as micro-setting; its centrifugal heat alters Elian’s finger placement and timing tactics. Ozone taste and stratosphere churn are filtered through a lens-smith’s priorities (dust = enemy, vibration = timer). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: tools slide toward open hatch → he shields camera with torso. Final image of glowing ache is charged by the vacuum of heat the hand created—setting literally fuels the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    High-altitude hospice is evoked through instrument echoes and antiseptic whiffs rather than décor lists; glass walls appear only when they frame weather below, keeping focus on internal soundscape. Micro-setting supremacy: Clara’s cot, shard clenched, oxygen hiss—objects that constrain Elias’s every tactic. Spatial choreography is surgical: he pivots from window to bedside, places trash-as-relic on table, bow grip calibrated to exact inch; no floating props. Final image—the now-silent cello—recharges opening panoramic window by turning the whole room into a resonant chamber that has fulfilled its purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment and tool constrain choices throughout: the nocturnal observatory’s silver circuitry in the floor dictates her sequence, the mosaic tiles hide the dormant heart, the brass key’s spiral teeth limit how it can be turned. Ozone-steam smell and violet sparks narrow perception to the immediate machinery under pressure. The final image—shadows clawing at the stone—reciprocally charges the setting rather than functioning as décor. The floating-isle rule is mentioned early enough to avoid orientation debt and later re-enters as cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden, maze, and tooth function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the enclosed secrecy allows Thorne to perform his metaphysical splint unseen.

Hedge rustle signals approaching parents, tightening clock. Garden’s breath-holding mirrors family’s suspended grief, charging the final alignment of lie-to-truth.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mist-gutted grotto functions as micro-setting: its damp limestone ribs coerce her into earthbound craft and literally cool the memory-heat that surges mid-scene. Sea-glass shards, lapidary wheel, and brass scale are tools whose tactile handling choreographs every causal step. Final image—“a cool tear of crystallized ocean”—recharges the grotto’s saline breath, proving environment and object constrain outcome. One hairline slip: “zephyr bloom” is lovely but abstractions briefly dilute sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The breached data-center-as-biotope is never dumped; we learn it through Elias’s pruning fingers and redirected trickles, the wet-stone/ozone scent, stalactites thawing above their heads. Setting actively constrains: only the melt-drip arrow makes the pendant findable; only the moss offers hiding. Micro-setting (the amber, the dust-crack flooring) is handled twice and charges the final image when Mara clutches the resin beneath vines. Spatial choreography is pristine—distance, direction, and object state track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “feral nexus in mist” functions as micro-setting: gray vapor thickens to gelatinous flow, physically resisting Elias’s upstream wade—environment directly constrains tactic. Shell fragment recurs with evolving state (jagged → glowing), charging final image. Sensory selection narrows to ink-smell, heartbeat, liquid light—crisis-urgent filtering. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Needs one more causal environmental push (e.g., mist burning skin) to hit 9.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arbor is no backdrop—it supplies the living conduit, the trellis for grafting, and the lattice that catches the last moonbeam. Dawn’s filtered light, damp earth, and the spent brown vine at the end track environmental change that mirrors spiritual shift. Spatial choreography is clean: overhead tendril → graft → prism → village dream. The final image of dew “different” in the air shows the setting charging the closure. Micro-setting (the vine itself) literally conducts the plot, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crater orchard is micro-setting as crucible: knee-deep snow, root hollow workspace, moonlit copper plate—all constrain gesture; Silas’s body is forced still by cold, guiding ritual precision. Skeletal trees function as living barometry—mirroring his internal vigil—while starlight fluid literalizes sky inside earth-bound metal. Setting details are filtered by an alchemist’s sensorium (sympathetic vibration, ambient pressure) rather than tourist catalog. Final fused plate extracts and re-packages this place, making setting portable and conceptually charged.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Marble cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics: its acoustic geometry dictates the timer’s placement and the peripheral gaze protocol; the final silence is a direct environmental debit. Sensory triage—visual shaft of light as proxy for invisible sound—is selective and POV-colored. Spatial choreography is clean: timer, daylight patch, and Elias’s stance stay trackable. The description never stalls momentum; every geological detail is recruited into the acoustic map. World rules stay consistent; polished stone reflects both light and sound without later contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The bronze grotto functions as both environment and tool: its oxidized ribs supply the exact star-slit that makes calcification possible; without that skeletal aperture the magic fails—setting literally shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices cold alloy against skin, dry twig-snap of hardening grief, not tourist visuals. Micro-setting (empty burner frame) charges the final image when it becomes the lens that reweights the meaning of light. Spatial choreography is immaculate: floor, knee, ceiling fissure, palm track cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Loft-skylight-rain triad is lived-in, not catalogued: rain beads become ghost applause, the bench’s vibration hammers the blank. Ash blank functions as micro-setting—it literally receives her pressure, constraining her ritual posture. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s engineer-widow gaze: sound (kettle) > touch (grain) > sight (rust hues). Final image—steam rising into shadows—mirrors the transferred ghost without symbolic signposting.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Kinetic Lagoon is not backdrop but active constraint: its charged mercury and hardened-air platforms dictate how Jaren can move and where the ghost can appear. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting that literally snags the air’s frequencies, altering tactics. Sensory selection stays urgent—”shimmered violently,” “knee-deep viscosity”—filtered through scavenger priorities. The final image of the lagoon rippling “without direction” mirrors his internal stasis, charging the closure under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terminal is evoked through tactile motion – “kicking aside faux-velvet ropes,” “climbed the gantry” – rather than static postcarding.  Storm-drainage pneumatics and micro-turbine specifics ground the engineering feat.  The sextant itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the closure; without its brass arc the hologram fails, meeting the 9+ gate.  One hairline slip: “vast atrium” is generic shorthand, preventing full 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment and micro-setting (wet amethyst vein under his knees) literally channels forbidden sound into his bones, constraining the final choice. Selective sensory economy—iron-gall ink scent, bruised sunrise color, quartz-cold palms—mirrors interior thaw without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: corridor → plaza → center; no floating rooms. World rule (soundless sanctuary) taught early and paid off when water momentarily unlocks voice, then reseals at dawn. Weather evolution (rain → drying sunrise) tracked minute-to-minute, guiding closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Twilight canal, wet-iron stink, oily water, brick embankments—each sensory pick is filtered through Elias’s myth-busting eye and guides his stealth timing. The barge itself is micro-setting: the winch tension he reads “like a nerve” and the radio-static clock literally decide when he must vanish. Final image reuses the canal surface as mirror for the city’s unbroken composure—setting charges the closure. No spatial slippage; every motion (winch, cable, sludge drip) is trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dock, snow, and fog are filtered through Elias’s diviner gaze, never touristic. The fulgurite and hawser function as micro-setting that literally steers his fingers. Final fog-charged image reweights the whole stake, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor dock planks could be any dock; one step short of perfect specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thread, carpet, and dying maple leaves function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the thread’s snap is the decisive act. Garden shadows evolve from skeletal shapes to theater of memory, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography is clean: hilltop estate, veranda, library dust motes all tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through grief-biased attention.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian lagoon, cedar branch, coin, and black sand function as micro-setting/objects that directly constrain technique and ritual success; their specificity charges the final acoustic image. Description is sensory-filtered through Elara’s fire-trained attention to minute atmospheric shifts. Spatial choreography is maintained in a single kneeling perimeter walk. All details feed the graft process—no filler exposition—meeting the 9- gate for object-as-setting that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dust-as-currency, dry aqueducts, and the Grand Cistern’s stone bowl constrain every tactical choice; waterless setting literally blocks memory flow. The stained glass box’s leaden frame and crimson/cobalt panes evolve from obstruction to valve, recharging the final spectral deluge. Micro-setting—the pedestal’s throat—dictates the precise torque Elara visualizes. Sensory economy favors grit, cold stone, and the knuckle-crack sound, all filtered through Elara’s diagnostic gaze—no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nebula is not backdrop but navigational hazard: crystallized hydrogen stalks can shred the traveler, so the sonar ping is a lived constraint. Sensory hierarchy obeys Xylos’s sentimental lens—petal-like plasma sheets, violet dark—every descriptor filtered through his grief. The brass gear’s fractal edge is micro-setting that physically bridges finite and infinite, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: clutching gear → sonar map → approach axle → press-fit → retreat under cold light.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse glass, ribbon silk, moth bodies, and dusk-violet light are not backdrop but tools that constrain choice: Elias must climb because the moth is at the pane; the silk snags because condensation coats the glass. Spatial choreography is immaculate—ribbon length, ladder rungs, ghost’s relative position track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy reflects carver’s bias: texture of granite dust, drag of silk on glass, sound of moth wings against resonance of mallet. The final image of migrating Monarchs re-uses the setting’s most volatile element to carry the lesson away, charging the closing beat with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic-glass ridge, brass-filled tower chamber, and pendulum bob form a micro-setting triad that literally constrains the final gesture: the ridge supplies the rake handle, the tower’s heat and geometry force the “impossible present-moment” repair, the bob’s pause is the only temporal window. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound during the climax—high whine of wood-on-brass—mirroring Silas’s tactile theology. No scenic breadth is attempted; every detail is purpose-driven, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt silo, star shafts, and shroud spectrum are tactile, immediate, and filtered through Silas’s gardener eye; the setting steers every action—threads hang where he must climb, colors sort his path. The sovereign case micro-setting anchors the knot’s release and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions or prop drift. Weather is used (wind at close) but minimally; enough for atmosphere, not checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is not postcard: thin air literally affects Elian’s breathing, the basalt desk conducts cold that stiffens fingers, the starless reflection mirrors his own indifference back at him. Micro-setting triumphs: the kingfisher quill is the single object that channels both air and water, constraining the only possible act. Spatial choreography is immaculate—window, desk, vellum, nib—no impossible positions. One hairline slip: “shattered mirror” is a touch familiar, but the image is immediately re-weighted by “absolute indifference,” saving it from cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember alcove functions as micro-setting that directly enables the core tactic: geothermal warmth hides both man and unauthorized ink from thermal drones. Sensory hierarchy skews thermal-visual, matching copyist’s attention to heat signatures and hue. Violet phosphorescence charged by story-dust reappears in the final image, reweighting the fog-filled aqueduct as future lung. Spatial choreography survives in one room; exits and drone vectors remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perspective floorboards and impossible horizon function as emotional trap, not backdrop; the porcelain mask’s jagged seams return in the final dust cloud, recharging the same light-catching shards that once hid Silas’s face—an environment-tool fusion that constrains the ritual’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is tactile, not postcard: brackish water rinse, petrified ledger, clay that “pushed back with the weight of the ocean.” Micro-setting (the brass cog) literally enables the final altering of reality. Spatial choreography stays clean across crawl, rinse, file, slot. Atmospheric specificity mirrors internal state—sewer damp = his abrasive calm—without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The velvet library, autumn leaves, and zither rosette are not backdrop: the velvet absorbs sound, enabling the subtraction method; the falling leaves reweight the final image of receding art. The rosette functions as micro-setting that literally focuses the acoustics and is handled in multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s musician ear—he “peers” through lattice gaps, feeling vibration sympathetically. Spatial choreography is spotless: students in plush aisles, Elian at window, podium placed, all track clean.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rusted greenhouse, composted books, twin-moonlight—details are selective, sensuous, and filter through a chef’s priorities. The greenhouse tools constrain every pruning cut; the cracked roof lets the violet beam charge the final image. Some spatial vagueness: exact layout of vine, crate, and door remains sketchy. Meets 9+ gate: the setting materially shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Bruised apricot” sky and “heavy nectar dusk” are selective, POV-colored, and return in the final image to reconfigure stakes. The tower’s glass booth and spiral ramp are micro-grounded—bodies move believably, distance tracks. Lacquer box painted with storm-dragons is a tactile prop whose antique vibe contrasts the steel ribs, charging the reveal. Weather (dead drones as hail) is causal, not decorative, satisfying the 9- gate; a hair more multi-sensory density would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bay, porch planks, and calcified root all function as micro-settings that constrain placement and charge the final image; remove any and the conceptual reprice collapses. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: sodium hum, salt sting, violet cold—each filtered through Elias’s synesthetic attention. Spatial choreography is pristine; we track his climb, crouch, placement, retreat without drift. Weather and season evolve from deceptive calm to sharpening dawn, mirroring the stakes without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The body-as-setting micro-loop (crushing suit vs. chest weight) and the ampoule-as-tool both constrain her final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—visual gloom, tactile marble grind, taste of stale air—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: pedestal-to-arch-to-dais tracked without drift. One minor slip: “groaning tides” is an auditory cliché amid otherwise fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The limestone step, chalk dust “like dry snow,” and the whining die form a micro-setting that literally constrains every tactic; spatial choreography is flawless (no impossible reaches). Infinite verticality is evoked through sensation (thin air, haze) rather than catalogue. Final image—hand clutching invisible fabric—reuses prior abstraction but gives it grain, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse—saffron quiet against gray amnesia—functions as micro-setting that both enables the ritual and isolates Elian. Condensation on the glass becomes the only canvas that can hold moon-ink, directly constraining the action. Smog-erased history is not backdrop but the very problem the symbol seeks to heal. The final blink across the ravine recharges the skyline image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Weeping limestone, cloying rosewater, and the ovens’ dry heat are filtered through Elian’s curator gaze, each sensory note tethered to survival stakes. The emerald lens acts as micro-setting that literally refracts the threat and later frames the bread, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean from balcony to annex to huddled refugees.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Brine-scent, violet glare, iron lever against palm—tactile triangulation keeps the glass room alive. The lighthouse lens is not postcard backdrop; it is the final actuator that bends light inward, weaponizing setting. Micro-setting succeeds: the yoyo’s warped tabletop and the screw biting palm constrain motion and time. Environment directly shapes the culminating tactic, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The funhouse is not postcard scenery; its warped mirrors and stinking clown mouth constrain every tactical move. Micro-setting object—the opera clasp—literally tethers the Advisor and burns Elias at climax, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows POV panic: crystallized-sugar rot, neon trails, searing metal. Spatial choreography is clean: left turn where path goes right, solid ground beneath apparent holes.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: graft unions creak under torsion, salt crust flakes off bark as percussion, driftwood rim acts as resonating soundboard. The great oak’s hollow bore is referenced twice as the low-frequency amplifier that literally turns the storm into organ bass. Blue-hour light shift is tracked beat-by-beat, forcing Elara to recalibrate strikes. Without this exact stage the acoustic alchemy would read as conjurer’s trick; specificity makes the physics credible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Heat, bone-white architecture, calcified shell ridges, and vented steam are filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze; every detail doubles as map data. The turtle-shell-as-steering-mechanism and the sun as flaying device constrain possible actions and charge the final reveal. Spatial choreography is flawless: plaza, ridge, fissure, gears track without drift. Environment is not backdrop; it is the antagonist that finally opens to swallow the expedition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station is a vivid logistics map: cracked pillars limit shelter, oil-stained gravel underfoot, distance from the bench to the tracks all register. Ivy is threaded through action—cracking stone, strangling shelter—so environment literally shapes the surrender decision. Sensory economy is excellent; iron taste opening line anchors era and decay. Micro-setting qualifies because the pillar fracture constrains credibility of the Censor’s "peace held by myth" stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Half-drowned pavilion, algae-slick granite, barnacle-choked crack—every surface is felt under glove or wader. Lantern-light on marble ribs mirrors Elias’s “silent grief,” yet the description stays tactile: mortar grit between fingers, iron-gall scent against brine. Spatial choreography is flawless—drawbridge up → plinth → fissure → submerged chest-level—so the reader can map at all times. Setting actively resists the repair, forcing the wrest action and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    The algae-dappled glass and vibrating parchment floor are not backdrop—they are the tools that let the stamp’s prism fire and the text reconfigure. Library tier, observation wall, and pump cavitation are tracked spatially; stillness is the micro-setting that enables fingertip detection of grooves. Environment directly constrains the final act: if the blackout ends seconds earlier, the decryption fails. High-band gate met: setting charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating tea garden’s white-gold scour and gravity-glass chains are not backdrop—they funnel the crane’s paradoxical flight path and literalize “descends while ascending.” The invisible prism functions as micro-setting that constrains the entire dream-capture mechanics. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s artisan eye: facets before fragrance, light before steam. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly from wrought-iron table to sky-edge launch.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Floating Observatory’s zero-g darkness and metallic ticking constrain every beat; the viewport glass and cooling-breaker clock shape tactics. The Geode is a micro-setting that literally organizes the vacuum’s ghost-energy and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bruising-purple sky, calcified chip port, and bone-crunching debris underfoot are filtered through Elara’s pilot-eye hierarchy of motion and altitude. The observatory terrace functions as micro-setting: its dome, console, and corroded port physically constrain the extraction beat and charge the final image. Brilliant dimness is not decorative; it is the literal light condition that lets the star-trail overlay work and that flares into semantic brightness once the matrix activates.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt terrace’s dying bruised glow, the sieved-hush ocean, and the driftwood that literally sprouts false memories are inseparable from Elian’s task; environment manufactures the story’s central hazard. Micro-setting (the gold watch hand lodged in petrified oak) functions as setting-as-tool, constraining retrieval and anchoring memory. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent of salt-slick steps → sand → kneeling → fingers brushing metal. Final image reuses “heavy atmosphere” now literalized in pocketed metal, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The storm-worn parapet, slick stone, and living mist are filtered through Silas’s chilled perception; the tower’s neutrality is not declared but enacted—no flags, no sides. The brass pull’s micro-setting (socket diameter) becomes the decisive environmental constraint. Spatial choreography is clean: opposite walkway, central pedestal, slumping boy—all tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal launch is sketched with brutal economy—knee-deep freezing surf, brine-stink, submerged rocks scraping plastic—each detail filtering through Elias’s shame-narrowed attention. The utility poles are not backdrop but literal stepping-stones for tactics: their “ugly, reliable copper wires” become the constellation he can bear. Micro-setting (compass in pocket, transformer hum) constrains the final choice and charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or brand-dump faux verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Underground lake, glowing algae, inverted stalactite cosmos—every sensory particular is filtered through Elias’s assassin-trained eye: “clinical appreciation of a fake diamond,” bioluminescence reflected in red stitching. Spatial choreography stays coherent: elevator gate, rock edge, water swirl, ball arc all track cleanly. The baseball itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Environment charges the ending image: the glowing water receives the sacrificed ball, making setting integral to the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is not backdrop but tool: its “immovable ink-black shadows” anchor Elian’s stance and later echo the silhouette of shared darkness after fusion. Sensory selection stays urgent—heat on boots, sulfur taste, bell-like resonance—never drifting into travel-brochire excess. Spatial choreography survives the aerial dive: we track his arm, the censer, the talon grip, the final shared stillness without impossible positions. Micro-setting inside the censer (star-anise, void-dragon breath) constrains the only viable tactic, qualifying for 9-band gate; merely a hair’s-breadth short of charging the very final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Midnight glade above the clouds” is anchored through frost-kissed turf, starlight-scent, and the porcelain dish that literally drinks moonlight; environment is micro-setting-as-tool, constraining the ritual’s physics. Sensory hierarchy matches cartomancer’s vocation—light absorbed, sound of snapping cards—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: linen spread → saucer centered → spiral dealt; no floating props. Final image of blank linen reuses earlier anchor and recharges theme; satisfies 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Cenotaph’s rusted-deck and dying-reactor hum constrain every motion; the blast door’s physical weight is repeatedly tested and finally neutralized by Elian’s weightlessness—setting becomes a tool that charges the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Black sand, tidal pool mirror, magma chamber form a micro-setting triad that directly channels the protagonist’s final act; remove any layer and the spiral fails. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: merchant-prince-turned-vagabond notices texture, temperature, and monetary absence. Environment forces the stop (heat → bare feet) and supplies the only currency the mountain accepts. Final white plume is setting evolving in response to action—clean spatial choreography throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fort’s twilight scorch, photoreactive paint, and gnomon grooves are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the blackout lets the dial reveal its UV map, the garden’s silence masks the thrum, the gnomon’s extension unlocks the cradle. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s sentinel bias—she clocks angles, not colors. The bronze quill itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final move. Only reason not 9+: the broader city grid geography is implied, not tactically detailed on page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    From line one the aurora, basalt rail, and polymer-painted stones are tactile tools, not scenery; the bluff’s slickness is the very antagonist Oren weaponizes. Spatial choreography is flawless—boots clamp, stones adhere for a beat, the alpha eel arcs along magnetic rails. The final image of long shadows across a frozen, frictionless ocean reweights every prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass-floor observatory is not backdrop but crucible: altitude and lightning exposure dictate the ether’s volatility and the need for steady hands. Brass console, obsolete timetable, red safety light—each object is handled, not catalogued. Storm’s barometric drop is the chemical trigger taught early; environment literally dissolves the ink. Final image marries sky scars to paper scars—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass atrium + brook + sundial form a micro-setting triad that literally steers footwork and shadow-angle choices; the northern door’s spatial payoff is inseparable from the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Silas’s clockwork ear hears gears over water. Half-painted sundial acts as both prop and geography, constraining vector math in real time. No static postcard; every surface is tapped, scraped, or shadow-read.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted girders, broken glass stars, and moonlit rotunda actively constrain tactics—garden geometry follows actual fissures. Micro-setting (coffee tin) doubles as tool and talisman, its false-bottom click echoing the library’s structural fracture. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the single tactile beat—“dirt under their fingernails”—grounds the blessing image. Environment is inseparable from the rebellion design; removing the decayed library obviates the guerrilla-garden premise.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s bruised-purple sky and delirious compasses are immediate sensory hooks; the arbor’s swaying lattice and cloud-tide currents are tactile and POV-filtered. The broken clock and projector are handled, manipulated, and evolve state (spring tension, bulb drain), satisfying the 9+ gate that objects constrain tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, light-cone, piano bench track cleanly. Only the arbor’s physics is lightly sketched, but that ethereality is genre-earned, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ridge itself becomes crucible—soft stone hardens only when Elian risks the unpleasant pulse, so environment directly constrains the final choice. Violet orchids singing opera function as micro-setting objects whose erasure proves reality. Ozone scent and bruised-purple air narrow perception to urgency, guiding attention toward the fissure. Spatial choreography tracks boots → fissure → sprout without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The wet basalt, humming compass, and ghost-blue needles are not garnish: the islet’s post-storm slickness makes his knees slip, the compass’s torque guides his trance, and the bonsai’s needles become the literal screen onto which guilt is atomized—every tactile detail constrains the ritual or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Winterglass Conservatory isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: its biting chill threatens the Unshaken Marvels, forcing Elian’s intervention. The tuning fork case (micro-setting) constrains tactics—automated controls are “too blunt,” so human touch via repurposed tools is required. Final image of lingering heat eddies charges closure, tying environment to emotional and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater library isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible. Rotting shelves, dissolved ink, and crushing silence constrain Silas’s mission, while the dome’s fragility underscores the impossibility he inhabits. The bioluminescent glow charging the lens’s prismatic edges directly enables the climax. Final image (“silence... wrap around him like a heavy velvet shroud”) reweights the setting from tomb to sanctuary. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: its height enables surveillance, its lattice filters moonlight for the bell’s reveal, and its repurposed folly status mirrors the community’s resilience. The silver bell and wrapped clapper constrain sound, directly shaping tactics under drone threat. Final image (“wind howled… song of endurance”) reweights environment through Elara’s stance. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Twilight Viaduct isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the story’s logic: its liminality permits spirits, its moss anchors the tripod, its violet clouds and blooming vines create the “foggy lucidity” that magnifies spiritual clarity. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin’s Tear function as micro-settings that constrain choice (only this lens reveals truth). Final image charges the setting: motes drift upward into the same twilight that once obscured the void, now transformed by mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    The living bridge garden functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its roots constrain Elian’s actions and supply the very material for his temporal trap. Sensory detail (ozone, petrichor, quaking bark) is selective and urgent, filtered through his distorted perception. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the texture of time feels like the bridge’s braided bark—fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting isn’t backdrop—it’s tactical. The piano bench hides keys; novelty archery yields the master key; dust and debris signal decay that contrasts the vault’s preserved future. Every object constrains or enables choice: the shackle fixes Elias in place, forcing ingenuity; the boarded windows frame the mob’s approach. Final image charges the setting: toys and trinkets become ironic counterpoint to the buried harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Sunken Orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and Ashen Forge form a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every choice—the dome isolates Elara physically and morally, the wrecks supply raw material, and the Forge transmutes silence into code. Sensory detail is purposeful: aurora light “sings in minor keys” to her synesthesia, moss contrasts graveyard outside, polycarbonate walls frame desperation. The environment culminates in the final image—“silent judgment of the sunken ships”—making setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The terminal functions as a dynamic micro-setting: verdigris ribs, amber glass, then emerald moonlight actively constrain and charge every action. Light isn’t backdrop—it’s tactical (golden hour for theft, moonbeams for development) and culminates in the aquatic hue that bathes the projection. Spatial choreography is precise: pillar, bench, satchel, jar—all tracked without error. The setting earns its 9+ by directly enabling the climax’s metaphysical collision.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned control room functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice: its instability (floor tilting, shrieking supports) forces departure. Tools (blowpipe, journal, bookmark) and environment (furnace heat vs. melting slush) constrain tactics and charge the final image—the transparent dome left behind as an “eye” in the ruins. Sensory detail is selective and urgent, filtered through Elias’s glassblower POV; ash, color shifts, and metal groans all serve theme and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    The decaying library functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: its rusted console, oxidized metal, and starlight enable decryption, while the collapsing architecture pressures every move. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“freezing stars,” “squeal of metal,” “bioluminescent pulse”—filtered through agoraphobic perception. The plaster cast emerges organically from environmental decay, not convenience. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax: only oblique starlight reveals indented numbers, making the environment causally active in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ridge fort, storm, and evaporated sea aren’t backdrop but active constraints: wind threatens to steal gold flakes, dryness measures memory of waves, and basalt mortar crumbling echoes universal entropy. The gold leaf booklet functions as micro-setting—its degradation directly shapes Elara’s ritual method and emotional state. Final image charges the object: bare pages vs. textured map in absolute blackness. Environment and tool jointly constrain choice and crystallize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)

The utility poles and copper wires aren’t backdrop; they’re navigational tools that replace celestial bodies, directly shaping tactics. Sensory detail (brine, decay, electric hum) is filtered through Elias’s trauma, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting charges the final image: scarred wood becomes salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bioluminescent lake isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice by manifesting timeline branches, directly enabling Elias’s realization. The baseball and algae-lit water function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective (glowing blue on red stitching) and filtered through jaded wonder. The environment reweights the entire moral premise, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fairy-tale orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: its stillness contrasts the violent rebirth, its moonlight frames the divine encounter, and its unchanging nature mirrors Elian’s desire to transcend mortality. The censer and scorched coat function as micro-settings that constrain action (only rare spices can bridge realms). Final image charges the orchard with earned eternity. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action (e.g., smoke spirals “under the force of Elian’s will”).

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “midnight glade above the clouds” functions as micro-setting: its “choking beauty” and “forgotten whispers” directly pressure Silas’s vulnerability and shape the ritual’s terms. The porcelain saucer and linen tablecloth are tactile extensions of environment, constraining choice—ink must seep into the crack, hands must be traced or absent. Sensory detail (crystalline scent of starlight, glowing grass) is selective and POV-filtered. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the glade itself doesn’t *alter* tactics beyond enabling the ritual—it charges but doesn’t constrain.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship isn’t backdrop but crucible: its patchwork nature mirrors Elian’s fractured self, and the engineering sector’s blast door is both physical and metaphysical barrier. The monocle, magnetized needle, and photographs function as micro-setting tools that constrain his method. Most crucially, his body—specifically his gravitationally responsive feet—charges the final image when joy lifts him to push the door, making physiology inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    The black sand beach, volcanic heat, and tidal pool constrain choices: bare feet force a stop; fissure guides detour; tide level enables reflection. Setting charges the final image—the bugs’ light seeping into sand toward magma chamber—and evolves causally (smoke turns white). Sensory hierarchy reflects Silas’s focus: coarse granules, subterranean groan, marrow-humming vibration. No white-room syndrome; every detail filters through his tactile, impoverished POV.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint and catalyst: the blackout enables access; the unfinished sundial hides photoreactive code; the garden’s silence permits covert action. The Luminous Fort isn’t backdrop—it’s the cage Elara repurposes into a lantern. Sensory detail is selective (purple gloom, metallic sigh, clean current’s hum) and filtered through Elara’s urgency. The sundial’s “ghost veins” charge the final image by transforming art into infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless ocean aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain choice (basalt edge for anchoring, aurora as eel lure, ice requiring polymer paint). The leaden vial’s weight makes the bluff “groan,” proving setting reacts causally. Final image of “frozen, frictionless ocean” under flaring aurora charges closure by contrasting achieved stillness with eternal slide. Every detail serves pressure or payoff; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stormlit observatory functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its glass floor, brass console, and altitude constrain action (chemical work amid lightning) and charge the final image—the scars on paper echoed in the sky. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: ozone, ether fumes, phosphorescent green—all filtered through Elias’s poetic, trauma-haunted perception. Weather actively shapes tactics (the “hour when masks slip” hinges on barometric drop), and spatial choreography remains coherent despite vertical vastness. The setting doesn’t just reflect internal state—it enables the truth’s emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass atrium isn’t backdrop—it groans under blade pressure, vibrates with collisions, and reflects breath-fogged epiphanies. The half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting: its coded angles constrain Silas’s survival tactics. Even the brook’s oblivious babble contrasts the interior ozone-charged tension, charging the final stasis. Every detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ruined library isn’t backdrop but active constraint: rusted girders frame silhouettes, broken glass becomes “diamonds,” fissures host seeds. The coffee tin and moonlight directly shape tactics and charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective (violet bruise of atmosphere, clang of sled) and filtered through Elias’s poetic perception. Environment and object-as-setting jointly enable the rebellion’s method and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the station’s decay forces improvisation, while the tidal arbor’s fragility (“sustainable only as long as the projector’s bulb held”) directly shapes Elias’s timeframe and emotional stakes. Tools (clock, projector) and environment (reinforced glass, bruised sky) are tactile and consequential. Final image—cloud tides swallowing notes—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Sensory hierarchy (static electricity, humming velocity) reflects urgency without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Ancient Ridge isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: blossoms sing lies, stone softens deceptively, only granite accepts the seed. The brass kaleidoscope functions as micro-setting, constraining verification tactics. Final image charges the ridge’s transformation from hallucination to bedrock, making environment inseparable from thematic resolution. Sensory hierarchy shifts under crisis—Elian filters scent and sound through professional urgency, avoiding tourist description.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the wet basalt, breezy islet, and post-rain clarity directly enable the ritual. The ghost ship’s compass and bonsai are tactile anchors that constrain action—lace must align, guilt must flow into needles. The cerulean atmosphere isn’t backdrop but active pressure, saturating perception and charging the final indigo bloom. Every detail serves the closure’s resonance without tourist cataloging.
