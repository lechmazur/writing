    The storm-damaged greenhouse is handled tactilely across beats: bent door, cracked pots, leaking roof, cucumber vines, damp tide line on brick. Setting constrains her method (gaps in roof admit dust and light; she tapes plastic "not to seal them perfectly, but to narrow the variables"). The flood's residue—iodine smell, milk-brown river—charges the ending image: the place "remembers the water" and so will her model. Spatial choreography is clear; micro-setting (filter lattice, shattered panes) drives her experimental design.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon functions as both stage and constraint: it "held the blast, bending the heat upward," directly affecting survival and shaping the protagonist's return. The ruined furnace, ledger strip, and frost patterns are handled tactically and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (foundation → narrow pass), and sensory detail is selective and filtered through the glass artist's POV ("stars trembled like glass waiting for the kiln"). The setting constrains the protagonist's choice to walk the ignored pass, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting and constraint: frozen ivy, glass that chimes faintly, the cold sensor-gloves all press against Lio's choices and charge the final image of "architectures themselves become orchestras." The Quiet's sensory deprivation is filtered through his professional bias (tuning forks, actuator rigs, heat-mapping monitors) rather than tourist description. Spatial choreography remains coherent across equipment shelves, glass table, roof, and implied city beyond. The conservatory's transformation from concert venue to laboratory directly enables the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The broken lens functions as micro-setting, constraining the descent ("pulled in his hands... like a compass") and charging the final image when it "warmed, answering some invisible call." The underwater library is vividly particular—shelves spiraling through impossible geometry, books bound in "sea-salt... hair or fog... the moment before a person spoke"—and the ravaged chamber pressures Elias's choice. Spatial choreography remains clear (boat, steps, landing, chamber). The lens returns with changed meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta arbor anchors throughout: its amplified acoustic (tiles chattering, then silent) marks emotional beats and the bell's resonance. The ridge, moonlight, and satchel choreography remain coherent. The arbor functions as both meeting-place and symbol, constraining the midnight encounter and charging the final assembly image. Micro-setting (the bell's curve catching moonlight through worn leather) textures the closure moment without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The viaduct's mist, climbing roses, and lantern-rail create a boundary space that supports the monk's claim and frames the camera work. The crystal fitted into the aperture constrains the experiment and charges the final blue glow. Micro-setting succeeds: the railing where the boy leans becomes the site where breath-sharing occurs, and the camera box's weight shift ("accepting an old and complicated debt") embodies thematic pressure. Sensory selection (violet hush, river exhale, ribs under wet skin) reflects Arun's receptive state without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living bridge garden is vividly realized through specific detail: "tender shoots braid the handrails," "bark spiraling in golden logarithms around my ankles." Sensory selection reflects the narrator's professional lens (measuring hedge shadows, noting root-knots). The halo fragment and photographs anchor micro-setting that charges the final image. The hyperbolic geometry functions as both spatial constraint and thematic vehicle, shaping the narrator's approach to the middle span and the dissolution that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The carnival setting supplies concrete constraints: the arrow on the pegboard, the piano bench lock, the bolted stool, dust and ticket stubs that ground spatial choreography. Micro-setting (arrow fletching, piano veneer) charges the final tactical moment when Mara uses the Overseer's own logic against him. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("popcorn oil and cheap plastic," "molted scales") and filtered through Mara's strategic priorities. The space evolves causally as the Overseer drags the piano forward and the keys spill, altering her tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken orchard is vividly particularized ("skeletal trunks grope through dim water, leaves replaced by algae and patient barnacles") and constrains the protagonist's work—underwater testing matters because ruined colors still have music. The ashen forge functions as micro-setting, its "cooled stone" providing tactile anchoring and the "leaking chemical light" (aurora) charging the final prototype test. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional bias: color-sound synesthesia shapes what is noticed. The setting participates in closure when "broken blue swirl[s] through" the device, enabling the dual-betrayal recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Emerald Station is anchored with specificity (tiled archways, iron bench, Track Three) and the blending of moonbeam and sunset light creates a charged atmosphere that supports the surreal encounter. The jar functions as micro-setting: its opening transforms the platform into an "impossible aquarium," directly enabling the stranger's layered reveal. Spatial choreography is clean, and the final image (cool moon, glowing jar) recharges prior material, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrains choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned control room constrains choice: cables, dead panels, icicles, and consoles frame the transformation from command center to inquiry space. The kiln, bookmark, and melting ice are micro-setting elements that charge the final image (the vessel placed on a console "like a crown laid sideways"). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "water ticked and slipped from metal like hesitant thoughts." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting directly shapes the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted library under soundstage stars is specific and purposeful: metal ribs, plastic-sealed books, the whispering seashell half-wired to a speaker all anchor the stunt-double world and constrain the scene to a waiting space. The cast with smudged ink becomes micro-setting—a physical object that the protagonist must lean close to decrypt, and its rain-mottled plaster and cryptic loops charge the final realization. Spatial choreography (table between them, leaning closer, writing between codes) is clean and the setting evolves with the protagonist's internal shift from erased to author.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridge fort's shuddering towers, broken hinges, and shattered battlements constrain the scene's enclosed vulnerability. The gold leaf booklet functions as micro-setting: handled twice (laid on the drum, lifted between them), its flaking gilt and scored surface shape the oracle's method and charge the final image. The storm outside and the "ambered hush" inside create atmospheric pressure that modulates with the narrative's tightening. Sensory selection—rain rivulets, cooling stone ticking, star pulsing—filters through urgency and supports the ending's reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen courtyard constrains and charges throughout: icicles as "organ pipes," the plinth "dusted with snow," thermal sensors projecting melt. The ice violin's physical properties (trapped air hum, feather frost on strings) directly enable the sound-release that shifts HEPA-3's perception. The courtyard's "quiet geometry" and "dormant hedge maze" frame the experimental isolation and recur in the aerial view, which reweights his embodied position. Spatial choreography (plinth, loudspeaker under bench, statue crack) tracks cleanly across iterations. The micro-setting (his "cleaning arm," "fingertips rimed with frost") grounds each loop and the melted remains charge Dr. Roe's entrance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal forecourt recurs as spatial anchor and constrains the final choice: the registrar must leave the archive to meet the stranger there. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("mist braided with lamps," "moisture translated music into silver"). The lens from the projector functions as micro-setting, altering tactics (revealing hidden drawings). The forecourt charges the closure image, making the ending dependent on this exact location.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The maze functions as setting and constraint: hedges "slowly turning toward him," visitors returning in "lunchtime tides," the arbor and tool shed anchoring spatial logic. Micro-setting details (the cracked bowl, flagstones, keys as wind chimes) charge the final image and constrain Elias's commemorative system. The garden's spatial choreography remains clear across multiple beats, and the setting mirrors his bodily decline without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The xenobiology research station is anchored early with vivid, selective detail: ozone, preservative mist, glass columns, hexagonal windows. The magnetic nexus constrains Ilen's choice—he must tune the prism or risk fracturing the manifold—and charges the final image through the humming prism and the valley's stillness. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. Minor slip: the station's occupational systems are sketched but not deeply explored; however, at this length the micro-setting and tool focus compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns provides vivid, purposeful atmosphere through selective detail (peeling gilt, crystal prisms, warped staff lines). Spatial choreography remains clear as the musician wades toward the podium. The water functions as micro-setting, constraining movement and transforming the program into the score, directly enabling the climactic discovery. The antique program as recurring object charges the final image when combined with the raised instrument, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain weather station setting constrains Mara's isolation and the oracle's fault-tolerant presence; the botanical illustration of Feverwhisper functions as micro-setting, appearing in camera logs and anchoring her memory of the drowned valley. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rime crusted the railings in fragile, furred geometry," "antennas combed the blued air," "dawn bled green over the peaks." The station's architecture (consoles, radios, wind turbines) and the extinct plant's rendering ("stems as if they were veins, its leaves stippled with pale, almost translucent dots") both constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the pacing between windows and radios tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tunnel is vividly anchored—"mineral cold," "gravel," "corroded pipe," "beaded valve wheel"—and evolves from threat to altar as the characters move deeper. The beaded rosary on the valve wheel is a micro-setting detail that charges the final image and constrains Evan's gesture (pressing his forehead to the pipe). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: the drip, the metallic rhythm, "vibrating dust" that resolves into phantom boots. The tunnel's breath metaphor recurs purposefully, framing the confession hush and the final rebalancing. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the setting's claustrophobia amplifies the stake of confronting a swallowed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and river are vividly particularized through selective sensory detail: "walls shone with captured dusk," "water moved without sound, a slow ribbon of mirrored stone." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from catacombs through transformation to refuge. The swan functions as micro-setting, constraining the keeper's choice to follow or refuse, and the blank-page path charges the final image by sketching futures beneath his footprints. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: detailed observation during contemplation, compression during transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is filtered through Mara's professional lens (wheelchairs in rows, oxygen tubing "like a halo") and the courtyard eclipse staging gives spatial coherence. The ash tree and flagstones anchor the climax, and the dimming light constrains perception ("shadows sharpening like ink"). The keepsake drawer functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Idiom is consistent (rehab vernacular, "controlled exposure"). Minor: Sage Ridge itself remains a label; the ridge doesn't pressure a choice beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The silo's spiraling shelves, dust-filmed skylight, and bronze quiet create vivid spatial anchoring. The blackened fireplace and fragment of tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain Brann's method (he must kneel, press circuits to ash and thread). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("bronze quiet, as if listening back"), and the recurring vertical axis of the silo charges the final image as he "descended to the next fireplace." The setting is indispensable to both the central action and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse on black rocks, the bar's bottle-glass that reflects Morse, and the rotating lens inside constrain choices and charge the final beats. Spatial choreography is clear: bar to storm steps to panel. Sensory detail—"dust floated in columns of stray light," "rotating lens groaned like an old musician"—is vivid and filtered through the narrator's professional fatigue. The Golden Dragon Takeaway and soy sauce packets as microdot disguises ground the island's "open secret" economy in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The chapel's "dimensional anchor" function directly constrains the ritual's possibility space, and the dust, stained glass, and contracting walls create atmospheric pressure that tightens during the climax. The ultramarine pigment—"older than anything else," ground from stone under the foundations—serves as both tool and charged object, its "strange attention" quality affecting the final confrontation. Spatial choreography (altar, front pew, rafters, walls drawing nearer) remains coherent throughout. The setting charges the closure when "the chapel seemed to contract...the dimensional anchor tightening its grip."

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (nautilus pressed to glass, ice absorbing whisper of color). The nautilus shell segment functions as micro-setting—handled in multiple beats, used to align thought and horizon—and constrains Eli's method. The mirrored horizon charges the final image, though its impact on choice is indirect. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting's reflection-doubling motif threads through perception and stakes, meeting the 9+ gate by constraining ritual and charging closure even if the choice itself is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The viaduct setting is particularized (slick stone, neon reflections, drains whispering) and recurs at both opening and closure, charging the final image when Lio emerges "just as the drops began to fall again." The tablet's physicality (clay, runes casting shadows, refusing rain) actively constrains handling and choice. Spatial choreography is clean through the corridor maze, though the maze itself remains abstract. The recurring water imagery (drop/ripple, beaded rain, dripping return) modulates from suspension to release and directly supports the timeframe element, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cavern's sensory particulars—dust in shafts of light, rough stone arcs, drums as "sleeping hearts"—are vivid and selective. The setting constrains choice: Eira threads the filament through drilled tunnels, the drums translate silence into touch, and the floor's tremor becomes a shared tactile medium. The micro-setting (drums, filament, stone) charges the final image as children press against skins and earth. Scope fits: no occupational depth beyond what the scene demands, and spatial choreography remains clear across movements.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting: the dry fountain rim holds the tube, the perimeter sweep teaches spatial discipline, and the northwestern sky channels the pigeon descent. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias—"clicks," "rustle," pressure systems—and the final image of walking upstairs alone charges the space with new purpose. Environment constrains choice: the rogue zone's surveillance gaps shape what the narrator can witness safely.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto functions as both shelter and crucible: cooled clay, ember-glow, dust between characters all ground the exchange. The rope is handled ("fingers brushing"), and its silvered fibers anchor the prison-escape backstory. The energy beings overhead press the scene from outside, stalling buses and silencing roads, which constrains the protagonist's arrival and frames the stakes. The final image does not lean heavily on setting, but the grotto's wound/womb duality and the dust circles charge the thematic question without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse—glass ribs, diving suits as planters, barnacle-sugared pipes, reservoir pumps that stall mid-cycle—supplies tactile constraint and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (porthole balcony → planks → tilted ruins) remains legible. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elio's acoustic bias: "unanswered questions" in water slaps, "afterring" in silence, droplets as "slow applause." The pumps' refusal to finish cycles directly mirrors and enables the thematic closure, elevating setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered—"Light from fossilized resin seeped through the stone ribs overhead, staining every face with a syrupy, honeyed sorrow"—and micro-setting elements (the ampoule, blotter petal, shelves "like ribs") constrain the dealer's ritual and charge the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects Eve's professional filter: she notices the copper filaments, the "ghost of burnt sugar," the static deepening as they walk. The environment pressures choice: deeper into the grotto, the static intensifies, her "hair lifting," pulling her toward the ampoule. Minor slip: spatial choreography is occasionally impressionistic (the transition from "crate of bottled moods" to walking among shelves is smooth but vague on exact movement).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "breezy library under stars" with open doors and the sea murmuring beyond creates atmosphere and reflects the characters' openness to change. The setting constrains action lightly—reshelving together becomes the physical anchor for their conversation—and the concert square across provides temporal texture. Spatial choreography is clear (stacks, shelves, open doors), and the lanterns are handled as both symbol and practical detail. For 9+, a more decisive choice constrained by the space (e.g., where to hold the reading, access to lantern oil) would elevate integration; as is, the setting supports rather than drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor anchor place with vivid specificity: "cooled night, its facets swallowing and returning starlight" filters setting through POV wonder. Spatial choreography (rows, spirals, arbor at center) remains clear. Micro-setting bonus: the obsidian arbor constrains the climactic choice—Elian touches it, feels the heartbeat, sees futures—charging the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful (chalk lines, glittering dust, glass leaves trembling) without catalog excess. Minor gap: the quartz hostel and crater's steaming origin are ornamental backdrops that don't constrain tactics, but the arbor itself meets the 9+ gate for setting involvement.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop canal system is established with vivid, selective detail: "silver veins," "slick tiles," "shadows locking like teeth." The pendant's physical behavior (cooling, flaring hot, vibrating) constrains the protagonist's navigation and search pattern. The narrow passage between leaning towers functions as a threshold that the keeper will not cross, and the air "tasted like old bells, like thunder heard from underwater" charges the climactic beat. The giant's breathing provides atmospheric rhythm but does not constrain a pivotal choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered (stalactites as "slow clocks," glassy fruit, mineral pools) and the mosaic stepping stone constrains Corren's method. The glass eyes function as micro-setting tools that charge the conjuring beat. Sensory detail (dripping stalactites, damp stone, flavorless dust) filters through Corren's focalized attention and the environment subtly mirrors his internal state (the cavern "taking a breath it will never release"). The setting participates in the final image (stalactites resume ticking, silence becomes "almost kind"), meeting the 9+ gate for setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library's architecture (crawl spaces, pipe chases, vent grilles, central aisle) directly enables Marrow's caching and guides his intervention. The outage silences electrical chatter, making the tape scrape "thunderous" and Emergency lanterns create spatial choreography for the librarian's movement beneath the vent. Micro-setting constrain choices: Marrow navigates by joist memory, withdraws tools from a cache, threads tape through a vent—each environmental detail alters tactics. The "sapphire hush" and phantom pulses charge the atmosphere without becoming postcard description. The final image ("trembling hands," "emergency light haloing") fuses body and space to support closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mossy trellis and linden leaf function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the leaf's unexpected heat triggers the kneeling moment, and the trellis "shimmers...as if every vine and bead of water had turned to watch her." The nursery's "pots and tags and invoices, seedlings sorted in soldier-straight rows" concretely embodies Mara's imposed order. Weather pressure (storm season, approaching slate clouds) tightens decisions and reflects internal turbulence without heavy symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The piece uses selective detail filtered through Mara's professional and emotional priorities—what she notices (fungi, leaf orientation, spiral burn) reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal island constrains movement (twice-daily road appearance/disappearance), the exposed seabed yields the brooch, and the rain trails function as navigational method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "sky had the color of a bruise remembering better days," "wet stones gleaming like vertebrae." The amber brooch charges the final exchange, and the slick road surface recurs to anchor her departure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all constrain choice and charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid and specific: stalactites hum notes that glow, quartz chandeliers pulse like hearts, the cave pearl rises on vibration. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere-driven. The cave's songs and overlapping shadows constrain both women's certainty and charge the final image when the pearl "settled there like a second heart." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (cave pearl on pedestal, shadows thickening) actively shapes the turning point, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ivory harbor gleaming "like a polished bone" and the "bruised, retreating sky" anchor tone and establish the post-storm setting with sensory precision. The seawall, bollards, and salt-wet boards constrain Mara's movement and focus her attention on debris, satisfying the micro-setting test. The harbor's spatial choreography is clear: quay stones, pier edge, harbor center, and the shift from shuttered windows to open ones track the return of the exiles. The trumpet valve resting on the bollard as "a small sun of tarnished brass" charges the final image by making the object a beacon that draws Caven forward, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The brass punch appears in multiple beats (finding it, pocketing it, feeling its tug, the conductor noting it) and constrains Adrian's route. The pavement cracks function as a recurring environmental detail that guides action across the city. The starlit vault setting is vivid ("columns rose like patient giants, their surfaces etched with map lines that pulsed faintly") and charges the final image where Adrian must choose whether to accept the conductor's challenge. The micro-setting of the kitchen table establishes his professional identity, and the transition from urban streets to the liminal station remains spatially coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tower setting is vivid and purposeful: parapet, wind, whale song, and fog create atmospheric texture that mirrors Lio's interior journey. The tile constrains the closure beat by anchoring the transcription ritual. Weakness: spatial choreography is sometimes vague (Lio "dragged my notebook closer" but we never learned where it was), and the tower's physical details (mortar, stone floor) arrive late rather than early. Sensory detail is strong but occasionally generic ("low thunder," "silver scars").

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prismatic escondite constrains choice throughout: its dimensional anchors enable secrecy but also trap the protagonist in "inaction." The fragment on the worktable, magnetic fields as "glassy threads," and the room's mutiny all pressure the protagonist's stance. The body ("two fingers") and recurring light motifs ("patient rainbows" → "question") charge the final image. Economy is excellent—details serve pressure rather than tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prep room is vivid and specific—"formaldehyde and whispers," metal table, sterile knives, fluorescent light—and the autopsy cavity becomes the literal site of discovery, constraining the search. The vintage ink pot recurs with reweighted function (ordinary → transformative). Spatial choreography (chest stitches unpicked, cylinder taped to spine) is clear. Does not quite reach 8+ because the room itself does not force a tactical choice at closure; the cylinder's hiding place does.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bonsai labyrinth, observatory, fluorescent lamp, and mountaintop anchor spatially and recur with purpose. The lamp's hum is handled as a live constraint (charted, felt in teeth, guides story-writing) and the bonsai's "invisible mouths of fragrance" and mist like "quiet handwriting" charge the final walk. Sensory detail is filtered through Aurelio's craft idiom (gold leaf, edges burnished, grain of timelines). Minor: the empty streets "lie empty as paper" is vivid but the metaphor does not return; occupational depth (gilding tools, ruled columns) enriches without overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The port's towering container labyrinth is rendered with specificity—crooked aisles of steel, frozen waves, sound folding and echoing—and directly shapes the protagonist's walks and listening practice. The poison label under cracked glass, the customs office room, and tide rhythms all recur and constrain his routine. The final beat returns to the room beneath the label, grounding the closure in a micro-setting that has accumulated meaning. Sensory detail (salt, diesel, gull cries) is filtered through the protagonist's archival lens, and the setting's textures charge the ending image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory (cliff, shattered dome, moonlight, dust spirals, abandoned star charts) supplies atmospheric pressure and thematic charge without becoming a postcard. The painted shell and half-finished cello function as micro-setting elements that constrain her choice: she must lift, listen, touch to trigger the memory-compass. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"dust floated in patient spirals," "loose pages… lifted, fluttering like startled birds"—and the final shudder in the gust charges the ending. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The raft city is vividly particular: "lashed together from tankers, pontoons, and the skeletons of drowned suburbs," and the carnival setting constrains choices throughout (vendors migrate, performers buy decks, murals guide movement). The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, warm against Jae's chest and burning hotter under pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (Carnival Row, Planning Office, "under the rusted roller coaster"). One slip: the Council's holographic models and the investors' "mirrored yachts" feel slightly generic compared to the textured carnival details, and we never see how the physical maze structure itself forces a tactical choice in a dramatized beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit summit, crater rim, and floodlit harvesters below create spatial pressure that Ilya navigates—anchoring the tripod at the rim's edge, kneeling by the marker, pouring powder onto basalt. The regolith's "dry, thin vibration" and the pulsar-white beacon blink anchor his sensory hierarchy (visual countdown, tactile contact with dust). The setting constrains his final choice: he cannot save the grain, only witness and signal. The glassy basalt pan and "jagged shadows that knife-edged away" charge the closure image of him leaving his own print beside history's.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rail depot and mist create atmospheric coherence; the metal basin and glass tubes function as micro-setting tools that constrain Elias's diagnostic method. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, basin, counter, door). The harbor bell and ship's maiden voyage recur as off-stage anchors that charge the final release, reweighting the drone's departure from repair errand to existential joining. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's auditory priority (vibrations, pitch, whisper of gears) without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice constrain movement and choice—the ice "accepted my weight with a complaining crackle, but held" creates genuine uncertainty. The condensation map on the fogging window directly shapes the protagonist's route to the bluff, elevating micro-setting to tactical necessity. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "steaming faintly," "wide white corridor," "each step echoed up my legs into my chest." The seam and trickle at the bluff charge the final image by anchoring the conceptual breakthrough in physical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient archway frames every move: Ansel waits beneath it, strikes the fork against it, and the woman appears under it at closure. Cobblestones provide tactile resistance—"cracked backs like old teeth"—that the footsteps must navigate. Fog, chapel, town hall, and schoolyard bells spatialize the sonic revival. The micro-setting of archway and stones constrains method (rhythm must be measured on uneven surface) and charges the final image where two lives meet under stone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater temple constrains the drone's approach and charges the final image—pillars, thermal haze, collapsed archway all pressure the retrieval. The control sphere's "gathered hush," dim lights, and board states ground orientation and reflect isolation. The crystal vial functions as micro-setting, its pulse and geometry triggering olfactory memory (citrus, smoke, ocean) that alters the protagonist's stance from observer to archive. The temple's "lonesome splendor" and perfumed water anchor tone and recur at closure, reweighting the protagonist's solitude as curated rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse interior is vividly anchored: rust, wet stone, cells as "stacked mouths," lattice from confessional. Sensory detail (groans, copper-light repose, flakes of rust) is selective and filters through the protagonist's listening posture. The confessional lattice and the narrow iron door constrain exploration and charge the final discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography (reef, tower spiral, corridor, iron door, library beyond) remains legible across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting throughout: glowing glass ribs, metallic fruit, luminous seeds, branches that creak with remembrance. The carved bead is handled across multiple beats and its warming/weeping steam at the climax directly charges the protagonist's choice. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ashen-veil ghost bride," "veil smoked gently," "mineral and old smoke"), filtered through the protagonist's alchemical-apprentice lens. The endless night and winter-cracked fields frame the greenhouse as a covenant-space that constrains the protagonist's departure.

    The labyrinth's sandstone walls, violet moon-sheen, and narrowing chambers constrain Orren's movement and guide his ritual. The copper plate and awl function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image: he alters the plate's design by "lifting the boats higher, angling their bows toward a gap in the rocks that never existed yet aches to be real." Sensory detail (dust like flour, iron and old tide, barnacles like dull coins) is selective and voice-filtered. The environment shapes both tactic (tracing routes via sleepwalking) and closure (the carved harbor), meeting the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard is both vivid and functional: tree roots "snake between bones," fermenting fruit mingles with "rainstone," and the sundial base half-buried with "roots clasping it like fingers" becomes a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ridgeline village to orchard to trench collapse. The setting constrains action—villagers stopped using old footpaths, the stone's toppling "drifted" seasons—and charges the closure when the sunbeam touches the dial just as the bell rings. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("something older she could not yet name"), and the teaching garden rebuild transforms space into a "map of generations."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The golden arcade at dawn, glass ribs turning "from gold to a pale, bleached coin," and the analog post counter as "hinge" anchor place and charge it with nostalgia. The ebony clipboard and marble table are handled concretely. The arcade's civic-curiosity status and hologram signs sketch the future-world lightly without exposition dumps. The counter as physical constraint shapes the final beat: Neve walks to it, rests the envelope there, feels the drop. Micro-setting (body, clipboard, counter slot) qualifies and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt observatory, frost-pressed glass, and eternal candle anchor setting purposefully; the flame's leaning and trembling signal hidden currents in two beats and charge the final stitching moment. Micro-setting (desk, needles, cloth) constrains Liora's ritual and the spatial choreography (prince climbing stairs, dropping scroll between scissors and candle) remains clean. However, the observatory itself does not pressure the prince's choice or alter tactics beyond atmospheric framing, which holds the score just below the 8.0 gate where environment would need to constrain a key decision.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mangrove labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: roots rise "like ribs," phosphorescent algae creates "breathing green wounds," and invisible condensation windows appear only in this zone. The gargoyle shard pulses when regret thickens, acting as both tool and environmental cue that shapes Lysa's inquiry. The lagoon's rewind—crabs stepping into earlier footprints, words unwriting—directly enables the vision that delivers closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lysa's professional focus: she notices spirit song and shard temperature over incidental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atrium's "iodine, wet stone, and sour breath of fear" anchors setting through olfactory and atmospheric specificity filtered by Mara's professional dread. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting—its "cold weight" and ridges "fit strangely against [her] lifeline," constraining her final choice to pocket it rather than return it. Sensory hierarchy is tight: distant mortars, greenhouse glass dust, and "jungle hush" of trapped plants all mirror the boy's confined agency and charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard district is vivid and purposeful: branches as ribs, moss on cobblestones, fog that "glowed from within." The fresco fragment serves as both anchor and catalyst, and the projectors transform spatial properties (light threading around old paint). Sensory detail is filtered through Lio's artist lens ("exposed film developing," "crooked chandeliers"). The fog constrains visibility and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure; minor lexical elevations ("photonic blossoms") nudge the score down slightly from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is introduced early, its tuned cavities and stone ribs actively shaping the narrator's actions: the clap-and-listen test at midpoint directly alters perception and enables the mural's awakening. Spatial choreography remains clear (wall, arches, viaduct, path), and sensory detail is filtered through the restorer's professional lens (grime, pigment, plaster shiver). The hobo nickel and the garden's reflected murmur charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure. The garden's breathing and the echo-chord mechanics constrain the narrator's choices and enable the bewitching, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: glowing terrariums, clicking beetles, fern fronds—all chosen to mask forbidden speech and test the lexicon. "Beetles for verbs, bees for questions, moths for warnings" integrates insects as functional alphabet, not ornament. The map and community gardens supply spatial tactics, and the entomologist's clipboard-shield moment grounds her choice in setting. The final image ("quiet grammar blooms beneath its taxed dreams") charges the setting with thematic weight, meeting the 9+ environment test.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gargantuan shell is vivid and purposeful: spiral corridors, barnacles, jellyfish-bright lanterns, and reef-shadow interplay ground every beat. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting, glowing and guiding action at the threshold. The coral path emerges as both atmosphere and constraint, forming a negotiation space that the poet must address. The sensory hierarchy—water-light, pulsing barnacles, shimmering curtain—reflects the poet's nocturnal attention and charges the final image of the restored city.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal library above clouds is vivid and purposeful: translucent shelves refract light, glass floors remember steps, clouds flow past like a slow river. The caretaker's bare feet and the worktable with radiating tools anchor micro-setting. The cracked bamboo tube and the opal sliver constrain the repair action. The setting charges the final image—the library brightens when the new name is archived, then resumes its ordinary shimmer. Detail is selective, filtered through the caretaker's professional focus (labels as glass orchids, archived emotions as tangible objects). No occupation-depth penalty applies at this length; the world rules (names as sounds, emotions as artifacts) remain consistent and shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's "shelves curved like fossilized ribs" and "crumbling inks" create vivid texture. The glass ink well and vellum page function as micro-setting tools that constrain the protagonist's choices—dipping the pen triggers the room's "attentive as a jury" response, and the script's glow signals the vow's taking effect. Spatial choreography (desk, shaft of light, cleared patch) remains clear. The archive enables the Arithene discovery and charges the final act, satisfying the constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amphitheater is vividly anchored (groaning stone ribs, cracked center, ragged circle of sky, scarred seating) and functions as more than backdrop: the treaties stored in stone niches establish the conflict's history, and the building's breathing becomes a recurring sensory anchor that modulates with narrative pressure. The surveyor's chain is handled across multiple beats (sliding through fingers, laid in a looping figure, adjusted by councilors) and its physical properties (iron links, weight, length) constrain the final collaborative gesture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (stage, orchestra pit, seating tiers). The dormant volcano below provides thematic resonance (patient restraint of heat) that charges the final alignment metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The attic functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: warped floorboard, single skylight column, and caged pigeons all pressure Noel's balance ritual and route-planning method. The Mars meteorite chip on the trunk recurs with reweighted meaning—first as refuge from mistakes, then recognized by the woman as part of his former philosophy, charging the closure. Sensory hierarchy matches POV: dust, light, and feathers filter through his focus on erasure and reinvention. No occupation-depth issues at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting terrace, hovering house, and self-rearranging maze are vividly particular and constrain choice: moving furniture a finger-width tilts the room and triggers transit. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—hexagonal clouds, prismatic sheets, cornfields like fingerprints—filtered through the narrator's spatial obsession. The maze's center and the one-step strip of soil directly charge the closure image. Micro-setting (furniture, logbook stamps in wood grain) functions as constraint and mnemonic anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater facility constrains choice materially: protocol override, dome glass as canvas, bioluminescent shrimp visibility. The body becomes micro-setting ("our shoulders almost touching," condensation-fogged glass traced with feather), and the burnt feather functions as tool that alters tactics in the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (sky-reader notices constellations, light patterns, celestial analogies). The drowned city charges the final image when its "gentle pulses" embody the redesigned rhythm, making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The iridescent cave is richly particularized (sea-foam on geode floor, crystals shifting from sea-green to bruised violet, seeds nestled in hollows) and constrains choice: the narrow prismatic tunnel Lio "had never noticed" drives discovery, and the unfinished crystal seam supplies the key insight. Sensory hierarchy reflects his professional focus (foam textures, crystal hums, seeds as punctuation). The cave functions as both workspace and metaphor without over-signaling, and the final return to foamy shallows charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (brine mist, flooded floor, flickering vending machines, moon-checkered paths) and the tide functions as both atmosphere and symbolic clock. The rising water constrains staging—Marcus sets his suitcase on a dry patch, watches the tide "inch toward his boots," and the final kiss of water on his boots marks the climax—grounding the performance spatially and temporally. Micro-setting elements (toppled arcade cabinet, rail, pylons) anchor character positions and movements. The setting charges the final image ("waves slapped pylons, machines blinked, gulls shrieked") without overt symbolism, supporting the "calculated wilderness" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden floating on the lagoon is vivid and purposeful: lantern-moths, black glass roots, mirrored paths all constrain Mareh's ritual choreography. The moonstone dust speck in her tooth and the water itself function as micro-setting that enables the climactic act. Spatial blocking is clear (skiff approach, lagoon edge, arm mapping). The garden recurs in the final line to charge closure ("quiet rebellion still learning to breathe"), satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prism atrium is vividly rendered: beveled panes breaking sky into color, cracked mullions mirroring the coastline, children watching raindrops race. These details constrain the protagonist's motivation (preservation of refracted stories) and charge the final image. Pearl Bay at dawn, the quarry pond, and the jetty anchor spatial coherence. The atrium's physical properties—how light "slows down and shows its workings"—directly support the thematic stakes, lifting the setting into the functional-essential range.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit ridge path, pine smoke, and boulder anchor the scene with sensory purpose. The porcelain box functions as micro-setting, constraining Rafe's chest and charging the final confession beat. Spatial choreography is clean (ridge path → boulder, characters seated). The moon as "watchful, cracked eye" mirrors the box's cracks and Rafe's scars, purposefully supporting tone without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto functions as micro-setting: tide-polished floor, algae-lit ceiling, iron hooks from forgotten fishermen create vivid spatial grounding. The gauge and decorations (glass orbs, mirrors, maps) are handled on the page and constrain choices—moving an orb left models generosity and the needle rises; clustering mirrors triggers frantic loops. The tidal opening and closing frame the experiment with urgency. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the mathematician's lens ("wavering constellations," "water-logged ceiling"), charging the final image when the grotto "resembled a patient cosmos, waiting for us to choose."

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage, blackened room, and toppled fireplace constrain discovery and charge the final image; the environment is not ornamental but integral to the protagonist's work. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "wet stone and forgotten ink," "rust and the sour smell of mold." The micro-setting (hearthstone, blistered brick) functions as setting at this length, with the protagonist pressing an ear to brick and humming into corridors—actions that would fail without these specifics. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the climate-shifted context subtly guides the stakes without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace functions as active constraint: the high vantage enables the painter's work, the prism parapet after rain supplies the droplets that become vision-corridors, and the "echoing" quality charges the silence with tension. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered—damp stone, drip from parapet, the smell of rain—scaled to the painter's professional focus. The setting recurs in the closure beat: the droplets rise, the girl stands on the terrace, and the braided melody slips "down through alleys toward the unseen mirror beside the riverbed," integrating vertical choreography into the final action. The city below functions as both canvas and constraint, its "shuttered windows…dark mirrors" anchoring the painter's method.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace stones "cracked, veined with grasses" and the low stone table "rounded by generations of bargaining palms" ground the ritual in tactile history. The three bowls (salt, ash, water) constrain the opening moves and charge the closure by making abstract stakes concrete. Sensory selection is purposeful: "crushed mint, dust, and the sharp memory of rain" anchor atmosphere, and torchlight "swallowing" the clipboard's surface mirrors the negotiator's internal compromise. Spatial choreography (barefoot envoy crossing threshold, touching knots) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The salt flat is established early via aerial view and becomes tactile when he steps onto it ("air tasted of metal," cracks underfoot). The cracks function as micro-setting: they constrain movement by forming a map that "drew me toward its center," directly shaping the protagonist's path to the basin. The final image—kneeling in gray mud, egg on waiting ground—charges closure by making the environment an active participant in the ritual. Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's particular priorities (legal subterfuge, board euphemisms) and the setting's desolation mirrors his manufactured drought without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silver courtyard, well, and prism sanctuary are vividly anchored with sensory particulars: blue lanterns "soft… seemed dangerous," light "folded so many times it had forgotten its color," threads as tactile constraint. Iri's descent and the sanctuary's weaving mechanics constrain her actions (gloves off, hands alongside threads) and charge the final image (hush sent upward, snowflakes reconsidering). Spatial choreography is clean. Micro-setting (threads, altar jars) alters tactics when Iri chooses to weave rather than jar. The recurring silver/snow motif modulates from muted opening to suspended stillness at closure, reweighting the courtyard's passivity into potential uprising.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome functions as more than setting: it "listened," "groaned," and the rotating dish mirrors the narrator's breathing, charging the final image where "our stories chose not to escape but to orbit together." Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered—"meteor hush," "glow worms of insight," concrete floor and mezzanine walkway anchor spatial choreography. The campfire story stick operates as micro-setting, handled across beats and growing "heavy with the warmth of their attempts." Bars with puppet shows provide purposeful contrast but remain lightly sketched, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: its floating nature limits resources (grass, stone, dew) and the "interrupted cadences" of wind shape Erin's architectural responses in real time ("she adjusted the structures, shifting a twig here, untangling a dangling root there"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—moss, mist, the moth wing "like smoke trapped in parchment"—and filtered through Erin's professional/personal priorities (honoring extinction events). The grotto's verdant specificity (ferns, smooth stone, shallow bowl carved from stone) charges the final image when the monarch drinks from the dew-lined bowl. Spatial choreography is coherent across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and rope supply concrete sensory anchors (frost-bearded caretaker, warm fibers, ice-dust bells) and the rope constrains the protagonist's hands in the climactic beat, shaping the illumination action. Micro-setting details (street organ scrap tied to wrist, frozen bells whose tongues are chiseled faces) charge the final image with accumulated particularity. Spatial choreography is clean: the protagonist moves from beneath the rope to touching it, and the caretaker's kneeling posture tracks the rising sounds. The "snowmelt ardor" that rushes up the protagonist's arms anchors the thaw metaphor in tactile sensation, elevating atmospheric payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine-draped bunker constrains choice (sealed wings, water intrusion) and charges the final image (climbing out versus sealing in). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: wind through rebar, roots scratching the roof, water forcing through seams. The rewilded forest functions as invitation and contrast to underground obedience. Spatial choreography is clear across the underground chamber, the dream-ridge, and the threatened bunker. The wafer seal's heat and the console's presence supply the physical grammar of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    The reimagined palace is anchored early with sensory specificity (incense, dust, electrical hum, brick reliefs, tarps over reconstructions). The utility alcove breakers and control board constrain Tammuz's method; the courtyard grid becomes the experimental apparatus. The tile's tactile presence (matte, cool, river mud scent, later warm) recurs and charges the closure moment. The "between regimes" liminality subtly mirrors his existential stance. Minor: the spice shop and rented room above are mentioned but never pressure his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: silence "tightened around thought itself," walls "flickered between stone, glass, and something like misted skin," and the shifting architecture forces the protagonist to confront bodily memory when escape routes disappear. The broken music box—handled twice, first as light object then as vibration source—charges the final image when its silent key-turn produces an internal note. Spatial choreography is clean (cross-legged opposition, the box between them, walls rippling outward). Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (the protagonist notices Glass "resting like snow" during trauma replay, broader detail in calmer beats). Entry to 9-band requires the object or environment to constrain a choice; here the sanctuary's shifts force confrontation but the protagonist's agency in the final turn is more internal than spatial, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ruined orchard's fog, frost-crusted stones, and decayed infrastructure constrain Elias's work (he must breathe with the fog to thin boundaries) and the glass mountains metaphor charges the final flare. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through craft-POV (sand-glass, silver dust, copper bowl). The sextant and mirror function as micro-setting objects that enable the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard-in-cathedral setting is vivid and purposeful: branches through stained glass and buckled flagstones embody the feral consequence of the broken contract. The mender's repair bag (cracked lens, copper wire, lead strip) functions as micro-setting, constraining his attempts to bridge his trade with his daughter's grammar. The ribbon tied to the watchful trunk charges the final image when the orchard "hushed" in response. Minor gap: the apple's mirrored vision feels slightly detached from the immediate spatial choreography, though it serves thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The astral orchard, asteroid, and catalog hall are vividly anchored with selective, purposeful detail—"apples were miniature suns; from others, they were closed eyes." Micro-setting (the bathroom, the mirror, the pistachio shell in its velvet cavity) drives the key turn: the mirror allows passage and the fruit splits to reveal pages. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's curator priorities; spatial choreography (orchard inside the bathroom stall, branches from the toilet tank) remains legible despite the surreal layering. The setting charges the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain-sized bookstore is vividly realized—phosphorescent indexes, crooked shelves, ink turning invisible—and its labyrinthine structure directly constrains Lysa's search method (charting gaps, following skipped numbers). The circular chamber with blank spines charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the diary, catalog cards, the hovering book) functions as tool and constraint. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lysa's professional focus: she notices linguistic artifacts, vein-structures, shimmering script.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carnival ship is vividly rendered with purposeful gothic-industrial detail: groaning hull, faded clown mannequin, shooting gallery with mirrored rifles, funhouse curtain of ticket stubs. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (gangway → stalls → shooting gallery → funhouse → theater). The emerald swatch card constrains the protagonist's entry and later triggers the theater-into-garden transformation, directly shaping the closure image. Sensory selection is filtered through the protagonist's professional lens (cataloging anomalies) and personal urgency. The transformation sequence where "seats sprouted into hedges of velvet and brass" and "the ceiling opened onto a sky of painted leaves" charges the final reconfiguration with spatial metaphor that serves theme without becoming mere decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mechanism room is vividly rendered—"cold metal and older dust, a high nest of shadow and tick and breath"—and the rope, seal, and gears function as micro-setting that constrains choice: Lysa must physically engage the braids to alter time. Spatial choreography is clear (central table, beam, escapement). The room's impossible existence (stone that doesn't match the hallway) feeds the stakes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lysa's archival attention, though the final image could lean harder on a recurring environmental anchor to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harmonic caves constrain movement and choice throughout: the veined ice curtain forces the mapkeeper to read crack patterns as a navigational grammar, the throat chamber's spiral dictates stone placement, and the luminous spores provide the invisible music that powers the conjuring. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (iron, wet basalt, ozone, terror on the tongue). The cave's resonance charges the final image by providing the anvil against which quiet is hammered. Micro-setting (the echo chamber stone, the ice sheet) functions as both tool and constraint, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass humming pavilion is vividly particular—panes vibrating with radio ghosts, grown like a salt flower around the lighthouse—and it constrains action: Keeper climbs corroded steps nightly, presses his forehead to glass to cast retrocognition outward. The prism and shard anchor tactile interaction (carried like a sleeping animal, trembling/cracking like thawing ice). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "dusk bleed through cracks," "thistle-blown hope snagging on rusted railings," ashen sky. The comet's "pale roar" and the beam's final obedience charge the closure image. Minor gap: the dead sea and horizon remain atmospheric backdrops without pressuring a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory setting constrains choice throughout: thin air and storm pressure frame urgency, the crystal forecourt whispers when touched (beat involvement), and shadow lengths on monuments provide the archivist's diagnostic tool, driving his decision to prioritize fading memories. The stormlight's shifting angles become a live clock that alters his transcription tactics. The final railing touch and dimming lamps charge the ending image, making the setting indispensable to both method and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The blooming fortress is vivid and purposeful: vines with night-opening flowers, damp earth, bruised petals, covered lanterns demanded by archers. The courtyard's flagstones and cracks guide shell placement, and the "orange eye" workfire anchors spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy reflects the designer's priorities (pollen, fear, echoes). The environment constrains choice (archers demand darkness, he works by feel) and charges the final image (the hand opens above the blooming walls). Micro-setting (the rag knot, fuses, crates) functions as setting and drives action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the tidal pool's reflection becomes the instrument of foresight, star-silver on jade charges the cicada, and the stone ledge stages the physical distance between narrator and Lysa. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-swollen notebook, waves whispering, star-dimpled water). The body and pool anchor the final turn when the narrator touches the reflection and it shudders, making temporal layers visible. The setting charges the closure image through the interplay of tide, stone, and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its beams offer specific silence flavors, the crossbars become "hands held out," and the porcelain doll resonates differently on western versus eastern struts. The inversion hour reconfigures spatial logic (gravity tilts, bodies rise) and charges the final shared float. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's collecting obsession—metallic taste, dusty quiet, wet hush—filtered through their particular mission. The setting directly enables the father's transformation and the closure image of two bodies "unbound from the math of fear."

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace, gondola cabin, and blue noise-level line create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Rian's priorities: storm glass crystals as weather-reading, the terrace's rotating panes scattering light, the cabin's "cable hum" and "soft scrape of glass against wind." The blue line constrains passenger behavior and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (platform → gondola → terrace approach) remains clear. The setting is not merely backdrop; it enables the experiment and the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, hourglass orchard, and stairway of obsolete operating systems are vividly specific and filter through Ilya's archival perspective (ozone/citrus taste, lenses recording for remembrance). The orchard's upward-pouring sand and the stairway's constellation countdown both constrain his ascent, charging the final moment. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations, and micro-setting (the ruby flake between paint layers, the stair itself) directly shapes the closure choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary, roofless under starlight, is vivid and purposeful: dust undisturbed except for one path, broken circles that frame the ritual. The doorknocker's warmth ("as though someone had just let go") and the threshold's static flicker anchor Mara's crossing. Scars as a micro-setting—pale ridges that glow and align—constrain the encounter's method and charge the closure image when their alignment enables breath, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bioluminescent mushrooms anchor setting viscerally ("blue-green caps pulsed…painting her hands") and constrain choice: their accelerating cycle signals the weight of promises, and their respectful dimming as she approaches the hatch charges the closure. The submarine-porthole hatch design echoes her bolt, functioning as micro-setting that shapes the final move. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional lens (moisture levels, gills shimmering with half-formed notions), and the cavern's humidity slows the change, adding tactical pressure. Spatial choreography from far corner to hatch is clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered—dust as "mute constellations," tables "the color of old tea"—and the gramophone on its wheeled cart functions as both tool and spatial anchor. The setting constrains Aurel's method (he smuggles equipment piece by piece, adjusts the needle above bare metal) and charges the final image when the room's acoustic properties become the medium for historical recovery. Evening light and golden shadows modulate with the emerging voice, creating a coherent sensory envelope that tightens rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly particularized—glass apples hum, metal trees rise from silver soil, crystal masks hold trapped possibilities—and the greenhouse environment constrains Calder's choices (he enters to catalog but confronts his allegiance). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through his weary knighthood. The marionette program functions as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the "endless night" frame remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that materially alters tactics or decisions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The file room is vividly anchored through dust patterns, bowed shelves, fluorescent hum, and tactile handling of folders and objects. Micro-setting qualifies: dust thickness maps neglect and becomes a diagnostic tool that constrains Mara's prioritization choices. The button—brass, worn, taped to a card—charges the climactic visitor scene. Spatial choreography remains clear across weeks of work, and the recurring image of dust-as-photography developer ties setting to theme without forcing symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The auric lagoon, phone booth, and puddles constrain Lio's route and provide the discovery mechanism for the archive. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "paint peeled in long, curling shivers," "water glowed from within, more like diluted metal." The puddles function as micro-setting that charges the final image when they reappear holding the phone booth reflection. Spatial choreography across markets, tram yard, freight gates, and lagoon is clean and tracks movement without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's acoustic and optical properties (prism, stalactites, mist) constrain the saxophonist's reversal project: the mineral patience and natural amplification charge his attempts. Micro-setting detail—dewdrops dripping "like measured rests"—integrates rhythm into setting and recurs at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (lakeshore, cliff, grotto throat) and the sensory hierarchy (sound over sight during fog) reflects urgency. The grotto does not physically constrain a choice so much as it provides resonance for the emotional and thematic stakes, keeping Q3 just below the 8+ band where hard constraint on tactics is expected.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen arbor, hollowed trunk, and heartwood grooves are tactile and specific, shaping Lio's workspace and constraining choices (guiding leaves, building monuments along inner bark). The moonstone leaf and leaf-map charge the final beat, making setting an active pressure. Sensory detail (wet stone and sap, mossy coolness) reflects urgency and anchors the voice's arrival. Minor slip: the valley below remains abstract; spatial choreography inside the arbor is clear, but the larger geography stays postcard-level.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "veils of spray," "mineral salt," "warped door furred with moss." The subterranean waterfall and greenhouse constrain Eli's path and supply the compass rose, which charges the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across three distinct zones. Minor density: the nautical charts and unnamed instruments clutter the cavern beat without altering tactics, trending decorative. The compass rose (micro-object-as-setting) constrains the final image and qualifies for the 9+ gate, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rain-washed foundry is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "rust to mirrored ink," the "coal that never quite died," puddles bending reflections "like time refusing a straight line." The crucible functions as micro-setting, actively constraining Eira's ritual and producing the vapor-vision that charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clear (doorway, floor, satchel beside bowl, touch rim, step back) and the setting's history (bells, coins, anchors, astrolabes) directly supports the thematic weight of names.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Echo gorge functions as active constraint: the narrow spiraling path, the harp jutted from stone, and the ledge where Mara stops all shape her descent and ritual positioning. The crocodile's tooth (micro-object-as-setting) anchors her method through tactile ritual. Sensory hierarchy is strong—"thin melodic scraping," "breath on glass" faces, wind arranging her hair—and filtered through her myth-collector lens. The harp's physical misalignment directly charges the closure image when its strings tighten with laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ultraviolet forest constrains movement and shapes perception throughout: roots the protagonist doesn't see yet compensates for, light "flashing brief equations" on skin, branches etching graphs. The clearing's frame—cables into soil, mycelium threads—grounds the abstract proposition in tactile detail. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: under nausea the protagonist notices only essentials (roots, the frame's hum), while calmer beats admit subtler wavelengths. The pewter mask strap functions as micro-setting, a concrete object that charges the closure choice. Minor gap: the forest's mechanics (how light translates nerve damage) remain atmospherically vivid but functionally vague, limiting how directly environment pressures tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with concrete, purposeful detail: creaking boards, dangling brass alembics, moth-eaten robes, and the painter alchemist's dusk-stained fingers. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from outer rail to velvet curtain to hanging canvases. The lighthouse lens fragment as micro-object charges the final image and functions as tactile setting. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's professional filter (noticing brushstrokes, hidden details). The market constrains movement and enables the core discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ticket office, concrete shaft, brass mainspring, and inverted room are vivid and constraint-rich: the polished circle on the barrel signals repeated ghost use, dust accumulation guides forensic choice, and the ceiling breach supplies the final spatial impossibility that charges closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (elevator grease simile, fibrous sigh of tape). The micro-setting (mainspring on crate) directly enables the protagonist's final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard, cloud-sea, and letterpress are vivid and purposeful; the frost maps serve as concrete instructions that constrain Ilen's choice. Spatial choreography inside the library remains hazy (where is Ilen's wing relative to the stacks?), and the final image of the library shuddering and the cloud-sea climbing higher charges the ending effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The baroque asteroid is vividly realized through selective detail: "curtains pooled in corners like spilled years," "corridors twisted like frozen music," copper-vine-framed mirrors. Setting directly constrains choice: mirrors must be veiled to prevent time leakage, sealed compartments require descent with drapes as tools. The micro-setting of mirrors charges the final image—covering them preserves Mara's reimagined futures. Spatial choreography remains coherent across multiple locations (galleries, Hall of Fractured Dynasties, sealed compartments, chapel of obsolete engines).

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered ("stone sphere lined with countless hanging chimes," "every whisper struck the metal and multiplied") and constrains the solution: Elias must use this acoustic space to make the fractured stone "speak." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (rust curling away, chimes shivering, the shard brightening from within), and the blackwood music box's "ring of polished emptiness" charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (workshop → stairwells → iron doors → chamber interior → pedestal); the rust's physical behavior (blooming, recoiling, creeping) tracks coherently and pressures the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subterranean lagoon constrains the final choice by requiring the skiff and isolating Elias from retreat; the compass needle locking across the water forces spatial commitment. Micro-setting excels: wet limestone under boots, dripping stalactites as "teeth of a patient beast," the rotted skiff's exposed ribs all charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's collector priorities—scent dominates early (petrichor, wet dust, metallic fear), then shifts to tactile and visual as he delves. The factory's absence creates negative space pressure: "resonant hush...as if someone turned down a sound the ears never knew they were hearing."

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed archway is rendered with layered specificity: "sea hurled itself," "spray that caught the headlights and turned into trembling prisms," tide throwing up "a tangled altar." The environment constrains choice (GPS fails, wind yanks, sand stings) and charges the final image when Mara reimagines it as the center of a new map. Minor slips: "edge of the world" and "throat in the cliffs" are stock phrases, and the archway's exact spatial position drifts slightly (rocks, surf, cliffs).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting details are selective and purposeful: the amber pavilion's autumn colors against spring, the cathedral's "dull" windows, the narrow stair, and the etched glass all ground the reader and reflect the story's thematic contrasts (light/dark, seen/hidden). The etched glass functions as micro-setting, constraining the discovery—Ira must climb, wait for low sun, and trace shadows to soil beds outside—and the final image of night gardens "learning to listen" charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy is strong (visual dominates, filtered through an artist's attention), though tactile and auditory details are sparse. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The zeppelin library is tactile and purposeful: books sway, shelves bolted to ribs, dangling microfilm ladders ground the descent. The obsidian lagoon—light-drinking, layered with "shipwrecked time"—charges the final image and supplies the debris alphabet that enables the parley. The rope ladder descent functions as both transit and temporal metaphor ("each rung another year"), micro-setting that constrains and enriches the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Paper-lantern cove is vividly particular: lanterns "speckled with dead moths and flaking salt," boats "knocking softly like teeth," amber bottle fracturing light into hexagons. The bottle itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the alchemist's attempts (force, flame, thought all fail) and charging the final image when it warms. Sensory detail is filtered through his craftsman's eye. The cove's emptiness subtly mirrors his isolation and frames the return at the end. Minor gap: the workshop interior and pier remain somewhat abstract; we lack concrete anchors for his movements between them.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard garden is vividly anchored early ("trees bore fruit like muted lanterns, each pear and apple wrapped in gauze labels inked with dates and names") and functions as archive, shaping Lan's ritual and the night's confession. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lan's archival focus (gravel, velvet disquiet, glue and chalk dust in memory). The wax shaving on the river stone and the garden lamps dimming modulate atmosphere purposefully. The garden does not constrain a tactical choice at closure, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound atrium is vivid and purposeful: glass ribs ringing, rimed iron balconies, blue-light cradle, and frost from the egg's breath all charge the atmosphere and constrain the space as sacred/fragile. The oak acorn cap as micro-object reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory selection (frosting air, grainy time texture, dust motes swirling) sharpens under pressure. The setting directly shapes the protagonist's final choice—the locked drawers and the egg's physical presence force the decision to reopen.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The windblown sanctuary is signaled early and constrains every choice: the listening dishes, the spiral path, the stone drop at the edge all shape Elias's movements and final decision. The rope is handled across multiple beats (coiling, uncoiling, tying, touching) and charges the closure when he sets his hand on it then steps away. Sensory detail is filtered through professional attention (pressure jitter, wind veer, needle jumps) and the final image—cupped hands, murmur of the valley, his uncertain heart—anchors the ending in body and place.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tracking station's "quiet older than memory," dust "like crushed nebulae," and the yellow lantern glass all constrain and charge the janitor's discovery. The dome itself becomes a receptor for projections, altering what he can witness. Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone, metallic tang, humming glass—and filtered through his custodial attention. The lantern glass as micro-setting object charges the final image when he lifts his broom "as if it were a staff." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vivid, selective detail throughout: hives "cracked and empty," "glassy dunes," "wind hissed through warped frames," the stained glass box "shattered chapel windows" with "looping grooves pressed by absent hands into softened glass." The apiary and box are integral to closure—the protagonist opens the box and light bends through Mara, activating the covenant's visibility. Spatial choreography is clear (gate, shed, box, protagonist and Mara's positions). Minor: the description occasionally leans ornamental in the middle third ("colors pulsed like slow bees") rather than constraining a live choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald silo is vividly particular (glowing green at dusk, breathing like a sleeping animal) and constrains the narrator's role throughout. The garage-sale driveway functions as micro-setting, shaping the method of rediscovery. The glass cube, urn fragment, and shifting scars on the object charge the final image when the narrator presses palm to glass and feels "a rough, braided current." Sensory economy is strong; every anchored detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lagoon setting is vivid and purposeful: "cupped in black rock," "deep metallic blue," post-rain mist, and the kite over water all pressure Elian's perceptual stance. The feather's arrival at the tideline and the woven-dawn strands appearing on the lagoon's surface directly constrain and enable his tending action. The body (lifting feather to ear, humming) functions as micro-setting. Minor gap: the being's emergence from "crossing strands" introduces a world-rule late without prior cue, and the spatial choreography of "whirlpools" and "strands" is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pillars "hollow with architectural secrets," copper coils in storage loft, and storm-opened chambers constrain choices and charge closure: the wires enable circuits, the chambers validate translation, and monks' final paths ("not the architects") prove the orchard's voice. Micro-setting (toolshed, copper, oak branches) functions as setting at this length. Sensory hierarchy reflects craft priority: "hum under birdsong," "grinding sigh," tactile wire-winding. Spatial choreography clear across cliff path, orchard, loft, and pillar interiors. Environment applies immediate pressure (storm, hidden seams) and the final paths are chosen by trees, not architect—setting decisively shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rainwashed tower, sculpture path, and fly amber function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the amber's dull refusal mirrors the narrator's stance, the spiral clearing's bare earth becomes the palm awaiting chemistry. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("bronze quiet," "ocher comma," moss "like old handwriting"), and the environment subtly guides choice—footprints double and converge, the hill descent structures the pilgrimage's rhythm. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tower stairs down the overgrown path to the clearing. The amber as recurring object constrains perception (its refusal to pulse comforts more than any model) and charges closure when it stays cool in the narrator's hand at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: pier narrowing, buried ammunition swelling, thin soil—all dictate seed placement. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (rust smell, breath as ghosts, "narrow vastness"), filtered through the coachman's perceptual priorities (dead languages, bird syntax, botanical labels). The dead reef's "absence so complete it seemed like a statement" charges the final image, making the environment indispensable to thematic weight. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (carriage, bench, pier, planks, crack).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scrapyard setting pressures choice through scarcity (scavenged speaker, hand-cranked generator) and the autumn leaf functions as micro-setting, charging the final image with its glow and framing the wait for the first knock. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "mountains of scrap," "tire rubber coat," "grooves tinted with faint bands." Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, shelf, Barrow's positions) and the cracked wasteland context tightens the stakes around preservation versus erasure. The leaf's return in the penultimate line reweights the opener's color-memory motif and constrains the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observation deck constrains choice throughout: the gilded compass warns him not to cross, the polarized shutters delay his glimpse, the dilation field makes his breath lag fractionally behind intent. The viewport's "slice of the universe where time ran unevenly" is not postcard description—it shapes his entire action (sketching distorted constellations rather than fixed ones). The sketchbook functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor with mother's inscription that charges the final act. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: he notices light-drag, shadow angles, starfield lag—details filtered through an astronomer's lens. The deck's scar "still warped the local measures of before and after," embedding constraint into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    The icebound spire, glassy rungs, and black-glass pedestal constrain the climb and charge the setting with tactile specificity. The "wrong sky" with bruise-colored pulsing recurs and pressures the protagonist's choices. The sundial lid's temperature paradox ("neither cold nor warm") and the engravings that ripple mid-scene transform the pedestal from postcard to active constraint. Micro-setting (hand on stone, frost on stairs) alters tactics and the final platform silence shapes the ritual exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The whispering gallery's acoustics constrain multiple choices: the narrator logs gestures by their sonic signatures, the woman and man negotiate divorce through stone-mediated whispers, and the dome itself becomes the archive medium. The custodian's glass-cased chessboard and the narrator's walking circuits use micro-setting (body and object) to charge the final image. The interregnum context colors every interaction—"everyone walking careful circles around power that was not there"—making the setting inseparable from theme. The gallery's threatened closure by the next regime tightens the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bookstore's corkscrewing architecture, shifting aisles, and underground spring constrain navigation and charge the search. Micro-setting elements (dusty display case, warm stone, glass texture "like a feather") drive the tactile unlock and stone handling across multiple beats. The final beat uses spatial metaphor ("sealed room," "soil of my mouth") to fuse interior and exterior geography. Sensory detail is vivid and selective; the "light tinted through stained pages" and "dripping water" anchor POV priorities. The stone's pulse-warmth and the locked case directly enable the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen village (raindrops suspended, dust motes "like neglected pawns") and the platinum tower with its etched constellations anchor the opening and constrain Elior's path. The tapestry's frayed border functions as micro-setting, its threads a tactile puzzle that responds to each tug with a groaning stair or darkening center. The final image—"tower's plates rang like chilled goblets; outside, the raindrops resumed their fall"—is charged by the established stasis. No occupational detail clutter; chess idiom is filtered through Elior's perception without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bone architecture (hollowed femur, vertebrae table, skull stools, knuckle chimes) constrains movement and choice throughout—Zev's dwelling frames the ritual spatially, and the canyon's physicality pressures Maren's descent. The chimes "turn every gust into a small, rattling joke against solemnity," charging tone and foreshadowing the refraction method. The pale spire functions as both destination and silent witness, its mist-veiled presence anchoring stakes. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (forged hush, scraped-bone voice, charcoal smudge). Minor note: a few phrases trend decorative ("breathlike vapors") without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid sea, workshop floats, and glass lung constrain every tactic: the cylinder's descent and fracture directly force the sigil-repair choice, and the corroding floats impose existential urgency. Sensory detail is filtered through Corin's alchemical attention ("smoking emerald acid," "prickled as though regret itself were trying to burn through"). The gears-and-cogs cathedral texture charges the final image when the workshop "groaned in sympathy, its rusted lungs filling with a different kind of breath," making environment both crucible and resonant object.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal cave network constrains the protagonist's path and supplies the pool, stalagmites, and moon-shaft that anchor the closure painting. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—lime taste, wet-cloth darkness, glass-clear pool—and the cavern's temporary-eternity motif directly enables the final image. Spatial choreography is clean through the descent and chamber widening. The setting fulfills the Q3 9+ gate criterion by charging the final image, though early quay anchors arrive slowly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt lighthouse, cooling rail, and lamp room constrain Mara's choices—she must climb to the lens to enact her method, and the "great lens, that eye of the coast" becomes the instrument of her beckoning. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "cooled basalt and wet rope," "black-backed gulls mocked him," the scent of "watered earth, moonlit stone, and forgiven arguments." The post-heatwave dawn filters through Mara's relief and urgency. Spatial choreography is clear across vertical zones (platform, lamp room, harbor below), and the setting's verticality mirrors the hierarchy Mara is challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The signal station's failing hydraulics, dead lights, moon-dependent phosphorescence, and the patina bronze censer foot all constrain Rian's charting work and charge the final image. The censer foot anchors Mara's past and narrows Rian's signals "through the metal into my bones," directly enabling the map-drawing choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt flats, iron taste, gravel underfoot). The station itself pressures the midnight work: analog consoles, humming landline, and starlight through ceiling cracks are integral to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ravine setting pressures choices throughout: cables, hanging pods, storms that "crawl," the humming ladder. The glass eye functions as micro-setting object, constraining attention and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("velvet that smelled of salt and dust"), and spatial choreography remains coherent. The orchard's physicality—roots, truffles, pods—shapes the mapping work and final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The opal dock's liminal glow and nautical twilight constrain the investigation to a threshold space that charges every choice. The lighthouse "loomed," "lantern caged in rust," "windows blind as cataracts" mirrors the keeper's opacity and the drowned man's erasure. The boutonniere's tactile presence—"crackling faintly," "color of old bones"—recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean: three boards away, turning to face water, walking the dock's length together.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The blooming cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (ceiling drops, forcing crawl; rising water pressures timing) and charges the final image (undecided stone, petal-filled air). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: iron-and-blossoms, damp fragrant mouths, warming chip. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and crawl. The matrix chip as object-setting warrants credit: it warms, projects paths, and becomes the tool that softens the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Spatial choreography is mostly clear (palace → terraced fields → shepherd hut → ridge ledge → grotto chamber) and sensory detail is vivid and selective (thin air scraping lungs, metal and overripe fruit taste, starlight dripping). The ember grotto's glowing stone and the shattered-glass ceiling provide purposeful atmosphere. The grotto interior constrains movement and charges the closure image with the bursting starlight and flaring visions, satisfying the 9+ gate test. Minor ambiguity: "cobalt grotto" vs. "ember grotto" (are these the same? the text treats them as one, but the color shift is unexplained).

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember nexus is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: "slagged stone," "rusted rails arc above it, sketching iron halos." Setting recurs at the closure moment when the pocket sun "pulses behind me, impatient," charging the final image. The shell's "spiral like a decision reconsidered at every turn" and the temperature gradient where "fossil and future argue" constrain Lio's conceptual choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cabin's "frozen lightning" beams, thin air "like an accusation," and cemetery as "scatter of pale teeth" anchor setting in the narrator's perceptual signature. The mountain altitude functions as micro-setting, constraining perception ("so thin it feels like an accusation") and enabling the lucid-dream soar. The scrolls' "sharp green smell of sap" and "resin on my fingers" ground tactile detail. The graveyard's glowing crosses function as a spatial constraint at closure, positioning the narrator "between graves and roofline" to crystallize his stance. Economy is strong: every setting detail either primes the soar or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The water clocks constrain and charge every beat: Mara unscrews a bolt, the screw is placed "beneath the channel," water "pooled above the new metal." The shop's "trembling calm of ticking water" filters all perception. Fog anchors the opening, then lifts as interior density increases—environmental shift tracks causally. The screw's placement alters the spatial logic of the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform is tactile and pressured throughout: tethering chains sing under gusts, carved talismans flicker, the storm circles below waiting for the runes to falter. The crow quill, tea leaves unfurling like ink dragons, and the glowing stroke "hanging in the air" all charge the final image. Sensory detail (humming platform, saturated hush, mist, vapor ribbons) is filtered through Lan's heightened attention. The platform's descent through mist at closure reweights the space as a threshold between isolation and "the waiting world." Micro-setting (cup, tray, quill) constrains rune-writing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archive setting constrains choice: "Veins of copper under the floor made the archive a natural switchboard for unfinished business." The perfume bottle, reel-to-reel machine, and fluorescent tubes function as micro-setting that charges the final image—lights flaring "like an applauding audience," the scent anchoring memory. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mirabel's professional lens (electrical surges as "spiritual telegraphs"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The orchard's "hush" and sawdust scent bookend the piece, tying exterior threat to interior resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The temple library constrains No-One's ritual walk: corridors fold back, creating the spiral necessary for arbitration. The chamber with nested rings of books is revealed through spatial progression and directly enables the final act. The dictionary functions as micro-setting, handled twice (lectern, then chamber floor) and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through cosmic scale ("draft against his skin," "candles flare sideways") rather than mundane particulars, fitting the elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station's physical particulars—brass pipes, water bowls, valves, horizon instruments—supply both constraint and metaphor without becoming ornamental. "The station from far above, its roofs and gutters arranged like the face of a dismantled clock" charges the closure image by transforming setting into thematic architecture. Sensory selection (salt-furred walls, wind "like water in pipes") filters through the shepherd's professional attention. The parapet where he sets the key down is both spatial anchor and symbolic threshold, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate of environment shaping the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rainwashed library, subway car, and hospital room are vividly specific ("wet wool, printer ink, something sweetly green, like crushed clover") and filter through the narrator's probability-professor lens. The candle lantern's mica pane charges the discovery beat, and the subway scrawls function as micro-setting that alters her route and mood. Father's chip-shuffle gesture in sedation and the styrofoam-cup bedside anchor the hospital scene. Minor: some sensory details (stone lions, smeared comets) approach catalog without pressing choice, but the clover-bright final image recharges the opening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subway utility tunnel constrains Lena's existence and charges the closure: "a narrow, echoing bridge where stories passed over the dark" transforms isolation into purpose. The glass disc is handled twice (opening solitude, then deepening tone for Mara), and the flickering streetlamp above Mara creates spatial pressure that Lena exploits for the final instruction. Sensory detail is filtered through Lena's priorities—"dripping dark," "chipped tiles," "thin electric pause"—and the micro-setting (booth alcove, rotary switchboard) grounds every beat without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blooming jetty operates as micro-setting that charges the closure: barnacle roses and mussel tulips frame the ritual, then intensify ("bloomed thicker") as the supernatural event unfolds. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's priorities—walnut ink, salt, phosphorescence—filtered through archival focus. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (rail → pylons → far end). The jetty's transformation directly enables the apparition, constraining the encounter to this charged threshold between land and sea.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station is vividly anchored early (ivy, cracked platform, fern through broken tile, benches sanded smooth by waiting) and the setting's recurring motif—objects as stalled prayers on shelves—charges the conceptual frame of reciprocity and circulation. The cracked concrete forming "a crude map of broken rivers" when they place the moon rock is purposeful micro-setting that supports the ritual. However, the station does not constrain a tactical choice or alter an option during the key turn; it serves as atmospheric container rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ultrasonic forest operates as micro-setting: its vibrations guide Orrin through undergrowth, the sound thins at the root-tangled hollow, and the silence presses like "cool hands" at closure. The compass ring functions as a charged object, warming and cooling to dowse inward ache. Body-as-setting: Orrin's skin absorbs languages, constraining perception and shaping the final phrase. Sensory hierarchy reflects his blindness (bone-deep sound, touch-driven grammar). The clearing's silence and soil-touch at closure anchor the renunciation with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: "falling and floating negotiated an uneasy truce" constrains movement and later deepens when "the floor buckled" and objects lean toward the void, cueing the pen's activation. The dried pen and observation deck dust become tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clean. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's professional lens (mapping transmissions, holographic charts). Does not quite reach 8.0 because the anomaly's physicality could press harder on a closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor setting is vivid and purposeful: moonlight pouring through the empty camera back, the breakwater stones as staging ground, rigging clinks and fish jumps as answering sounds. The camera functions as micro-setting, constraining the ritual and charging the closure image when it "clicks like a chord resolving." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting enables the final transformation rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive setting actively constrains movement (climbing, narrow passages, the well descent) and the tapestry's suspended position forces a risky physical choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "air…tasted faintly of soot," "lantern swinging," "fingers scraping stone." The fresco, figurine, and mosaic are handled across multiple beats, reweighting meaning each time. The body and tools (lantern, notebook) anchor the protagonist's actions. The environment charges the final image when the protagonist chooses to remain underground, adding spatial cost to the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden is realized through layered sensory detail: "stone ridges into concentric ripples," "subsonic chords," "ground tremble like a heartbeat," and the auric lagoon's "pale gold waves" that translate sound into light. The micro-setting (the rail, the lagoon's surface) constrains the protagonist's drumming choice and charges the final image when the water mirrors the rhythm and the garden blurs into "rings of possibility." Spatial choreography is clean (narrator moves from the preapproved loops to the pillar to the railing to perching above the lagoon). The setting is not merely decorative; it supplies the mechanism (speakers, subsonic pulses, reflective water) that enables the entangled connection and the collective signal at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The container maze's steel corridors, ventilation shafts, and tactile details (dented blue wall, diesel smell) constrain Milo's whisper route and guide the inspectors' movement—environment shapes choice. Aurora, frozen cranes, and magnetic hiss establish storm pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear across corridors. The key pressed to metal and oiled vents function as micro-setting tools that charge the final proof.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt dock, bruised-glass canal water, and upstairs room with shutters anchor the space cleanly. Sensory detail is vivid—"gleamed like a buried memory," "trembling constellations," "slap of waves"—and reflects the guardian's patient attention. The dental mirror as micro-setting object constrains the dentist's final choice: he tilts it, sees light on the door, and that fragile beam becomes the catalyst for picking up the phone. The guardian's hand in the canal and the dock's wet boards provide tactile grounding. Cap at mid-7s because the broader occupational world (dentistry, canal operations) remains underdeveloped and the house interior is generic beyond the mirror and shutters.

    The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and fog-wrapped streets are filtered through Daniel's perceptual bias (unspoken words, chess geometry). The grotto's iron-veined stones and the synchronized window displays constrain the rebellion's method and charge the final image from the council balcony. Spatial choreography is clean across multiple sites (bakery c4, post office e5, library a7). The setting actively shapes the climactic choice: only from the balcony does the scattered forest cohere, making location a tactical necessity rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sublittoral fringe appears multiple times, shaping atmosphere and access (the skiff journey, seaweed as drowned banners, the breathing dark). The scrimshaw's polished island becomes a charged micro-object that draws Mara's gaze and structures the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Sensory work is vivid and POV-filtered ("purple light down into its throat," "pilings sweated cold"), though the harbor itself remains more textural backdrop than choice-constraint until the final passage.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Turbines as omnipresent surveillance ("sensors under its blades") and sonic oppression constrain the performer's method and charge the final yard departure. Micro-setting details (chipped mug, pine shavings, dried bouquet) recur functionally. The wooden hybrid's hollow center invites rest, shaping Mara's micro-choice to place it. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt atrium is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—"throat of stone, ribs of humming quartz colonnade curving toward a skylight the color of wet slate"—that structures Lio's progression from threshold to dais to free stride. The quartz's vibration in response to footsteps ("answering the pressure of footsteps with a music too subtle to be called a song") constrains silence and enables his speech, directly affecting the closure moment when "the colonnade catches it and spreads it through dissolving boundaries." The frozen lake recurs as perceptual anchor and metaphor, its "creaks and groans of shifting pressure" paralleling unvoiced confessions. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout, and the environment charges the final image of Lio moving freely among pillars.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The courtyard is established early with tactile detail (ash glowing in cobblestones, cooling glass, kiln-warm air) and recurs as the frame for the barter economy. The reed tongue and plant function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice: Mira places them on easel and sill, their presence shapes her painting process, and the plant's bloom at closure charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (bare feet on ash, mug of cooled tea, metallic sound in bones). The setting does not explicitly block a tactic, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and specific (cracked cylinders, jars of silent bird calls, coils of tape), filtered through Elya's professional attention. The miner's lamp lens actively constrains her choice to follow color rather than the clipboard score, directly charging the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clean (tower, stairwell door, rafters). Minor cap applied: while the bells and lens shape the final choice, the broader occupational systems (tuning protocols, grant metrics) remain atmospheric rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting constrains Ela's work: no clocks, long exposures, the central shaft apparatus, and the catwalk choreography are all purposeful. The origami birds "scattered the incoming starlight into strange halos that illuminate the scars of the observatory's metal" charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Ela's craft-oriented perception. Minor note: spatial transitions between workbench, coordinates, and catwalk could be slightly sharper, but micro-setting (jewelry tools, vellum, origami) compensates well.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight, dangling cables, scarred floorboards, and measuring tape create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The tape's placement "between two cracked tiles, aligning its zero with the north-facing window" grounds Mara's ritual in spatial specificity. The skylight's water-bead trajectories anchor the thematic claim about "analog time between the drips," and Jonas's kneeling near the tape at the thirty-three mark integrates setting into the confessional beat. The final image ("zero lay between them") charges the closure by literalizing shared origin in the room's geometry. One minor gap: the loft's emergency-power hum and obsolete machines are vivid but remain atmospheric rather than constraining a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archive and pagoda supply vivid, purposeful detail: "dust fell in slow spirals," "bronze prism pagoda," "tiny doors on each facet." The pagoda constrains Hiran's choice—its etched constellations "tugged at him"—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (threshold, innermost chamber, kneeling beside the pagoda) remains clear. The micro-setting (pagoda doors) functions as both constraint and catalyst, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for choice-shaping presence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with translucent petals and magnetic-tape dust creating textured layers. The river-stone bracelet functions as micro-setting, constraining Lio's attention (the chill, the shadow sensing the stones) and charging the final image when the shadow winds around it. The monitor and tape reel supply concrete staging for the pivotal beat. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and the shadow's pooling at Lio's feet, and the setting's layered archives directly enable the story's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The workshop under stars and Mara's wire sculpture provide spatial grounding; the vial as micro-object constrains the key choice (Liora must decide whether to keep or release it). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("fog seemed to hold them," "packed-earth floor"). The tail tip's physical presence—"pale and spiral, like a question mark"—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no setting detail is wasted.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tower setting constrains choice (isolated recovery space) and charges the final image (meteor hush sky). Micro-setting details—stiff blanket, metal tray, frosted hourglass—recur with shifting meaning. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional lens (scar imagery, incision language). The hourglass's frozen sand and glowing grains provide a tactile, visual anchor that shapes her epiphany. Minor gap: spatial choreography of bed-to-window distance could be tighter when she addresses the ivy.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The projection booth supplies concrete sensory anchors (dust, hot metal, flaking gilt, torn velvet) filtered through Mara's spatial imagination. The film strip functions as micro-setting: she touches it, it delivers visions, and its cooling in her hand marks the turn. Setting constrains the psychometry action and charges the final image when "the projector flickered on" autonomously, projecting fragments onto the booth wall rather than the main screen—this choice matters and elevates the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe constrain key choices: the instrument "clicked, a soft metallic consent" before the tunnel opens, and the archway stones provide spatial grounding for the final rest. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air that tasted of metal and cold flame"—and the body (shaking hands, skull pressure, back learning stones) functions as micro-setting. The astrolabe's transparency and dust scenes charge the closure image. Environment shapes the protagonist's trajectory and the ending posture.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glowing dune functions as both macro-setting and constraint: sparks rise "like seeds seeking gravity," requiring the guard to cup and place them in hidden corners. The chess clock (micro-setting/object) charges the final image when he presses his ear to it and hears "wave functions collapsing." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"warm sand," "tiny sparks floating up," "distant rail sings…possibility on silence"—filtered through the guard's vigilance. Minor slip: "rusted signal towers, gutted cars, tunnels" are listed but not used tactically in the action.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (brass leaves dripping oil, copper-filing soil, wind through steel) and constrains the protagonist's navigation choices—high whistles signal thin coils, low grinding marks heavy crowns. The body and the small gear function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. The pool of mercury and the lattice of branches structure the closure beat spatially, making the environment indispensable to the ending's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The harbor mist, cliff path, and ferry house on stilts are vivid and purposeful, and the stairway spiral constrains Mara's descent through memory-triggered steps. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency (lungs burning, mist-slick walkway, tar and salt scent) and the setting charges the closure image. The ridgeway functions as both physical and metaphorical pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the body-as-setting element (the star sinking into her chest) charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt fortress, revolving lobby, spiral staircase, and snow function as active setting elements that constrain and charge the narrative. The bolt "chillingly cold, etched with a tiny engraving of a spiral staircase" pulls the protagonist toward the forbidden descent. The bruise-purple discoloration on the staircase wall triggers embodied memory ("ice give way, stone rush upward, ribs bending"). The spatial choreography is clean: lobby → service corridor → spiral staircase → wall mark, with snow breaking in at closure. The fortress architecture (no doors, echoes, soundproofing) directly shapes the central conflict (silence as sentence). Minor deduction: "cobalt" and specific visual detail could be more causally leveraged in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library setting constrains every choice: dust-heavy light, worm-eaten scrolls, hairline cracks for rainwater, texts that "remember being read" all pressure the titan's tactics. The iron gall ink pellets and blackened cedar desk function as micro-setting, anchoring his ritual. Spatial choreography is clear (desk near the heart of the stacks, shelves he manipulates, the cracked oculus). The frozen constellations outside and the scholar's flickering form integrate time-stall into the sensory field. The library as a place where "time reached...only as an echo" and "days, years, and dynasties arrived...as mis-shelved volumes" directly charges the final image of the scholar encountering reordered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The monitoring station, intake grate, roof rail, and tide chart constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through professional attention: "pylons," "intake grate," "transparent tide table." The tapping on the rail and the station's "breath" anchor the protagonist's micro-choices. The vanished sandbar in the final beat is a direct product of the setting's bathymetric memory, making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors early with fuel drums, coolant hoses, engine casings, and hazard-striped stone circle; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The standing stones function as micro-setting that charges the closure: their hum rises "in attention," the vibration travels through Liora's feet, and she positions herself inside the ring to send her message—setting constrains stance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (barefoot contact with rust and dust, opera glasses clinking, distant atmospheric booms). The "margin of daylight" timeframe shapes the scene's texture (bruised gradient sky, shadows stretching) and the stones' buzzing presence elevates mundane repair-bay elements into resonant infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The volcanic hot springs setting supplies concrete sensory detail ("steam ladders curled up from the sulfur pools") and constrains the unsealing ritual to the bathhouse location. The kite snarled in the dead cedar functions as micro-setting that enables the decoding action. The slick stones and hissing springs charge the climactic gesture sequence. The setting's reconstruction scaffolds and shattered greenhouses visually anchor the theme of incomplete futures.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arboretum's glass roof condensation ping, the black rocks below, the numbered wristband, and the drone-forbidden airspace all constrain Mariam's choice of refuge and charge the final image. The absent lighthouse beam—plants leaning toward empty air—directly mirrors her body reaching for what's gone, and this motif returns at closure when "the absent lighthouse cast no beam, yet the path back...was clear." The fig leaf veins traced like henna hands and the sea lavender in concrete cracks provide micro-setting that tilts her stance. Spatial choreography (bench, docents in orchids, tram path) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse library is vivid and purposeful: narrow windows with "salt-stained" light, circular walls that seem to tilt, tide charts and philosophy tomes, the spiral descent. The tarot box and the unmarked volume constrain his choices—he rearranges cards, pairs them with memories, then descends. The setting supplies both resources (the book's margin note, the darkened stairwell) and pressure (walls closing in, the room tightening). The final image—oil drums and forgotten lenses at the base—charges his realization about painting possible selves. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Desert setting is vivid and purposeful: wind-carved encampment, bone-holes in tents, sand grains suspended mid-stampede. The Painted Table functions as micro-setting that constrains the demonstration and charges the final touch. Sensory detail is filtered through Iren's tracker perception (tracks, patterns, causes). The ink spill on the table supplies the physical substrate for his epiphany and final action, satisfying the constraint-on-choice gate for 9+ eligibility, though the encampment itself does not directly alter tactics beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subzero library with ice shafts and frozen dust creates a vivid constraint; the setting pressures Ana through isolation and the polite chime of her compliance interface. The fire slot and dormant network cables are concrete tools that shape her final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across vault, console, capsule, and central hub. The storm above functions as both atmosphere and metaphor without becoming overbearing, and its shift near the end charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glass dome, cracked from the shockwave, constrains the farm's neutral-ground status and charges the atmosphere throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the roses' colors and scents are tied to the engraved values, and the sandbag scrap anchors both past and present. Spatial choreography (terraces of roses, threshold, rows) is coherent. The dome's fractured starlight recurs at the closure and the environment subtly guides choice (raiders "hesitating at the door"). The setting functions as micro-setting and participates in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sound wave garden constrains movement (zigzag navigation, pitch bends by angle) and the rail spike's tactile history (rust-dark, cold iron remembering rails) charges the voicing-silence beat. The body under pressure is vivid: lungs ache, salt taste, searing shapes across inner sight. The frozen droplets "like notes on a staff" and the final "broken rhythms" tie setting to closure. Sensory hierarchy tilts toward auditory/tactile as befits the fisher's gift, and spatial choreography (bow, skiff advance, throat of the garden) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is vividly anchored (glass-limbed lighthouse, telescopes tilted toward human brightness, brass and dark wood console). The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting, constraining Elena's final choice by reminding her of her father's contradictory legacy. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the room's "long metallic sigh," heels clicking like gavels). The setting charges the closure image (observing down through clouds, presses thundering below) but spatial choreography during the phone call remains slightly abstract—we lose track of Elena's exact position mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The laboratory is vividly textured—tape machines, wax cylinders, server rack with firefly lights—and the amber piece constrains the narrator's stance ("so the firmware remembers it is not the only thing that can trap a life"), charging the final image when paired with the voicemail box. Sensory detail is filtered through the POV's grief-soaked attention (air tastes like "dusted vinyl and rain caught in microphones") and the meteors provide atmospheric pressure without becoming postcard. The micro-setting (mixing board, central console drawer) enables the climactic action. One slip: spatial choreography between the lab and upstairs room is cursory, and the "rooms above the lab" remain a placeholder rather than lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's mist, dripping ceiling, and whispering gallery tiles create a coherent atmosphere that pressures Lark's choices: the tiles "learned your secrets," the hush "tugging at her tongue," and the boy "staring…at the dripping ceiling" establish spatial and sensory anchors that drive the action. The tile flake functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice to draw in the sand. Selective detail supports the closure image without excess; the "lilac unease" modulates from opening dread to the "gentle, lilac unease" that charges her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The shattered sky, charred pillar, and mosaic stepping stone all constrain Laleh's ritual choices with concrete spatial logic. The tessera's heat and the stepping stone's alignment guide her actions, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (iron-and-rain smell, fractured sunlight, "warm coldness" of steel). Minor slip: the "colorless light" in the penultimate beat abstracts the climactic sensory moment when specificity would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard setting is vivid and selective: silver pears, dusk-colored plums, cracked fountain, trees in spirals. The hedge maze gate and Marcel's shifting costumes function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Synesthetic sensory hierarchy is consistent and POV-filtered ("citrus-green tang of possibility," "brown-violet musk of old fear"). The spatial choreography is clear across the maze approach and fountain convergence. Lina's tarot coin and the fountain lip provide concrete anchors that pressure the collaboration choice, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The light painting studio supplies fiber brushes, projector glow, and cool wall as tactile anchors; the geode sliver's mica facets and warmth recur across beats and flare sympathetically at the turn, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (Eli on floor, Naya cradling sliver, air "knitted and trembling" between fingers) remains clear and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cave network constrains Iri's descent through tidal exposure, mineral tang, temperature gradients, and the hidden pool's buoyancy—each detail filters through the sensor-map maker's professional lens. The elm leaf fossil and the still pool both charge the final image: the leaf's "forgotten sorrow" primes Iri's address to the unknown, and the pool's buoyancy enables the floating stance that crystallizes the dual-world mapping mission. Spatial choreography (descent, kneel, step into water, float) remains coherent throughout, and the "ribs of an ancient whale" ceiling subtly mirrors the spiral pattern's organic recursion.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber warehouse is vividly particular: "resinous panes that glowed like trapped sunsets," "dust floated like slow constellations," chalk marks and missing index books. Sensory selection (touch on resin pane, low murmur, air thickening) reflects urgency and filters through Mara's professional attention. The buttons function as micro-setting, constraining her search method and charging the final image when she pours them "like a tiny, clattering constellation." Spatial choreography (aisles, tiers, crate placement) tracks cleanly. Does not quite reach 9+ gate: while the warehouse pressures her search, the environment itself does not force a binary choice at closure; the jar's contents do that work.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fog that "swallowed sound," the abandoned weather station's "metal ribs...like the skeleton of some stranded mechanical whale," and the snow-code field all constrain and enable Elias's choices. The pillbox's tactile weight and the field's spatial choreography (slope, glinting point, kneeling) ground every beat. The final image—mist thinning, "silver hush ease into...approaching spring"—charges the closure by mirroring his internal thaw. Micro-setting (pillboxes, grass, film strip) functions as both constraint and emotional anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and selective: fog, lanternlight halos, the skiff nosing out "like an erasure," the village "like dark knuckles." The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, anchoring reflection and constraining the coachman's thought ("trace slow circles...meaning could gather"). The fog-bound crossing supplies both atmosphere and the constraint that shapes the coachman's ambient method. The final image—opposite bank as "blank page the night itself was quietly learning to read"—charges closure. Spatial choreography (skiff to bank to coach) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oasis setting constrains the potter's movement (circling the perimeter, kneeling on grit) and charges the final image through具体 details: cracked hives, dry well, hairline sprouts "phototropic to kindness." Sensory hierarchy reflects the potter's craft attention (shadows marking hours, grit grinding knees). The abandoned beekeeping infrastructure—hive frames, empty boxes—functions as micro-setting that the potter physically manipulates, and the sprouts' emergence at closure directly ties environment to the enacted choice. Body and tool (lantern glass, clay) ground the speculative premise in tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fire escape, harbor, and alley are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("blade of moonlight up the alley," "stairwell's throat"). The barge's swing and the resulting light physically cue Mara's realization, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is coherent across the narrow sill, pots, and railing. The old woman on the second floor provides brief environmental consequence. The harbor functions as both backdrop and symbolic anchor but does not directly constrain a choice at closure—Mara's decision to arrange the fragments is driven by internal realization rather than environmental pressure—keeping the score shy of the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal library "rose and fell with the moods of the sky," shelves drifting "like anchored ships," and the stone circle's hum are vivid and purposeful. The sundial's "atomically reflective" surface catches shifting scripts, charging the reflection scene. Spatial choreography is mostly clear—balcony, rotunda, catalog towers—though the "pit of mist" and "twelve standing pillars" could be more concretely anchored in Lio's movement. The setting constrains choice: the stone circle enables the reflection encounter, and the library's tidal adjustment at the end becomes the proof of Lio's new independence, satisfying the 9+ test for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lotus temple's wet stone, carved petals, and oculus constrain the protagonist's physical choices (sitting cross-legged, spreading fragments on damp floor) and the dripping rainwater—channeled, ticking into rings—becomes a recurring spatial rhythm that charges the closure moment when light "pours through the oculus in gentle sheets, turning the damp stone into a mirror." Sensory detail (lotus milk smell, boot circles in puddled dust, popcorn-scented ticket) is selective and POV-filtered. The scaffolds and cranes remain postcard elements; deeper integration into tactics would lift this higher, but the temple itself does meaningful work.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The transmitter tower, studio console, and auxiliary feed constrain Mara's tactics: she patches SUB BASS, toggles the subsonic generator, and the meters sync with the Void. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "neon ballast buzzing like distant surf," "dust rained down like gray snow." The tower's "subsonic insistence she felt in her teeth" charges the final image when the Void answers with a window-rattling swell. Spatial choreography (upstairs debate, studio below) remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon's compression, starlight lattice, and "obedient light" column all constrain navigation choices. The brass tube/pedestal and blueprint compass are handled objects that alter spatial access. The temple's impossible geometry—doorways nearer than shadows, three halls from one—directly pressures the explorer's claustrophobia and decision-making. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal angles. The staircase's "compressed midnight" charges the final image. Scope fits: environment drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quarry mist, gravel, and floodlight halos create a coherent sensory envelope filtered through Jonas's disordered face-sense (mist "turning...pale moons, their halos bleeding"). The ribbon fragment in the evidence bag is handled twice (initial viewing, then painted onto canvas) and its satin angle charges the final image by conferring "weary, stubborn dignity" on the victim. The folding table, easel, and Rhea's flashlight beam supply micro-setting that constrains Jonas's work in real time. Spatial choreography (quarry rim, stone slip) remains clear. Minor: the thirteen-year timeframe and the phrase "furrowed hush" recur but do not evolve with events.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    The station's oppressive atmosphere (walls sweating, bunk foam drinking moisture, concrete sweat) is visceral and recurring, directly constraining Liora's sleep and mood. The setting functions as both literal weather station and inherited punishment site, which charges the final image when she realizes "the platform was still a place of reversible exile." Sensory details are filtered through her map-librarian attention (puffed pages "like drowned lungs," instruments moaning). The copper nail as micro-object constrains and charges the closure. Minor: the "towers groaned like guilty masts" and "bruised lint" sky are evocative but edge toward decorative at moments; spatial choreography of the station itself (layout, rooms) remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain pullout, scaffold wrap, and violin itself function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the glass flake vibrates between bridge and fingerboard, the scaffold wrap's diagrams twist into "doors, or maybe exits," and the updraft carries dust that projects the glass images. The setting is filtered through the fiddler's professional lens (bridge-song, bow arm aching, bridge and fingerboard). Spatial choreography is clean: pullout overlooks chasm, headlights crawl below, truck approaches from behind, hitchhiker steps into halo. The glass flake's warmth ("like breath on a winter bridge rail") charges the final image when it shatters "into invisible dust against the bridge."

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The circus train setting is vivid and selective: rust flaking like "tired glitter," calliope wheeze, moth-eaten lion blanket, chalk sigils at door thresholds. These details accumulate to constrain the protagonist's psychology and charge the final image (the crate that once held costumed bears now holding currency). The train functions as micro-setting that mirrors and pressures the protagonist's cyclical path. Spatial choreography inside the ringmaster's car remains coherent across the visit.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory dome, telescope mechanics, transparent star chart, and daylily-pressed telegram function as tactile, purposeful details that constrain the investigation. The variable stars and their "patient insistence, like breathing written in light" create atmospheric specificity tied to the discovery process. The setting directly enables the decoding work and charges the final moment when pattern and healing converge, though the physical space could have pressured a choice more overtly to reach the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen lake, spectral orchard, and the ice as a "receptive, rippling stage" all constrain Arlen's approach—he cannot break the ice with force, only through patient druidic method. The seed pulsing beneath his hand charges the final image and provides the physical anchor for the conceptual turn. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (frost-stiff cloak, warlike breath, branches raking the underside of ice). The micro-setting of the ice surface and the orchard's spiral motion shape tactics throughout. Spatial choreography is clear across the shore-to-orchard descent.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt glade functions as more than backdrop: roots physically constrain the narrator (braided ankles, drawing blood), and the clipping responds to "eclipsed light," grounding the mystical in environmental logic. The glade deepens at dusk as the vision sequence unfolds, creating spatial-perceptual shift that supports the tonal arc. Micro-setting details—clay pot placed "like a puzzle piece," roots twitching "like nervous fingers"—are filtered through the narrator's rooted perspective. The maze topiary and scars as recurring objects charge the final image, making the glade's pressure tactile rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly particular: sour cherry roots trammeling skulls, basalt altar with silver-dusted channels leading into soil, candles throwing doubled shadows. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("air tasted like rust and pomegranates"), and the environment directly constrains the climactic choice—the altar as mouth, the orchard as throat. The recurring image of roots trammeling (skulls, then the brother's scarf) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the descent and ritual. Minor slip: "dusky resolve made visible" reads slightly abstract for this otherwise concrete setting.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry as "echo valley" functions thematically and texturally; the trailer's fluorescent buzz and wobbly card table ground Eli's isolation. The amp itself operates as micro-setting: the cabinet lip curve, speaker grille scrap, and transformer placement constrain recognition and charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective—cigarette burns, dust, gaffer-tape singe—and filtered through professional habit. The body (steadying table with knee, fingers recognizing curve) participates in discovery without forced choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly particular—"lattice of dark metal trees magnetized to nothing visible," oscillation that makes teeth ache—and constrains Mara's final choice by offering the "agreement" on its terms. The frozen wave functions as micro-setting, a spatial anchor where the seed is placed and the arbor responds. Sensory detail (pressure inside bones, trembling membrane) is filtered through Mara's scholarly attention and charges the closure image without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: water level dictates which shelves are accessible, the glass bones amplify the moon-phase fluctuation, and the submerged step becomes the stage for the smelting conversation. Sensory hierarchy reflects the librarian's archival priorities (marble, salt, moonlight thickening when the moon is missing). The creel—woven reeds darkened by currents, wet with salt and moonlight—is handled across multiple beats and its emptying/lightening charges the closure. The setting's physical logic (flooded arches, rising tide) remains consistent and the final image uses high water as a mirror for the identity exchange.

    The crystal caves anchor every choice: the mirrored facets create the "latent radiance," the limestone pedestal holds the pearl, the carved shelf stores the etched shells. Micro-setting details (the resonant hush, the nacre's glow) charge the final confession and closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear (natural tunnel → man-made chamber → pedestal → shelf → exit), and sensory selection reflects Mara's shift from inspector to confessor.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy, cracked jukebox, accordion slumped "like a drunk," bellows "patched with tape, silver scales holding together a lung that refused to quit") and constrains the protagonist's physical path and emotional access. Micro-setting qualifies: the accordion as recurring object charges the closure when the narrator presses a key and lets sound "scrape against the tiled ceiling," reweighting memory through tactile interaction. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (platform → waiting room → bathroom → platform). The bathroom graffiti functions as setting element that supplies the conceptual resource driving the final turn. Sensory selection reflects urgency and profession: the narrator notes "coordinates" and "map references" even in emotional extremis, which is character-specific filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glowing library in mist is vivid and purposeful: shelves that shift with silence delays, alcoves of empty chairs for unsaid invitations, parental reprimands that snap back "like a slammed door." The mist itself acts as both medium and constraint, beading on her lashes as she builds her mental diagram. The library's rule—silence returns at varied speeds—directly shapes her method and final choice, charging the closure image when ink fogs under the lantern book.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The velvet observatory is vividly rendered ("walls padded in deep violet velvet, swallowing echoes") and the environment constrains the protagonist's choices: the condensation-sweating plinth, the humidity that makes the violin hum, the garden outside that intensifies the telepathic volume. The coffee-and-saucer micro-setting charges the divination beat, and the violin's physical crack in the final image is causally linked to the humidity and the protagonist's refusal. Spatial choreography is clear (plinth center, window where Aurelio paces, brass table by service stair), and midsummer heat is embodied in the violin's melt-threat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, ice-rock slabs, and frost-laden mineral ribs create a vivid, purposeful environment that constrains Elara's movements and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (bone stairs, floating slabs, central fissure), and the emerald beam falling on Isren's body guides the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (lucidly watchful steps, breath vanishing, chiming glass veils), supporting the radiant-hush tone. The micro-setting—Isren's elevated slab beneath the fissure—directly shapes the closure, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The umbral grotto—ribbed like a scallop, light behaving "like water poured backward"—constrains the protagonist's choice to enter and charges the final image (planting in stone floor). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the climber's urgency: "vineyard hush," bark beneath nails, the hairpin's coolness. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and grotto interior. The grotto's micro-setting (smoke column, stone floor) directly enables the closure act, meeting the 9+ gate, though some descriptors ("cold, bright mist") are slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse interior (round room, spiral stairs, hundreds of chimes) is vivid and POV-filtered through professional idiom ("drafts cross," "tongues poised for guidance"). The dawn palette and salt-heavy wind recur to mark emotional shifts. The hollow mirror shard is handled twice and its "missing center" metaphor charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting pressures Mara's choice by isolating her with sensory reminders of the storm (surf, wind), but does not force a tactical constraint in the peak beat, capping this below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating platform tethered to magnetic field-lines constrains the demonstration and charges the final image; the grotto's resonance aligns the ripples with an unseen grid, making setting essential to method. The basin of water drawn upward, the sycamores leaning inward, and the abyss below create spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the stone, the basin, the platform's drift) all constrain Mora's trance and the lesson's unfolding. The grotto's "hidden pull" appears at closure, tugging at the hollow inside her—environment shapes the final stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bone towers function as micro-setting that constrains choice: their hum guides the protagonist's spinal alignment, and the echoes map spatial coordinates without movement. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—"each gust drew out a low chord," "flat slab," "layered dust"—and filtered through the skimmer's professional attention. The final image directly charges closure: "every echo a coordinate, every silence a path" converts setting into navigational tool. The canyon's physicality (vertebrae, ribs, hollow cages) is specific and irreplaceable, shaping both the skimming method and the protagonist's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound spire functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the unmapped stair, the observation ledge, the arches of ice that frame the final platform all guide Orren's path and charge the ending. The harness/rail regulation supplies a concrete constraint he violates, and the "brilliant dimness" of enchanted lamps recurs with purposeful modulation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "the air grew thinner," "delicate arches of ice that did not melt," "textured vapor threaded with quiet light." The spire's vertical structure—corridor, side stair, platform—remains spatially coherent. The clouds and cityglow provide distant pressure (the automated world below) that contrasts with the liminal space above.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken-ship library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (barnacled pilings, silt like slow snow, swollen wood, waterlogged books leaking radiance). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pier to ladder to water to hull to corridor. The library itself constrains the final choice: Elias must enter, find the book, and speak his vow inside this space, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting shape a key action. Micro-setting (the tag warming in his palm, the door carved "Vows") charges the closure image. No occupation or professional depth is needed here; the lamplighter role functions as atmospheric framing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ambered observatory deck, contracted universe, and "stars packed so closely that their light became a thick marmalade" create a vivid, purposeful sensory environment filtered through the protagonist's professional focus. The glass floor and console are micro-setting elements that constrain choices: coins cast on glass create visual constellations, and the tuning dials become the final tactile anchor. The contracting universe functions as both macro-setting and pressure mechanism, tightening around the characters' choices. One small miss: the cosmologists' exposition about the new burst feels slightly external to the POV's immediate sensory frame.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory's cracked lenses, scattered light, and dome constrain the ritual: light must scatter to coax fears forward, salt crystals form the geometry. The lantern "strictly refused to die" charges the final image of ongoing work. Sensory hierarchy is strong (grainy whispers, trembling constellations, inkish shapes). Minor slip: the cellar recordings are mentioned but not spatially integrated into the ritual's choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The viaduct functions as micro-setting: arches as "ribs holding up the sky," the plinth's iron bracket as "empty throat," and the sea filling the bell constrain Tamsin's ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects her magical focus (drip rates, barnacle dents) rather than tourist catalog. The bell's physical handling across beats (cradled, leaned toward the drop, water overflow) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting's folkloric claim ("bridge listened to tides...world's balance counted drop by drop") directly scaffolds the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridgeway, reservoir, exposed mud, and rising steeple constrain Tomas's path and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through his grief and vigilance: "boots sucking at wet ground," "sapphire hued even under the dull sky," "mirrored hush." The photographs scattered along the slope function as micro-setting, physically guiding his trajectory and reweighting memory. The steeple "peering from the water like a question" charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear across the slope, water, and ridgeway.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hidden orchard, waterfall veil, and mirrored pool constrain Elian's apparatus placement and supply the prismatic light needed for the transformation. The crystal, alembics, and lenses are handled across multiple beats, and the starlings' flight is spatially choreographed ("folding and unfurling like ink dropped into wind"). The final image—starlings as constellations against crystal flowers—charges the closure by inverting sky and orchard. Sensory selection is strong: "the very air tasting newly made" reflects heightened perception without catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal arbor setting constrains every choice: braided lightning scars as ladders, thin air affecting thought, windless heights where trust lives or dies, swaying branch-seat reminding of fall risk. The parachute buckle (body-object hybrid) recurs with shifting weight and meaning. Micro-setting exceptionally integrated: instruments, sensor threads, and the arbor's physical constraints shape the protagonist's recording tactics. The final descent past lightning scars charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The floating-rock dojo, glass tendrils, translucent sound-floor, and training blades all constrain the duel's choreography and charge the speculative atmosphere. The projected childhood bedroom provides a concrete anchor for the memory-strikes. However, spatial relations remain impressionistic—rocks "drift closer" without affecting tactics, and the environment never forces a micro-choice or alters an option on the page. The setting vivifies tone but does not reach the 9+ gate of constraining a choice or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel functions as crucible: it "catches the noise, macerates it against stone and moisture," transforming engine roar into bruised resonance that rattles spoons, trembles hairbrush, shivers the egg timer. Micro-setting details (nail holes, mouse runs, air vents) serve as conduits for the phantom laughter. The pull cord handle returns warm in Lysander's hand at closure, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (dust, mildew, cut grass and shampoo) and the rusting egg timer on the windowsill bookends the frame with concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen garden is grounded early with vivid, selective detail (hoarfrost, marble bench, paper-dust air) that reflects the narrator's interiority. The garden's transformation into thought-objects (bushes as clauses, fountain as question mark) directly enacts the "interiorizing exteriors" method and constrains the protagonist's perceptual stance. The pendant as micro-object charges the closure beat by enabling the narrator's threshold crossing, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember nexus functions as charged micro-setting: "braziers guttered in concentric rings," "cinder" that sinks underfoot, heat "pinning his skin." These details constrain his approach and charge the final act—the pyre's heat is a literal obstacle he crosses, the "stone rim" becomes the altar for his counter-ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (ash, metallic sigh, scents of spring rain and cloves at the climax). The wardens in the arcades provide spatial choreography and witness the shift. The setting participates in closure when "the ember nexus cooled a little, as if evening had stepped one inch back from night."

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gorge, suspended towers, and rusted platform constrain every choice: she must climb ladders, spread a blanket on steel slick with moonlight, and balance falling-city physics against valley safety. The shard of hush (a micro-setting object) charges the closure by dissolving on her tongue and aligning her heartbeat with the towers' stutter, enabling the final redirection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rust drifted into the black gorge like exhausted confetti" embodies the city's weariness without catalog-touring. The body-as-setting (tongue, chest vibrating, veins leaking stillness) directly enables the protagonist's tuning action at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ferry deck, bay fog, and spectral grotto are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("wet moonlight," "mapped glow of subway routes, nerve fibers, and constellations overlain"). The grotto constrains the final choice by offering a visible array of alternate crossings, directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the radio, rail, and deck positions track clearly. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Eli's focus narrows to the radio dial and the grotto ahead during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gallery functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: walls that "leaned but never fell" and shifting corridors respond to the protagonist's weaving, making space itself the medium of grief-work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("neon smoldered behind the buildings like embers pressed under glass"). The sinew thread as recurring object charges the final image by becoming the literal tether that holds the protagonist between options. Spatial choreography remains clear across impossible geometries.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The benthic city exerts continuous pressure: pressure domes hum, diamond-glass viewports frame alien spires, and the "plain of black manganese nodules" grounds abstract stakes in tactile geology. The chain link functions as micro-setting, handled twice (worn on a cord, pressed against glass) and charging the final image by framing a cosmos it "had never known." Spatial choreography is precise—column at the back of the hall, furthest viewport, kilometers of layered water—and sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (lights thin, spires hum below hearing). Environment constrains the choice to meet Mirror and supplies the viewport as the medium for edge-geometry revelation, essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    The hearing aid constrains multiple choices: its temperamental wheel must be learned nightly, it heats in Eren's palm as he climbs, it vibrates at the photograph. The mist-clad atrium and the riverside apartment's smells anchor space concretely. The photograph is handled twice and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Does not quite reach 9-band because environment pressures tactics but does not decisively alter the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The undersea facility is vividly realized through selective, pressure-driven detail: cables like "black roots," rust flakes in stairwells, observation window "starred by pressure fractures." Spatial choreography remains clear across descent, and the tidal equilibrium directly constrains the mission window, shaping tactics. The sphere's "almost negative" weight and the rig's visor-thread function as micro-setting elements that charge the final choice. The crashing hush recurs purposefully, modulating from external threat to internal echo, and the gold fleck guides navigation, transforming setting detail into causal infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    The opal observatory, snow, dome acoustics, and the porcelain shard all return with purpose. The spilled tea spreading across notes becomes the discovery vehicle, and the dome's creaking and light flares anchor the computational struggle. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains the final-night deadline and the ink patterns charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The towers of bone, tunnel walls (smooth/jagged), and the flawed diamond function as micro-setting that constrains and enables the protagonist's method. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the storyteller's tactile focus (pocks, ridges, faint carvings). The diamond's fractured light and the bone towers shedding powder both charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean and the canyon's physical properties (echoes, grooves, vibrations) directly affect the protagonist's work. This meets the 9+ test for environment shaping choice and closure, but purple phrasing ("pale lightning frozen in stone") occasionally ornaments rather than serves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The underground garden is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "bioluminescent moss...gravitationally playful spirals," "chamomile fog," "soil...pulsed with the slow heartbeat." The cordless phone and bone bowls become tactile anchors that constrain the narrator's understanding and charge the final revelation. The arrowhead at the archway ("dull triangle of flint...vibrated softly") provides a concrete constraint before entry. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the setting actively shapes the narrator's evolving comprehension of the metamorphosis phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky-bridge, rusted airships, gears shedding iron snow, and the orchard with living statues establish a vivid steampunk-fantasy hybrid. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric: "bronze faces expressionless, stone eyes flickering with emerald runes," "fountains spat steam instead of water." The locust shell and violin constrain the protagonist's tactile interaction at the turn. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the vertical layering (bridge above, orchard below, city beyond). The setting charges the final image when branches tangle with the sky-bridge and lift Lio, making the environment active in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt arcade at twilight is vividly rendered (fluorescent hum, cracked glass roof, shuttered stalls) and the "brittle hush" permeates sensory choices. The bottle itself—cloudy glass, violet swirls, rattling cork—recurs with tactile specificity and charges the final image when Mara lifts it beside the dusty letters. Spatial choreography is clean (narrow corridor, counter, wall of envelopes). The smuggling-drone border and checkpoints shape access without becoming expo-dumps, and the arcade's failing lights create the trade window that makes the scene possible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop setting pressures Eli's choice by offering the halo fragment and horses as tangible objects that respond to his song, constraining the stakes around repair versus creation. Sensory detail is purposeful: "misting hush," "whispering gleam," and wind bells anchor atmosphere while reflecting POV priorities (carpenter's eye for wood grain, joints, splinters knitting smooth). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout; the platform, beam, cage, and horses track clearly. The micro-setting (carousel platform, halo cage) charges the final image: tools and waiting horses embody the shift from salvage to building.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scientific poetry library is specific and purposeful: "Equations courted metaphors on the spines; volumes of tensor calculus leaned against slim collections of neutron haiku." Spatial choreography is clean (reference desk, stacks, junction of "fiction met fluid dynamics"), and the setting supplies the analog-memories premise. The tattered silk scarf functions as micro-setting/object, present in opening and closure beats, though its constraint on choice is light. The library's "fluorescent quiet" and "floral carpet" filter through Mariel's sensory priorities. Minor: the junction where the poet stops is labeled "unremarkable" yet serves as the conceptual center; a single concrete anchor (shelf label, lighting fixture, carpet seam) would have charged the final image more vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    The whispering archipelago, glass-shard palette, and camera are vividly particular and filter through Irena's professional lens. The palette fragments constrain her dawn ritual across multiple beats, and the highest cliff charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (dark mornings, shifting rock colors).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The viaduct functions as a charged threshold—"a hinge, a shadowed nexus under starlight"—and the first star's appearance constrains the locksmith's timing ("the hint has been given"). The river's "little broken roars" and the smell of rain from "somewhere past the map" anchor the scene in sensory detail filtered through the protagonist's anxious perception. The vial itself acts as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when uncorked. Spatial choreography is clear (edge of viaduct, river below, western hills). The setting actively shapes the moment of uncorking and the protagonist's disorientation, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken greenhouse with its glass ribs and fairy ring constrains the detection action and charges the final moment when the protagonist stays "until the tide crept back in." Shipwreck masts as "half-drowned sundials" and the silted floor where "apple roots once drank rain" anchor spatial choreography. The rising tide functions as both atmospheric pressure and literal clock. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: a folklorist reads mushroom patterns as maps, not decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library interior (dust, mirrors, shelves, porcelain cup, brass spoon) grounds the scene; the afternoon shadow caught in glass is evocative but functions more as atmosphere than constraint. Spatial choreography holds (central aisle, mirror wall, low table, stack where Jun hides). The micro-setting of the chipped cup and spoon charge the tea-leaf ritual, but the environment does not force a tactical choice—Rhea's actions would proceed identically in a plainer room. Misses the 9+ gate slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The verdant parapet beside the waterfall supplies both atmosphere and a literal threshold where "worlds fray and braid," grounding the climactic seed-planting moment. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's grief-turned-wonder: "scent of bruised leaves, wet rock, and something sweeter, like memory steeped in sunlight." The stone parapet's warmth and the mist's cooling breath anchor the metaphysical work in tactile experience, and the orchard's spatial choreography (rows, last row, stone rail) remains coherent. The setting charges the closure by providing the physical site where the seed absorbs the narrator's imagined city.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prism sanctuary is more than backdrop: starlight refracts through glass columns "like a held breath," and the stone floor holds the net, grounding the ritual spatially. The tapestry needle and net are handled across multiple beats, constraining Ilan's method (threading, teasing fibers, slipping through the star-knot). Micro-setting details—salt smell, moonlit dust, shadows thickening—modulate with pressure and charge the final image when the hush "carries a grounded stillness" that sinks "gratefully into the stone." Sensory selection reflects urgency: calm detail in setup, sharpened starlight and crowding shadows as the ritual intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault constrains perception (saints "almost erased," fragments on the floor the team avoids touching) and charges the final image by accumulating damage as a form of broken trust. The museum basement's "dust, raincoats, and magnetized tape" anchors sensory memory without catalogue bloat. The ancient henge appears vividly in the first reel but remains scenery; its stones do not constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is clean (viewing room, monitor, descent through sinkhole, vault) and the vault's evolving state across reels—more damaged in the second—alters what Elias reads in the woman's posture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken library is vividly particular—"letters detached and drifted upward like startled fish," snow globes tethered to a collapsed chandelier—and the decompression chamber's claustrophobic intimacy ("the cylinder lay between us like a found heartbeat") charges the decision beat. The wreck's spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Micro-setting (the cylinder, the globes) constrains the narrator's final choice, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, but the Earhart hangar at the end feels more symbolic than spatially active, preventing full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The misty courtyard is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("silver mist that caught every lantern-glow like trembling breath") and recurs purposefully—mist hums, exhales, rings with "tinkersong wonder" at closure. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice (drawn from satchel, fitted to screws) and its warming signals the encoding shift, constraining Lio's method. The wall itself acts as micro-setting, its cracks and circuits enabling the ghost's reply and charging the final transformation. Spatial choreography (courtyard above clouds, balustrade, wall) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound spire functions as constraint and atmosphere: frost traces "silver ferns," the corridor is "frosted in pale, patient blue," and the observatory's rotating prisms create the scattered light essential to decryption. The goggles—micro-setting as tool—charge the final method by resolving chaotic colors into script. Sensory detail is filtered through Etta's servant priorities: she notices "dusted around them," "scrub-water cracks," creating lived-in specificity. The spire's cold and isolation pressure her limited time and constrain her choices at the lock.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gondola functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: unmoored, it becomes both laboratory and memorial, enabling her to test her theory only because the cable broke. The brass telescope, cooling metal, and broken cable ring are handled tactilely and repeatedly. Sensory detail is purposeful—dusty starlight, greasy stratocumulus, sodium halo—filtered through Mara's professional and emotional priorities. The setting charges the final image: without the severed tether and drifting platform, her discovery of atmospheric memory cannot occur.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hollowed oak library is signaled early with fractal shelf structure and holds Mara's painted skies. The coin's faint indentations function as micro-setting that led to the book safe, and the narrow book of primed boards becomes the tool that constrains her final act. The boards' warping under layered paint is the physical limit that crystallizes her insight. The demolition crew idles outside, creating spatial pressure. Setting details (dust motes, ancient grain, lowest ring safe) filter through Mara's tactile navigation and professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting, constraining Lio's discovery method and charging the final image when it dictates the ship's course. Airship details (observation deck, storage bay, hull) ground spatial choreography without catalog excess. The starling murmurations operate as both atmosphere and functional pressure, their shifting patterns controlling light distribution. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's observational priorities: light variations dominate while sound remains muffled background texture.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen library is vividly specific: crystal vertebra, rimed windows, ice-skinned books, frost feathers. These details constrain the protagonist's movements (frost-filmed steps, borrowed breath) and charge the final image—the thaw is both sensory and conceptual. The hall of mirrors functions as micro-setting that alters each repair beat. Selective, purposeful detail throughout; the environment shapes every tactical choice from gear selection to mirror approach.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard planet's floating rock arches constrain movement throughout—safe routes painted with solar paint, spans that collapse, harnesses lashed to trunks—and the watering bell functions as both anchor and signal device, cracking under final pressure to pierce "stone and skin and whatever gauze separates the living from the organizing dead." Spatial choreography remains clear: low arch cradles butterfly garden, promenade hosts meetings, northern orchards drift toward nebula, survivors cross to the surviving span. Sensory detail is purposeful and varied: mineral ghosts clouding glass, violet gas river, sap and dust streaking faces, auroras caught in spiral etchings. The bell's crack charges the final image by marking the boundary between planning and survival, and the shattered state persists ("bell in shards") as a cost marker at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse interior—brine, dust, metal tang, shelves carved with symbols—is vivid and the clock itself (taller than a man, hands trembling) constrains the adjuster's ritual. The nested-pattern chambers function as micro-setting, each room holding a memory that the adjuster adjusts; this recursive spatial logic charges the final image when he "stepped back from the clock." The puppet head on the pedestal and the darkening sea in the closing beat tie setting to closure. Spatial choreography (pedestal, glass face, corridor of echoes) remains coherent. The dusk timeframe and mist anchor atmosphere without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard, cliff, mechanical birds, and nut function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: "roots knotted into stone," "frost here did not simply bite; it remembered," birds as counters whose circling drives travelers toward the narrator. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"sea grind," "salt air," "iron wings clicked," "wind smelled of iron and rot"—and filtered through the narrator's urgency and familiarity. The nut as object-setting charges the final image: it burns when the stranger names the blueprint. Spatial choreography is clean (orchard rows, cliff shoulder, terraces). The labyrinth itself remains offstage but pressures choices as threat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The braided ravine constrains her insight (foam lines thin at splits, tighten at merges) and charges the final image when she returns the chrysalis there. The research station, Leo's old bench, and the spectrometer anchor space. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Does not quite reach 8.5: the ravine's physical properties could press harder on her resin-design choices mid-story; here it mostly frames reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library with apple-book trees, invisible counter, ripening atlases, and translucent trunks creates a vivid, selective micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clear: woman appears between shelves, picks slate and bottle, sits on low branch. The branch cradles them, the slate sits back on it, and the orchard chimes at the catalog update—environment participates in closure. Sensory detail is filtered through the vendor's perception (glass leaves flashing "reflections of skies that had never existed"). The setting constrains choice: the woman must choose slate, bottle, branch; the vendor must honor the catalog's self-updating nature. One minor note: some details (bottled moonlight "cool and trembling") feel slightly ornamental, but the branch's return at closure charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The desert fortress, rain-darkened adobe, tidal pools on flagstones, and the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes all constrain Rafi's movements and choices: the pools guide his daily readings, the cracked tile marks the pavilion entrance, the frozen coral transmits emotional contagion on contact. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through his professional priorities (cumin, wet stone, the chime of crystallized shards). The pavilion's translucent tables and frost-cracked memory storage supply the story's central resource and hazard. The final courtyard image—pools shrinking under cleared clouds—mirrors the emotional arc's quiet resolution. Deduction: while vivid, the setting operates more as atmospheric scaffold than as a force that directly alters a peak choice; Rarfi's tactics (using tongs, sealing the shard) are cautious responses to a static environment rather than dynamic pressure.

    The astronomical clock tower, grain elevator, and cuckoo weight anchor the setting concretely and constrain action—Mara follows the weight's chain, volunteers clear choked chutes, the tower's gears power the rehabilitation. Spatial choreography is legible (tower ribs, western buttress, maintenance stairs, bins rising like organ pipes). The setting charges the final image: chutes opening "like throats" across the plaza unifies space and metaphor. Sensory detail is purposeful ("corn dust and locomotive breath," "mice and memory") and filtered through Mara's musical/architectural priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    The moonlit canyon is not mere backdrop: its bioluminescent moss pulses in sync with earthquakes, its geology mirrors Lio's project ("strata of time folded and faulted"), and its electromagnetic whisper cross-wires the neural filaments to dredge collective dreams. The periscope mirror, handled across multiple beats (salvaged, wired, triggered, adjusted toward his reflection), becomes both tool and charged object. The canyon's seismic jitters ease into a heartbeat as Lio accepts the memories, proving environment constrains and reflects the protagonist's internal shift. Sensory detail (moonlight funnel, trembling constellations, silver ivy) stays purposeful and POV-filtered throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Spatial choreography is vivid and coherent: the archivist glides through mist veils, pushes off rock, crosses thresholds marked by sensory cues (prickle, metallic taste). The grotto's "columns like frozen smoke," "shelves carved from basalt," and "chains of calcified ink" are purposeful and filtered through his professional gaze. The margin doodle unfolds into "corridors, spirals, tiny staircases," constraining his path and enabling discovery. Time pressure (the waning hour) forces urgency at the climax. The body and environment charge the final image when "dust began to rise" signals gravity's return, compelling him to close the codex and retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The siskin alder grove is established early and returns throughout: the tallest alder, porcelain insulator, copper wire, mossy roots, leaf mold, mushrooms, grass blades, and the hedgehog all contribute to spatial choreography. The copper wire threaded between trunks constrains Lio's final action—strumming requires the setup, and the grove's unified sway depends on the rooted network. The insulator as remnant of "electric speech" charges the final image by linking past sound to present motion. Sensory detail (chill of porcelain, trembling copper, leaf litter underfoot) is selective and tied to POV focus, avoiding catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and purposeful: iron veins guide arrival, stormlight hum affects teeth and hands, and the four basalt monoliths "drag thoughts into strange alignments," constraining Oren's perception and choice. The worry stone's dent aligns with a groove in the ground, anchoring micro-setting that charges the final image (the dent deepens, marking future cost). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (hum modulates into pulses, dust and twilight frame the ritual). Minor gap: spatial choreography of Oren's movements between monoliths could be more precise to reach high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop's "open roof hatch" and "bench" anchor spatial choreography; the microphones and console function as tools that constrain Elias's method. The timeframe (pre-fireworks stillness) creates urgency as sounds recede. The diary clasp as micro-setting object charges the final beat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("cotton," "friction of pages pressed tight by time"), filtered through Elias's priorities. Does not reach 9+ because the workshop itself does not impose a tactical choice—it provides atmosphere and tools but the core constraint is temporal (fireworks) rather than environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is anchored with specificity: rope bridges, platforms stitched by weathered intention, resin ghosts on branches, and sensory detail (old cedar smoke, crushed juniper, bitter root tea). The canopy functions as micro-setting that constrains movement ("feet knew the rhythm of each rope") and charges the final image (highest branch as planting site). Spatial choreography is clear across the climb. Minor slip: while the village setting shapes Liora's argument ("Up here we sway and shudder"), the marshes below remain abstract and do not constrain on-page tactics. No occupation-level depth is required at this length; the herbalist role informs perception without needing technical systems.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful: the inverted hour constrains Lio's flight window, the floating arches supply spatial landmarks, and the water's path guides navigation. The moss eruption ("fractal greens… force that accelerates plant growth") and the crown of pierced stones both constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects piloting priorities (wind, sap channels, touch on bark). The orchard terraces, skiff mechanics, and droplet-planets all anchor reader comprehension and drive micro-choices, satisfying the 9+ quick test for environment/object constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth constrains movement and perception throughout: "rows rising fifteen, twenty stories," "invisible vortices no blueprint could predict," and the investigator's paced survey that registers gusts tugging at clothing. The final image—"quiet after impact"—charges the setting with the grid's shutdown and the town's silence. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (vapor threads, trembling vane, drafts channeled by concrete). Spatial choreography is clean; the port's geometry drives the investigator's tactics. The setting is indispensable to the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ice cavern, amber sheet, and aurora constrain perception and charge the final image with cascading light and resonance. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through synesthetic POV ("a clear note rang green in his sight"). The amber sheet functions as micro-setting, handled twice and reweighted by light shifts. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout; the environment actively shapes the moment of release and the resulting storm of colors.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Thunder-echo Range is established through selective, purposeful detail: "avalanchingly quiet," "overlapping scales" of stone, the amphitheater that "folded and refolded" sound. The natural bowl constrains Cael's choice—he seeks a space that listens—and the wind through the flute's finger-holes becomes the catalyst for his realization. Spatial choreography is clean (descent along streambed into bowl). The setting charges the final image: his imperfect note "touching stone, sky, and the place behind his ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and press constrain the central action: the narrator cannot access transposed empathy without them. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"amber sheen, drinking in what little starlight remained"—and filtered through the narrator's urgency. The halo fragment's "pale fire" and "faint chorus" recur and charge the closure image when the narrator touches it and enters the geometry. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara at center, tables with type, the press, the fragment's position all track. The vanishing stars provide a live environmental constraint (timeframe) that tightens the window for this work.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridgeway, aurora colors, and snow provide vivid sensory grounding; the pendant's sympathetic vibration constrains the courier's perception and charges the final kneeling image. Micro-setting (body: knees soaking through trousers) anchors the closure physically. The aurora functions as more than backdrop—its "too bright" wrongness drives investigation and the pendant's response narrows options toward stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is purposeful and constrains choice: the quartz arbor sends the protagonist to town (directive function), and the frost on the sedan supplies the method of communion. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the mystic's lens ("bones the mountain had decided to wear outside its skin," "remembered temperatures of emotion"). The prism angled against glass charges the final image by refracting unnameable colors, and spatial choreography (uphill quarry, downhill town, post office, porches) remains clear. Environment does not constrain a peak choice as tightly as needed for 8.5+, but the quartz arbor and frost function as micro-settings that reweight the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard setting constrains Nari's solitude and the puzzle's assembly on "packed earth beside her loom" charges the final sequence. Spatial choreography is clean: bamboo, apples, lantern, loom positions track across moves. The tree sap amber bead recurs with purpose (lips → puzzle corner). Micro-setting (the loom, the puzzle on earth, frost on apples) shapes the tactile ritual of unweaving and feeds the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard planet's floating arches, calcifying orchards, and abandoned mines create a coherent pressure system that shapes Corren's choices: the arches' pull ripples into bedrock, forcing him underground; weightless shards "hum against his skin" and enable the final reshaping. The cobalt pears anchor tone and return at closure ("carrying that azure defiance"), and the magician's silk functions as both tool and setting constraint. Spatial choreography is clean (forge → groves → mining district → collapsed gallery → back to orchards). Minor gap: the "mining district...ringed by warning sigils" is described but never constrains a choice; it remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair bay is anchored early with vivid detail (flaking hazard stripes, ozone tang, cracked deck) and the green shard charges the final image by serving as the tool Lio uses to "redirect that momentum." Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's mapper perception (currents of sound, heat, memory). The bay itself remains static scenery; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics, keeping it below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lantern room is rendered through vivid sensory fragments: "curved panes held the sea in fragments, black water and white foam slicing around him like shattered film." The sea glass and stone spiral function as micro-setting objects that constrain his choices—he handles the glass, rearranges stones, and angles the glass to cast a halo. The haunted reputation and the extinguished lamp pressure his actions. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the climb and lantern-room moves. The setting charges the final image when he scuffs the spiral "so the message would mean safe."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald lighthouse under stars constrains the final choice—its glass throat, lenses salvaged from observatories and server farms, and the beam that "folded, ricocheting inside" all enable Orrin's ability to steer. The glass lantern wick (silicon and sand) catches "ghost-light" and stores oaths in refractions, directly shaping closure. Micro-setting (the beam wrapping him, the open hatch) charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Orrin's professional lens (data-spun oil, total internal reflection, sigils in storm charts). The drowned harbor town and repositioning stars create atmospheric pressure without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating tea house, braided prayers, valley mist, and cliff-edge ledge create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting filtered through the dye master's professional eye ("watching colors steep"). The blue morpho wing functions as a charged object that constrains the final turn: holding it up through dusk light becomes the vehicle for the protagonist's insight, and its "delicate weight" tilts the tea house, making the environment respond to thematic pressure. Sensory details are selective and voice-appropriate, avoiding catalog; the setting subtly guides the protagonist's perception and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop potted trees, storm, moonlight, and tower observatory constrain Milo's choices throughout—he waters them from cleaning cisterns, climbs the hidden stair during the storm, and uses moonlight to heal the sextant. The sextant itself functions as tool-setting, its cracked arc and faint heat grounding the magical logic in tactile detail. The setting charges the final image: "rooftop washed and humming" anchors the closure beat. Spatial choreography is clean (Corridor Theta → service stair → rooftop) and sensory detail (condensation tick, wind tearing coat) is purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly realized: black mica scales, glass roots chiming beneath soil, pear trees with ashen sunset skins. The mica window at the heart constrains Mara's final action—she must touch the shard to it to send the song. The micro-setting (satchel, shard, window) charges the closure image when the window brightens and memories fly. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's memory-keeper perspective. No occupation-level systems required at this length; the setting earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret library's curved shelves "like question marks," fluorescent hum, municipal grout, and "footsteps that did not touch the ground" establish spatial and tonal anchors. The crumpled invitation in the cardigan pocket, the janitor's key "only he cared enough to polish," and the gray volume on the shelf are tactile and purposeful. The library's air "thicker, as if expecting company" modulates with the arrival of Mara. Gate met: the library constrains Elias's nightly choice and charges the ending when he "began at last to stay" inside rather than exile himself. The "nestled paradoxes orbiting older, unnamed suns" veers toward ornamental register but remains within the piece's lyric idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "glassless arches," "bamboo screens," "feral camellias root in broken pots," beans and chicory among thorns. The setting constrains choice (the tea house "only open now, in the thinning light, when regular customers have forgotten it exists") and the courtyard's "overgrown map of what once passed for order" mirrors Elias's internal state. The bread, kettle, and tea function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure: sharing the bread in this neglected, tended space makes the act of witnessing tangible. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting serves as more than backdrop; it embodies the theme of noticing neglect and transforming it into soil.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen library's quartz hush, hoarfrost-furred dome, and calibration cuffs constrain Serin's approach and charge the final image of graphs stabilizing. Sensory hierarchy reflects his archival focus: frost crescents on drawers, conductive prickle, trembling glyphs on the ceiling. The vault's elevation and fragility (unraveling protocols, thinning clouds) pressure every choice. Micro-setting qualifies: the cuffs route readings through his nerves, the pedestal holds the ledger and instruments, and the crystal dome frames the slide's convulsive shimmer at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pirate market setting is vivid and purposeful: "lantern dim, stalls folded out of shadows," "teeth that remembered every bite," "planks went soft underfoot." The rotting pier functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the atmosphere. Sensory detail is filtered through Loretta's POV—her moonshiner's eye for "where people hid what they were not ready to lose"—and the final image of "gentle rot" directly charges closure. The watch fob as recurring object reweights meaning from mysterious artifact to repository of painful truth.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, spiral-grass patch, and voting trees create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The spiraling grass marks the convergent meeting point, and the aurora's dimming brackets the encounter temporally. The tin compass ring functions as a body-tool hybrid that constrains navigation (pull on tongue, melting into skin). Sensory hierarchy is strong: taste dominates (rust, burnt sugar, ozone, salt, old paper), filtered through the skeptic's bioluminescent POV. The setting charges the final image (twilight, four bodies on the bluff) and the trees' voting provides atmospheric pressure without dictating choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean crystal cave constrains movement ("narrow path," "domed chamber") and its auroral reflections become a motif that charges the final line ("crystals pale with morningless, auroral sorrow"). Concrete sensory details—"limestone," "lantern light," "damp stone"—anchor Elias's descent and are filtered through his artist's eye ("frozen fireworks," "shy, auroral colors"). The cave's physical niche ("carved with shaking hands") enables the core action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and the sitting vigil. The micro-setting (paper on knees, crystals reflecting twin lanterns where her irises should be) integrates choice and atmosphere without postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse city's toxic sky, hydroponic streets, and condensation banks are filtered through Lio's craft-specific lens (gold leaf, living vines). The zinc plate fragment and map shreds constrain his choices—he must piece together the map to locate the observatory—and the corroded seal at the observatory gate responds to the postal authority, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across the studio, corridors, and observatory. Sensory detail (humidity, rust, stale ink) modulates with urgency. The micro-setting (worktable, floorboards, map) and the macro (sealed city, abandoned observatory) both shape tactics and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering bluff is anchored vividly early and constrains Lio's work—altitude, wind, and stone all shape the kinetic sculpture's voice. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting at the climax, its impossible blues and greens charging the final image and altering the sculpture's chord. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "frost steamed from her arms," "thin ice forming behind his teeth," "stone ribs humming." The bluff leans in twice, anthropomorphized but consistently, and the cities below provide spatial hierarchy without cluttering choreography. The cradle of weathered silver and the breach in clouds supply concrete constraints that enable the climactic sound.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dome setting constrains choices throughout: irrigation lines anchor his walking ritual, glass ribs tremble under magnetic stress, geometric soil seams enable the controlled burn. The desert roses respond tactilely to the burn—"sap thickening, spines brightening"—and their sacrifice mirrors his internal clearing. Micro-setting (the crate, the climate partition, the dried trenches) functions as architecture for the closure action. Sensory hierarchy reflects android perception: "hot minerals and faint resin," "musical stress," "wavering heat." The glass-dome enclosure charges the final image: containment becomes survival method rather than trap.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: bougainvillea "like open veins," laundry, coffee hissing, obsolete brass mailboxes "like a forgotten organ." These elements ground the setting and constrain action—the sealed mailbox is spatially present and charges the final image. The dawn timeframe recurs as a structural anchor. However, the ending pivots to city clerk confirmation and developer retreat, which occur off-stage and lack spatial grounding, slightly weakening the closure's environmental charge.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken laboratory setting drives choices throughout: "pipes creaked like old throats," water lapping at calves, the hangman's dice in their rusted box, journals drifting in a wire cage. The environment supplies concrete resources (the dice as map, the servers, the journals) and pressures the protagonist's movement and discovery. The final image of the lab as "a heart choosing, in calm defiance, to keep beating unseen" charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (graphite and salt smell "slammed me back into her orbit") and the body is present in boots stirring silt, reading aloud to dice rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The salt crystal chamber—glass trays, pulsing crystals, mineral air—constrains the final exhumation attempt and charges the closure image when grounds cling to crystal edges and air thickens above spirals. Micro-setting (the father's cup, pressed wildflowers, coffee scent against mineral sting) layers texture without postcard excess. Spatial choreography is clean across warehouse and harbor. The whale as environmental anchor pressures the town's avoidance and the narrator's investigative stance. Sensory selection is purposeful: "gleaming silence," "slow souring," "bitter smell at odds with the clean sting of mineral air." The choice to pour coffee onto salt is motivated by proximity and the father's habit, making the setting indispensable to the method.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The brook, reeds, fireflies, and stone anchor space and sensory hierarchy; the crane's wing and flat stone constrain the ritual action concretely. The valley's pre-existing "half remembered silence" motivates Ilen's site choice and charges the final image when "the night relaxed." Spatial choreography is clean (grass, water, stone). The micro-setting (body, crane, stone) functions as setting here and constrains choice, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: occupational mechanics of summoning remain slightly abstract, though the textures are vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting details are purposeful and filtered through the narrator's attention: "Yellow lamps should not flicker sea-green" signals wrongness immediately, and the rooftop garden constrains the climax by providing the wooden decking for the seal impression. The meteor shower functions as both atmosphere and catalyst—"the sky was busy writing drafts"—and the antique desk seal becomes a key that unlocks the building's voice. Spatial choreography (neighbor's door → fire escape → rooftop) tracks cleanly across moves. The recurring use of the seal to press against decking and produce "a circle of air that rang like a bell" charges the final image with both sensory specificity and functional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet garden is richly anchored with sensory specificity (gray moths, black roses, salt-laced hush, blue glass lantern) and its atmosphere of archived sorrows pressures Neris's choice to return nightly and finally to engage with the caretaker. The stone bench and seashell half function as micro-setting elements that constrain the pivotal moment. The timeframe "when the last star fades into morning light" charges the final image with the garden's shift from eerie sanctuary to working archive, and the cobalt sky transition marks the cost of the night's work.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The marble sanctuary, stalactite drip, and aurora provide sensory grounding and constrain the scene's urgency (the dripping marks time, the sanctuary's isolation enables secrecy). Pearl twilight and auroral shimmer modulate with emotional beats. The heritage rose thorn and the key function as tactile micro-setting elements that charge the final choice. Spatial choreography (lectern, columns, obsidian floor) remains clear. The environment's "wisely enduring" quality mirrors Irian's decision to accept the unfinished, tying setting to theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The canyon is vividly rendered through sound and pressure ("the canyon became a throat and she stood upon its tongue"), and the shell functions as micro-setting that anchors memory and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clear (rim, depths, distant campfires). Minus: the "serpentine nexus" and caravan detail in the opening feel ornamental—merchants and spies are named but never constrain Liora's choice or reappear, and the nexus itself does not materially shape her actions at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with candles, ice-walls, and "borrowed starlight," and the melted snow globe functions as a charged object at the altar. The setting recurs at closure when "the glacier creaked and the candles flared," modulating tone with the woman's tears. Spatial anchoring is clean throughout. The snow globe constrains Marek's ritual (he touches it before each session), meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting, but the glacier itself does not visibly limit or enable a tactical choice, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The whispering parapet functions as micro-setting that constrains the lesson and charges the final image; the rivulets, puddle, and slick stone are used tactilely (Ren dips the whisk, droplets fall). Sensory detail is vivid and selective (fireflies, moon paths on water, wet stone) and filtered through the narrator's urgency. The bamboo whisk and puddle directly enable the droplet demonstration, a choice-shaping prop use. The closing constellations of fireflies reprise the opening lanterns and lift the final beat without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The radioactive orchard is vivid and pressures every choice: respirator mask, glowing dust under UV lamp, fruit with geometric scars. The chain fused to the trunk and the diamond buried in roots constrain Theo's discovery tactically. The "crushed, fractured halo" image charges the final beat, making the stillpoint tangible. Sensory hierarchy is professional (UV lamp, spade strike "rang like glass but felt like ice"), though "murky light" is slightly generic for this precise POV.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stormlit observatory setting constrains choice throughout: condensation mopping establishes routine care, the cobalt portico becomes the stage for the climactic test, and storm imagery pressures every beat. The floating teacup simile and "bruised purples and feverous greens" clouds are vivid and POV-filtered. The portico functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—he must stand beneath it as rain lashes the panels—making removal of this exact setting impossible without collapsing the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The loft's physicality (broken ribs, cracked slats, carved boards) establishes decay and impermanence that mirror the poet's transience. The dunes supply the music box and guide the woman's climb, grounding coincidence in spatial logic. The glass jars function as micro-setting: their presence constrains the poet's material economy and enables the climactic gift. Dawn's timeframe tightens the decision (waking courage, morning's worth) and the loft's skeletal decay charges the poet's memory of lost children, feeding his motivation. The setting does not supply a blocking constraint at the peak choice, holding it below 8.0, but sensory selection (sand, rust, lavender, wind) filters through the poet's priorities and the final step toward town uses spatial descent as metaphor without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drift-ice marina, lighthouse chamber, and crypt are vividly rendered with selective detail filtered through Elias's engineer priorities: "metal bones," "stone chamber yawned like a core sample of night." The crypt keeper's key—a recurring object—constrains choice (its tuned teeth are necessary to the binding ritual) and charges the closure image ("two beings sharing the same exhausted, forgiven breath"). Spatial choreography is clean; the sunset's gold-to-iron gradient operates as a live clock. The "fleeting golden sunset" and ice pressure shape the urgency, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("basalt and cold smoke," "dark water below, slowly twisting"). The viaduct basin's frost-etched maps and the current through the protagonist's hands become micro-setting that enables the closure revelation. Spatial choreography remains clean across all moves, and the restrained wildness of wind acts as atmospheric pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered through selective detail (slick tracks, pinging rails, dripping ceiling, wet concrete walls) and directly constrains the investigator's perception and choices. The lantern's flame "brightening when we passed certain maintenance alcoves, dimming near others" makes environment an active agent. Post-drought wetness affects acoustics and echoes, charging the atmosphere. The micro-setting (body, rails, alcoves) shapes the apparition sequence and final stance, meeting the 9+ gate test for environmental constraint on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shop's layered ticking and glass-covered gears create a coherent atmosphere that mirrors Elias's internal pressure. The clockwork heart as micro-setting object constrains the conversation and charges the final image when it beats "steadier, not flawless, but undeniably alive." Spatial choreography (counter, velvet pad, lamp angle) tracks cleanly. Minor gap: the street/rain/window details in the opening do not return or constrain later choices, slightly reducing integration density.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop floating on acid sea, the kaleidoscope's ozone-and-regret smell, and the arrow tip's concentric ripples all constrain or enable Orin's choices. The kaleidoscope functions as micro-setting: Orin must "transliterate the human mess of wanting into mechanical grammar" through its shifting images, and this interface shapes his final ascent. The acid mist clawing his cheeks during launch and the "bruise-colored wound in the sky" charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (workshop hull, cart mount, sky corridor) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive setting ("humming cathedral," "chilled racks," Deep Cold vault) is vivid and the recurring 713 numbers constrain the narrator's investigative tactics. The patch object returns with reweighted meaning at the decision point, charging the final choice. Micro-setting qualifies: the interface, the query system, and the "sliver" gateway all shape on-page action. However, the "buried subnet" revelation lacks spatial grounding—we don't see or sense what that space feels like, only learn of its existence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard's fog-rings, swinging lanterns, and grinding ice provide vivid sensory anchors. The vintage-store mirrors inside the lighthouse constrain Ira's method at closure—he holds the fragment "up to the vintage store mirrors, letting each reflection catch and alter the light"—which charges the final image. Spatial choreography (stairwell widening, counter, leaning mirrors) remains clear. The ice and orchard pressure the geopolitical stakes but do not directly constrain an on-page choice until the mirror method at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drift-ice marina is not postcard but pressure: "shattered porcelain," "ragged teeth of ice," the motor "coughing like a long-time smoker." The parasol tip functions as micro-setting (tuning fork, tactile anchor) and charges the final image when touched to water. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, bunk, shoreline, boat three). The storm-damaged village supplies the taxonomy task (repairable/recyclable/irretrievable) that mirrors the protagonist's choice. One small slip: the heirloom's survival from "the fire that followed" the truck accident is slightly muddled (was the grandmother in the truck? separate fire?), but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber pavilion, vacant station, and vineyard rows anchor place and filter perception through Tomas's seasonal rhythms ("prunes by day," "tends by night"). The burnt letter and bench constrain the encounter spatially; the woman's tipped-open suitcase and thin coat register cold and urgency. Sensory detail is selective (thyme, perfume, soot, creaking boots) and the setting shapes the conversation's intimacy. The environment does not directly constrain a peak choice—Tomas could deliver the same parallels anywhere—but the station's vacancy and autumn chill modulate tone and make the exchange feel anchored rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    The pavilion's "silken walls" and "conjured clearings" create spatial zones that guide the prophet's interactions, and the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes supplies tactile pressure (grinding, shuddering, exhaling) that tracks emotional stakes. The cable—invisible to all but the line walker—functions as embodied setting, his balance registering the city's truthfulness. The dunes and distant camels offer sensory grounding. However, the "whisperfield calm" and "murmuring" remain largely atmospheric labels rather than concrete sensory anchors that constrain a specific choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lavender field constrains choice (guides the path, hosts the table) and charges the final image ("lavender field murmured approval"). Micro-setting details are purposeful: folding chairs and rickety table anchor the makeshift archive, rusted chimneys frame dereliction, and oil under fingernails plus cartoon stickers on the lunchbox filter through the protagonist's observational bias. Spatial choreography remains clean across moves. Minor cap: the factory ruins function more as backdrop than active constraint in the middle beats, though the lavender recurs with escalating function.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library is grounded early with concrete anchors: "high, grimy windows," "iron ladder," "contraband notebooks," "chandelier whose candles had long ago been replaced by humming glass orbs." The cracked crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's method (he must touch it to replay voices) and charging the final image when "the suspended hush followed, clinging to his clothes." Sensory details—dust spirals, echoing sigh, crystal's fracture—filter through Elias's scholarly bias and shape his climactic choice to speak in fractured sequences rather than ordered arguments.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fog sculpture garden functions as micro-setting that constrains the search and charges the final convergence: statues "dissolving and reforming," the "unmade bed" sculpture at the driftwood markers' center. The seawall chapel built from refrigerators and cassette players anchors the prophet's world with specificity. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the walk into fog, and the tide as "collaborator rather than enemy" subtly mirrors the prophet's stance. The garden's ephemeral structure directly shapes the narrator and Mara's discovery, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lunar observatory, regolith tremor, and shielded dome provide concrete environmental constraints that shape Ilias's choices: the quake threatens alignment, forcing him to override damping filters and work by sound and touch. Micro-setting (Camera Three housing, console handrails, clock hand in glass cage) functions effectively. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: micrometeorites ticking, attenuators sighing, static crackle. The setting charges the final image: "held the configuration steady through the last aftershock" directly ties environment to closure. Spatial choreography is clean (console to console, staff on handrails, array above).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cloudy radiant haven above the city ("the ward felt like a radiant haven above the clouds") functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image: the separation from the world below reinforces the liminal goodbye. The cologne bottle, uncapped, constrains the scent-moment choice and threads sensory particularity (citrus and pine) through antiseptic. The vinyl fragment as tactile object (jagged, faded label, "compact moon") recurs with reweighted meaning when Mr. Alvarez recognizes it and Mira tells him "let it be the part that does not have to be fixed." Spatial choreography is clean (bed, tray by window, guitar on knee). The room "drawing in around his bed like a circle closing" charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating-isle observatory is anchored early and constrains choice: Lysa climbs the spiral stair, the brass table holds the key socket, the dome opens to stars. The seven mirrored spoons—salvaged from the kitchen madness—are handled twice (laid out, then straightening to point inward) and charge the closure by showing shadows crawling from their reflections. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "hot metal and rain that had not yet fallen," "worn stone memorized." The observatory's nocturnal purpose (watching "what the sun erased") directly supports her investigation of noon shadows. Minor: spatial choreography of the lower hall automaton and the central table could be slightly tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hedge maze and secret garden constrain Mara's access to knowledge (only she and Tomas know the map) and charge the final image: tools, glass instruments, and the breathing tin box ground Tomas's project in tactile detail. The boy's "bones wrong from this world's angle" and the violet sky provide sensory specificity that reflects urgency and otherworldliness. The garden "folding behind me like a closed book" and "dawn snagging on the hedge" are purposeful images that integrate setting into closure. Spatial choreography is clean across moves (table → maze → garden → stone under violet sky → back to garden).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto functions as micro-setting: "walls slick and dark, breathing out ocean hush" and "mist folding like petals" constrain the ritual and charge the final image when refugees wait "where the mist hangs thickest." The polishing stone and basin anchor tactile action. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: during memory the air is "tender sharpness that tugs loose a forgotten hour"; at closure, collective glow "press[es] faintly against my ribs." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: sagging plastic conduit, cracked floor tiles glowing with moss, skylights carved into the ceiling, rusty bolts rising "like broken teeth." The setting constrains Mara's movement (she follows green islands like stepping stones) and supplies the central resource (the moss garden trays) that enables the final collaborative act. The pendant functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when its amber glow catches "remnants of server light and afternoon sun," and spatial choreography remains clear throughout (doorway, gutted racks, center trays, bare patch beside the largest frame).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fogbound riverfront and backward-flowing reflections create vivid atmosphere and serve the lyric design. The seashell fragment functions as a micro-setting object, enabling the visions that pressure the novelist's stance. Spatial choreography (desk → streets → pier) is legible. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice at closure; the novelist's acceptance occurs in reflection rather than through a tool, body, or environmental friction that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The arbor is vividly rendered: leaves beaded with silver fog, paths furred with moss, vine tendril curling like a curious finger. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the tinkerer's attentive stance. The copper bowl, reed flutes, and book of layered leaves function as micro-setting tools that constrain his method. The arbor's spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and the environment (tree, roots, soil) directly enables the closure action when phrases are poured into the soil and the tree responds.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard's "thin, colorless ribs" of snow, "exhausted metronomes" of trees, and crater geography anchor early and persist. Micro-setting shines: the metal case, vials, and twig-continents constrain his work method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("ash-soft cloth," "hiss like paper catching flame but never burning"). The final act of pressing the map beneath the illustration plate shows the environment—twigs, snow, bark—charging the closure image by becoming the map itself. Spatial choreography (kneeling, laying arcs between trunks, guiding droplets) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The marble cavern, spiral stairs, mineral veins, and the timer as tool are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (moist air, tang of iron, lantern light fracturing). The mirrors and chalk lines ground the locksmith's process in spatial choreography. The cavern subtly charges the final image: "the silence felt crowded, softly luminous." Micro-setting (the timer mechanism, mirrors, polished floor) constrains the locksmith's method and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bronze grotto is not mere backdrop—it holds burdens in "shingled hush," pressing close as a spatial constraint that the protagonist must navigate by orienting properly. The kerosene lamp burner with whalebone ribs functions as a tool that shapes action: flame "climbed into patterns, fractal loops that beckoned the burdens inward." Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's craft-specific perception (bronze "shone like old coins, damp and bruised"). The grotto's bronze bones and the basin's starlight reflection charge the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure. Micro-setting and recurring object (lamp, basin, bronze walls) all constrain choices and elevate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as recurring micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the closure: steam clouds the glass, softening memory, and the rain whispers as crowd noise fading. The loft's spatial details (hot plate, table, rafters) ground choices without catalog excess. The ash blank itself operates as object-as-setting, its grain and weight shaping Mara's tactile engagement. The final beat's dual frame—trucks disappearing outside, knife opening wood inside—uses setting to articulate the stakes with economy and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The kinetic lagoon is not mere backdrop—it supplies the camera wheel, dictates the rowing approach, and its mirrored gears/machine-made tide charge every choice. The disposable camera wheel functions as micro-setting: its plastic teeth and fogged negatives materialize eroded ambitions and enable the ghost's response. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (mirrored surfaces, steam-clockwork seagulls, muffled calliope) and filtered through the protagonist's scavenging lens. The lagoon's fractured stillness directly shapes the final beat: "the lagoon echoes the motion with a slow, reluctant ripple." Spatial choreography (shore → skiff → center) is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spaceport's sensory detail is vivid and selective: "ribs and bones," cracked skylights, dust films, candy wrappers. Spatial choreography is coherent (concourse, checkpoint, maintenance closet, atrium). The sextant's arc "matching almost perfectly the arc of a proposed distribution main" charges the final moment and constrains her choice to honor existing infrastructure. Micro-setting (pipes, planters, manual) alters tactics. Strong integration of body, tool, and recurring object.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sanctuary's "glacial hush" and the crystal forecourt constrain Elias's choices: the silence enforces the no-tools rule, the rain-wet stones mirror his mood, and the exposed gears become the physical locus of his decision. The body anchors the scene through tactile detail ("two fingers, excruciatingly gentle," "the scent of rain regarded him"), and the forecourt's tessellated glass reappears at closure to charge the final image with "tiny transparent metronomes." Sensory hierarchy reflects POV: he notices mechanical sounds, the weight of ink, the "specks of long-set grime," all filtered through a clockmaker's lens. The setting is not merely backdrop; it pressures the central choice and supplies the physicality that makes the ending resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting constrains choice throughout: the canal's narrowing at Lock Eleven, the torn hull as entry point, and the cold water as tactile barrier all pressure the dive. The sundial and rope function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the gnomon catches lantern light, insisting direction still matters. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—wet iron, algae-slick paper, barnacled metal. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the dive and surface confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and lantern create consistent atmospheric pressure. The fulgurite glass constrains Eli's perception, acting as a lens that illuminates rope patterns, thus affecting his interpretive choices. The harbor's "oceanic hush" and fog rolling thick modulate sensory hierarchy, narrowing focus as Eli slips deeper into the rope's language. Spatial choreography (dock end, mooring post, lantern, rope coil) tracks cleanly. The final image charges the dock-under-snow with thematic weight, and the setting's recursive description ("golden dock under snow" appears three times) anchors the closure without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden supplies recurring constraints: dry fountains, unpruned roses, moss-erased stones all pressure Sera's argument that "nothing disappears; it only moves beneath the pattern." The thread appears in three beats (parcel, Sera's fingers on it, implicit in the final metaphor of weft), charging the closure image. Sensory specificity is filtered through POV (smell of smoke and chrysanthemums, gravel silvered with birch leaves) and the setting's decay mirrors Sera's thesis. The garden's spatial choreography remains legible throughout the walk, and the dusk pooling "thick between the trees" calibrates the ending's emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, corroded throne, and transparent observatory walls are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "damp, a bedraggled prince of rust," "world was a maze of cranes and chimneys." The egg itself—"color of old moonlight, mottled, faintly warm"—charges the final image by constraining the prince's choice. Spatial choreography is clear (hall, observatory, private chamber). Minor excess in world-building ("piston blossoms and iron rivers") does not constrain on-page action but enriches atmosphere without dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian lagoon and volcanic black sand constrain the boy's presence and charge the final image; the setting provides both the curse's origin and the site where Maris's father "wanted fire where the water could watch." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "salt clung to the smoke, softening the smell," "marram grass," "kelp-drift peace curling in slow hieroglyphs." Spatial choreography is clear (dune crest, water line, advancing fire). The setting drives one key choice (Maris positions her body between boy and flame) but does not escalate further, keeping it just shy of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The city of forgotten fountains supplies concrete setting details that constrain Lira's investigation: dry basins, sweating stone walls, the underground chamber. The fountain that halts water mid-air and the stained glass box both function as micro-settings that drive key choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across plazas, arcades, and the spiral stair descent. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("air tasted faintly of rain," "pressing silence"), filtered through Lira's observational stance. The recurring fountains charge the final image when they "roar back to life."

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nebula garden functions as micro-setting throughout: ionized dust petals, hydrogen veils, and luminous filaments constrain the protagonist's pruning actions and charge the final image of "closing luminous filaments before they flare to cruelty." The calculating gear operates as tactile anchor—"ticking softly," pressed between fingers with teeth biting skin—grounding reflection in physical sensation. Sensory selection reflects the protagonist's priorities: colors "tuned to frequencies that would rattle bone" and "sonar pinging through the luminous fog" create a consistent synesthetic filter. Spatial choreography remains coherent across drifting, tending, and reaching gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse at dusk is rendered through "glass bones...tick as the heat fled," cracked brick, fig-tree shadows, and ivy clusters—all filtered through Elias's carver's attention. The ribbon roll becomes micro-setting: pale blue with silver threads, its loose end pinned under a rusted trowel, later unwinding as a spatial guide across graves. The potting bench, stone slabs "like unfinished doors," and charcoal marks transform setting into working space that constrains his ritual. The final hill and the butterflies' "soft roar" charge the closure image. Spatial choreography across the cemetery paths remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The obsidian ridge, pendulum bob, and broken rake handle all constrain choices and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's professional/grief lens: "breathing weight of the sea," "fevered hands" of time. The tidal setting directly informs backstory causality (brother's death) and primes the final choice to teach others. Spatial choreography remains clear across the iron spine and harbor view.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt silo functions as both setting and closure stage: climbing it is the story's spatial climax, and the tapestry hanging inside directly enables the revelation. The sovereign case, chess clock, and frayed strip are handled across multiple beats and gain meaning through touch. Velveteen gloom, marble slabs, and off-key whistling anchor POV filtering. Spatial choreography (graves → service road → silo ladder → hatch → cylinder) tracks cleanly. The environment constrains the final choice (must climb, must match the strip at height), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: some phrases ("sealed cobalt candle," "cold inland sea") trend decorative without altering tactics, preventing full 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake create a tangible crucible: the tower isolates Elian, and the advancing snows reported in his data constrain the map's options. The kingfisher nib's sensory detail (blues and greens "like a living shard of river water") charges the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean (balcony to chamber, desk to velvet box), and the braziers, vellum spread, and charcoal tracings ground the modeling work. The three-year thaw cycle transforms setting detail (temperature charts) into tactical constraint. Minor gap: the "frozen lake lay mute" at the end is evocative but doesn't mechanically alter the final beat as directly as the nib does.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember alcove, ash drift, and dial glow constrain choices throughout—electric lamps are avoided because they "felt official, monitored," and mist presses the space into an island. The boy's dust-covered boots provide micro-setting evidence that the mixture is working, directly charging the closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Lina's copyist attention. The alcove's former function (tram garage) adds texture without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery is anchored early with concrete objects (rocking chair, pedestal, metal bowl, ash lines on the floor) that guide spatial choreography and constrain viewer movement. The ash scattering creates an invisible barrier that shifts distances and pressures people to test boundaries, demonstrating micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory selection (charcoal warmth, gray snowfall, porcelain glint) is purposeful, though the gallery itself remains somewhat generic beyond its symbolic name.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken city is rendered through purpose-driven particulars—collapsed avenues as canals, towers like broken teeth, silt layers where the clock tower sheared off—that ground every choice. The chronometer cog's brass teeth and salt corrosion charge the final image by returning as "teeth on metal," and the waterline's slapping heartbeat motif brackets the piece. Micro-setting qualifies: the sewer cell's rock shelf, the dripping arches, and the storm drains that echo Council proclamations all constrain the narrator's tactics (preserving relics, listening, testing stories against physical evidence). The body and tools (lamp, cog, hinge) function as setting extensions that shape stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The velvet library, wine-colored curtains, and high windows supply atmosphere and the closed drapes/dimmed lamps constrain the exercise (subtracting noise). The zither's soundhole rosette—seven interlocking hands—is handled in multiple beats and charges the closure when placed between Dari and Ilan, making it a micro-setting object that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography (circle, chairs shrinking, standing by the zither) remains clear throughout. Minor gap: autumn and the hill above town are postcard touches that do not pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: missing glass panes, salt-crusted vines, cracked planters supply concrete obstacles that Ariel and Kai must clear. Spatial choreography is clean (central aisle, beds, floor crunching underfoot). The aligned moons create a ticking environmental constraint—three pale columns meet over the central bed—that times the pruning and planting. The final glow through cracked panes charges the closure image. Sensory detail is dense and filtered through Ariel's taste-centered perception, though some metaphors (vines like cathedral ribs, dust motes like tiny planets) gesture toward grandeur without anchoring tactile friction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lightning collection tower constrains choice (granddad is "up in the tower," the city wakes only if Marla speaks) and charges the final image (tower flares white, drones rise). The glass booth, bridge railings, and matchbox are handled concretely. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("nectar dusk," "fluorescent buzz," "rasp loud as a spark"). Minor deduction: the drone beehives and their "failure" remain atmospheric rather than spatially grounded; we never see a hive or understand its physical form beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The corner that "never took sunlight" constrains Eli's final choice: lodging the orris root there and moving the bed toward darkness is a spatial decision with cost. Rust-stain coastline, warped sunlight pooling, tidal breathing, and the gap by the bedroom corner function as micro-setting that charges both tactics and closure. Sensory hierarchy (faint violet, metallic air, old rain in flour sacks) filters through Eli's observational bias. The bay itself pressures less directly but the house's particulars—floorboards sighing, doorways narrowing—anchor every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater garden is vivid and selective: barnacled stone ribs, lantern-corals, failed fountains, anemones. The setting constrains choice—structural weakness is the planned escape route, and the ceiling's crack matters causally. The ampoule's petals scatter color over mosaics, and the collapsing column is pressed by the visitor to trigger the flood. Spatial choreography is clear: cracked stairway, weakened column, ceiling burst. The body (stone hand dislodging silt) and the recurring ampoule charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The infinite staircase constrains every choice: Arin cannot go back, cannot arrive, can only climb. Micro-setting details (cracked baluster, warm railing, darker stone) are filtered through his search for asymmetry and missed choices. The crack that reveals the crossing staircase supplies the story's central image and charges the closure when it "shivered shut." The dice (object-as-setting) constrain his stance on fairness and second chances, recurring at the rupture beat and the final pocket moment. Sensory hierarchy reflects his priorities: stone texture, warmth of railing, visual asymmetry. The final image—"a world of doors he would never open behind him"—is directly shaped by the setting's irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse is sensorially vivid and POV-filtered ("plants breathe," "loamy and slow"), and the smog-choked city below provides contrast that charges the saffron quiet. The calligrapher's brush—its moon-tipped bristles and "breath on glass" glow—functions as micro-setting, constraining Aurelia's method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (above/below, glass panes as interface) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto city setting constrains and charges multiple choices: the waterfall curtain as gate, the high-arched mist-clouds, the dark niches where beehives once hung (establishing scarcity), and the spiral stair into the kitchen anchor spatial choreography. The emerald lens as micro-object functions as setting-extender, shifting perception and enabling the protagonist's insight ("dough bright as riverweed, the faces… shimmering with faint outlines"). Sensory detail is vivid and selective—rosewater, yeast, stone, mist—filtered through the museum-guide POV. The setting's transformation from "frozen in time" to "thawed" by war directly shapes the stakes and charges the final image of teaching amid dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse interior (brass, numbered stairs, round chamber with jagged crack) and the hunger stone itself constrain Aurek's choices at every beat: the backward knob, the yoyo niche, the crack over which he casts the device. The tide's exhale is tracked and pressures the descent. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"basalt shining with a faint, latent radiance," the smell of "rust, brine, and old prayers"—and filtered through Aurek's watchmaker's eye. The final spatial move (casting the yoyo into the void) charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The funhouse setting constrains choice throughout: broken mirrors show the drowning loop, the corridor forces confrontation, and the pier (accessed via mirror-as-curtain) stages the climax. The opera cloak clasp is handled twice and charges the final image by its release. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("wet velvet and chemical smoke," "pond scum and anesthesia"), and spatial choreography remains coherent. The funhouse's rotting bulbs and cobwebs create repulsive allure that supports tone without becoming a static catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The driftwood platform, tide-casks, bolted trees, and sea constrain every choice—Aera cannot escape the swell, must redistribute weight, and uses the orchard's own structure as instrument. The mallet, planks, and mast function as micro-setting that charges the final image: "dubbing the world" is literal percussion on wood. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency: "apples clacking like teeth," "salt-crusted ropes that groaned like low cellos." The orchard's physicality drives the climax and ending image without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtles function as micro-setting and recurring constraint: their ridges are "pattern languages," scars guide storm prediction, broken spirals signal fear and force Keth's Council appeal, and the final shell carving + whistle call charges the closure by making the environment an active agent. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "salt light glazed the roofs," "barnacled continents sighing," rust turns "bruised gold," the pulse through bars. Spatial choreography is clean (balcony → Council table → sealed harbor gate → waterline). The gate itself pressures choice by sealing the city and representing the Council's paralysis. The turtles' turn in the final line completes the environmental arc, making setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The disused station with ivy, broken windows, and the busted clock face supplies atmospheric constraint and mirrors the theme of time annotating history. The illuminated letter T anchors tactile engagement. Spatial choreography (platform, tunnel, bench) remains clear. The ivy pressing through "like thick handwriting" and the tendril slipping through the clock face charge the final withdrawal. Minor: the rosebush's final petal and the "roof of glass and gathering dusk" are vivid but do not constrain a choice within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The submerged pavilion and its "broken mosaics," "slick steps," and "barnacles" are vivid and selective. The inkwell—brass corners, iron-gall tang—returns with tactile specificity and charges the closure act of sealing the note. The harbor's tidal rhythm (low tide reveals ruins, high tide swallows the pavilion) constrains Mara's window and paces her work, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle. Minor spatial detail (skiff tie-off, column-to-column movement) remains clean, though the city's "neon and noise" contrast feels gestural rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is integral: the blackout removes watchers ("no watchers peering through the observation dome"), enabling Mara's investigation. Concrete details—brass lantern, swollen ledger pages, kelp-thread ribbon, mineral-stained aisle—are woven through action. The library's "breathing darkness" and "papery hush" modulate with the blackout's pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, stacks, narrow aisle, mis-shelved folio). The stamp as micro-object constrains choice (she carries it "as if it were a compass"). The folio's physical state (ribbon seal, faint stamp outline, margin dates) charges the closure image. Meets the Q3 9+ gate: environment and object constrain choice and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating island tea garden, glass basilica, and moss-soft table are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("steam twisting like uncut paper," "transparent stone"). The setting constrains choice: Liora must wait until twilight, the basilica "waits for her," and the spiral bridge is climbed with ritualized purpose. The copper wheel and molten glass function as micro-setting tools that enable the gem-polishing transformation. Spatial choreography is clear across locations (garden, basilica, bridge).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    The floating observatory and its console anchor the setting; the geode crystal functions as micro-setting, heating and humming to constrain perception and charge the final choice. Sensory detail is selective: "feeds spill light across the glass like bleeding constellations," the crystal's "ache like a word trying to remember its own pronunciation." The vortices on the console become tactile through the metaphor "fingerprints left on fogged glass." The observatory's orbital remove mirrors the narrator's moral distance, and the geode's physical warmth grounds the turn. Spatial choreography remains clean; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory dome, cracked stone floor, and rusted telescope constrain the action: Mira projects onto the ceiling because the dome breach allows starlight to fall through, and she must lean into the eyepiece to complete the pattern. The dust on boots, wrist console projection, and type foundry chip are handled objects that recur with specificity. Spatial choreography remains clear across the rotunda beats. The setting does not quite charge the final image—Mira could tune her frequency anywhere the stars are visible—but the observatory's history of pilgrims "bringing whatever the world had made unreadable" primes the thematic frame and lends weight to her own decoding act.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt terrace, sea, and driftwood carvings are vivid and purposeful, with sensory selection filtered through the genealogist's professional eye ("patterns are not letters I know, yet something in them pricks like half-remembered handwriting"). The watch and carved symbols function as micro-setting elements that constrain the final choice: without the forked emblem on both watch and wood, the decision to gather and study lacks its causal anchor. Spatial choreography from terrace to shore is clean, and the forgotten shore directly charges the closure image by supplying the archive of erased names.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The parapet is storm-worn, mist-crawling, with wet granite and broken merlons; sensory detail (sea sound, torch smoke, salt-clotted hair) is woven through pressure beats. The signaling lantern on a frayed cord becomes a micro-object that the protagonist untethers, altering the spatial mood and symbolically cutting the safety line. Spatial choreography (east/west captains, walkway crossings) remains clear. Minor limitation: the Black Coast armor "lacquered like beetle shells" is vivid but ornamental; it does not constrain a choice. The lantern's untethering charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal setting, utility poles rising from the bay, and the kayak itself all constrain choice: the poles guide his navigation even on water, and the barnacles' upward spiral toward faint light provides the exact observation that tilts his decision. The fog, tide, and concrete ramp anchor the opening cleanly. The astronomical compass functions as micro-setting/tool and charges the final image as metronome. The setting feels lived-in and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's surveyor's bias. Sensory selection (brine taste, hull wobble, compass thump) reflects urgency and familiarity without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting escalates through concrete layers—oil slicks, dust-drowned stadium, welded tunnel door, bioluminescent lake—that constrain choices (torch required, cold bites through boots). The lake's "bruised turquoise light" and algae chandeliers charge the final image and reweight the cleanse motif. Spatial choreography remains clear across transitions. The underground cavern functions as both literal and conceptual pressure, making empathy's absence palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)

The fortune slip, spices, and phoenix ash function as micro-setting tools that constrain the conjuring choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the transformation, and the final image of embers becoming seeds charges the orchard with new meaning, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered—thin air, savage stars, clouds as altar—and the setting pressures choice by isolating Lysander in a liminal space where repentance can occur. The cards, cloth, and porcelain shard function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image: he gathers them as he turns homeward. The bridge of mist and whirlpools of missed moments supply a coherent surreal geography that tracks through his realization without spatial confusion. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though some phrases ("sea of clouds shone faintly") lean toward postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spaceship functions as both macro-setting and constraint—low spin enables flight/pinning, patched hull implies scarcity, archive deck becomes chapel. The gravitational interplay between joy and sorrow directly shapes navigation adjustments and panel access. Sensory detail is purposeful: salt-filmed photographs, magnetic cradle glow, flooded street immersion. The star's final dimming coincides with closure but could press harder on ship systems or resources to elevate from vivid backdrop to active constraint at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Black sand, volcano glow, driftwood telescope, and rice paddies anchor vividly. The bottled lightning bugs function as micro-setting, constraining the final choice (splitting jars, waving them to redirect crowds). Spatial choreography is clean across ridges and camps. The cosmic timeframe (eclipse, comet) enriches atmosphere but does not materially pressure a tactical choice, and the quarry is named late without prior grounding, lowering specificity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal bluff and frictionless physics constrain movement choices: eels glide through air, waves fail to break, Arin's knees eventually scrape stone when friction returns. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (aurora colors "like melted compasses," dust drifting "sideways where no wind moved").

Geography remains stable, though the world-rule exposition could be more concretely anchored in observed cause-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atrium, brook, sundial, and tin are vividly detailed with sensory specificity and filtered through Darius's philosophical lens. The half-painted sundial and light beams function as tools that could constrain choice, and the spatial choreography is coherent throughout. However, the environment never forces a live decision on the page—it remains backdrop for exposition about past methods. The setting charges the atmosphere but does not alter tactics or outcome in this single waiting scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted library setting is purposefully rendered—"skeleton of shelves and wind," "rain through the open roof"—and constrains choice when the loose floorboard hides the tin and when "the old prison corridor rise[s] around us" triggers the narrator's survival persona. The coffee tin functions as micro-setting, a recurring physical object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: tin on cracked floor, floorboard concealment, patrol boots above it, retrieval. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's poetic bias without slipping into postcard mode, and the setting's history (prison library → post-riot ruin) informs present tactics organically.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its hanging compasses and root-walkways pressure Leon's challenge ("maybe it tests whether we can strike the next chord anyway"), and the final image of unfolding pathways charges the closure. The station piano, broken clock, film reels, and projection provide concrete anchors early. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("grain buzzing in his ears," "bench sway with some invisible tide"). The arbor's environment—roots, mist-tides, chrome-blue sky—directly shapes the final moment when "new pathways unfolded in the air."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridge, monsoon sky, and knowledge-fruit seed constrain Kael's tactics: he must finish rounds before the storm, the seed anchors his doubt, and the ridge becomes the site of the dream trial. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("uncertain silver," "purple long before the sea was ready," "flowers...closed as if unwilling to overhear"), filtered through Kael's role. The seed's physical presence (wrapped in seagrass, felt against palm, set on flat stone) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across the village, ridge, and dream-tree sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and selective: wet stones, salt-sweet breeze, leaning pines, highest rock, narrow grove with "smell like opened books and seaweed." The compass constrains the tutor's path (locks on the grove, not north), and the lace's rain-swollen threads charge the final discovery. Micro-setting (bonsai grove, stones, lace between rocks) directly enables the climactic realization. Sensory hierarchy reflects the tutor's priorities (pruning imagery, bonsai scars as "years when something essential almost broke"). One slight: the ghost ships appear late and are somewhat abstract ("shapes gathered, hulls and masts coalescing"), reducing tactile grounding in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse and flood-scarred town are rendered with precise, lived detail—iodine and mud, damp tide lines, sagging vines, milk-brown river—and every environmental fact matters to tone and action. The storm damage and imperfect repairs (plastic over leaks, puddles, never fully drying out) constrain Lena’s tactics and directly echo her thematic aim to track what persists and accumulates. Her choice of this place “for the air circulation and the cheap rent” but really for its memory of water integrates setting with character psychology. The final image of smudges creeping across paper grows organically from this environment, charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, kiln ruins, stars, frost, and glass are not mere backdrop; they actively shape survival, revelation, and choice (“The canyon had held the blast… Now it held my questions”). Environmental specifics—starlight developing the ledger like a photograph, arrows along the canyon floor pointing toward the dawn pass—directly constrain and enable tactics. Sensory detail is rich yet selective, strongly filtered through a glass artist’s eye. The setting also charges the final image, where the ruined furnace and canyon become a material metaphor for ending one life and stepping into another.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The winterglass conservatory and the smoldering, soundless city are vividly and economically rendered (“ceiling of frozen ivy,” “fires bloomed like poppies among buildings”) and deeply filtered through Lio’s sensory deprivation. The environment is not postcard-static: the glass roof chiming, shelves of equipment, and architectural acoustics directly shape his choices and the final plan (turning buildings into instruments). The rules of “The Quiet” are integrated via observation and effect rather than exposition dumps. Setting clearly charges the final image and constrains what kind of “music” is possible, satisfying the 9-band gate even if not pushed to maximal extremity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the rusted harbor town, the impossible descent through dry water, and especially the paused underwater library—are vivid, specific, and tonally unified. Details like books bound in “the moment before a person spoke” and doors “swollen with unwritten words” are strikingly original yet functional, reinforcing the theme of arrested rest. Environment and recurring objects (lens, shelves) charge the final image and meaningfully constrain what the story can be. The piece uses mostly visual and conceptual detail; a bit more tactile/somatic interaction under pressure could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, wind, and chattering tiles create an unusually vivid, texturally specific micro-setting that’s consistently filtered through Mara’s attention. The setting is not mere backdrop: the arbor is the depot, the gathering place, and the structural focus of her plan, and its physical acoustics (“amplified quiet”) charge the final image. Sanctions and border crossings are woven in with economical detail that feels lived rather than expositional. The environment shapes tone and meaning more than tactical choices, but it’s tightly integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight viaduct, mist, river, and lanterns are sensuously realized and pervasively filtered through Arun’s consciousness, setting a strong tone from line one. The recurring arches/lanterns motif charges the final image of blue-lit faces and lanterns rising into the damp arches. The setting slightly influences logic (thin boundaries, roses/arches to catch the lanterns) but functions more as emotional and thematic atmosphere than hard constraint on choice, which keeps it short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The living bridge garden, black water, and halo fragment create a deeply specific, tactile environment that governs what is possible: the bridges’ geometry and the water’s refusal to reflect directly shape the climax. Setting details are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, never reading as neutral scenery (“vines arch into trembling corridors,” “sky colored ghosts”). The environment’s rules remain stable, and the recurring objects (halo, roots, photographs, water) explicitly constrain options and charge the final image. This integration of place with premise and ending easily meets the high-band standard.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned redemption center is richly particular (popcorn oil, ticket stubs, sagging prize shelves) and tightly integrated into the story’s logic: the vault under the counter, the arrow on the pegboard, the piano as interface. Environmental details consistently come tethered to function rather than as décor, and the dead carnival atmosphere reinforces the themes of squandered abundance and latent potential. Objects-as-setting (chains, piano, arrow) actively constrain and enable choices. The setting’s specificity and causal role justify the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sunken orchard, shipwreck ring, and ashen forge are not just decorative; they tightly mirror and pressure the emotional stakes (ruined growth, fractured hulls as analogues for broken trust). The environment is interacted with functionally—greenhouse panes, currents, wrecks as sites for “collecting absences,” and the forge as the locus of experimentation and closure. World rules (chemical aurora, drowned orchard) are consistent and learned through use, and the recurring orchard/forge imagery directly charges the final reflection about trust as a “battered marvel.” Setting specificity and tone are exceptionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Emerald Station and the golden-hour / moonlight interplay are richly realized (“green as bottled oceans,” “the whole platform looked underwater, preserved in some impossible aquarium”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the station, its clock, the tracks, and the light conditions all shape what’s possible and when. The jar and camera function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image. A slight broadening beyond visual detail into other senses during the peak might deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    The abandoned control room and melting ice are rendered with concrete, memorable detail—“icicles dangled from control levers like undecided sentences,” “water ticked and slipped from metal.” Environment meaningfully constrains and charges the story: this is a former command center whose dead machinery and thawing cold are precisely what make it an apt “safe zone” and shape Corin’s choice to work here. The setting evolves (ice melting, building “exhaling”) and directly charges the final image of returning as “stepping into a question that warms itself.” The world-building feels both specific and thematically integral.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “rusted library under stars we used for night shoots” is vivid, specific, and thematically apt as a graveyard of scripts and identities. Details like “metal ribs gone orange with decay” and books in “clear plastic like organs in jars” are strongly filtered through the POV and echo the body/organ motif. The seashell prop and soundstage ceiling recur to charge the closing image with a sense of artificial yet consoling environment. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully shapes mood and the metaphorical sense of being warehoused and interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and deeply integrated: the storm-tossed ridge fort, cliff spine, shingle shore, and single star all shape tone and the practical situation. Weather and architecture matter—the pause in the wind, the exposed battlements, the strangely dry hall once the map is complete—so the environment is more than backdrop. Details are filtered through the story’s lyric sensibility rather than a neutral camera, which keeps the atmosphere cohesive. The final image of darkness entering the fort and the map opening corridors in that black decisively charges the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen courtyard and its elements (icicles, rusted railings, hedge maze, twilight) are vividly realized and consistently filtered through HEPA-3’s sensibility. Environment is not mere backdrop: cold and ice directly constrain the violin’s fragility and the physical evidence of change (puddled remains, frost on fingertips). The setting’s tone—industrial, repurposed, half-abandoned—echoes the “second chance” experiment on an object not meant for this use. The final image relies on these environmental specifics to feel charged rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the crystal whispering forecourt, mist, and telepathic “mindfield” are not postcard backdrops but the exact medium of the story’s stakes. Weather and architecture (crystals, rain, halos) recur and evolve, from the opening images to the final concert, charging the last scene. The archive hall and obsolete projector gear are also well-used micro-settings that shape her tactics. Environment constrains communication and makes her language-bound stance consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and particular: the maze wedged between glass towers, catwalks with technicians, the tool shed cube, and the arbor with dead vine all feel concrete and lived-in. Details are filtered through Elias’s horticultural eye, which keeps the specificity tied to character. Crucially, the garden and city infrastructure charge the premise of measurable luck and culminate in the maze-as-question-mark image that anchors closure. The only small gap is that the environment doesn’t materially constrain tactical choices so much as it frames and echoes them, but for this quiet piece that’s largely sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the twin moons, ice-sheathed cliffs, xenobiology domes, and temporal lab equipment all feel tactile and filtered through Ilen’s perceptions. Environmental details (cold seeping through gloves, the aviaries, the hovering prism) are not postcard scenery; they frame and constrain the work on the manifold and charge the final image of the valley within the hush of wings. The “icy warmth” in both environment and tone threads through to closure. World rules—temporal manifold, embryos dreaming on different axes—are conveyed in-scene without derailing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is outstanding: the flooded opera house, lanternlight, peeling gilt, and slowly turning chandeliers all feel specific and inhabited, not postcard. The environment isn’t mere backdrop; the water threatens objects, deforms the program into “warped staff lines,” and explicitly shapes the nature of the code and the final image of him lifting his instrument above the dark water. Sensory detail is rich yet focused through a musician’s eye, and the tone of a half-drowned cathedral of art under repression is consistent and potent. The setting meaningfully charges both the premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain weather station is vividly realized—“tired mechanical lung,” antennas combing blued air, rime-crusted railings—and consistently filtered through Mara’s professional and personal stakes. Environmental features are not postcard décor: the extinct Feverwhisper, the reservoir expansion, and the auroral storms fuse setting with backstory and the core suspicion of steered weather. The micro-setting of consoles, clipboard, and auroral glow meaningfully charges the final image of green dawn over the peaks. While the station does not physically constrain her choices in a tactical way, it deeply shapes the conceptual stakes and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned train tunnel is vividly rendered (“tunnel breathes,” “flashlights yawning,” rusted rails, mineral cold) and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The beaded valve wheel and rosaries function as charged micro-setting, becoming an altar that focuses the climax and final image. Environmental detail is economical yet texturally dense, and the space’s sensory qualities (cold, drip, darkness, metallic rhythm) mirror the emotional stakes. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment powerfully charges mood and meaning but doesn’t strongly constrain concrete options or tactics beyond ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is a major strength: the overgrown catacomb-library, obsidian refuge, and silent river of extinct cities are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through his archival sensibility. Environmental features are not mere backdrop; the path of pages, the river’s mirrored stone, and the library’s roots physically and symbolically shape his options and the story’s stakes. The final image—him at the obsidian refuge while the library erupts into daylight—reconfigures prior spatial anchors into a charged, thematic tableau. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through transformation rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the southern slope of Sage Ridge, pine and sage scent, the ash tree, cracked flagstones, and slanting light all filter through Mara’s sensibility as a routine inhabitant, not a tourist. The eclipse’s changing light, shadows sharpening “like ink,” and the hush “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” actively shape the emotional stakes and cadence of beats, especially in the courtyard silence. The micro-setting of the rehab (wheelchairs, oxygen tubing, nurses, common-room TV) grounds the story and subtly underscores fragility and institutional constraint. While the environment doesn’t present hard physical obstacles, it clearly charges the final image and how the moment can unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reclaimed silo library and the transplanted fireplace are richly specific and consistently filtered through Brann’s perception (“bronze quiet,” “skylight filmed with dust and old storms”). Environment isn’t just decorative: walls and stone are quasi-characters, their remembered pressure literally enabling his work and charging the final image. The silo’s spiraling shelves toward the dim skylight deepen the theme of vertical reach toward a vanished source (dreams, sky, axis). The ending—Brann descending as the silo “listened with all its walls”—relies on setting to carry the story’s conceptual and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bar, lighthouse, and rocky island are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action (“storm steps,” “bricks salted and pitted,” the lamp slicing through the window). The environment meaningfully constrains choices: isolation, darkness, and the physicality of climbing to the lens all shape how the protagonist can act. The recurring images of light, water, and fog culminate in a charged final picture of the island “exhale[ing] into a different, sharper cadence” while the sea “read[s] back my fortunes.” Setting is not mere backdrop; it actively charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chapel and its atmosphere—“dust softened the stained glass light into a muffled clarity,” “dimensional anchor,” blue pigment older than the building—are vivid, selective, and thematically tuned to listening and containment. Environmental elements constrain tactics: the Order’s one-color rule, the chosen anchor site, and the silence instead of congregation directly shape how Jonas operates. The recurring ultramarine and the sense of the building “listening” feed back into the climax, where the anchor “tightens its grip” as logic closes in, giving the final image more charge. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk or environmental backlash at the climax could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are rendered with high specificity and woven through nearly every beat. The environment doesn’t so much constrain physical options as it shapes perception and method: reflection on glass prompts the timelines, the nautilus alignment, and the vertical “DO NOT WASTE” line. The setting’s reflective logic directly charges the final image of him raising a baton over the city as the horizon pales. It’s deeply integrated and atmospheric, just shy of 9+ because it influences stance and image more than concrete tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The viaduct after rain is richly realized and never merely decorative: the glowing stone, drains, and suspended droplets all support the temporal and thematic frame. The environment constrains and charges choices—the rail, the drop into dark water, and the lenses in each raindrop concretize the branching-timeline concept. The final image of the tablet sliding into the dark water pays off both setting and object. This is publish-ready level atmosphere with purposeful, not touristic, detail.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drum maker’s cavern is vividly rendered and functionally integral: stone, drums, and tunnels become the literal circuitry for the “filament of hush” and shape how the experiment can occur. Details like dust in “audibly muted light,” drums as “sleeping hearts,” and stone transmitting rhythm give the environment a lived, pressured role rather than decorative backdrop. The setting both mirrors the thematic concern (buried feeling, echoing chambers) and constrains tactic: this exact space with these drums is necessary for silence to become touch. The final image—silence as music—only resonates as it does because the cavern has been so concretely established as instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting feels textured and purposeful: the quiet courtyard, dry fountain, curfew-emptied rogue quarantine zone, and abandoned school all reinforce isolation and latent threat. Details like “fountains turned to smears of copper and glass” and the transformer hum do double duty as mood and world-building filtered through a storm-watcher’s eye. The courtyard is not just backdrop but a micro-stage that constrains the action (he listens there, commits to remaining there) and charges the final image. The quarantine and boundary behavior of sensors/pigeons extend setting into a coherent, lived-in system rather than mere scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canal market, “low island of crystal shadows,” trembling lanterns, and Mara’s wrist-greenhouse create a vivid, coherent environment that feels both magical and tactile. Setting objects (lanterns, UV tube, vial, greenhouse charm) aren’t decorative: they channel memory, make scent legible, and culminate in the sprouting seed that charges the final image. Sensory specificity—especially olfactory and visual—feels filtered through Elias’s bias as a scent-traumatized professional. The only limiter is that the broader city/world beyond the stall remains impressionistic, understandably at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the stalled coastal highway, rust-colored hills, and “terra-cotta grotto under starlight” create a strong, lived-in atmosphere. Details like the grotto as “between a wound and a womb” and the rope’s smell of “metal and old sweat” are not postcard-ish; they mirror the themes of harm/shelter and escape/debt. The energy beings hovering beyond the atmosphere charge the whole environment with experiment/witness tension. While the grotto doesn’t physically constrain tactics, it clearly shapes the intimacy and ritual weight of this encounter and charges the final poised choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the harbor city’s “chronic hush,” the drained canal, and especially the sunken orchard greenhouse with shipwreck housing and diving-suit planters all feel lived-in and strange. Environmental elements constrain and charge choices—the hush motivates Elio’s pursuit of resonance; the greenhouse’s submersion and salvaged pumps literally shape how the trees survive and how his music travels. The final image of the inverted bowl by the pumps and scarred sapling reaching for shattered glass ties environment tightly to theme and closure. Detail density is high but generally well-filtered through Elio’s sensory bias, especially sound.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto and resin-lit environment are vivid, multisensory, and consistently filtered through Eve’s professional and emotional lens, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Details like “syrupy, honeyed sorrow” and shelves of bottled moods feel both specific and world-building without devolving into catalog. The setting subtly mirrors the thematic work of entrapment and preservation of emotions, and the grotto’s deepening static field modulates Eve’s bodily experience. It doesn’t sharply constrain physical tactics, but it meaningfully charges the encounter and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific: harbor smells, open doors to the salt wind, the “breezy library under stars,” and workers studying tides and languages all create a rich, lived-in place. Details are filtered through Elias’s professional lens (shipping almanacs, crew) and Marin’s musical/literary focus (scores, motifs), which keeps description purposeful. The environment lightly shapes the stakes—the open, late-night library and proximity to the symphony justify the proposed after-concert readings and workers’ presence. It’s atmospheric more than constraining, but the harbor/library contrast meaningfully supports the thematic revaluation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through character perception, giving the piece a strong, cohesive atmosphere. World rules (crystal pears, trees sprouting from echoes, pilgrims) are implied through concrete observation rather than exposition. The arbor in particular charges the final image and ties setting directly to meaning. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics, but it thoroughly saturates tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: rooftop canals, chimneys, wash lines, and the giant’s breathing all shape both atmosphere and constraints (“beyond this, the city belongs more to sound than stone”). The giant’s nap operates as both temporal and physical environment, culminating in “the giant shifted in his sleep, streets heaving overhead” to charge the ending. Details are filtered well through the illustrator’s eye, and the recurring pendant functions as a micro-setting object that literally shapes time and space. The world’s rules (time-sculpting pendant, sound-dominated zone) are clear and consistent without exposition dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern orchard is exceptionally vivid and specific: stalactites as slow clocks, glassy fruit holding forgotten hours, mineral pools feeding pale trees. Setting is fully filtered through Corren’s aim and grief, not a static backdrop. The environment materially charges the stakes—his realization about “tearing open every branch” makes the orchard’s ecology and magic a constraint on his options. The final return of stalactite ticking and kinder silence reweights the space thematically and emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    The library is rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail (“sapphire hush,” “crooked stacks,” emergency lantern halos) that feels both atmospheric and functional. Environment and architecture directly constrain action—crawl spaces, vents, and the outage-shaped lighting pattern are the only ways Marrow can intervene. The setting’s evolution (from silent outage to breathing, sob-filled space) mirrors the thematic shift from emptiness to charged presence. The recurring hush of the library meaningfully charges the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse valley, mossy trellis, and storm season are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail tied to Mara’s professional and emotional lens. The linden as boundary marker and the trellis as habitual detour both constrain her paths and charge the climactic moment when the trellis “shimmered, not with light but with attention.” Weather and water are not postcard backdrops; they actively mirror and pressure her inner state. Setting integrates tightly with theme and closure without feeling over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the tidal island, vanishing road, salted atmosphere, rain trails, and desal-stitched mainland city are specific and mutually consistent. Environmental constraints (the tidal road, the single well, the failed tide) directly shape what Mara can do and why this day is different. Details are always filtered through her sensibility (“sky had the color of a bruise remembering better days”), reinforcing mood rather than feeling touristic. The final image is charged by the visible absence of the tide and the failing sea behind her at the checkpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid, specific, and POV-filtered, with details like “chandeliers of quartz that pulsed like sleeping hearts” and the cave’s preference for “the language of breath” doing atmospheric and thematic work simultaneously. The environment actively shapes and constrains events: the cave’s shifting music derails Lyra’s plan, the shadows and vibrations literally free the pearl, and “bright darkness” is not just mood but an operating condition. Setting and object-as-setting (the pearl) charge the final image, where the cave’s unstable song becomes the new, accepted rhythm of Mira’s life. It’s both immersive and structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor is fully realized as both physical place and emotional pressure-field: “ivory harbor after rain,” bruised sky, seawall, bollards, and unclaimed moorings all feel integral rather than decorative. Setting details are consistently filtered through Mara’s archivist sensibility, with tide and weather explicitly “editing” the fragments she’s racing. The environment charges the final image of the note hanging over the wet stones and tarnished brass. The harbor doesn’t quite force a concrete tactical decision in-scene, which keeps this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the city, the arrowed pavement, and especially the “starlit vault in mist” station are richly imagined and tightly filtered through a map-obsessed mind. Environmental details (columns etched with live map lines, constellational trains, wet-iron-and-paper smell) feel purposeful and thematically aligned with routes and unsaid paths. The doorway of “absence” and the phantom infrastructure meaningfully frame his choice, even if they don’t physically constrain tactics beyond the single available route. The world’s rules are consistent for a fantastical piece and learned through observation rather than infodump.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, sea, whales, fog, and tile are rendered with precise, vivid specificity (“whales drew silver scars across the sea,” “fog rolled in rings around the tower”). Setting is tightly bound to interior state: the height and isolation “sculpt space for reflection,” and whale-song literally and metaphorically vibrates the scene into resonance. The environment and key object charge the final image rather than serving as backdrop. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the setting doesn’t overtly constrain available actions beyond providing seclusion and sensory context.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prismatic escondite and storm-wracked planetary environment are vividly realized and inseparable from the story’s mechanics and theme. Details like “overlapping geometries” and “crown of bent nails” aren’t postcard flourishes; they directly shape what can happen (space buckling, light changing behavior, fields realigning). The setting evolves with events—the room twists, mutinies, then steadies—and the final act of redrawing boundaries is literally spatial. Environment and recurring objects (escondite, amulet, fields) clearly charge the closing image and constrain future choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prep room is vividly, economically evoked (“air hums with formaldehyde and whispers”) and tightly linked to action: her professional access to his opened body makes the discovery possible. Tools and objects—the scalpel, metal table, autopsy stitches, ink pot—function as lived-in parts of the environment rather than set dressing. The setting’s sterile, constrained space reinforces the theme of bodies/accounts being opened and sewn back up. While weather and broader world remain offstage, the micro-setting is so purposeful that the scene never feels white-roomed.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory, bonsai labyrinth, and dead town below are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Aurelio’s sensibility (“bonsai shadows sway like a field trying to remember the sea”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the working lamp enables his method, the mountaintop distance underscores isolation, and the bonsai path frames both opening and closing, charging the final image. Environmental details evolve with the beat (night → dawn; lamp hum → flicker-out) and directly shape what he can do and when he must stop. This integration of atmosphere, tool, and constraint is at a publish-now level.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    The port and its “towering labyrinth of shipping containers” are not backdrop but active atmosphere, shaping his work (overheard voices through container walls, strange acoustics) and his identity (timing walks to the tides as the city “breathes”). Details like trucks grumbling at night, rusted ladders, and the customs-office room feel lived-in and specific, filtered through his archival obsession. The poison label becomes a micro-setting object that constrains the ending choice when he writes on its back and lies beneath it. Environment and recurring objects directly charge the final image and could not be swapped without breaking the piece’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, cliff, sea, shell, and half-finished cello form a tightly integrated micro-setting that is both vivid and thematically loaded (failed instruments vs. stubborn myth). Details are selective and purposeful: the “shattered dome,” “constellations that never existed,” and the open cello throat all echo the story’s obsession with incomplete knowledge. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics, but it decisively charges the final image of shell-on-cello and the departure back toward the cliff. World rules around the quasi-magical resonance are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    The raft city carnival is rendered with striking specificity—tankers and drowned suburbs lashed together, neon tides, investors in mirrored yachts—and these elements actively shape tactics (the maze vs. zoning, drifting carts, crumbling piers). The environment and object micro-setting (the foundation chip) both constrain choices and charge the final dilemma about privatization and escape routes. World rules around zoning, rent tiers, and speculative pressure are consistent and embedded in action rather than dumped. The only thing holding this just under 9 is that the physicality of the final moment is mediated through description more than immediate embodied interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar summit, crater rim, heritage beacon, and dormant harvesters are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Ilya’s professional and emotional lens, giving the world weight. Setting is not mere backdrop: the airlessness, countdown infrastructure, and heritage zone constraints shape what he can and cannot do. Recurring objects (the footprint’s absent presence, the grain, the vials, the beacon) charge the final image without over-declared symbolism. This is near top-tier atmosphere, just shy of perfection because the environment constrains mood more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is richly and purposefully rendered: mist, rails, harbor vibrations, and the cramped shop all inform how Elias perceives and how the drone learns to orient. Details like “the rails and the sea shared their trembling music through the stones” and the chiming glass tubes feel specific to his sensory world rather than generic atmosphere. Environment and tools actively shape tactics and the final image as the hummingbird follows “the pulling song of rails and sea.” It stops just short of 9+ because the depot itself, while strong, could be even more tightly tied to an unavoidable constraint or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rusted outpost, iron lake, creaking metal, and complaining ice are vivid and fully inhabited; weather and structure tangibly shape what’s possible (isolation, ice crossing, hidden warm seam). The condensation on glass as an environmental “map” elegantly fuses setting with method and guides the key choice. The final image—kneeling by the seam under the outpost, red pencil out, falcon calling—relies entirely on this environment to carry its charge. Setting feels indispensable and thematically fused rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost town is rendered with strong, specific images—fog as a “wild hush,” buildings as exhausted sleepers, dust as “frozen applause.” Setting is tightly integrated with mood and concept; the archway, cobblestones, chapel, and fog all recur and evolve as the town stirs. The environment supports rather than merely decorates the action, especially in how sound moves through eaves, chimneys, and stones. It stops short of fully constraining Ansel’s choices, functioning more as resonant backdrop than active obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly and economically realized: Station Pelagia, the pressure-black deep, and the half-temple/half-machine space feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental constraints (no surface, dwindling power, crushing depth) meaningfully narrow options and frame the protagonist’s isolation. The temple’s sensory details—perfumed vents, luminous algae, carved spirals—aren’t just pretty; they fuse with the vial’s function and the civilization’s exit strategy. The final image’s power depends on this environment; without the deep and the temple, the “lonesome splendor” would lose its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse prison off the jagged reef is vividly, economically drawn through smell, sound, and shape, and it consistently constrains options (no escape except lethal seas; hidden architectures inside stone). Setting is fully POV-filtered—cells as “stacked mouths,” windows as “missing teeth,” the tower as a “throat”—and those images evolve into the core conceptual turn about stories clogging a lighthouse. Environment and micro-setting (the confessional lattice, the rust-breathing door, the reef where bodies lie) directly charge the final stakes. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment has not yet forced a concrete, immediate trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and endless night are lushly specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s lived familiarity. Setting is not postcard decoration: the covenant is literally tied to this place, the endless night is the “cage,” and the greenhouse “heart” responding at the end charges the final image. Details like metallic fruit, luminous seeds, and winter-cracked fields reinforce tone while anchoring the world’s rules. Environment and recurring objects (orchard, bead, glass ribs) decisively shape the stakes and closure, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting work is rich, specific, and tightly POV-filtered: the wharf, barnacled stairs, violet sandstone, and iron-and-old-tide air all feel tactile and lived-in. The labyrinth is not a postcard backdrop; its chambers and walls directly enable his project and define his solitude, and the environment literally becomes the new “page” for the town’s stories. Time of night, tide, tools, and stone all interact to shape what he can do and when. The final image of the carved harbor in the last chamber is strongly charged by everything we’ve learned about this place.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard, fermenting apples, roots in bones, and the sundial stone create a vivid, specific environment that is integral to every beat. Setting is not decorative: the roots, graves, and stone dictate where people move, what they discover, and how time and ancestry are conceptualized. The final image—sunbeam, bronze pointer, dial, and listening orchard—depends entirely on this environment to carry thematic weight. Sensory detail is lush yet focused, with smell, texture, and weather all working in service of mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The golden arcade, glass ribs, old post counter, and hologram-flecked shops create a vivid, lived-in near-future that is strongly filtered through Neve’s sensibility. The preserved counter as “hinge” and the slot as the threshold where “every envelope…became a small future” directly charge the final image of the letter poised before the drop. Setting details are economical yet specific (field trips to learn what “patience once looked like in public”), and they consistently echo the story’s preoccupations with time, nostalgia, and controlled transition. Environment doesn’t overtly block tactics but meaningfully frames and weights every choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn frost, and the eternal candle create a striking, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Liora’s professional gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop: the candle’s behavior informs her reading of lies, and the observatory’s role as a star-watching archive amplifies the terror of missing constellations and potential erasure. Environmental details (frost like ghosts, stone and glass “inhaling”) support the theme of memory vs. oblivion. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the physical space doesn’t significantly constrain tactical options beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth, phosphorescent algae, and condensation “windows” create an immersive, non-generic setting that is always tied to the emotional and thematic stakes (apologies, regret, unspoken words). Environment consistently shapes action: Lysa must pole through roots “like ribs,” the spirits’ song shifts as she advances, and the whole place is defined as “the space where an apology waits unspoken,” directly charging the premise. The shard functions as a tool within that environment and the algae wounds “that healed in moonlight” subtly mirror the story’s interest in slow, conditional repair. The only reason this doesn’t nudge higher is that the physical labyrinth itself doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices beyond mood and access—it’s more charged backdrop than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The misty atrium, iodine tang, greenhouse glass, orchids, and generators create a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and war-adjacent rather than generic. Setting is consistently filtered through Mara’s eye (plants as “civilians in disputed borders”), and the coral fragment works as a micro-setting object that charges multiple beats and the ending. The final image of anxieties drifting between orchids and generators elegantly ties the physical space to the thematic question. This is excellent work; it just stops short of absolute top-tier because the physical environment seldom constrains concrete action beyond mood and symbolic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ruined orchard district and fog are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme: ribs of branches, luminous fog, and the decayed greenhouses mirror the idea of suspended, half-forgotten joy. The environment constrains choices (a hidden, abandoned district where illicit light art is possible) and strongly charges the final image of fog glowing with remembered laughter. Details feel filtered through an artist’s eye, with consistent attention to color and light. The setting is not just backdrop but an active emotional and conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sound wave garden under the viaduct is exceptionally realized and integral: stone ribs, tuned cavities, and reflected sound are not mere backdrop but the mechanism of the haunting and the character’s transformation. Environmental details are filtered through her professional eye and auditory focus, and the physical architecture literally shapes how the question and reply travel and return altered. The setting evolves in step with the arc—from passive echo chamber to active, breathing presence—and it charges the final image of walking on “in the ever-renewing pause” under humming arches. This is a model of setting as both atmosphere and engine of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse and the wider city gardens are rendered with striking specificity—“glass terrariums glow like bottled moons,” beetles as “impatient typewriters”—and always through Arlen’s bias. Setting is not decorative: insect noise provides cover, the greenhouse becomes a “grammar school,” and Ministry-regulated gardens become literal blank pages for their language. World rules around audits, seed purchases, and “emotional compliance” are integrated through action rather than dumped. The final image of a “quiet grammar” blooming under surveillance is charged directly by the environments already established.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: barnacles as metronomes, “reef-shadow joy,” spiral shell corridors, and coral blooms all filter through his sensibility. The gargantuan shell and reef are not backdrop; the threshold chamber, water surface, and coral path actively shape where and how he can negotiate with the moon. Environmental elements recur to charge the ending (barnacles to coins, windows to halos, reef-shadow joy returning as he sleeps). World rules (undersea city, coral responding to song, clouds hiding the moon) are consistent within the tale’s fantastical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal library, glass floors, bottled storms, and orchids as labels are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through a caretaker who moves in a space he deeply knows. Setting and objects are not postcarded: the cracked chime can erode memories, the orchids literally store names, and the atrium of oldest orchids becomes the arena of the climax. Environment and tools meaningfully constrain what he can do (he fixes, listens, archives) and charge the final image of the new orchid glowing then fading. The density of description is high, but it remains functional and integrated rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The extinct language archive is vividly realized (“shelves curved like fossilized ribs,” “distilled residue of a hundred obsolete dyes”) and deeply filtered through the consciousness of an arcane linguist. Setting is not postcard; it supplies the crucial resource (Arithene vows) and frames the act of writing as a kind of ritual trial, with the room “stirring, attentive as a jury.” The recurring objects (ink well, vellum, glowing script) charge the final beats, especially the step “out of the archive’s shadow.” Slightly more direct environmental constraint on physical choice would be needed to push it into the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater and the “breathing” building are vivid, specific, and thematically integrated from the first line to the last. The space is not postcard backdrop: it stores treaties, shapes acoustics and tension, frames the chain on the stage, and culminates in the image of stone restraining fire as a model for human restraint. The surveyor’s chain and oculus light function as micro-setting elements that constrain and charge the council’s choice. This environmental logic directly underwrites the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The attic is vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated: smell of “rain-soaked cardboard and brittle glue,” warped floorboard as a scale, dust motes under the skylight driving his routing method, cages, and the meteorite on the trunk. Environment and recurring objects directly shape behavior (pigeon training, dust-based navigation, the attic as the space where he becomes someone other than “Noel Harrow”). The contrast with the paperwork “downstairs” gives real spatial and thematic topology. The final image of the dusk attic, drifting dust, and the bird bearing the song is fully charged by earlier setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is strikingly specific (hexagon clouds, drifting prism terrace, rearranging maze, hovering house) and always filtered through Map’s sensibility. Environmental rules—terrace drift, necessary distances, thresholds—consistently shape options, from furniture spacing to the world-balancing strip of soil. The recurring objects-as-setting (wood grain, stalks, soil) strongly charge the final image of that one-step distance between father and child. Atmosphere and geography are clear despite high surrealism, and physical distances matter at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underwater city and dome are vividly, economically realized—“black glass,” “algae-furred statues,” drowned avenues—and these details are always filtered through the narrator’s way of seeing. Setting is not postcard backdrop: the dome, failing lights, pressure hum, and bioluminescent shrimp all directly shape what’s possible, what must be solved, and what ultimately changes. World rules feel consistent and learned through action (airlocks, rebreather collars, light protocols) rather than exposition. The final image—city glowing in “gentle pulses” after sunrise through leagues of water—depends utterly on this environment and recharges every prior mention of light and darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The geode cave, shifting crystals, sea-foam, and unfinished crystal seam are vividly rendered and inseparable from both premise and resolution. Environment and objects (crater glass, seeds, raw crystal) directly shape what Lio can perceive and thus what he can conclude. The closing return to tide and foam lets the setting recharge the new understanding. Description is lush but mostly purposeful, with only minor risk of over-ornamentation in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arcade is vividly and economically rendered—the brine mist, broken neon arches, and vending machines as “constellations trapped in glass” feel specific and lived-in. The environment is not just backdrop: the encroaching water dictates where Marcus can set up and provides a live clock that kisses his boots at the turning point. The bishop as recurring object and the hum of machines as a kind of metronome both charge the final moment. This atmosphere strongly supports theme and tone without drifting into disorienting spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is lush and particular—“twilight garden under stars,” lantern-moths, black-glass roots—and consistently filtered through Mareh’s tide-dancer sensibility. Crucially, environment and rules constrain action: the garden must float beyond surveillance buoys, the lagoon and moon-tug are required for the ritual, and saltwater/starlight later activate the verse. World rules stay internally consistent and are shown through use rather than exposition. The final image of the garden shifting from exile to rebellion is strongly charged by the established setting.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, mist, prism atrium, and quarry-pond are vividly realized and tightly filtered through a glazier’s eye (fractures mirroring shoreline, rainbows “on gray days”). Environmental conditions (fog, wind vs still pond, the aging atrium itself) are not mere backdrop but the primary way the story thinks about fragility and change, and they directly charge the final wish to see what water and glass “agreed upon.” The setting’s rules and physicality stay consistent, and details feel chosen rather than touristic. The environment effectively constrains the central choice by making demolition vs restoration feel materially and symbolically weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and textured: the moonlit ridge, canyon fire remnants, and the earlier shed all feel specific and lived-in, with consistent fireline and rural details. The porcelain box functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully constrains memory and charges the final image. Celestial imagery (stars as reverse embers, the cracked moon) deepens atmosphere and subtly mirrors inner states without feeling like generic symbolism. The environment doesn’t heavily limit tactics, but it shapes tone and resonance in a way that feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tide-polished grotto is vivid, tactile, and thematically charged from the opening line onward—its low-tide access, algae light, and fishermen’s hooks all become functional parts of the ethical experiment. The environment actively shapes choices: it provides the hooks and reflective surfaces, mirrors the tidal “rise and fall” the gauge measures, and frames the final image of a “patient cosmos” awaiting our decisions. The closing beat fuses setting and theme: the grotto-as-laboratory and as metaphor for communal space recharges the meaning of every earlier description. Detail density is high but well-controlled, with no white-room moments or static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined university, ivy, wet stone, salt wind, and warped post-climate architecture are vividly and economically drawn, always filtered through the echo-cartographer’s priorities. Setting is not postcard; the ivy literally conceals the fire door, the prior blaze and flooding define what can be found, and the environment’s “groaning” weaves into the sonic premise. The final image of staying “until the walls finished dreaming” is fully charged by how thoroughly the building has been established as a quasi-conscious environment. World rules for the climate-shifted campus hold consistently without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The echoing spring terrace, damp stone arches, and curled streets below are vividly and economically rendered, and environmental details like rain droplets are directly harnessed into the magic system. Setting is filtered through the painter’s work with light and mirrors, so it feels lived-in rather than touristic. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mainly provides a beautifully textured stage. That keeps this excellent in atmosphere and specificity but not quite at a 9+ where setting would actively shape decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace, cracked stones, bowls of salt/ash/water, and distant artillery create a vivid, coherent environment that’s inseparable from the story’s mood. Setting isn’t postcard; the ritual location and midsummer pause concretely shape when and how negotiations can occur. Details like “water cupping the moon in miniature” and grasses turning silver serve both atmosphere and theme without clogging motion. The final sense of the sky’s indifference is charged by all the earlier celestial and terrace imagery, giving the space clear narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt flat and sky are vividly, selectively rendered (“broken mirror,” “air tasted of metal, of old coins and new batteries”), with weather and ground texture shaping mood and movement. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the cracks become a literal map that guides him to the basin, and the man-made desiccation is inseparable from his moral situation. Environmental details track his psychological descent from aerial abstraction to kneeling in mud, charging the final image. A hair shy of perfect only because the physical constraint of the terrain is more symbolic than truly tactical beyond the guidance to the center.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the “silver courtyard under snow” and the “prism sanctuary under starlight” are sensorially rich and firmly anchored early. Environmental logic is consistent (no torches; light born from pressure and memory), and details are POV-filtered in ways that reinforce the emotional economy of secrets and echoes. The courtyard and snowfall meaningfully charge the final image when the flakes hang midair, reweighting the opening weather as a sign of systemic disruption. While the space doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics, it strongly shapes atmosphere and the climactic visual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    The decommissioned radar dome, mezzanine, safety rail, and dormant dish are vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The setting mirrors and pressures the ethics debate (surveillance, incoming fire, blind listening) and physically encodes status—him above, them below—until the perspective-swapping exercise softens that hierarchy. The final image of the dome “listening” as stories choose “to orbit together” is a charged reprise that couldn’t happen in a generic room. World details (bars, puppet stage) are selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “verdant grotto above the clouds” is richly realized and consistently filtered through Erin’s sensibility—ferns exhaling mist, shelves of stone, cloud-shadow altars. Crucially, the environment constrains action: its altitude, drifting nature, and architecture of grass spires and ledges shape how Erin signals and how the monarch can approach and land. Weather and air currents (“interrupted cadences”) materially affect the stakes and tactics. The final image of the grotto drifting on with the sky “embarrassed and forgiven” is charged by all this prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and bone-colored rope are vividly rendered, with details like “spoken breath felt like chiseling glass” and the frost-bearded caretaker giving the place a lived, charged specificity. Setting isn’t postcard; it shapes the premise: the rope descending through an “ice ceiling,” the frozen bells, and the auroral light are integral to how memory is “cast in time.” The environment also charges the final image—“icebound sanctum under aurora,” bells chiming faintly—so the world and the thematic stakes interlock. It’s rich and purposeful, but there are few moments where physical constraints of the environment alter tactics in-scene, which keeps it from going higher.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bunker and rewilded forest, along with storm and roots, are vivid and functional; environment isn’t just backdrop but a live constraint (sealed wings, leaking seams, the road waiting above). Details are filtered through his habits and fears (sensors along roots, rain “rehearsing”), which deepens atmosphere without devolving into a catalog. The bridge dream-setting mirrors and reconfigures the bunker’s logic, using physical path imagery to embody the thematic conflict. The final choice is literally spatial—up vs in—so the setting meaningfully charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace-museum is vivid and specific—incense, dust, electrical hum, tarped reconstructions—and consistently filtered through his scientific-mystical gaze. Environment crucially shapes action: the floodlights and courtyards are what make the magic square projection possible, and the under-patrolled, “between regimes” wing grants him illicit agency. The clay tile functions as a tactile micro-setting object that literally warms at the peak beat. This could edge into 9-band if a specific environmental constraint imposed a harder tactical limit or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The soundless sanctuary is vivid and integral: “air trembled without sound,” “walls shimmered as if they were trapped horizons,” and its shifting architecture directly manifests and pressures the internal work. The ruined car shard is concrete and tactile (“glass resting like snow on my skin”) and slots neatly into the sanctuary’s rules as a remembered-physical space. The music box functions as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image when the sound emerges internally instead of externally. World rules (reality curling to reveal knots) stay consistent and are learned through experience, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard and fog are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with ice, glass, vapor, and cobbles all working as a coherent sensory palette. Setting is not mere backdrop: the fog is an active collaborator, the courtyard a functional workspace, and the frost-glass imagery charges both the process and the final flare. The environmental rules (fog breathing, frost shimmer) stay consistent and directly shape tactics. This world feels specific and lived-in without exposition dump, and the closing image of “suns on glass mountains” pays off early atmospheric choices.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral-orchard is vivid and integral—roots buckle flagstones, branches pierce stained glass, apples shimmer with possible futures, and petals answer his offer. Environment consistently shapes action (improvised climbing, pruning under precarious rafters) and charges the final image of petal “agreement.” Details are strongly filtered through the mender’s eye (quartz lens, glasswork tools repurposed), giving the setting a lived, character-specific texture. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding (smell of soil/fruit, chill stone) at high-pressure beats could add yet more dimensionality.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard on the asteroid, the belt-like catalog hall, and the cramped, dripping bathroom are all sharply rendered and filtered through Elias’s sensibility as curator. Setting is not mere backdrop: the orchard is simultaneously museum and book, directly enabling nonlinear inheritance and literally producing the fruit-pages that drive his realization. The bathroom functions as a micro-setting that constrains behavior (his retreat space, the only room with a door) and becomes the unlikely portal where the rule-set breaks open. The final image—Elias stepping from bathroom mirror into the orchard with a future-fruit—relies entirely on this environment to charge the thematic and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain bookstore is vivid, strange, and functionally integrated: spiraling shelves, phosphorescent indexes, and memory-as-payment all constrain what Lysa can do and how she must pay for it. Her occupational filter (“arcane linguist”) shapes what she notices—gaps in codes, vein-like patterns—so setting and character perception are tightly fused. The environment actively channels her tactics (researching catalog gaps, descending into colder, narrower corridors) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The final image of branching script like leaf veins recharges earlier botanical and architectural details, satisfying the 9+ gate of setting charging the closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival ship is richly evoked through tactile, specific images—rusting carousels, mirror-shooting gallery, fog-filled theater—and the environment evolves meaningfully as the ship shifts and the theater becomes the “garden.” Setting is thoroughly filtered through the narrator’s perception, supporting tone and theme rather than feeling like a tour. The ship’s mutable physics align with the memory/time premise and charge the final transformation of hedges, paths, and painted leaves. While environment doesn’t overtly constrain concrete tactics, it constantly shapes perception and the stakes of identity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mechanism room and clock tower are richly evoked—“gears and pendulums,” “cold metal and older dust”—and tightly interwoven with the magic; altering the rope literally shifts the tower’s workings and the chimes. The setting both constrains and enables choice: only here, with this machinery and ceremonial rope, can she manipulate time. The room’s physical logic remains consistent, and the contrast between mundane diagrams and impossible door deepens the uncanny atmosphere. The final step back into the ordinary hallway is a clean spatial resolution, though a slightly stronger echo of the machinery in the last sentence might intensify the charged return.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harmonic caves, ice curtain, luminous spores, and storm-besieged mountain are richly imagined and tightly integrated with action; the environment literally dictates paths (fork of sound/silence) and enables the protagonist’s tactics. Details are filtered through his professional eye, so specificity (e.g., “examining crack patterns in ice the way astronomers read fractures in light”) feels both atmospheric and functional. The setting directly charges the final image—quiet forged at the mountain’s heart against the storm’s pressure—so world and closure are inseparable. A minor reason this doesn’t push higher is that we don’t see the environment push back in an unexpected way at the climax; it mostly cooperates once he’s chosen correctly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: the “glass humming pavilion,” dead sea, and fused-bone pedestal all shape tone and plausibly constrain what he can do (climb, chart, tend the prism). Environmental details—radio ghosts, rusted railings, ribs of long-dead ships—are filtered through Keeper’s long familiarity and loneliness, avoiding touristy cataloging. The lighthouse/pavilion and prism charge the final image and could not be swapped for a generic ruin without major loss. That said, the environment rarely exerts active physical pressure in the climax beyond atmosphere and elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the stormlit observatory, underclouds, crystal forecourt, and shadowed monuments all shape how memory is perceived, measured, and prioritized. Environmental details are always purpose-driven—the stormlight changing shadow lengths directly alters his sense of which memories are in danger. The final image of him on the balcony above the waking city is charged by everything we’ve learned about this place’s vertical memory economy. A slight reason for not going higher is that the environment constrains mood and method more than forcing a concrete, difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid—the blooming fortress, damp earth, bruised petals, starless sky, and single “orange eye” of his workfire all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details are filtered through his profession and mood (sky as stubborn page, walls as exhaling gardens) and directly charge the final image of the hand above the blooming fortress. Darkness, the archers’ need for it, and the living flora all subtly shape tone and stakes rather than acting as mere backdrop. World rules feel coherent despite the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and the cicada create an unusually vivid micro-setting that perfectly matches the story’s interest in thresholds and exposures. Environmental details are selective and purposeful—“mirrors of water in the stone,” “a hollow in the cliff where waves spoke in echoes”—and consistently filtered through the chronicler’s eye. The objects-as-setting (pool and cicada) explicitly charge the final image and constrain the kind of decision that feels possible here. The only small check is that, while thematically decisive, the physical environment doesn’t strongly limit practical options beyond mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vividly original and fully integrated: the “xenial trellis above the clouds,” rusted sky-farm beams, bunkers below, and inversion physics all shape what the characters can do and feel. Claustrophobia and the father’s reluctance to climb emerge directly from this environment, and clipping to the trellis inverts the usual bunker logic. The porcelain doll and the trellis beams function as micro-settings that channel silence in specific “flavors,” culminating in the charged final image of two bodies and the drifting doll. Weather, clouds, and altitude all meaningfully bear on tone and stakes rather than being decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gondola system, station roof, and drifting prism terrace are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Rian’s sensibility, with details like “star-colored shards across the gondola windows” doing double duty for mood and worldbuilding. The setting actively participates in the concept: a suspended crossing where sound and light interact becomes the natural arena for an experiment in silence. Environmental elements (height, cables, glass, wind) shape what is possible and charge the final image of quiet vaulting across the city. This is near publish-ready atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and thematic: fossilized circuit boards, a kaleidoscopic waterfall of archived media, hourglass fruit trees, and OS-steps all fuse worldbuilding with the memory/preservation theme. Environmental elements genuinely matter—the waterfall as threshold, the orchard as recording/remembrance, the stairway as physicalized system history, and the countdown inscribed in stone. Details are filtered through Ilya’s archival sensibility (e.g., solvents from obsolete data centers), keeping description character-specific rather than touristic. The only restraint on a higher score is that, while wonderfully textured, the environment could constrain his tactical options a bit more explicitly under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary, river, and industrial edge are vivid and tightly selected, with details like “the river gnawed quietly at its own reflection” and dust “like soft gray snow” reinforcing theme and mood. The threshold is not just described but physically felt (“flicker along her skin like static”) and conceptually central. The open-roofed, circular, dust-laden space and its single footprint path shape how the encounter unfolds and deeply charge the final image. Setting, body, and motif interlock to constrain meaning and options.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: bioluminescent mushrooms, drowned city infrastructure, and the idea-physicality rule are all filtered through Mara’s lived familiarity. Environmental details (mushrooms “listening,” drizzle from metaphors, the submarine-like hatch) directly constrain and shape her options at the end. The recurring bolt and hatch design function as micro-setting elements that charge the final choice. Sensory and atmospheric specificity sustain mood without ever feeling like static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Palatine Library and the sepia reading room are rendered with high specificity—dust as “mute constellations,” oak tables like “old tea,” heat in the bricks—anchoring mood and world. Setting is not mere backdrop: the room’s acoustics and history (site of the last council, the table that holds the ring) are essential to the standing-wave conceit and the final image. Objects like the gramophone cart, horn, and ring are integrated into the physical environment in ways that matter to meaning. A slight reason not to go higher is that environment constrains tactics more conceptually than logistically.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vivid, original, and closely tied to both theme and decision—the forbidden experiments and masks concretely stage Calder’s options. Details like “metal trees,” “glass apples,” and “vats of silver soil” feel purposeful rather than decorative, and the endless night creates a sealed, numinous arena for choice. The setting charges the final image of the kingdom sleeping while the orchard unsnaps the future’s strings. It shapes meaning more than physical tactics, but at this length that’s sufficient and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The foster file room is vivid and purposeful—the dust, bowed shelves, humming fluorescents, and boxes with aging handwriting all mirror the neglect of the children’s histories. Setting directly shapes tactics (she uses dust patterns to triage which lives to attend to) and charges the final image of her walking the aisles, hand on spines. The micro-settings of objects (the button, Polaroid) and environment create a coherent, lived-in archive. The only reason this doesn’t nudge higher is that environmental constraints are emotional/intellectual rather than forcing hard physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular and integrated: the memory-trading markets, broken tiles of the tram yard, and puddle reflections all function as worldbuilding and as mechanisms of discovery. The auric lagoon and hidden phone booth are more than postcard images—they’re the only place the erased infrastructure persists and the engine of the story’s climax. Weather and environment actively shape action (Lio nearly turns back when it rains; puddles become the necessary map). The recurring juxtaposition of mundane city and secret, glowing enclave charges the final image of puddles holding the booth’s potential return.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, mist, lake, and mineral tears are intensely specific and filtered through his musical sensibility, creating a fully embodied, textural environment. Setting meaningfully shapes tactics—the acoustics, fog, and “prism atrium in mist” enable his experiments with absence and negative space, and the lake “breathing” through gaps is central to the undoing. Weather and time (“as dewdrops form”) are not decorative; they tune the mood and establish a liminal, half-finished world that mirrors his project. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint (e.g., how remote or demanding this place is to reach) could deepen the cost tied to setting.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skyborne arbor, valley, and hush are vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail that always runs through Lio’s perception. The environment constrains and enables action (sorting grooves, inner bark for monuments, floor opening to roots) and directly charges the final image of planting into the roots as the sky brightens. World rules—the tree as a question, leaves as answers—are internally consistent and learned through observation rather than exposition dumps. The setting strongly supports mood and theme without ever feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and economically rendered: the abandoned depot, subterranean waterfall, and ruined greenhouse are sensorially rich and thematically aligned with buried currents and overgrown time. Specifics like “brass mouths gaped,” “vertical river of glass,” and clock faces on iron stems give the world a memorable texture. Environment doesn’t physically constrain choices much, but the hidden spaces (trapdoor, cavern, archway) structure the narrative’s progression and discovery. The recurring tools/objects (clocks, compass rose) effectively function as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-washed foundry is vivid, concrete, and constantly active in the scene—the leaking roof, steaming crucible, and “coal that never quite died” are all doing story work, not just mood. The environment tangibly constrains choice (it is “the only place left” where this ritual can happen) and physically hosts the transformation via the crucible and rainwater. Recurring objects (foundry, crucible, coin, rain) charge the final image of her stepping back into the night with the altered name. Sensory detail stays selective and purposeful, matching the piece’s lyric aims.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and inseparable from the story’s mechanics: the gorge’s acoustics and the cliff-harp literally channel the dead. Details like “a shy secret spilled across stone” and “a low throat of wind and water” establish both geography and mood in a way filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The gorge constrains the action (narrow spiral path, wind, embedded harp) and charges the final image once the sunrise fully reaches it. This is excellent atmospheric integration, just shy of transcendent because the environment could be pressed even harder against Mara’s body and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ultraviolet forest is not just atmospheric; it functions as an “interface,” actively reading nerve damage and translating it into equations, directly constraining and enabling her choice. Details like leaves pulsing in ultraviolet and cables branching like mycelium are vivid yet purpose-driven, tied to stakes and world logic. The setting charges the final image (forest flaring as her pain “began to factor”), satisfying the high-band gate where environment shapes the ending. World rules are consistent and learned through observation and action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops, the hanging canvases, and the “condensed dusk” on the painter’s fingers all create a specific, atmospheric, and thematically apt setting. Details are filtered well through the narrator’s sensibility as a translator attuned to overlooked signs. The lighthouse lens fragment becomes an object-as-setting that charges the final image and embodies the overlooked histories. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it deeply charges perception and theme, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is outstanding: the abandoned circus ticket office, humming dead wiring, cracked midway, and upside-down mirror room are all vivid and thematically loaded. Details are filtered through the narrator’s technical and ghost-aware eye (e.g., “breath cold as elevator grease,” dust as “slow-motion film”), which grounds the surreal. Environment actively shapes events: the ceiling tiles, fluorescent fixture, shaft depth, and impossible elevator doors literally constrain and reconfigure what can happen. The circus flavor, while atmospheric, could press slightly harder on stakes or history to reach maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard above the cloud-sea is vivid, specific, and omnipresent, with details like “glass trees heavy with translucent books” and the sideways-turning wing integrated into action and stakes. The setting isn’t mere wallpaper: misprints risk rupturing treaties that keep the library aloft, and the environment’s instability manifests as drifting sections and phase shifts. Recurring objects (glass trunks, cloud-pulp, chains) evolve with the plot and charge the final image of a negotiated, more fluid reality. The only slight limitation is that the environment more frames than constrains micro-tactics in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The baroque asteroid, visible time, mirrors, and crystal coils are vividly specific and deeply integrated into action and theme—this never reads like a postcard tour. Environmental rules (time curtains, mirrors as leverage, coils in shards) stay consistent and materially shape choices from Mara’s initial mirror-covering to the final storm walk. The final image of the asteroid as “a theater… of unused possibility” recharges the entire setting with conceptual weight. At this scale it’s hard to see what more the piece could do with place without crowding out character.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is rich, specific, and constantly in play: the workshop above clockmakers, the stairwells where each droplet rings, and especially the stone sphere of the resonance chamber lined with chimes and “dismantled clock hearts.” Environment and objects (rust, lantern, shard, chimes) don’t just decorate but actively constrain tactics and shape the climax. The recurring rust—“red moss” on the lantern, furred hinges, a “covenant” that literally recoils from Elias—charges the final transformation, where light crawls along it and flakes away lies. This is a fully integrated atmosphere that mirrors and pressures the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is outstanding: abandoned loading yard, chemical runoff ditch, cave mouth, and subterranean lagoon all feel tactile and smell-specific, clearly filtered through Elias’s sensory bias. The environment meaningfully constrains and guides action—he can only reach the hinge by following the ditch into the cliff and then crossing the black water, with the skiff as the only viable means. Weather, stone, water, and industrial relics all reinforce the post-factory liminality. Description is lush but purposeful, consistently deepening mood and stakes rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal setting and storm-tossed archway are vivid, tactile, and tightly integrated—the rain, surf, sand, and altar of debris all shape what Mara finds and how she moves. The archway and van form a strong spatial axis, and weather has real presence in her physical experience. The setting also charges the final image conceptually (archway as map center, gatehouse), not merely decoratively. It rarely constrains a concrete choice under pressure, which slightly limits it from the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the amber pavilion, off-season foliage, and etched cathedral glass all contribute directly to mood and meaning rather than feeling touristic. The environment is not just backdrop—the window’s construction and light paths literally explain the flowers and charge the final image of “darkness into a sheltering hand.” Seasonal misalignment (autumn colors in early spring, thawing snow) subtly supports the story’s concern with wrong-time blooming. This is elite-level atmosphere, tightly filtered through Ira’s artistic sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating library and the lagoon are vividly realized (“books swaying like lanterns,” “obsidian lagoon…drink the sky”) and consistently filtered through Maris’s sensibility as an archivist. Setting is not postcard-only: the zeppelin’s height, the rope ladder, and the shore as ritual ground all shape her movements and the terms of the parley. The final image explicitly recharges place (“on the shelves above”) so environment participates in the closure. A slightly stronger sense of the lagoon’s physical peril could have nudged this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly rendered—lanterns, dead moths, black water, brass wish-machine—and consistently filtered through the alchemist’s sensibility. Paper-lantern cove and the bottle aren’t just backdrop; the environment (empty houses, swept streets, dangling ropes) embodies the town’s abandonment and charges the stakes of any “revival.” The amber bottle, reflecting and fracturing lantern-light, becomes a micro-setting that literally and thematically shapes the final realization. Weather and physical surroundings don’t overtly constrain specific micro-choices, which is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard atop the skyscraper is vividly rendered and integrated—gauze-wrapped fruit as labeled promises, lamps dimming, branches “leaning inward”—and consistently filtered through Lan’s ritualistic sensibility. The environment shapes tone and metaphoric stakes, turning the garden into an archive-body rather than a postcard backdrop. While it doesn’t physically constrain options, it does charge the final image as the orchard “tightens” in response to the forbidden content. The specificity and consistency of this setting strongly support the story’s atmosphere and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium, glass ribs, rimed iron balconies, blue-light cradle, and numbered drawers create a vivid, coherent environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting is consistently filtered through the seed saver’s sensibility, tying environment to vocation and theme (last wild seeds, forgotten fields). The acorn cap and egg cradle act as micro-setting objects that charge the ethical choice. While the atrium doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics, it heavily charges mood and stakes in a way that supports the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary above the clouds is vividly realized and consistently filtered through his vocation—ribs of stone, listening dishes, spiral path, and precipice all feel functional rather than decorative. Environmental specifics actively shape options: isolation, altitude, and the open drop foreground how fully his decision is made alone, and the dishes’ shiver at the shadow marks the key pressure spike. The rope and logbook function as micro-settings/tools that constrain his choices and charge the ending (“old prayers pressed into the fibers”). Atmosphere stays tightly aligned with the solstice hush without lapsing into generic weather.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shooting star tracking station and dome are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the action—the dust, old instruments, and dome projections aren’t backdrop but active participants in the scene. The environment shapes what can happen (he is alone in a long-abandoned observatory; the dome becomes the screen of memory and revelation), and the recurring objects (broom, console, lantern glass, dome) directly charge the final image. Sensory details (dust, ozone, metallic tang) filter through his particular attention as a custodian, deepening both atmosphere and character. The setting’s “forgotten” status mirrors and intensifies his own, crucially supporting the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scorched wasteland and ruined apiary are vividly particular and always filtered through the beekeeper’s sensibility (“wind hissed through warped frames with a kind of mute eloquence”). Setting and object-as-setting (hives, shed, stained glass box) aren’t decorative; they actively charge the final image of “a wood of unsaid things” and the conceptual covenant between silence and meaning. Environmental constraints (drought, abandonment, glassy dunes) justify her isolation and the villagers’ flight. The world’s rules around ghosts and the beekeeping craft feel internally consistent and learned through attention, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and thematically integrated: the emerald silo, breathing concrete, and “algae of ages” all fuse worldbuilding with the time-leak premise. The urn fragment and glass cube function as recurring micro-setting objects that directly charge the final image (the narrator’s hand on the glass, feeling the braided current). The garage sale on the cracked driveway and peeled calendars extend the world beyond the silo in specific, grounded ways. Environment shapes meaning more than tactical options, but it does so with high economy and consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lagoon after rain, black rock, metallic water, and mist create a vivid, coherent sensory environment that strongly colors every beat. Setting is not mere backdrop; the lagoon becomes the resonant site of “woven dawns” and the crossing strands that birth the being. Weather and water texture mirror and inflect the internal arc without feeling like simple allegory. The environment charges the final quiet image even if it doesn’t impose hard physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid, original, and constantly in play: basalt pillars, orchard, storm, and copper network all shape what is possible. Environmental specifics (lightning, hollow pillars, living stone) don’t just decorate; they drive the key turn where energy unlocks hidden chambers and redefines the mountain as an interlocutor. The world’s rules—stone learning to speak, trees negotiating with rock—are taught through action, not exposition. The final image of him dying “between them, listening, as everything negotiated peace” is charged precisely because the environment’s agency and history have been so well established.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is excellent: the rainwashed tower, moss “like old handwriting,” overgrown sculpture path, and spiral clearing give a vivid, coherent physical journey that mirrors the thematic one. Details are strongly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility as scientist-skeptic, and the recurring “bronze quiet” of weather and metal deepens atmosphere. The fly amber functions as a micro-setting object, charging the final image in the clearing. The primary constraint is that environment shapes mood and metaphor more than concrete tactical choices; it rarely forces or forbids specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the dead reef, rusting railings, birds on the pier, and under-harbor trenches create a precise, eerie ecology. Details are tightly filtered through the coachman’s vocation (war ruins, seeds, birds, reef), and the environment actively shapes meaning—the dead reef’s “statement” and the jetty’s narrowing charge the final beats. The micro-setting of the crack where the war was fiercest constrains his last act. The balance of visual, tactile, and auditory detail (bird calls, quiver of spent metal) serves the lyric, somber tone without feeling like a static catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scrapyard wasteland, glass cylinder, and waxed autumn leaf are rendered with precise, poetic specificity that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Setting is strongly filtered through the narrator’s priorities (sound, memory, color), and the preserved leaf in particular elegantly charges the final image and theme. Environmental constraints are more emotional than physical—the world doesn’t overtly hem in tactics—but the post-war scarcity and salvage economy quietly shape all available options. Spatial and atmospheric anchoring are clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and tightly integrated: the dust-tasting air, dimmed machines, gilded compass, and folded-distance starfield are all filtered through Elian’s trained, ritualistic gaze. World rules around the dilation deck are consistent and learned through action (lights slow to awaken, delayed breath, lagging stars) rather than exposition dumps. Crucially, the environment constrains behavior (the no-cross compass circle, the shutdown law) and charges the final image of him standing at the viewport claiming this as “north,” so it functions as more than a postcard backdrop. A slight check is that external physical constraints are never put under acute, choice-forcing stress.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, frozen wind rungs, and bruised sky are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the thief’s sensibility. Environment shapes behavior (careful climbing, wind dying at the summit, pedestal of black glass) and charges the final image: “let the wrong sky write me anew.” World details (stormlight, children playing with star-marbles) feel coherent within the piece’s own logic. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, always tied to mood or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    The whispering gallery is exquisitely realized not as postcard but as mechanism—distances, the dome, and echo directly shape behavior (what can be said unseen, how gestures become sound). The chess exhibit and glass case are integrated micro-settings that deepen the atmosphere and thematics of expendability and leaderless systems rather than feeling decorative. The environment constrains tactics (no touch, only echo; voices disembodied), which in turn births the narrator’s archival practice. The final image—floor and dome continuing to whisper routes only their feet could have written—would collapse without this specific architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain bookstore is extraordinarily vivid—“absences in stone,” “ink spring,” moving-ink map—and always filtered through the narrator’s longing and dislocation. Setting is not postcard; it funnels the protagonist downward into isolation and into contact with the stone, and the physical corkscrew structure mirrors the internal spiral. The storm and muffled thunder over the mountain charge the final image and tie atmosphere directly to the thematic realization about hidden grief. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment during the climax could push this even higher, but it’s already elite.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and rule-coherent: frozen raindrops, unmoving thunderclouds, the gleaming Platinum Labyrinth, and the tapestry all feel integral rather than decorative. Environment and object-as-setting directly constrain action: the labyrinth is in the woven border, and solving it requires tactile interaction with that environment. World rules (time-freeze except for Elior, pawn, and tower) are consistent and learned through observation and action, not exposition dumps. The final image of raindrops resuming their fall recharges the earlier atmosphere with clear stakes and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bone canyon, pale spire, and hollowed femur home are vividly drawn and threaded through the entire piece, with environmental details like the “forged hush” and knuckle chimes doing double duty as mood and theme. The setting meaningfully charges the final image—Maren seeing “pale shimmer” bands as alternate selves walking below—and the ritual geography (cliff, descent, central spire) underpins the story’s logic. World rules around confession and the spire’s listening are clear without exposition dumping. The main limiter is that the environment inspires and mirrors rather than sharply constraining tactical choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is not decorative; it constrains every action, supplies both risk and tools, and culminates in the final image of the workshop as “a page mid-sentence.” Sensory detail is rich but purposeful—smoking emerald acid, rusted miracles, the hiss of neutralizing vapors—all filtered through Corin’s alchemical mindset. The environment directly shapes tactics: the glass lung, the rising sea, the trapdoor, and the fracture in the cylinder all arise from, and feed back into, the setting’s rules. The concluding parallel between the workshop’s “rusted lungs” and the glass lung’s kintsugi seam is an exemplary setting-charged closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the quay, shack, broken mirror, and coastal cave network are rendered with tactile, selective detail and a strong sensory palette. The environment isn’t just decorative; the labyrinthine caves, moonlit shaft, glass-like pool, and “frozen waves” of stalagmites directly shape the central vision and final image. The recurring objects-as-setting (mirror, seashell, pool) charge the ending, with the pool literally holding color as keeper of the secret. This integration of place with mood and meaning is nearly publication-ready at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly and economically realized—the cobalt lighthouse, mist, cooled stone, horn, and lamp are tactile, specific, and filtered through Mara’s perceptions. The environment and tools actively constrain choices: the rail humming with “old nights,” the lens as “eye of the coast,” and the horn vs. light dichotomy are all structurally tied to what she can and does do. Weather (heat wave breaking, mist returning) meaningfully inflects both mood and stakes. This is publish-ready atmospheric work, just shy of perfect because there’s still a slight sense of aesthetic luxuriance over constraint in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The starlit signal station, the mountain’s “fractured spine,” the dead hydraulics, and the phosphorescent ceiling panels are vivid and tightly woven to Rian’s task and limits. The moon-dependent light and the analog consoles directly constrain what kind of navigation is possible, and the censer foot functions as both tool and relic that charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cables like veins, antennae shivering), never mere wallpaper. The environment quietly mirrors the inner work—collapsed infrastructure bearing tenuous, almost sacred communication—without over-explicit symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hanging orchard over a void, cable-slung pods, and crawling storms create a distinctive, sensorially rich environment that clearly shapes mood and social arrangements. Specific details—the ladder that hums, the ravine as a “socket” for the glass eye—are strongly filtered through the narrator’s mind and recur meaningfully in the final image. The setting does exert some constraint (isolation, suspended pods, dependence on cables), though most pressure is emotional rather than logistical. It very effectively charges tone and theme, even if it seldom forces concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the “opal dock in mist,” rusted lighthouse, and bone-colored Edelweiss all filter through the narrator’s eye and reinforce liminality and isolation. Environmental details are not postcard filler; the dock’s glow, ropes, and cataract windows all mirror the story’s concern with obscured perception. The Edelweiss and lighthouse recur as charged micro-settings/objects that frame obligation and death, directly feeding the final image. While the physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it strongly charges the mood and meaning of every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the blooming cavern, iron-and-blossom air, and undecided stone are all filtered through Elias’s map-and-foundry sensibility. Environmental elements actively constrain choice—the rising creek, narrowing passage, low ceiling, and petal-curtains make hesitation dangerous. The matrix chip and stone wall worked as a micro-setting at the climax, literally becoming the doorway that charges the final image. Sensory detail is dense but never generic, and consistently advances mood and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain realm, storm, and ridge path are vivid and selective, with the environment concretely constraining choice (dangerous ledge, thin air, storm vs clear bruise of sky). The ember/cobalt grotto above the clouds is a strong, non-generic setting whose properties (dripping dark starlight, shard-like ceiling) directly shape the final revelation. Sensory detail is integrated through Isera’s bias, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. The setting palpably charges the last image without over-explaining world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus is vividly realized—slag basin, rusted rails, furnace light—and always filtered through Lio’s sensibility as a “pocket-sun alchemist,” which prevents any museum-tour feel. Environment and objects aren’t just backdrop: the nexus is where discarded heat and discarded feelings collect, where both his work and his friends’ secret converge, and that specific place is exactly what Kira wants to “bring… with us somehow.” Recurring objects (pocket sun, shell) are handled as tools and symbols whose physical properties (heat, resonance geometry) matter to the plan. The setting directly charges the final image: this particular basin of gathered heat is what he’s now trying to encode and “return differently,” not an abstract anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain ranger cabin, thin air, cemetery, and sky are all sharply rendered and consistently filtered through his perspective (“ceiling beams looked like frozen lightning,” “pines shrinking into a dark comb on the mountain’s scalp”). The environment is not postcard-static: altitude and “sleeping too close to the sky” are the precondition for the entire job and his condition, and the final hovering image depends on the spatial relationship between cabin and graves. Weather and atmosphere (“ghost weather,” wind, accusing thin air) meaningfully echo his fractured temporality without over-explicit symbolism. The setting stops just short of directly constraining a concrete tactical choice in the climax, which keeps it under a 9-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The water clock shop is vividly realized—“tall glass columns,” “marked scales,” “towering column crazed with fine cracks”—and all description is filtered through Mara’s sensory deprivation and the client’s awe. The environment directly shapes meaning: time becomes visible as dripping water, and placing the screw at the base of the oldest clock charges both the physical space and the final image. Fog outside vs. dense air inside deepen the “occluded views” motif and mirror the characters’ emotional states. The shop could not be swapped for another setting without collapsing the story’s logic and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The floating rock platform, cloud sea, storm below, and anti-gravity tea stream create a vivid, coherent environment that is constantly present and integrated with action. The setting exerts pressure (any gust could shove them into thunderheads; tethering chains sing; talismans flicker) and charges both the “breath between storms” concept and the final image of descent through mist. Objects like the cup and quill are spatially and sensorially grounded, and the weather meaningfully mirrors and constrains Lan’s emotional state without feeling like a cliché. The final line explicitly fuses setting with theme (“an inkwell of weather”), so environment directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the sheet music archive, copper veins, flickering fluorescents, and reel‑to‑reel all both color atmosphere and function as occult “switchboard.” The antique perfume bottle and the orchard’s hush recur and decisively charge the ending—the scent unlocks Liora’s memory and the outside trees framing the last image enact the story’s “imperfect miracle” of rerouting, not saving. Environmental details are filtered through Mirabel’s bias as a metaphor‑driven exorcist, so even electricity and ink behave in character. The space also constrains options: the induced currents and machine determine the method and idiom of contact, rather than being decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple library is richly realized and functionally designed: folded corridors, spiral geometry, and the obsidian lectern all directly shape the ritual and constrain his movement. The nested rings of books and the central space for the dictionary beautifully charge the final image and make the environment inseparable from the story’s logic. The “library stones” holding afterimages of prior cycles integrate setting with cosmology rather than serving as backdrop. This is immersive and purposeful, with the only restraint being the piece’s preference for poetic over tactile detail at times.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    The horizon measurement station and the fjord are vividly, economically rendered and entirely inseparable from the story’s premise and stakes. Details like brass pipes, water bowls, salt-furred walls, and the “vast protractor” of the horizon filter directly through his occupational gaze. The environment shapes both his tactics (going to the roof instead of the control room) and the final image (key on the parapet, listening to the sea). The setting’s measuring function is thematically fused with his realization about what is and isn’t truly being measured.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hangar, the bioluminescent mushroom grids, and the mycelial nets are vivid, particular, and tightly filtered through the narrator’s professional gaze. Setting is not postcard: the ex-military hangar, badge-locked dock, and permeable mycelium explicitly mirror and pressure the security-versus-permeability dilemma. The reinforced plastic door and its scratches charge the final image and constrain choice; the environment is inseparable from the thematic and plot beats. It stops just short of a 9+ because physical constraints rarely force specific tactics beyond the binary of door locked vs opened.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful—the rainwashed midsummer library, blurred stone lions, wet-wool/ink/clover smell, and smeared-comet subway lights all filter through her anxious, analytical mind. The library and archives aren’t mere backdrop; they physically enable the discovery of the note and the “lantern trick” that restructures her view of her father. The rain motif and “clover bright” return in the ending image, charging the final mood without heavy-handed symbolism. Environment doesn’t rigidly constrain tactical choices, but it consistently shapes perception and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subway utility tunnel, the “concrete throat,” and the maintenance alcove are vividly and economically rendered, with imagery doing double duty for mood and theme. Setting functions as more than backdrop: Lena’s literal position beneath the city mirrors her liminal emotional role, and the utility tunnel becoming a “narrow, echoing bridge” at the end genuinely charges the closure. Micro-setting details like the flickering streetlamp and the glass disc are woven into action and choice, not merely described. The only thing keeping this just shy of top-tier is that the tunnel itself doesn’t materially constrain tactics in the central beat, functioning more symbolically than as a lived obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The jetty, bay, barnacles, phosphorescence, and festival-detritus are vividly rendered and always filtered through the archivist’s sensibility, giving us a lived-in, slightly uncanny harbor. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tide’s timing, the jetty’s far end, and the sea’s behavior (swelling, curling like a page) all shape when and how the ritual and Mara’s arrival occur. The recurring ledger/ink/jetty triad charges the final image of her writing under the stars, making the environment an active participant in closure. A slight tempering is that physical constraint is more atmospheric than tactical, but the world rules feel internally consistent and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The disused, ivy-choked railway station is economically but vividly evoked—rusted timetables, cracked tiles with ferns, shelves of stalled objects, a “crude map of broken rivers” underfoot. These details are filtered through the story’s sensibility; the environment clearly supports the tone and concept of unfinished exchanges. The setting does some subtle work charging the moon rock (ivy trembling, invisible timetable), but it doesn’t strongly constrain choice or tactics. As a result, it’s atmospherically excellent but stops short of fully embedding itself as a functional obstacle or resource in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly specific and inseparable from Orrin’s tactics: its inaudible hum, tactile languages, and sudden silence at the clearing all directly guide his choices. Details like “sap-slow grammar of trees” and “notes…bright needles in the ultrasonic hum” feel organic to his sensory reality rather than decorative. The environment constrains movement (following vibrations and notes instead of sight) and charges the final stillpoint, though you could lean even more on how the forest physically restricts or taxes him for a perfect 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    The observatory at the edge of a gravitational anomaly is not just atmospheric; the skewed gravity shapes movement, mood, and the sense of possible drift, and later reads as a cradle reacting to his edits. The anomaly’s physical behavior (buckling floor, objects leaning, the anomaly “deepening”) is woven into the beats where choices occur, not dumped. The pen itself functions as a charged micro-setting-object, its heat and glow constraining and enabling action. The final image of him rocked by the anomaly while editing his timelines richly recharges earlier spatial details.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harbor is vivid and specific (“bowl of spilled stars,” rigging clinks, fish jumps), and the environment is consistently filtered through Lena’s mood. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it does charge the ritual—water, moonlight, and stillness become the medium in which silence is mapped. The recurring harbor details evolve toward the end, where her laugh “harmonizes” with the quiet as if the place had been waiting for that note. This strong integration falls just short of the very top band because the harbor remains more symbolic/aesthetic than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive is vivid and specific—collapsed amphitheater, rockslide entrance, soot-tasting air, radial stone shelves, central well with a suspended tapestry—and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The environment constrains and charges action: the hidden entrance, the descent into the shaft, and the arrangement of artifacts all shape how the narrator encounters the message and the final image literally hanging in the well. Details like wind keening through broken seating and ash layered over a buried world echo the themes without feeling schematic. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical risk and tactical implications of the space are more lightly sketched than the atmospheric ones.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the sound wave garden, concentric stone ripples, subsonic chords, and auric lagoon all feel tactile and specific while mirroring the story’s concerns with resonance and entanglement. Environment consistently shapes action (she follows vibrations, hides behind stone, perches on the rail, uses the water’s responsiveness as a communication channel). World rules are learned through sensory experience rather than exposition, and the garden’s rings explicitly charge the final image of “rings of possibility.” This is elite-caliber atmosphere and specificity, just shy of perfect due to its almost unrelieved lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The container maze, seawall, cranes, and aurora are sharply drawn and always filtered through Milo’s professional familiarity, giving the setting both lyric charge and functional pressure. The environment directly shapes tactics: radios and compasses fail, echoes tangle shouts, vents carry whispers, and the storm’s interference justifies Milo’s analog methods. Objects like the key and maps work as micro-setting, physically routing air and possibility. This integration of place, weather, and system with the plot is strong enough to feel distinctive and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canal, dock, rain-slick boards, and the single watching house are vividly rendered and do more than decorate: water, lamplight, and elevation physically enable the silent code between guardian and dentist. The “cobalt dock after rain” and “bruised glass” canal are strongly atmospheric without losing spatial clarity. Crucially, the environment channels light into “trembling constellations” that charge the final image. The only small constraint is that the exact “cobalt after rain” specificity is more tonal than structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and thematically bound: the “cobalt library,” Maple Street mist, and magnetic grotto all feel specific, atmospheric, and purposeful. Spatial logic (windows arrayed like a chessboard, visible from the council balcony) directly shapes the plan and outcome. Environmental detail evolves with the action—the fog on the night of the displays sharpens lights and attention. The final grotto scene recharges the entire physical world of the story as a medium for “forests of second thoughts.”

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, pilings, and “sublittoral fringe” are rendered with precise, atmospheric specificity, filtered through Mara’s bodily familiarity with the work and water. The recurring scrimshaw bone functions as a micro-setting object, anchoring the magic and charging the final image. World rules about post-violence infrastructure are concise yet integrated into scene and dialogue. While the disappearing island itself remains more suggestive than explored, that elusiveness suits the theme rather than feeling like a gap.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and thematically integrated: turbines as “pale, turning skeletons,” mechanical cheer, surveillance sensors, the cracked yard, and the chipped kitchen all mirror the emotional desiccation. Objects—the mug, bouquet, pine block, and final hybrid carving—function as a micro-setting and charge the last image. The turbines’ presence constrains behavior (fear of being reported, need for performative joy) and literally “overshadows” the farmhouse, then is conceptually folded into the hush. It falls just shy of higher scores only because physical constraints from the environment don’t materially alter tactics beyond atmospheric surveillance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are exceptionally vivid and integrated: the humming quartz responds to steps and voice, the skylight and dust function as a listening audience, and the ice mirrors the town’s muted history. Details are consistently filtered through Lio’s sensibility (cloud-shadow, weather, sound), avoiding tourist-catalog description. The environment actively shapes meaning at the end—his movement off the dais into the colonnade literalizes “striding through boundaries,” and the singing stone becomes a co-witness to his defiance. The only minor limit is that the physical setting rarely constrains concrete options; its pressure is thematic and atmospheric rather than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courtyard, ash, kiln, glass, and plant arrangements create a vivid, coherent micro-world filtered through Mira’s sensory bias. Setting details (mute glassblower, plant alphabet, kiln-warm air, glowing seams of ash) are integral to tone and thematics rather than postcard garnish. The recurring plant-as-setting element directly charges the final image of blooming and so participates in closure. The environment constrains meaning and mood more than physical options, but it does so with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly realized and deeply integrated: the “laboratory of lost sounds,” cracked cylinders, jars of silent bird calls, and dormant tape all echo the story’s concern with absence, memory, and restoration. Environmental specifics (tower height, blackout, emergency lantern, prism lens) tangibly shape perception and tactics, as when she follows “the colors bending through the lens” instead of the score. The mood and physical space meaningfully constrain who comes here and why it feels “honest” after the blackout. This environment is inseparable from both premise and closure, charging the final tactile image of connection at her fingertips.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is richly specific and tightly integrated: rotating dome, central shaft, “chandelier of ghosts,” and the building’s very ribs becoming tattoo lines. Environment shapes both method (where birds are placed) and final image (the scars of the metal glowing, her path lit up), so setting is not postcard but mechanism for meaning. The “timeless” suspension from clocks subtly reinforces her stuckness and the long exposures of grief itself. Minor sensory range beyond the visual is limited, but what’s present is so focused and thematically apt that it still reads as elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, dangling cables, and flickering obsolete machines create a vivid, coherent environment that mirrors the thematic pivot from digital to analog belief. The setting isn’t just decorative: emergency power, rain, and the high, isolated loft enable this candlelit, off-grid ritual and charge the final image of “another map quietly began to form.” A slight bias toward visual detail over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lost civilization archive and the bronze prism pagoda are richly realized and tightly integrated, with environmental details (“dust fell in slow spirals,” “air around it folded like a many-sided mirror”) fully filtered through Hiran’s perception. The setting is not postcard: the pagoda’s behavior and the archive’s seclusion directly constrain what he can do and charge the final image of him remaining underground. World rules around memory and artifacts stay consistent and are revealed through interaction, not exposition dumps. This is near top-tier work, just shy of utterly transformative environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “blooming library above clouds” is vivid, with petals of light, scents, and the descent into a dust-and-tape underlayer; the river stone functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Setting is consistently filtered through Lio’s sensibility and supports the mood and theme rather than feeling like postcard description. The world’s rules (shareable dreams, Archive layers, Overseer) are learned through action and remain internally consistent. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain logistics, it strongly charges choices and the ending image, which earns it a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The workshop, mist, stars, and fox are vivid and tightly filtered through Liora’s emotional state, avoiding generic atmosphere. The vial, wire, and eventual crossroads installation function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image rather than as mere props. Environmental details like the “packed-earth floor” and “twisted length of wire that gleamed like a snake” embed us physically in the space. The setting shapes the mode of response (forging a public object) even if it doesn’t impose hard logistical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower room, dawn light, and especially the plants, coffee, and hourglass are rendered with rich, POV-filtered specificity that shapes mood and meaning. The environment is not mere backdrop: plant telepathy and the coffee ring are the mechanisms by which the new “miracle” reveals itself. The recurring atmospheric cues (“meteor hush,” the ivy at the window) come back in the final image to charge the thematic shift. Setting operates as micro-stage and symbolic pressure without slipping into generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vintage movie palace and projection booth are richly evoked through selective, sense-driven detail (“rain braided the neon,” “dust, hot metal, and slept-through matinees”). Setting is tightly integrated with theme: the palace as a heart that’s lost its beat, the booth as a repository for cut scenes, and the final image of the film cooling in her hand. The environment meaningfully frames the premise but doesn’t quite constrain a concrete tactical choice in the moment, which keeps it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit archway, valley, and city are vividly realized and tightly woven into the action, not just painted behind it. The archway keystone spiral and the aurora “tunnel” directly shape what can happen and how the ritual works, and the final rest against the “cooling archway stones” charges the last image. Sensory detail is rich and POV-filtered (air that tastes of metal and cold flame, sky sounding like breathing). A slight constraint is that geography affects mood more than tactical options, but for lyric short work it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “glowing dune in bloom,” buried tracks, ash, rusted signal towers, and the chess clock create a highly specific world that is both visually vivid and conceptually functional. Setting is never postcard-only; the dune archives possibilities, the buried rails guide his path, and the clock plus micro-sites (tunnels, gutted cars) shape his tactics for placing and charging sparks. World rules about ash, bioluminescent sand, and quantum-like wave functions stay internally consistent while remaining mysterious. The final beats—pressing his ear to the glass, the dune humming—are inseparable from this environment and its tools.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid, specific, and multisensory—brass leaves dripping oil, gears in ironwood trunks, copper-filings soil—and these details are filtered through the narrator’s analytic sensibility. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: he uses wind-sound through different trees to navigate, and the forest’s constructed canopy literally houses the missing gear that drives the climax. The platform over mercury and overhead mechanism are tightly integrated into the final choice and image. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk or constraint from the environment would be needed to push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, mist, ridgeway, and stilted ferry house are vividly evoked and consistently tied to liminality (“when the world forgot…which parts…were land and which were still becoming sea”). The internal stair and unseen sea are an effective micro-setting for the final crossing, and the environment mirrors Mara’s psychological state without slipping into muddled symbolism. Weather and terrain don’t much constrain specific tactics beyond mood, but the in-between quality of place clearly charges the final image. Overall, the world feels textured, coherent, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cobalt fortress under snow, the revolving lobby, and the bruised spiral staircase are vivid, textured, and integrated with action rather than decorative. Setting rules (silence makes the fortress invisible to storms) are consistent and directly govern tactics and stakes. The staircase bruise and the snowstorm both constrain choice and charge the ending image, with cracks and incoming snow literalizing the thematic break. Environmental detail is economical yet highly specific, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “ancient temple library lost in time,” with dust-heavy light, worm-eaten scrolls, and ribs of stone, is vividly rendered and consistently refracted through the titan’s perspective. The environment is not postcard-only: its temporal distortions and book-circulation logic directly dictate his method (messages in books) and make possible the ending (a scholar from a skewed time-slice arriving to read them). The stalled heavens and mis-shelved volumes metaphorically and practically underpin the story’s stakes about lineage, remembrance, and drift. Setting remains integrated with action and theme to the final moment, charging the closure image of realization in the stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is superbly realized: “station hums like a tired lung at the edge of the drowned city,” intake grates catching paper like jellyfish, vanished archipelagos under sixty meters of water. The environment is not just backdrop; the station’s function (sea-level monitoring, periodic assemblies, rooftop vantage) and the drowned geography directly enable the discovery of the atlas page and the charged final vision. Details are tightly filtered through a marine-professional gaze, keeping the world both plausible and eerie. The final image of being “drifting moored above paths” elegantly fuses physical setting with conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport bay and the anomalous stone circle are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility (“cathedral arches,” “votive candles”). Environment and recurring objects aren’t just decorative: the deck’s vibration, the stones’ hum, and the opera glasses all shape how she perceives her choice and charge the final image of the message sent “at the stones, in the margin of daylight.” Worldbuilding is economical yet suggestive (rebellion, curfew, grounded shuttles) and never devolves into a tourist catalog. The environment functions as a constraint and a ritual space, directly supporting the story’s last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic hot springs, sulfur pools, steam “ghost ribs,” and shattered greenhouses are richly realized and constantly refracted through the narrator’s perceptions and plant-connections, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. Setting actively shapes key actions: roots and moss surface the embryo, the cedar and cliff grasses teach the kite script, and the hot springs literally carry the unsealed destiny away in the final image. World rules (eruption, academy vaults, guided children) feel consistent and are mostly shown via interaction rather than dumped. The environment’s role in the last paragraph—“the springs had learned to dream their own futures too”—charges the final image in a way that’s both concrete and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum, cliff, fog, and dead lighthouse are vivid and constantly refracted through her trauma and aims: no-drone airspace, plants leaning toward an absent light, sea lavender in concrete. Setting shapes both logic and meaning of her choices—this is where “safe but not unreal” is physically realized. The final image of the clear tram path along the cliff and the dark lighthouse recharges the whole environment as a frame for partial healing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with ocean, glass, and plants all doing thematic work rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse-library setting is vivid, textured, and integrated with theme: the sea’s “slow pulse,” salt-stained light, circular walls, and lantern stairwell all echo fragmentation and guidance. The environment constrains and shapes action—his refuge, his descent into the darker base, the presence of obscure volumes and nautical/tidal materials. Recurring objects (tarot box, windows reflecting his lover, the stairwell) charge the final image rather than remaining postcard details. A slight additional sense of the physical hazard or isolation of the lighthouse could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The desert, wind-carved encampment, eclipse light, and the tent interior are vivid and consistently filtered through Iren’s professional and emotional priorities. Objects-as-setting (the Painted Table, the ink, Kesh) are strongly integrated, with the ink and table literally structuring the central experiment and final gesture. Environmental touches like the wind “carving fresh lines in the sand that Kesh recorded…like a second script” deepen the thematic patterning of written/edited reality without feeling ornamental. The setting does more to charge mood and concept than to constrain tactical choice, but it’s specific and tonally cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “echoing library under snow” and subzero vault are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Ana’s professional eye. Environment constrains choice—the isolation and storm make this the one plausible night to act—and the cold, shafts of ice, and machines “that dreamed” all charge the final image of her decision swallowed by the library and listening snow. World rules around truth as controlled substance and cultural quarantine feel coherent and are learned organically. It’s very strong atmospheric work that shapes stakes, not just backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    The desert rose farm under a cracked glass dome is vividly realized and suffused with function: roses that “drink light” and store memory, the veined dome, and airship sandbag all embed history and constraint. Setting is always filtered through Mara’s sensibility (feeling fractures, tasting fear in soil), so worldbuilding never turns into a tourist catalog. The environment meaningfully shapes options—neutral ground status, raiders’ hesitation, physical containment under the dome—and charges the final image of walking among “roses of patience and continuity.” The dome, soil, and plants are inextricable from the story’s logic and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sound wave garden, the rail spike, and the sleepwalking constellations are vivid, specific, and all do work: the garden constrains motion and sound, the spike anchors and later conducts silence, the constellations literally guide him to the “throat.” Sensory detail is rich across modalities (sound, touch, taste of salt) and always filtered through his profession and goal. The environment directly shapes tactics (zigzagging to bend pitch, timing the attempt to the hour when patterns break). This is exemplary micro- and macro-setting use with the rail spike charging the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory above the clouds is vivid, tactile, and thematically loaded: “glass-limbed lighthouse,” telescopes aimed down, echoing heels like a gavel all merge setting with stakes. Environment constrains the piece—this secret mountaintop vantage is the physical embodiment of Orpheus and her inherited power. Key objects (telescopes, console, pen nib) are integrated into action and the final choice. A slight pullback from 9+ comes from the world rules around emotion-tuned cameras being gestured at rather than grounded through concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid, strange, and lived-in—dusty vinyl air, tape machines, wax cylinders, broken phones—filtered through a narrator who knows how each device functions. Setting isn’t just decorative: the mixing board, server rack, and baby monitor all constrain tactics and make the final act (patching an old phone through the board to feed the firmware) feel inevitable. Recurring objects, especially the amber with the insect, accrue thematic weight and charge the final decision image. I’m holding this just under the very top band because environmental constraints are more conceptual/emotional than physically or socially limiting in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto, mist, sand mandala, and whispering tiles create a fully realized, sensorially rich micro-world filtered through Lark’s sensibility (“soft, lilac unease,” “smudging faces, making every profile look half-erased”). Setting is not backdrop; it actively shapes options—the emergent hush polices speech, the tile translates secrets, the mandala’s destruction anchors the ritual’s purpose. The environment decisively charges the ending image as she presses the tile into the sand, though one might wish for a slightly clearer sense of physical taboo or risk attached to altering the sacred mandala.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptionally specific and integrated: “ancient plaza beneath the shattered sky,” half-bitten towers, broken minarets, the single standing minaret, the naming pillar, and the mosaic stones all shape both magic and meaning. Environment and object-as-setting are not decorative; the tessera, stepping stone, and pillar directly constrain the method and locus of change. The shattered sky and fire-scarred plaza mirror the city’s psychic fracture and charge the final image of ruins that remain but feel newly breathable. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that never slips into a static tour.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through Lina’s synesthesia and Marcel’s theatricality: the maze, orchard, pears, and fountain all feel lived-in and enchanted without exposition. Environmental details actively charge the action—the garden “brightens” around the coin, the maze carries applause echoes, and the theater’s pending gutting contextualizes the urgency. The tarot coin and the maze/orchard function as micro-settings that constrain options: they must meet here, after closing, to work this magic at all. The only thing holding this just below 9 is that the environment shapes mood and meaning more than concrete tactical choice at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The light painting studio, fiber brushes, projector glow, and geode all create a tactile, atmospheric micro-setting that syncs with the story’s concern with paths of light and mental mapping. Details are filtered through Eli’s state (the room “falls away” into remembered light paths; breath clouds in faint beams), avoiding white-room syndrome. The recurring geode and light-painting imagery charge the final “compass” idea meaningfully. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it does subtly frame what choices feel available.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is one of the story’s great strengths: the “black stone corridors,” whale-rib ceiling, brine basins, and still pool all feel vivid and tactically relevant. The environment not only colors mood but constrains action (tides, descent, hidden drop into water) and underwrites the liminal theme of between-worlds mapping. Tools and objects (lantern, fossil, printed-alloy body) are tightly integrated and recur with shifting charge. This is near top-tier atmospheric work, just shy of 9-band in how strongly it constrains a specific choice under acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “amber warehouse beneath cliffs,” humming cliffs, resinous crates, and dust “like slow constellations” create a vivid, coherent environment that’s inseparable from the story’s logic. The cliffs’ hum and its rare absence concretely constrain timing and security, while the guarded, confiscatory nature of the warehouse motivates Mara’s elaborate mapping scheme. The setting also charges the final image as the freed echo threads through every relic, turning the warehouse into a vessel of “raw possibility.” This is rich, specific, and purpose-driven without feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the mist swallowing sound, the cliff, the abandoned weather station, and the snowfield all filter through a spy’s trained perception. Environment isn’t decorative—the snow literally encodes Mara’s message, the mist shapes mood and sensory focus, and the seasonal edge (late winter/early spring) enables both snow codes and their imminent erasure. The final image of mist thinning and spring sounds directly charges the thematic shift. This is near top-tier atmospheric work, just shy of utterly singular world-feel.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog-bound river, hill-village, coach, and crossing are rendered with precise, atmospheric detail that feels fully inhabited (“Mist smeared the lanternlight into halos, soft as breath…”). The environment is not just backdrop: the river and fog literalize the story’s liminality and palimpsest logic, and the final image of the opposite bank as a “blank page” meaningfully recharges earlier setting motifs. Weather and terrain also subtly constrain tactics (waiting for oars, horses feeling out the rutted path, the skiff as necessary intermediary). It stops just short of 9+ because setting rarely forces a concrete on-page choice so much as it pervasively colors and frames them.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The oasis, ruined hives, central well, and scorched wasteland are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme and action—the environment is never postcard backdrop. The setting constrains choices (water scarcity, isolation) and charges the final image as sprouts emerge along the well wall in direct response to his movements. Professional detail (pottery, kilns, sun patterns) is woven through in a way that feels lived-in rather than expository. This is excellent environmental integration; the only reason it doesn’t reach higher is the global cap from a not-quite-exceptional Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and fully integrated: the fifth-floor fire escape, alley “throat,” and luminous harbor by moonlight are not backdrop but active participants. The environment and objects (fire escape, rosebush, harbor light, hanging shards, the bitting gauge tooth) literally constrain and enable her choice to create a light-reflecting apparatus. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, with the harbor and brick acting as externalizations of her inner life. The final image—garden humming in glass and leaves as harbor bells ring—feels inseparable from this particular place.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal library, stone circle, and mist pit are vivid and consistently filtered through Lio’s perspective, with details like shelves as “anchored ships” and pages “like startled birds” doing double duty as atmosphere and world-building. The environment meaningfully shapes action: Lio must use the circle and its hum to activate the sundial; the library’s tides and verticality frame both risk and solace. The final image—library adjusting its tides in concert with Lio—charges the setting with thematic weight rather than leaving it as backdrop. It just falls short of using the environment as a hard physical constraint under duress, which keeps it below the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are sensually and specifically rendered—“lotus milk,” scaffolds like “patient herons,” the oculus as “a healing wound.” Setting isn’t postcard décor: the storm and pond deliver the nest, the rising temple specifies the commission’s liminal stage, and the final light-sheet on wet stone mirrors the narrator’s internal uncoiling. Environmental details recur and evolve, charging the final image without over-symbolizing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The university radio station and tower are richly realized through tactile and auditory detail—“the building’s nervous hum,” “guy-wires thrummed…in her teeth,” ceiling dust, exit light on charts. Setting constrains choice: access to the Void band, sub-bass equipment, and the tower sale itself all arise from this specific environment. The final image of the Void rattling window glass ties environment directly into closure. A minor limitation is that the broader campus/defense world stays mostly conceptual rather than spatially or socially textured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and integral: the canyon’s narrowing walls, the impossible geometry of the corridors, and the starbeam that both orients and misleads all shape his choices. The temple’s “spatial mutiny” is learned through physical navigation—doorways, pillars, and shifting corridors—not exposition dumps. Environment and micro-setting (the starlit nexus, the brass tube, the midnight staircase) directly constrain his tactics and charge the final image of descent. This is nearly exemplary, just shy of utterly transformative world-building at the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quarry in mist is vividly and economically rendered, with gravel, floodlights, and damp pages grounding the lyricism. Setting is firmly filtered through Jonas’s sensibility, turning weather and light into extensions of his way of “seeing” absence. The environment subtly affects action—the hush, limited visibility, and treacherous stone make the final slip feel plausibly ominous. While it doesn’t rigidly constrain choices, it strongly charges tone and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station is vividly and economically rendered—the sweating walls, spongey bunk, bruised sky, and groaning towers all serve both mood and metaphor. Environmental conditions (isolation, constant damp, weather focus) plausibly shape the premise: why exiles are sent here, why the data matters, why the dread is inescapable. The submerged old platform and the copper nail in the final image tightly fuse setting and theme. The setting constrains options more conceptually than through concrete on-page obstacles, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain pullout, chasm, scaffolded overpass, and truck headlights are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with action (the map-flutter as new “geography” for the song, dust in the beams, gravel shivers answering the music). Environment constrains and charges choices: the bridge under repair, the dangerous switchbacks, and the elevated vantage make the fiddler’s watch-and-play response feel necessary rather than abstract. The recurring objects-as-setting—the violin, bridge, and glass flake—directly charge the final image of the road “collapsing into the one ahead.” Strong as is; one more tactile interaction with the scaffolding itself could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered and suffuses the piece—rust, calliope wheeze, ringmaster’s car, chalk sigils—and it functions as both emotional refuge and thematic engine. The environment concretely shapes choices (this is where he stores the inheritance, where he returns to process collapse) and charges the final image of circling tracks and repeated routes. Details are filtered through his history; nothing reads like neutral postcard description. This is publish-ready atmosphere and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    The celestial observatory is vividly evoked (“domed roof,” “slit of the dome,” “lamps…a hollow of midnight solace,” “variable stars…like breathing written in light”) and filtered clearly through the narrator’s sensibility. The setting’s tools (telescope, star charts) aren’t just decorative; they enable the decoding method and literalize the theme of mapping suffering onto the sky. However, the environment largely supports and reflects interior states rather than constraining choices or imposing concrete obstacles. The specificity and atmosphere are excellent, but the setting stops just short of becoming an active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lake–orchard construct is vivid, original, and consistently functional: the ice, vortex, and spectral trees all constrain action and encode the world’s rules about lost things. Details like “sleeping fish suspended mid-flick” and coins “like patient stars” are strongly filtered through Arlen’s sensibility and aim. Crucially, the setting isn’t postcard; it directly shapes the central tactic (scrying through the ice) and charges the final image of the ice cracking under his confession. A tiny deduction comes from the density of imagery occasionally risking over-lushness without adding new constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt glade, living roots, and eclipse-conditioned plant create a vivid, coherent environment that is inseparable from the story’s magic system. Setting actively constrains action: the narrator is literally rooted, the eclipse determines when the clipping can grow, and the forest “studies us back,” all of which matter to the vision ritual and stakes. The covenant between sky and soil elegantly fuses atmosphere and world-rule. This is top-tier scene-building, only just shy of perfect because the glade itself doesn’t overtly shift or evolve at the climax beyond deepening color.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized—“roots snaked between bones,” the altar as a “mouth,” candles throwing more shadow than light—and almost every environmental detail is doing thematic or procedural work. The setting directly shapes the magic’s logic (channels into roots and bones, the orchard feeding on offerings) and charges the climax when the roots shiver and trees bend. Sensory texture is rich but controlled, never losing spatial or conceptual clarity. The environment clearly constrains what’s possible here, even if no literal obstacle course of movement is required.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quarry office trailer and “echo valley” are vivid, specific, and filtered through Eli’s performance history, giving the setting emotional texture rather than postcard description. The rattling trailer, fluorescent buzz, and gray bowl of the quarry all echo the “after the applause” silence and charge the internal stakes. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain his tactical options, it meaningfully shapes mood and thematic resonance. The amp and its physical details function as a micro-setting object that directly drives the core turn.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The magnetic arbor, clouds, and hum are vividly specific and integrated into action (the guide’s standing wave, the lines of force, the membrane pressing close). The environment directly shapes options and stakes: isolation above the clouds, the arbor’s pull on patterns, and the strange field dynamics all constrain what Mara can do. The arbor also charges the final image, functioning as both setting and active interlocutor. This is near top-tier atmospheric work with no major missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal atrium is vivid, specific, and integral: glass bones, marble stacks, rising water, and moon-thickened light all constrain action and mood. Setting isn’t postcard; the tide literally reaches “middle shelves,” the fisherman must wade in, and the half-submerged steps dictate their physical interaction. The environment’s logic (ocean storing memories; missing moon thickening light) stays consistent and culminates in the final, water-mediated reflection swap. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that environmental constraint, while strong, could be edged even closer to the climactic smelting choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered and absolutely integral: the mirrored facets, hush, shells, and pearl form a coherent environment that shapes tone and Mara’s willingness to confess. The cave isn’t a postcard backdrop; its rules (the pearl’s response to hesitation, shells darkening) directly mediate the central act. The final image—stone, water, and pearl making the bunker feel like a “question” rather than a tomb—depends on this precise setting logic. This is very close to top-tier work; only a hair more environmental constraint on choice (beyond mood/spiritual mechanism) would push it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The disused station and river are richly specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“overgrown with ivy and apologies,” “river drilled through the pipes below”). Setting is not postcard; it actively charges choice and theme: the platform as site of busking and crash, the bathroom as archive, the accordion as relic. Environmental details evolve with the emotional beat—from eerie ruin to “STATION OF SECOND CHANCES”—and the river’s final ordinary wave recharges the entire landscape with a new, quieter meaning. The only minor limitation is that the physical environment doesn’t much constrain physical options, only psychic ones.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular and fully integrated: fog “corridors,” spiraling shelves into mist, lantern-books, and silence-as-architecture all work as both environment and operating rule. The library’s prohibition on spoken words and the behavior of silence directly constrain tactics and shape the climax (ink fogging away under a lantern book is an excellent micro-setting payoff). Details are always filtered through her professional sensibility as a “somnolent cartographer,” so the space feels both strange and lived-in. I’m capping just below 9 because the surrounding city and river remain slightly generic compared to the exquisite specificity inside.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet observatory, dormant telescopes, sweating plinth, and humid midsummer air are richly specific and all feed the mood and stakes (the violin is literally at risk of melting). Setting is always filtered through character and purpose—“air tasted annotated,” ivy and oleander as whispering commentators—rather than touristic listing. The environment constrains choice (indoor garden and observatory as a pressure cooker for her plant-telepathy and the violin’s instability) and charges the ending image when the ice body finally cracks. World rules around the drowned empire, observatory politics, and magic are consistent and legible without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skyborne grotto, bone stairs, aurora, and ice-rock slabs are rendered with remarkable specificity and are always filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment isn’t mere backdrop: the auroral beam dictates where Isren lies and how she aligns the chip, and the cold/frost modulate how she can touch the bodies. World rules (meteorite chip, contracts, floating slabs) stay consistent and are learned through her actions. This is elite-level atmosphere that also gently constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: “umbral grotto” ribbed like a scallop shell above clouds, vineyard hush of thinning wind, smoke behaving like water poured backward. These environmental details are not postcard décor; the grotto’s rules (smoke column, objects from other lives) enable the central vision and thus the climax. The hairpin and sapling function as micro-setting objects that literally charge the final image. Sensory and atmospheric choices consistently mirror internal state without feeling over-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, wind, sea, and chimes are vivid and tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, avoiding generic coastal imagery. Environment is not mere backdrop: the wind enables the chime “reading,” the tower embodies Mara’s duty vs. domestic failure, and dawn’s “cleaner, but not simpler” horizon charges the thematic turn. The final image of the breeze taking the coat, echoed from earlier, gives the setting real weight in the closure. Spatial and sensory anchors (stairs, narrow window, round room) are consistently clear.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the magnetic grotto, floating stone platform, sycamore hush, and iron-veined river stone all feel tactile and coherent. Environmental elements are not just scenic; the grotto’s magnetism and the suspended basin of water actively mediate the lesson, and the abyss under the platform quietly raises the sense of risk. World rules (magnetism, intention, field-lines) are implied through action rather than explained. The final charged image of the grotto’s pull and the hollow inside Mora shows the environment subtly mirroring and charging the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of bone and echoes is vividly rendered and fully integrated into method and meaning: towers hum, echoes map space, and the environment literally teaches him to “navigate without moving.” Objects and setting (bone spires, pebbles, arrowhead, flock) are not postcard details; they are tools and pressures that constrain how he can act. The final image—spine aligned to a rib of bone, canyon arranged in “ringing layers”—shows the setting actively charging closure. A slight pullback from 9+ stems from the world’s rules remaining suggestive rather than fully stressed, but within this scope the setting work is elite.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire, automated city-glow below, and the milky, sourceless glow above are vivid and distinctive, with details consistently filtered through Orren’s sensibility and profession. The environment meaningfully constrains and pressures choice: height, cold, open shafts, the rail-and-harness system, and the “forgotten” stair all shape his options and charge the final risk. The keystone and mist function as charged micro-settings that literally alter what space is (a doorway between “here and maybe”). World rules feel coherent and are revealed via action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integrated: pier, tide, derelict ship, and drowned library all shape what he can do (climb down, swim through a rent, navigate silt and shelves). Environmental details like the ribs of the ship and waterlogged glowing books are not postcard décor; they are the arena where vows physically manifest and must be confronted. Recurring elements (lamps, lanterns, the sea) charge the final image and echo his new way of perceiving. A slight density of lyric description occasionally risks overshadowing tactical constraint, which is the only thing holding this out of the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, amber light, glass floor, and compressed, “marmalade” sky create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels inseparable from the story’s mood. The bowl and coins act as a micro-setting that physically embodies the fate/agency problem, especially when left scattered at the end. World rules around the contracted universe and observatory work coherently and are consistently filtered through the narrator’s perspective. The environment constrains choice more thematically than logistically, but it still charges the final image strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, dome, phonograph, atlas, lantern, and scattered light are all tightly woven into both atmosphere and mechanics—the dome’s acoustics and the brass instruments are not just pretty but functional to the echo-ritual. Setting details are selective and highly charged, like the “trembling constellations” on the ceiling that echo the crystalline reefs on the floor. The environment meaningfully constrains what’s possible (this work happens here, at this height, with this architecture) and charges the final image of him continuing in the observatory at dusk. It’s rich without becoming a static catalog, fully fused with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, dawn light, and sea are not postcard backdrops but active, myth-charged environment: the bridge “listens to tides” and supposedly counts the world’s balance “drop by drop,” which directly frames and enables Tamsin’s tactic. The sensory texture (sleepy blue arches, shy peach sky, yawn of the sea) is precise and filtered through her sensibility without derailing momentum. The setting’s rules (this is where balance is tallied) and physical affordances (height over the sea, central plinth) constrain what she can do and charge the final image of her leaning the bell over the edge. The recurring motif of drops and counting roots the abstract idea of cosmic balance in this specific place and object.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reservoir, ridgeway, exposed town, and steeple are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Tomas’s professional and emotional lens. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the dropping waterline makes the photos and rooftops available, the ridgeway positions him between water and town, and the steeple and dam road charge the closing tableau. Recurring images like the “mirrored hush,” skeletal piers, and resurfacing streets deepen both atmosphere and theme without feeling decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes what he can see and do, especially in the final choice to address the neighbors at the dam.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard, waterfall, pool, and apparatus are richly specific and integrated with Elian’s attention, never feeling like postcard backdrop. Setting actively constrains choices: the hidden location, prismatic waterfall, pool, and ring of flame all shape how light can be routed and how the ritual unfolds. The final image—starlings as constellations amid crystal flowers in a reversed sky/orchard—charges the environment with clear thematic weight. At times the lavish description approaches saturation but remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    The nocturnal arbor, braided lightning ladders, and storm-humming branches are vivid, integrated details that shape both mood and constraints (thin air, height, instruments woven into branches). The parachute buckle and ladder scars recur as charged objects that embody inheritance and risk, and the setting’s altitude and isolation concretely frame the burden of unseen labor. The final sense that “the branches steadied” ties environment directly into the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock dojo, sound-formed floor, ruined courthouse, and history-rewriting sky are vividly specific and integrated into action (e.g., the sound gong becoming a floor, childhood bedroom projections as the arena). Setting is filtered through Arin’s sensibility and thematically mirrors identity instability and rewritten histories. Environment constrains tactics—conflict must occur through memory projections under Kesh’s rules, not physical combat. The final image of dojo rocks drifting closer as verdict forms nicely charges the setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    The converted mill, nocturnal hours, and quiet brook are vividly rendered and constantly filtered through Elias’s sensibility (“nocturnal haven,” “valley’s hollow,” emergency strips, muddy bank). Setting meaningfully constrains action: the coordinates tie to the old watercourse feeding the brook, requiring him to go downstairs, follow the bank, and plant in persistently wet soil. The underground watercourse and mill’s groaning beams directly charge the final sense of something remaking the town from below. Weather and darkness shape tone and plausibly affect choice without ever devolving into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel, the old house, and recurring objects like the egg timer and leaf blowers are richly rendered and functionally integrated. The acoustics of the tunnel and the house’s vents/brickwork materially shape how the ritual works and how laughter travels back. Setting details (mold writing stories, dust understanding the clatter, limescale silence) mirror the emotional state without feeling like mere decoration. The final image of the warm pull cord in the tunnel and the air holding “the shape of a smile” shows the environment still charged by the story’s events.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen garden and mist are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the library’s logic—bushes as clauses, statues as punctuation, the fountain as a question mark. Setting is consistently filtered through the narrator’s mind, so environment and thought blur in a way that supports theme without losing spatial coherence. The pendant and the garden together charge the final movement when the world “hardens” and the library unfolds. Physical constraint is more metaphysical than practical, but it still meaningfully frames the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember nexus is vividly realized—“coals breathing slow orange, the air a metallic sigh of ash”—and tightly integrated with action (heat, ash, and cinder shape his movement and the ritual site). The crozier and lens function as charged objects rather than mere set dressing, with the plaza’s sanctioned-burning function thematically echoing “discarded intentions.” Environmental shifts (embers cooling, wardens shivering) help register the change at the end. This is rich, economical worldbuilding; the only thing keeping it short of the very top is that the larger city/kingdom context remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The hanging radio-city over a gorge is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated into the stakes: its suspension, potential fall, and future repurposing literally shape what is possible. Details like “rusted ladders,” “drooped like wilting flowers,” and rust drifting “like exhausted confetti” are not ornamental; they mirror the city’s exhausted desire to end. The environment constrains the narrator’s options—any misstep in satisfying that desire risks physical catastrophe in the valley below. The final imagined re-use of tower parts as bridges and gardens charges the setting with future-oriented meaning, reweighting the entire scene.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ferry, fog, and especially the spectral grotto with overlapping subway maps, nerves, and constellations are vivid and thematically charged. Setting is tightly bound to action: the bay’s midpoint is where reality loosens, and the grotto physically embodies all possible journeys, forcing a choice. Details like the “boards shone like wet moonlight” and static as “metal bees” feel specific to Eli’s world rather than generic lyricism. The environment meaningfully constrains options at the climax, satisfying the object-as-setting and closure-charge expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—the folded city, the subterranean “optical illusion gallery,” the mutable walls—and all of it is filtered through a grief-tuned perception. Environment isn’t decorative: the stairs that “erupt into depth,” the shifting planes, and the silhouette-doorway directly constrain or frame each decision. World-rules (space reacting to memory, tension reshaping geometry) remain consistent and are shown through action. The final image of the thread-wrapped doorway is inseparable from this specific architectural setting.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    The benthic city and viewport are vividly and economically realized—the “blister of diamond glass,” black manganese plain, and humming alien spires create a specific, lived-in environment. Setting is always filtered through the navigator’s priorities (currents, beacons, lack of north), and environmental constraints (no visible stars; reliance on sensors) directly inform the conceptual pivot to edge geometry. The recurring chain link functions as a micro-setting object that literally touches the glass in the final image, charging the closure with a sense of embodied history facing the cosmos. Atmosphere of submerged, pressurized wonder is maintained without slipping into generic SF décor.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and purposeful: the “mist-clad atrium,” “boiled cabbage and laundry soap,” and the riverside flat all feel specific and filtered through Eren’s sensibility. Environmental details mirror the liminal dead-living threshold (twilight, mist, hush) and deepen tone without turning into mere postcards. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-settings/charged objects, though the physical environment rarely constrains options in a concrete way. That keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The undersea ravine and buried facility are vivid and sensorially rich, with pressure, rust, cables, and muffled sound all doing atmospheric work. Setting is tightly integrated with constraint: the tidal alignment window, groaning structure, and narrowing tunnels shape what’s possible and heighten Noah’s claustrophobia. The facility’s purpose (listening to undersea cables) meaningfully underpins the sphere’s function and the story’s themes of forgotten voices. The environment also charges the final image—the sea’s “crashing hush” brackets the piece and makes the quiet whisper of “return” feel earned and eerie.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal observatory under snow, storm, aurora, and cold machinery are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s grief and obsession. Setting elements constrain and charge choices: the storm and power draw heighten the risk of his final computational push, and the doomed observatory timeline sharpens the urgency. Recurring objects (the mug shard, spilled tea/ink, the telescope “eye”) enrich atmosphere and theme without feeling decorative. The setting could shape one explicit tactical choice more directly, but as-is it strongly charges the final image and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and fully integrated: towers of bone as vertebrae, the canyon’s erosive language, the tunnel’s textured walls, and the bone dust all shape the stakes and the mechanics of his work. Environmental details are always filtered through his tactile, sonic focus, so worldbuilding never feels like a tour. Crucially, the canyon and tunnel constrain what’s possible—no birds at first, endless echoes, grooves wearing themselves out—and charge the final image when bone dust and echoes become ingredients of the new language. The environment is not just backdrop but the primary opposing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and specific (“fallen through a bruise in reality,” inverted trees, chamomile fog on the ceiling), and always filtered through the cryptid researcher’s sensibility. The environment isn’t just pretty: the root-door with its “tooth,” the bowls, and the underground garden’s pulsing soil all actively carry the world’s rules and charge the final understanding. The garden’s logic is internally consistent, and the stone/arrowhead-root arch meaningfully shapes access and stakes. This environment and its tools are inseparable from the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated: rusted airships, groaning gears, enchanted orchards, and living statues are not mere backdrop but the very machinery that reacts to and channels Lio’s music. Environmental elements constrain and shape action—the wired roots, rune-eyed statues, and power lines tearing free are how the revolution manifests. The locust shell and the sky-bridge function as charged micro-settings that frame his choice and final lift. World rules are consistent and learnable through action despite the high lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the cobalt arcade, shuttered stalls, cracked glass roof, and smuggling drones all shape what’s possible (this is the last place for hand-to-hand trade, under failing lights the cameras ignore). Details are filtered through Eren’s professional lens (border cracks, drones “anxious,” mail drop ritual), so specificity feels motivated rather than decorative. The storm in a bottle and the bullet-holed ceiling at the end explicitly tie environment to the final choice—those holes are literal paths for the unleashed storm. World rules are consistent and learned through implication, with no exposition drag.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly realized—the abandoned circus train, dust, wind bells, half-sunk carriage, and unfinished horses all feel tactile and specific. Environmental elements (the hidden workshop, halo cage above the platform, sunk wheels) are not mere backdrop but charge the emotional register and final image. The carousel and tools materially shape what he can do and what the story can mean. Occasionally the description tilts toward lushness for its own sake, but the atmosphere consistently supports the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “scientific poetry library” is vividly and efficiently realized—“equations courted metaphors,” neutron haiku, floral carpet, fluorescent quiet, all filtered through Mariel’s sensibility. The environment isn’t just backdrop: it supplies both the physical network of aisles and the conceptual blend of science and poetry that makes her hyperbolic mapping feel organic. The library explicitly “amplifies” the key human moment at the end, charging the final image. This could edge even higher if the space imposed one concrete, inescapable limitation on her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated: the whispering archipelago, fading edges, jarred sunrises, and the highest cliff all feel necessary rather than decorative. Environmental specifics (boats missing harbors, birds forgetting routes, palms that never touch) embody the stakes and world rules. Tools and place—the cliff, the camera, the jars—directly constrain the final action and charge the last image. The atmosphere is consistent and richly textural without slipping into generic mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The viaduct, bruised sky, and river are vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, with strong lines like the town “smudged into shadows” and the river’s “little broken roars.” The environment isn’t just pretty; the viaduct-as-hinge metaphor and the first star materially charge the ritual and final image. The micro-setting of the vial in the locksmith’s scarred hands further anchors the abstract stakes in tactile reality. A slight sense persists that the same ritual might be portable to a different site, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and inextricable from the story’s mechanics: the “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” and the still tide-water functioning as a mirror make the broken-constellations method possible. Environmental constraints (low tide, rusted ladder, encroaching water) subtly shape timing and choice. The greenhouse, shipwrecks, and mushrooms evolve from atmosphere to functional ritual apparatus that charges the final image. This is a rare case where setting, tool, and magic system are seamlessly the same thing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    The forgotten library, shattered mirror wall, dust, and “afternoon shadow caught in glass” create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that feels inseparable from the premise. Setting is not postcard: the mirrors are the mechanism of exile, the cup/spoon and vellum are tools of Rhea’s work, and the environment’s cold, fractured qualities mirror the city’s self-erasure. World rules (memories exiled into mirrors, reversible vs permanent) are conveyed organically through action and implication. The library and mirror-wall tangibly constrain options and charge the final promise, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard on a parapet over a waterfall, with mist, bruised leaves, and “budding hope,” is vivid and sensorially rich without losing clarity. Setting is filtered strongly through the narrator’s sensibility and directly charges the magic—this is where “the worlds fray and braid,” and the final image of newly awake leaves depends on that geography. The parapet’s liminality and seasonal detail reinforce the thematic hinge of precarious, nascent hope. Environment doesn’t literally trap or free bodies, but it constrains meaning in a way that’s integral to the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, glass columns, and ancient net are vivid and integrated, with details consistently filtered through Ilan’s ritual-focused attention. Setting does more than decorate: the sanctuary’s silence, the way light refracts, and the stone that "breathes" all charge the mood and make the final "grounded stillness" feel like a real transformation of place. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics—he could arguably perform this rite elsewhere—so its role is more atmospheric than logistical. Nonetheless, the recurring sanctuary and net imagery clearly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The museum basement, reel-to-reel, moor, henge, and “rain-scoured fresco vault” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, creating a dense, coherent atmosphere. The environment is not mere backdrop: the physical silence of the footage, the eroded saints, and the wet stone all reinforce the chapel-as-listener premise and charge the final recommendation. The contrast between the cluttered, archival basement and the stripped, damaged crypt quietly mirrors the themes of preservation versus violation. Setting doesn’t overtly constrain physical choices but it heavily conditions how choices are perceived and weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater library, coral cliff, pulped books, and snow globes are vivid, original, and tightly filtered through the diver’s perception. Setting is not mere backdrop: the depth, wreck, globes, and decompression chamber all concretely constrain options and charge the final ethical dilemma. The recurring objects (globes, cylinder, Earhart’s preserved plane above) meaningfully reweight the final image. There’s minor over-lushness in description at times, but it never harms clarity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “courtyard floated above the clouds” with silver mist and storm-veined sky is vividly realized and tonally aligned with the piece’s liminal concerns. Setting details (copper dust in bricks, lantern-glow, balustrade over cloud-sea) are filtered through Lio’s artistic, slightly dissociated attention, which keeps them character-specific. The environment does some subtle work—seclusion and the charged storm interval—but more direct constraint on action (e.g., physical risk or access limits) would raise it into the very top band. As is, the atmosphere is lush, specific, and meaningfully integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sky-palace, icebound spire, and frost-rimed corridor are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Etta’s perspective, with details like “frost traced silver ferns” doing double duty as mood and worldbuilding. The environment meaningfully constrains choice: the forbidden height, cold, and strange prisms shape her tactics (goggles, touching the script gently rather than forcing the door). The observatory with its spinning prism is not just backdrop; it is the mechanism by which the diary becomes readable. A touch more sense of physical risk from the cold itself might have pushed the setting into true crucible territory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and deeply integrated: the sky gondola, severed cable, city halo, and layered clouds are rendered with precise, profession-filtered detail. The environment constrains options (no cable, dead radio) and charges the final image of her letting the “broken space” carry her; the brass hardware, glass, and humming batteries all feel tactiled and lived-in. The weather and cloud typology double as both professional data and emotional mirror without heavy-handed symbolism. This could edge even higher if the physical danger or survival logistics of the gondola environment bore more directly on a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly specific and fully integrated—shelves echoing branches, alcoves as knots, pale manuscripts “like bark”—and the carved oak’s age and condemnation drive the entire situation. Environmental features (the hollow, the lowest ring, the secret safe) shape what she can do and how she tries to preserve something. The demolition crew, horns, and the hush before charges are all used to tint perception and constrain time, not just decorate. The final insight about frames and edges is inseparable from the fact that these skies live on and in literal walls within this specific doomed space.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the antique airship, the murmuring starlings, and the dusty children’s corner form a cohesive spatial and atmospheric web. The hopscotch board and the hull’s relation to the starlings function as a micro-setting that literally channels “stranded luminance” and constrains how Lio can discover and act on the pattern. World rules—light pooling in chalk, maps of rumors, “cartographer of unfinished places”—are revealed through observation and action rather than exposition dumps. The environment directly shapes both the method of navigation and the final image (the corridor opening around the ship), satisfying the object-as-setting gate for high scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library, frost, clouds, and mirrored hall are lushly realized and tightly integrated into the premise; almost every paragraph refreshes the environment through action and perception. The setting constrains choice—the mirrors are the only locus of work, the frost and altitude color every breath, and the library’s frozen state is directly reweighted by the ending thaw. Detail is selective rather than touristic, with strong POV-filter (“nostalgia…like old driftwood,” “windows rimed, stairwells breathing out little sighs”). The only small limitation is that weather and altitude rarely impose concrete tactical obstacles beyond tone.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard planet and floating arches are vividly and economically rendered, with details like “iron-black loop cradling an old butterfly garden” and “violet river curling into itself” doing double duty for atmosphere and world rules. Setting meaningfully constrains choices: arches can collapse, ladders and cranes must span them, and the nebula alters gravity, all of which shape the evacuation plan. The watering bell and arches recur as charged objects/structures, culminating in the cracked bell and surviving span at the end. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that environmental constraint, while strong, isn’t exploited for complex tactical variation beyond the main crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hidden lighthouse, black rocks, mist, and the towering clock create a vivid, tactile environment that is more than backdrop: the door sequence, central placement of the clock, and later the unshattered window all shape what is possible. The “pane of hush” and the lighthouse windows full of “wan, changing colors” directly charge the final image and echo earlier environmental beats. World rules—time as chambers, shelves of carved symbols—are taught through action and perception, not exposition. The setting’s isolation and oceanic imagery mirror the emotional stakes without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is strikingly specific and functional: the cliff, maze, frost, and mechanical birds all constrain options and shape tactics. Details like roots “knotted into stone,” frost that “remembered,” and birds sketching “invisible corridors” are filtered through the narrator’s weary, mythic sensibility. World rules are consistent and learned through action (assembled paths, frost tracing untaken routes). The environment and small object (nut) both charge the final realization, satisfying the object-as-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The braided ravine, research station, river foam, and lab bench are all sharply rendered, and consistently filtered through Mara’s scientific and musical sensibility. The environment isn’t mere backdrop: the river’s braiding directly inspires the polymer concept, and the ravine’s edge plus chrysalis/foam at the end charge the closure image. Physical details like concrete, reeds, and water movement anchor the lyricism. A slightly stronger sense of weather or physical discomfort under stress could deepen the tactile stakes, but the current level already supports publication-grade atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library is vividly and consistently realized, with details like “luminescent apple-book trees” and “branches like fragile bells” doing worldbuilding, mood, and thematic work at once. Environment meaningfully charges choice: branches become aisles and perches for the slate, the catalog literally resides in the trees, and the final image of his name “among the branches” is inseparable from the setting’s logic. Objects-as-setting (slates, bottled moonlight, apple-books) integrate seamlessly into the environment rather than reading as add-ons. The only small limit is that the physical constraints of the space don’t sharply alter tactics beyond mood and symbolism, which keeps this at the high end but not beyond.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert fortress after rain, tidal pools, sandstone stair, and coral ice pavilion are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and theme. Environment constrains choice: the hidden stair, the frozen coral tables, and the stored shards literally determine how Rafi can interact with remorse. The weather and water motifs (pools, storms, sea memory) evolve across the piece and directly charge the final image of the fortress returning to “uneasy sleep.” This is an exemplary fusion of worldbuilding and emotional landscape without lapsing into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and functional: astronomical dial, wheezing stone ribs, rusted chutes, and organ-pipe bins all shape the story’s possibilities and final image. The clock tower’s machinery and the grain elevator’s architecture directly constrain tactics (re-rigging weights, opening chutes) rather than serving as backdrop. “Borrowed starlight” and dust-as-applause tie atmosphere to theme without feeling ornamental. This is near the top tier; the only ceiling is that environmental constraints are solved fairly smoothly, with little friction or surprise once the plan is declared.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The moonlit canyon, tectonic engines, and bioluminescent moss are sensorially rich and consistently filtered through Lio’s mind, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Crucially, the setting is not decorative: the canyon’s geology, electromagnetic “whisper,” and seismic pulses directly affect the device’s behavior and the memory-entanglement premise, and the land’s heartbeat calms as he accepts its stories. The mirror and canyon together charge the final image of quiet luminosity with new meaning. I’m only holding short of 9+ because while the environment meaningfully shapes the magic-logic, it doesn’t impose many concrete physical constraints on his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly specific and filtered through his sensibility: inverted gravity, “columns like frozen smoke,” basalt shelves with “calcified ink,” and mist layers that alter physics and perception. Environment genuinely constrains action—the single hour of inversion, threshold membranes with sensory cues, and the spatial oddity of falling upward define his tactics. World rules around gravity and thresholds stay consistent and are shown rather than explained. The final return to the “ordinary stacks” effectively reweights those early anchors without belaboring them.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and always doing work: the siskin alder grove, buried wires, porcelain insulator, and hedgehog all serve both atmosphere and mechanism. The environment is not just backdrop—it is literally the instrument and choir, constraining what he can do (tree modifications, copper threading) and charging the final image of the grove swaying as “music.” Details are skillfully filtered through Lio’s musical perception, avoiding tourist-list description. This could reach the very top band if the physical constraints of the space more sharply shaped tactics or risk in the climactic experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The magnetic nexus, iron-veined cliffs, stormlight, and basalt monoliths are vivid, coherent, and consistently filtered through Oren’s sensibility. Environment is not postcard: the nexus’s properties (gravity thinning, hum/pulses) and the stone’s placement and groove literally enable the covenant’s legible speech. The final image of the deeper dent in the stone is strongly charged by prior material and the place’s function. There are no spatial or rule inconsistencies, and detail density stays purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    The workshop under the hatch of stars, hilltop town, and encroaching festival are vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention to sound. Setting materially shapes the story: his instruments, microphones, and vantage point make his project possible and create the contrast between fragile silences and impending fireworks. The environment—stars as audience, town as rising roar—charges the final image of the first rocket and the opening clasp. Details are economical yet atmospheric, never slipping into generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The treetop village, rope bridges, scents, and weather are not mere backdrop; they constantly shape perception and stakes (descend to rot vs. sway in the canopy vs. bloom death at the very top). Details are filtered through Liora’s nose and body, making the environment feel lived-in rather than touristic. The choice to plant “on the highest branch” and the closing inhalation make the setting itself complicit in the risk. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action instead of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and specific: inverted gravity harvests, floating arches, levitating wells, and sap-brightened roots all feel both strange and coherent. Environmental rules (gravity inversion, upward water flow) are learned through Lio’s goal-directed movement, and they actively shape his navigation and methods. The high grove’s stone halo and water loops charge the final image, with the pedestal and arrow emerging as a natural culmination rather than a grafted symbol. A touch more direct constraint—where the environment forces a harder tactical compromise—would be needed for a true 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly realized and consistently filtered through a professional eye—containers as “frozen waves,” wind corridors as invisible but map-worthy structure. Setting and atmosphere are not decorative: the maze and building faces literally shape the airflow that caused the crash and that the protagonist must now read. The silence of the shut-down town and the halted drones function as both mood and practical constraint, giving him a “clean stage.” The final prescription to redesign the yard and routes confirms that environment is a live, causally central force.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ice cavern, glacier, aurora, and amber sheet are vividly rendered and deeply fused with the protagonist’s perception and task. Environment is not postcard scenery: the cavern’s acoustics, the aurora’s colors, and the amber’s behavior under light all shape what Ilen can do and how. The setting culminates in the aurora mirroring the cavern’s pattern, charging the final image. A slight reason for restraint is that physical constraints (cold, danger, bodily limits) remain more aesthetic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Thunder-echo Range is vividly evoked (“avalanchingly quiet,” “bowl of stone where thunder once pooled”) and consistently filtered through Cael’s sensibility. The amphitheater’s acoustics and the stone’s “listening” charge the final image of the thin note hanging between stone and sky, so setting clearly shapes the emotional stakes. Details are economical but textured; the environment mirrors his interiority without sliding into heavy-handed symbolism. It stops a little short of absolute indispensability because a similar remote, echoing landscape could be substituted without fully breaking the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars are rendered with striking, specific imagery that is tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“paper waited like a pond refusing to admit it was ice”). The environment is not mere backdrop: the halo and press literally structure how emotion-math is enacted and how the ending experience is possible. World rules (starlight → empathy → type → geometry) feel consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps, despite their abstraction. A slight sense of aesthetic saturation—almost every object gleams metaphorically—keeps this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through the courier’s priorities (lonely routes, town lights fading, snow whispering). Environment and recurring object-as-setting (the pendant) directly constrain and enable the key experience: the aurora “singing” is what charges the moment and allows the slowed-time layer to be felt. The setting isn’t a backdrop; it’s the mechanism by which the encounter with wonder and Ralen’s fate becomes possible. The final decision is inseparable from this ridge under this sky, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the quartz arbor, Maple Street, and the frost-etched sedan all feel specific, sensorially rich, and inseparable from the premise. Environmental details are filtered through the mystic’s gaze (“bones the mountain had decided to wear outside its skin,” cars as “sleeping animals, each with its own secret weather”). The environment doesn’t just decorate; it provides the very medium of communication (frost, quartz, hush) and charges the final thematic claim about objects absorbing emotion. The only reason this doesn’t nudge higher is that setting never directly constrains a concrete, high-cost decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard among bamboo, with shriveled apples and swallowed paths, is vividly rendered and deeply integrated into tone and stakes. The setting supports Nari’s solitude, the forgotten quality of her craft, and the plausibility of this private magic. Environmental details (frost on fallen apples, moonlight through bamboo, the loom at the orchard’s heart) evolve with the action and charge the final scene with age and cost (“the orchard felt abruptly older”). The world feels distinctive yet legible, with setting functioning as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is highly specific and integral: floating arches, cobalt pears, calcifying tools, and reversed mining all arise from one coherent planetary logic. Environmental forces (gravity ripples, sinking arches, abandoned mine shafts) directly shape available tactics and culminate in the arches “groaning in answer” during the climax. Details are purposefully filtered through Corren’s craft-centric perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. The final image of him climbing back toward the orchards “carrying that azure defiance” is charged by all the prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail (“Flaking hazard stripes…air hummed with a faint ozone tang”) that supports both tone and concept. Setting is filtered through Lio’s professional perception, turning sound, heat, and probability into quasi-physical architecture, which deepens the atmosphere. The shard functions as an object-as-setting, literally the “knot” of overlapping bays and the charged tool at the ending beat. While the bay itself doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, the layered versions of the room and its disused, liminal quality are thematically integral.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, dark sea, iron steps, and lantern room are rendered with vivid, selective detail that always passes through Elias’s professional eye. Environment constrains action and mood: isolation, darkness, and the now-useless machinery frame his decision to create a tiny substitute light. Recurring objects (stones, lens, sea glass) are rooted in place and charge the final image of the small green halo. The only minor gap is that the “haunted” aspect remains more tonal than concretely pressuring his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: drowned harbor town, emerald stone, data-spun oil, and repurposed observatory/server-farm lenses all feel specific and lived-in. World rules—light folding via total internal reflection, the lighthouse storing oaths as refractions—are unusual but internally consistent and dramatized rather than dumped. Crucially, the lighthouse as physical apparatus enables the final act of steering the new dawn, so environment shapes options rather than being a postcard. A minor increase in tactile interaction with the drowned town itself (not just its memory) could deepen spatial texture further.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house, valley mist, pigments, and tethering prayers create a distinctive, immersive setting filtered through the dye master’s sensibility. Environmental details (mist seeping through slats, altitude drawing stories like mist pooling, the ledge where “cloud met stone and hush”) are not decorative; they mirror and charge the thematic interest in gathered, suspended stories. The blue morpho wing and tethered tea house act as charged objects/structures that shape the final image. Setting consistently supports tone and theme without over-explaining its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the stormlit tower, hollow labyrinth, and secret rooftop garden are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that always passes through Milo’s maintenance-worker gaze. Weather and architecture actively matter—storms reveal cracks, the storm’s “inhalation” marks the inciting moment, the moonlight physically heals the sextant, and the rooftop micro-ecosystem becomes the stage for reconfiguring the premise. World rules (maze with opinions, instruments retired from reason) are consistent and conveyed economically through action. Environment and object-as-setting (the sextant) clearly charge the final image, though we don’t quite see the environment constraining a hard choice, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: glass ribs, black mica scales, glass roots, glowing pear-fruit, and the “last lung of creation” all shape tone and meaning. The environment matters functionally—the mica window is the only interface to the realm, and the orchard as a storage of swaddled memories makes her act legible. Details are filtered through the protagonist’s purpose and history rather than feeling like a tour. The final image of dawn unfurling between trees, from people instead of sky, is charged directly by the established spatial and atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The library setting is vivid and meaningfully particular—“shelves that curved like question marks,” humming books, municipal grout versus secret chamber. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it encodes the story’s conceptual stakes (regrets as catalog system, question-mark shelves) and enables the central mechanism of walking a “path the past wished for.” While the space doesn’t physically constrain options, its rules and atmosphere strongly shape the emotional and conceptual action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The palace courtyard and tea house are rendered with lush, pointed specificity—fig trees through balustrades, beans among ornamental thorns, kettles over a brazier—and these details are always in conversation with the themes of neglect, resistance, and quiet care. The setting genuinely constrains and enables action: the secrecy and obscurity of the tea house make this kind of witnessing possible, and the overgrown, repurposed space mirrors Elias’s attempt to compost guilt into something else. The final image of warmth rising into the cooling courtyard air is directly charged by the environment built to that point. At times the density of imagery verges on maximalist, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library above the clouds, with frost, brass railings, quartz hush, and the hoarfrosted dome, is vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Serin’s professional gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop: cold, altitude, and crystalline stillness shape his tools (conductive frost cuffs), the fragility of the vows, and the stakes of a literal fall. Environmental details evolve with action (glyphs on the frosted ceiling, images sharpening and erasing) and charge the final image of a “dim weave” newly threaded. It stops just short of 9-band because environment constrains mood and stakes more than it complicates his tactical options in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is richly textured—tide, pilings, lanterns, sagging boards, and stall wares all feel lived-in and specific. Setting is not just backdrop: the hidden-underwater economy, the “truce of hush,” and the soft boards at the end of the pier all inflect tone and the sense of risk. The environment quietly constrains options—this market is the only place she can access such a device and the hush modulates how the climax is experienced (sounds padded, wrapped in cotton). A small potential gain would be showing the physical constraints of the pier affecting one concrete choice beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the lavender bluff, aurora brushing grass, abacus-leaf voting trees, and luminous sea create a coherent, specific otherworld that feels lived-in. Details are filtered through the protagonist’s sensoria (especially light and taste), so the environment feels inseparable from consciousness. The bluff and aurora function as more than postcard: they frame when “the sky listens hardest” and charge the final image of “four small bodies carrying the weather of a larger tomorrow.” The only thing keeping this from an even higher score is that the environment constrains mood and meaning more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subterranean crystal cave and the darkened theater above are vividly realized and filtered through Elias’s artistic sensibility, turning light, stone, and dust into emotional correlatives. Crystals refracting lantern light into “auroral” hues, and then reflecting where Mara’s eyes should be, directly charge the central choice and the final image. The cave’s isolation and glitter provide a psychological chamber where his calling can’t be drowned out, functionally constraining the scene to his confrontation with the portrait. A slight reason for not going anywhere else is assumed rather than dramatized, but the setting still does real thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is rendered with striking specificity—glass corridors like ribs, numbered leaves, condensation banks, brittle stems in dormant corridors—and all of it feels lived-in. Environmental conditions (toxic air, drying oasis, sealed observatory, storm outside) constrain behavior and charge decisions, especially the choice to enter a forbidden, guilt-haunted structure. Details are filtered through Lio’s plant- and water-attuned sensibility, keeping description purposeful rather than touristic. The final image—a hush smelling of “stale ink and long-delayed honesty”—is powerfully charged by the accumulated atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bluff, wind, clouds, and distant cities are richly realized and consistently filtered through Lio’s sonic-artistic sensibility. Environment is not postcard-only: altitude, wind, and the bluff’s “leaning in” directly shape how the sculpture functions and how far its truth travels. The iceberg fragment as a micro-setting object is tightly integrated, charging the final image with remembered light and color. This world feels distinctive and internally consistent without over-explaining its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert rose farm under a glass dome is vividly and economically rendered, with tactile specifics (hot minerals, resin smell, glass ribs trembling) and coherent spatial logic (irrigation lines, trenches, climate system). The environment constrains and enables tactics: he uses pumps, soil dryness, climate partitions, and the dome itself to stage a safe “burn.” The final image—walking renewed rows under a still-fragile dome while magnetic north wanders—charges the theme and closure. Small worldbuilding details (alignment systems, engineered sky) all serve the core pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly realized—bougainvillea as “open veins,” laundry, coffee, and obsolete mailboxes—and every environmental detail serves conflict or theme rather than postcard prettiness. The mailboxes and the courtyard’s communal layout directly constrain choices: the mystery hinges on that physical wall of boxes, and the final legal protection is literally housed in the setting. The world’s pressure (sirens, surveyors, cement dust) is integrated into the environment and drives stakes rather than sitting as backdrop. This is rich, economical setting craft tied tightly to the story’s core action.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken laboratory and surrounding ocean are richly evoked through tactile, acoustic, and visual detail (“Pipes creaked like old throats, glass hummed with pressure”), and the setting is firmly anchored and consistent. Environment and object-as-setting (the dice, the observation dome, drowned servers) meaningfully shape thought and tactics, especially the guided navigation and the reprogramming of the building. The pressure of depth and structural settling adds atmosphere more than acute logistical constraint, but the world feels coherent and integral rather than decorative. The final image of the lab as a “heart choosing…to keep beating unseen” is strongly charged by prior environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, whale, and salt-crystal warehouse are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the premise: moonlight on the whale’s flank, the “gleaming silence,” and the pulsing crystals all mirror and embody the story’s strange physics of forgetting. The environment is not just backdrop; the dead whale is explicitly posited as plugging a memory trough, and the salt chamber becomes the laboratory where those forces are tested. The final image of humming crystals and gleaming silence is inseparable from this setting. A minor limitation is that physical constraints don’t force concrete choices in a survival sense; the pressure is more metaphysical than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The brook, fireflies, reeds, and valley night are vivid and sensorially precise, and they’re not mere backdrop: Ilen chooses the place for its half-remembered silence, and the brook literally participates in the spell. Environmental details (the brook’s chatter smoothing, fireflies’ “new patterns”) charge the final image and echo the reconfigured future. The quasi-mystic worldbuilding is consistent and contained to what matters for this scene. This is near top-tier setting work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is outstanding: the wrong-colored light, “air that tastes like paper left too long in rain,” and the rooftop garden under meteors all feel tactile and lived-in. The rooftop and building aren’t just backdrop; they literally become the speaking entity, and the roof’s history (flowers, near-fire, arguments) constrains what is at stake. The antique seal as a recurring object bridges apartment and roof and charges the final image in the narrator’s hand. The only thing keeping this from a 9+ is that the environment shapes meaning more than it constrains concrete choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “velvet garden at twilight” is vividly and economically evoked, and it’s not just backdrop: it’s an “archive for resting sorrows,” the only plausible place for this seashell and caretaker to exist. Sensory and tonal details (gray moths, black roses, blue-glass lantern) are filtered through Neris’s bias and echo the story’s emotional palette. While the garden doesn’t physically constrain choices, its function as an archive and liminal space charges every decision and the final image, fully justifying the lush description.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, vellum, and marble dome are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Irian’s sensibility as a scribe in a hidden holy space. Environmental details (stalactites as clock, aurora’s colors, “pearl twilight”) support the hushed, conspiratorial tone and reappear at the end to charge the new “script of history.” While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it functions as a wisely enduring witness that thematically anchors the idea of rewritten dynasties, especially in the closing line. Detail is lush but mostly purposeful, avoiding tourist-list excess.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon setting is vivid, tactile, and thematically fused with the premise: stone, depth, and echo mechanics aren’t backdrop but the operative “system” through which truth is revealed. The caravans and “serpentine nexus under starlight” frame a larger world of intrigue without cluttering the central scene, while the shell functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Environment constrains and enables choice—only here can she test the rumor and hear the layered voices—though physical constraints don’t quite force tactical improvisation beyond that premise.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glacier shrine, candles, and snow globe are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that feels inseparable from the story’s mood and stakes. The environment isn’t just decorative: the climb to reach Marek, the ice “breathing,” the throat-like entrance, and the way her tears freeze all subtly pressure and echo the moral coldness they’re confronting. The recurring candlelight/borrowed starlight motif directly charges the final image. World rules stay consistent and the setting is deeply filtered through Marek’s vocation and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The canal, parapet, rain-slick stone, fireflies, and moon paths are vividly rendered and always filtered through emotional stakes. Crucially, the setting is not postcard: the wet parapet provides puddles for the whisk, height and angle for droplets to travel, and the whispered rivulets evolve from “decay” to “patient instruction,” charging the thematic turn. Firefly season and the fractured streetlamps fold into the final sky-image, so the environment directly shapes both tactics and closure. World rules (semi-magical but consistent) are taught through perception and action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard and radioactive dust are vividly evoked and integrated with action—Theo walks rows, digs in glowing dust, and the engineered fruit’s scars mirror the diamond. The environment directly charges the final image and decision, since the thriving orchard amid wasteland is the entire hinge of the stakes. The world’s rules (engineered resilience, poisoned aquifers) feel consistent and are economically conveyed through Theo’s investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: the “stormlit observatory above clouds,” cobalt glass portico, bruised-purple and green sky, and rusted radios all feel lived-in and tonally precise. Environmental conditions (altitude, storm, lightning, glass) meaningfully shape what’s possible and charge the final image of Ilen under the portico as both specimen and spectator. Details are filtered tightly through his sensibility—scientist-poet, a bit eroded—and never devolve into catalog; the world’s rules (radio reflection off the storm, isolation) are consistent. The only limit keeping this just shy of 9-band is that the environment constrains mood and imagery more than concrete tactics beyond “stand under glass in a storm.”

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes,” jars, and sea are rendered with vivid, selective detail that consistently reflects his sensibility. Setting does more than decorate: the loft as a ribcage/skeleton of past summers and the descent toward the “waking town” at the end concretely stage his before/after state. Sensory variety (wind, sand, smell of rust and lavender, the mutter of waves) supports the tone without bogging the scene. While the environment doesn’t overtly block or enable specific tactics, it deeply charges the final threshold image and his role as liminal translator.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and integral: drift ice, groaning marina, narrow lighthouse interior, and stone crypt all shape mood and options. Environmental details are filtered convincingly through a professional’s eye (listening for structural faults, feeling hum through teeth) and the rules of the world (sound, stone, ice, sunset) stay consistent. The marina’s initial groaning and final quiet charge the closure image, making place inseparable from the story’s emotional arc. Weather, light, and architecture all subtly constrain action without ever reading like a tour.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, hidden conduits, and standing-stone viaduct are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s purpose. Environment meaningfully constrains action: true work begins only once the lake “sealed itself in glass,” and the viaduct’s storm-memory literally channels the world’s haste into the climax. The final image of walking the frozen shore to “map slowly” clearly draws power from the established setting. A minor nit is that “magnetic viaduct after rain” and storm-charging could bear one more concrete interaction earlier to deepen functional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway maintenance tunnel and the wet, post-drought environment are vividly realized—rails pinging, dripping ceiling, slick tracks—and consistently filtered through the investigator’s professional eye. The lantern operates as a micro-setting/object, shaping what can be seen and what memories surface, and it charges the final conceptual shift around “testimonies braided across time.” Weather and acoustics (“after the drought ends, when the world is suddenly wet again”) aren’t decorative; they deepen the uncanny atmosphere and support the entanglement motif. Spatial clarity is maintained despite the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    The antique music box shop is vividly realized—the “vibrant hush,” layered ticking, rain-blurred street—and every detail is filtered through Elias’s mindset. The environment isn’t just decorative: the tools, lamps, ticking clocks, and the shop’s function as a repair space all mirror and charge the ethical question at stake. The recurring clockwork and light-through-rain imagery directly feed the interpretive method Mara uses on the heart and thus the closing image. It stops just shy of 9+ because the physical setting doesn’t quite constrain options so much as thematically echo them.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and consistently filtered through Orin’s sensibility, from the “rusted cathedral” workshop to the acid sea to the “bruise-colored wound in the sky.” Environmental elements affect action—the acid sea makes the workshop an isolated node, the workshop’s machinery embodies the Algorithm, and the sky corridor plus blind spot literally channel the climax. The recurring objects (workshop, arrow tip, kaleidoscope) function as micro-settings that constrain choices and strongly charge the final image. There’s slight excess in descriptive density, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “humming cathedral of obsolete lives,” chilled racks, Deep Cold, and the playlist/silence mechanics create a richly specific, non-generic tech-environment filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The archive is not backdrop; its rules (backups, deletion routing, warrant gates, pattern-loving system) constrain tactics and make the final realization possible. The spaceship patch functions as a micro-setting object that charges the decision scene nicely, further deepening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes” and fog-ringed trees with lanterns create a striking, memorable atmosphere, and the vintage mirror shop inside the lighthouse is both vivid and functional. Setting objects (mirrors, crystal fragment, orchard itself) are not mere backdrop; they become tools and stakeholders in the negotiation, especially when the orchard is proposed as a “deciding voice.” The environment’s physical constraints are less active than its symbolic and procedural ones, but the recurring images of ice floes, lanterns, and storm-smelling dust strongly charge the final vision-work. World rules feel consistent and are learned through observation rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina and ruined fishing village are sharply rendered with selective, purposeful detail—“shattered porcelain,” “ragged teeth of ice,” roofs ripped like “wet paper.” Environment and small tools function as micro-setting: the parasol tip and the unstable boat on creaking floes directly shape how the ending realization is staged. Weather and cold aren’t mere color; they condition movement, tone, and the volunteers’ slow rebuilding. The final scene’s ice, water, and vibrations concretely charge the last conceptual turn rather than floating in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station, amber pavilion, and vineyard are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (taillights into hill mist, ash smelling of thyme and old perfume) that always passes through Tomas’s sensibility. Setting shapes circumstance—the last bus gone, the rising chill, the emptiness—creating the liminal pressure that makes this encounter possible. The vineyard and trellis metaphors organically tie environment to theme rather than feeling pasted on. The final image of the sentinel in the darkened vineyard/station strongly charges the ending with place-based resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is striking and deeply integrated: the murmuring pavilion, restless dunes, and kinetic parapet are all doing thematic and structural work, not just decoration. Environmental features directly constrain stakes—the parapet literally threatens to “breach the surface and swallow tents,” while the pavilion serves as a fragile sanctuary of thought. Details like “whisperfield calm” and “silken walls [that] sighed” build a coherent atmosphere that mirrors the tension between repression and expression. This is just shy of transcendent only because the characters don’t have to physically navigate or adapt tactics to the setting under acute pressure as much as they might.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lavender field behind rusted factory ruins is a striking, specific setting that undergirds tone and theme throughout, from the chimneys as “mute fingers” to lavender “murmuring approval.” Details are filtered through the archivist’s sensibility, with the map case, table, and tea integrated into action rather than static description. The juxtaposition of industrial decay and cultivated purple rows meaningfully mirrors the attempt to reclaim pain as something ordered and fragrant. However, the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices; it charges the imagery more than it shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library, dawn light, dust, and especially the chandelier with sonic orbs are vivid, selective, and entirely filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment is not just decorative: the orbs’ sound-focusing and the cracked crystal actively enable his method and the final “armor” image. World rules around language and sanctioned speech are consistently embedded in setting rather than dumped. It stops just short of 9+ because the setting shapes method and mood more than it directly constrains a hard tactical choice under visible, immediate threat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is outstanding and integral: the junkyard chapel, tidal flats, fog sculpture garden, and driftwood corridors don’t just decorate—they channel choices and frame every beat. The ocean’s erasure of chalk and driftwood functions as an active collaborator/antagonist, and the “collapsed sculpture…like an unmade bed” directly shapes the climactic realization. Details are sensorially rich across modalities (fog, salt mist, rusted hulls, bottle-wind) and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The final image of chalk on a refrigerator door, resisting the rain, is fully charged by all that environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar observatory is vividly particular—“lantern nailed to the raw dark,” regolith, micrometeorites, shuddering pylons—and the environment directly shapes tactics (quake vs. tracking, shielded dome, trembling mirrors). Tools and objects (cameras, tremor sensors, spinning clock) are integrated into both action and mood. The setting also charges the final image, where the closed systems and buried archive feel like a fragile sanctuary in a hostile void. This is fully publishable-caliber atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hospice room, the oxygen tube, the old radio, and especially the clouds turning the ward into a “radiant haven above the clouds” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Mira. Setting actively charges the theme and dialogue (“Are we above everything now… For a little while… we are in the waiting room between worlds”). The recurring shard, windows, and cologne all function as micro-setting elements that constrain perception rather than as static décor. Detail is selective and purposeful, with no white-room patches or tourist listing.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory, floating isle, and celestial machinery are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Lysa’s scholarly gaze. Setting images (island in the broken moon’s penumbra, stars like sparks from a grinding machine) strongly charge the tone and theme. The tools-as-setting—spoons, brass table, key—do constrict what she can do in this moment. However, the environment mainly enriches atmosphere rather than materially constraining choices beyond timing and access, so it stops short of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hedge maze, secret garden, improvised instruments, and violet-sky otherworld are vivid, selective, and tightly filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a bone setter and skeptic. The garden is not postcard scenery; it functions as Tomas’s “sky,” the locus of his experiments, and the necessary site for the portal and the boy’s rescue. The corpse on the table, the tin box, and the hedge at dawn all recur to charge the final image of the substitute body turned to soil and the maze/garden folding like a book. Setting could constrain immediate physical options a bit more explicitly, but as a symbolic and practical container for the action it is highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, ocean hush, and tidal memory are richly and consistently rendered, with details filtered through the narrator’s sensibility as a “star watcher” of non-burning light. The environment meaningfully constrains choice—no fire, secrecy, stone that “remembers tides”—and the cave’s darkness makes the cool glass-light both necessary and potent. The recurring micro-setting of the basin, stone wheel, and mist charges the final image of children holding “tiny moons.” Setting is not postcard; it’s inseparable from the story’s stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The data center-turned-moss-garden is vivid, tactile, and thematically precise: sagging conduit vs. real moss, thaw drip patterns, trays of salvaged metal, cables as trellises. Setting constantly interacts with action (she follows moss “stepping stones”; she kneels into damp; Eli stands knee-deep in green), and the environment clearly charges the closure image of planting over “the worst wounds first.” The amber pendant and the repurposed server space act as micro- and macro-settings that constrain what this ending can be: not escape, but reinhabiting a scarred site. This is elite-level atmosphere with strong integration into character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exquisitely integrated: the “feral nexus in mist,” backward-flowing reflections, and skeletal warehouses all externalize his liminal, in-between state. The river is not just backdrop but the medium of the visions and the core metaphor for crossings and endings, which directly charges the final shoreline image. The seashell functions as a micro-setting/object that opens futures, tying body and environment into the thematic frame. Weather and atmosphere affect tone and choice (he walks into rain/mist without umbrella, into hush), supporting both mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    The arbor, dawn light, wells, and oldest tree are richly rendered and always in play, not mere backdrop; the environment literally mediates the solution as the bowl’s contents are poured into the roots. Sensory detail is specific and filtered through the tinkerer’s attentiveness (“leaves beaded with silver fog,” “iron-tasting shadows”), tying atmosphere to stakes. The setting constrains and enables choice (ritual must occur here, at this time) and charges the final image of blossoms “like slowly waking eyes.” World rules feel internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crater-orchard is exquisitely realized and integral: the grove that “remembered fruit” justifies why this must be his workshop and ties world-death to barrenness. Environmental specifics (subarctic cold, crater floor, withered trees, snow ribs) actively shape his tools (twigs, nests) and the very premise of coaxing maps from a place that once held life. The setting’s logic never wavers, and the final image of the faintly glowing map “scratched onto the cold page of the crater floor” is charged by everything we’ve learned of this place. This is elite-level atmosphere married to function.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marble cavern and its physical properties (stone, scars, moisture, echoes) are exquisitely realized and consistently routed through the locksmith’s sensory hierarchy. Crucially, the environment is not postcard backdrop: the reflective stone, scars, and acoustic behavior directly shape his tactics (mirror placement, chalk marks, use of whispers and questions) and charge the ending’s “crowded, softly luminous” silence. The observatory above and the “city thinning” remain more abstract, but the underground chamber functions as a micro-setting that constrains action and underwrites the metaphysics. This is high-level atmospheric and functional integration, just short of 9+ because setting never sharply forecloses an option or forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bronze grotto and lamp/whalebone micro-setting are vividly realized and inseparable from the story’s logic—the burdens, the “shingled hush,” and her craft literally depend on this environment. Setting details are filtered through her sensibility (“rock shone like old coins…night itself hammered into its curves”), building an atmosphere that both mirrors and shapes her inner work. The environment constrains tactics (she must return here after thaw, use the basin, flame, and hush) and charges the final image of leaving with a new way of bearing weight. World rules around burdens and the grotto remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft and emptied fairgrounds are specific, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Mara’s grief and history with the circus. Weather and height above the fairgrounds mirror her liminal emotional state while the trucks leaving under rain sharpen the “here and gone” motif. The skylight, rain, and loft are not postcard decor: they charge the final image of her carving “under the rain-beaded skylight,” where environment and object converge. The ash blank and kettle function as micro-setting tools that constrain and mark her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kinetic lagoon, stalled carousel, and clockwork seagulls create a distinctive, immersive environment that consistently reflects and pressures the inner conflict. Setting is not mere backdrop: the lagoon’s center, the gears, and the carousel debris all structure the character’s movements and symbolize the cost of his orbiting avoidance. The recurring lagoon/carousel imagery directly charges the final image of the ghost filling with outlines. A slight risk of baroque overload exists, but it stays controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly and economically realized: carnival detritus, cracked tiles, dead fountains, graywater manuals, and pipes all feel tactile and inhabited. Setting is tightly fused with POV—the engineer sees hydraulics and “maze of intentions” where others might see ruins—and the environment directly dictates what she can do (scavenged PVC, existing lines, condensate). The recurring sextant/tool and the building itself both charge the final image of redirected flows and dawn. This is near top-tier atmosphere, just shy of transcendent because the environment never quite corners her into an impossible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary, cloister, and rain-slick crystal forecourt are rendered with dense, varied sensory detail that’s always filtered through Elias’s clock-obsessed, rain-haunted perception. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the no-tools rule, the architecture, and the “soundless” design concept all shape what he can and cannot do. Weather and space entwine with theme in the final image of raindrops as metronomes and a rain-following clock, directly charging the ending. Detail is rich but usually purposeful, with only a few edges of potential over-lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canal, lock, warehouses, and barge hull are vividly and economically realized through smell (“wet iron and lost decisions”), sight, touch, and temperature. Setting is not postcard backdrop; the narrow, cold, barnacled environment constrains movement and tactics underwater, and the final image of the canal swallowing reflections charges the ending. The sundial functions partly as micro-setting/a tool, enriching the sense of time’s strangeness. Description always feels filtered through the narrator’s sensibility rather than generic scenic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, fog, snow, and “golden dock under snow” are vividly rendered and recur in ways that feel integral rather than decorative. Environmental details are tightly tied to Eli’s attention and actions (kneeling in the snow, fog obscuring the world, the dock as altar, harbor’s hush mirroring the rope’s secrecy). The fulgurite and rope function as micro-settings/tools that crucially shape what’s possible in the scene. The final image is strongly charged by this atmosphere—harbor breathing, dock whitening, seeds and knots turning toward spring—meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is extraordinarily vivid and purposeful: “harbor bare as a stripped altar,” “shadowed garden in autumn,” “bronze nymphs crusted with leaves” all mirror the theme of ornate structures gone empty. The garden is not mere backdrop; its paths and remembered incidents literally map Sera’s pain and frame the walk that constitutes the story’s central action. The recurring carpet/thread metaphor ties interior spaces (palace corridors, unfinished carpet) to this external garden. The final image of carrying her presence “like a lantern” is charged by all the preceding environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, and mechanical underworld are rendered with dense, purposeful detail that always feels filtered through the prince’s sensibility. Environmental constraints matter: the elevation and mirrors enable sunlight as a non-industrial heat source and underscore distance from the ruined ground. Recurring industrial imagery (pistons, ore-lifts, Continuum Engine) frames the egg and final chamber as radical intrusions. The setting feels both original and thematically fused to the story’s stakes rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and functionally embedded: coastal dunes, marram grass, and the “obsidian lagoon” all constrain bodies and tactics (on foot instead of truck, boy at the water line, fire line behind). The lagoon is not decorative—it’s the father’s blaze site, the source of the jar sand, and the charged backdrop for Maris’s final choice, so the environment literally and thematically shapes the story. Sensory specificity (salt-softened smoke, kelp-drift, mirror-black water) is selective rather than touristic. This landscape directly charges the closure image of Maris watching the boy with “something quiet inside finally ease.”

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains is richly realized and inextricable from the plot: fountains as dry basins, then as memory-locks, finally as roaring conduits of restoration. Setting details (“air tasted faintly of rain,” “stair spiraling down between sweating stone walls”) are selective, atmospheric, and always filtered through Lira’s work. Environment directly constrains options and charges the final image—the fountains’ breath-like roaring parallels the city “breathing through its fountains.” World rules (memories in fountains, then box) stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    The nebula garden is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the caretaker’s expertise—“petals of ionized dust,” “hydrogen veils,” newborn suns “shed their layers like old regrets.” Setting is not postcard backdrop; its rules (slow, non-burning radiance; generational star cycles) directly shape what the narrator can do and how they conceive of harm. Environmental detail charges the final image: drifting among “falling petals and the humming gears,” the garden itself becomes the arena and embodiment of the narrator’s long, self-imposed watch. The micro-setting of the wrist-bound gear as a time-tool further grounds the cosmic scale in tactile, bodily stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse, cemetery, and butterfly-thickened dusk are vivid, selective, and constantly re-integrated into action and theme: ticking glass, ivy, stone slabs as “unfinished doors,” and the butterflies themselves all matter. The environment meaningfully shapes the story’s options—Elias flees the workshop for this liminal space; the seasonal migration governs when the grandmother appears; the glass and butterflies frame the final ritual. The recurring objects (ribbon, stones, butterflies, greenhouse) explicitly charge the closing image. This is a model of atmospheric yet purposeful setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The clock tower, harbor, and tidal obsidian ridge are vividly rendered and tightly tied to both origin trauma and present duty, with the environment (tower mechanics, sea) clearly shaping what the narrator can and must do. The pendulum chamber functions as a micro-setting whose constraints—weights, cables, arrested bob—charge the climactic stillness. The obsidian shore is not mere backdrop; it is where the inciting harm occurred and recurs imagistically under the tower, deepening the cost of each choice. Description is lush yet purposeful, consistently filtered through the narrator’s time-and-tide-obsessed gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vividly and economically realized: “velveteen gloom,” the cobalt silo, cracked chess clock, and ruined tapestry all feel specific, tactile, and filtered through this narrator’s habits and history. The environment meaningfully shapes action—the disused silo as an “observatory” is where memory is literally woven and decoded. Recurring objects (clock, sovereign case, tapestry) are integrated into place rather than floating symbolism. The piece might edge toward atmosphere-saturation, but it rarely feels like inert postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and ghostly maps create a vivid, coherent environment that mirrors and pressures the decision—cold, isolation, and advancing ice are not mere backdrop but the problem to be solved. Professional details (crates of data, probability coastlines, braziers, vellum) are filtered through a cartographer’s eye. The final image echoes the opening (lake, spire, pen) to charge the setting with the weight of the choice. The only slight limit is that the tower itself doesn’t dynamically constrain tactics beyond mood and symbolic isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: ash “like gray snow,” the “ember alcove in mist,” the hill above the siren-laced city, and the thistling radio hum all feel tactile and lived-in. Details are strongly POV-filtered (her wariness of electric light vs trust in the shortwave, her musician’s ear for keys and intervals). Environment constrains choices—she must hide in the repurposed tram garage, rely on pirate radio, work with ash and pollen dust—and these same elements charge the final image with the boy by the coals. The world’s rules (story famine, monitored utilities) are sketched efficiently through scene rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gallery, ash-dusted floor, rocking chair, and porcelain mask are all integrated into action rather than described as backdrop, with the ash lines literally shaping how people move and hesitate. Spatial and atmospheric details (“twilight hush,” extinguishers, distance to exits, floor seeming to sink) mirror the conceptual stakes and charge the final image. The vanishing-point effect on the floor neatly externalizes the thematic question about perspective and disappearance. A touch more non-visual sensory texture (sound, smell of ash, heat) at peak beats could push this from excellent into the truly immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and thematically charged: “sunken city ruins,” canals where avenues were, leaning towers, and sewers below the “rat line” are all filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environmental details like the waterline slapping “in a rhythm suspiciously close to a heartbeat” and the harbor clock tower sliding through “sedimentary layers” deepen the sense of historical accretion. The cog on the rock shelf functions as a micro-setting/object that charges the final section, turning the environment into a laboratory for truth. While the setting does not tightly constrain moment-to-moment choices, it is integral to mood, premise, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “velvet library in autumn” is vividly evoked and consistently colored—heavy wine curtains, bowed hymnals, rain on high windows—and the sensory choices match the contemplative, fragile work being done. The zither functions as a micro-setting object, a physical and symbolic center that literally structures the final beat. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it absolutely charges tone and stakes: this hushed, secluded room is the only plausible crucible for such tentative harmony. Detail remains selective and filtered through Maro’s priorities, avoiding tourist catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted greenhouse and drowned city are vividly evoked through concrete, character-filtered detail, and the environment materially shapes events (the cracked roof focusing moonlight, the ruined beds that must be cleared, condensation as water source). Sensory layering (salt, rust, mildew, citrus) is purposeful and aligned with the chef’s palate. The setting directly charges the final image—the faint glow through cracked panes amid a ruined city—so atmosphere and world-building meaningfully bind to the closure. This is rich, economical scene-setting without feeling like a tour.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bridge, the blind city, the silent drone “beehives,” and the flickering lightning collection tower form a coherent, atmospheric setting that’s inseparable from the conflict. Environmental elements constrain choice: blackout means emptiness; the closed bridge isolates Marla; the far-off tower is both threat and hope, and its behavior (flicker, flare, steady glow) tracks narrative shifts. Details like “data-cleaning pigeons” and “drone beehives” are specific, not generic SF garnish, and the tower explicitly charges the final image as the instrument of Granddad’s lesson and the city’s revival. The recurring contrast between nectar dusk and the new half-light embeds tone in place rather than floating as mood.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    The house by the bay is exquisitely realized and fully integrated with Eli’s perception: from the rust stain coastline to the sunless corner, every detail feels selected through his sensibility. Environment drives key choices—the storm triggers the shard drop; the corner’s refusal of light and new density compel him to move the bed and sleep there. The recurring streetlights, bay, and breathing architecture all converge to charge the final realization. Setting functions not as backdrop but as active counterpart in the story’s core relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater city garden is vividly, economically rendered—“lantern-corals swaying like drowned candelabra,” “marble lions seemed to inhale”—and details are consistently filtered through the statue’s perception. Setting actively shapes tactics and stakes: the planned structural weakness, the pressure of the water column, and the draining of the sea are all decisive to the outcome. Environmental change is tracked (awakening garden → groaning columns → ceiling rupture → sea draining), charging the final image. The micro-setting elements (ampoule light over mosaics, cracked stairway, anemones) avoid museum-tour excess and remain in service of mood and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The infinite staircase is vivid, coherent, and omnipresent, with concrete asymmetries (cracked baluster, warm railing) that mirror the theme of almost-repetition and missed possibilities. The environment meaningfully constrains choice—no first step, no last, no going back—so all tactics must be framed as endurance and reinterpretation. The crack in the inner wall and the glimpse of the other staircase are environmental events that serve as the story’s key turn. The final image of “boundless confinement” directly depends on and recharges the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rooftop greenhouse over a “smog-choked city” is vivid and specific, with strong multisensory detail (loamy soil, condensation, saffron quiet) and a clear vertical geography. Environment and tools matter: the glass panes become the literal writing surface, their orientation toward the streets makes the magic plausible, and the thin air + moonlight condition the experiment. The polluted city’s harshness makes the remembered kindnesses more poignant, subtly charging the final image. Setting is fully integrated rather than postcard-like, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto city, waterfall, mist, and terraces are vividly tactile and always filtered through the guide’s sensibility. Setting isn’t backdrop: ex-museum galleries as dorms, vanished beehives, the sweating stair, and bread kitchen all shape what the characters can do and what matters. The waterfall and thaw imagery explicitly charge the final plea (“before the last of it thaws and runs back into the waterfall”), making environment central to the thematic cost. Detail is lush but purposeful, never losing spatial or situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and low-tide fissure are vivid and specific (“basalt shining,” “molar in a rotting jaw”) and clearly constrain what is possible—especially the crack to the sea and the stone revealed only at ebb. Setting is consistently filtered through Aurek’s sensibility as a clockmaker and skeptic, which keeps the atmosphere from feeling generic. The environment explicitly shapes the final action (casting the yoyo into the breathing dark below), so the micro-setting directly charges the last image. A touch more interplay between weather/storm and tactical choices could edge this toward a 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is richly and selectively rendered (“broken mirrors,” “wet velvet and chemical smoke”), with details that do double-duty as emotional and supernatural machinery. The environment constrains options: only in this rusted spectacle do the photos shift, only through the mirrors can he access the frozen pier, so setting is not interchangeable. Recurring objects (funhouse mirrors, the ticket booth, the clasp) charge the final image by pivoting us back to the corridor and the warmed Polaroid. Description verges dense but remains purposeful and anchored to Elias’s perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the driftwood ring, tide-casks, ladders, and wave action all materially constrain what anyone can do and drive the central problem. Weather and sea-state directly shape pressure and options, and the musical vocabulary is constantly embodied in tools and structures (mast, apples, ropes). The final image of “tomorrow already humming in the tide” is charged by everything we’ve learned about this environment as both home and peril. Minor restraint on the score comes only from how uniformly lush the description is; it’s rich but always relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The turtle-city is rendered with vivid, selective detail—“barnacled continents,” “salt light” that hides bruises, the harbor gate as “scabbed lace”—and these are filtered through Keth’s professional eye. The environment constrains choices (no ships through the rusted gate; dependence on turtles and shell-script) and directly charges the final image of the turtles turning under oppressive sun. World rules (turtles as infrastructure, shells as language) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than dump. This is beautifully atmospheric and nearly exemplary, with just enough lyric density that one could wish for a single concrete physical obstacle at the gate to match the conceptual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    The disused station, ivy, broken clock, glass roof, and rosebush are vivid and tightly curated, consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility and the story’s concerns with time and annotation. The environment doesn’t constrain physical tactics much, but it strongly charges the argument and the final image: ivy as handwriting/annotation, the busted clock, and the empty tracks directly echo the theme of time overwriting truth and of stories leaving their rails. The setting details evolve (ivy through the clock, rosebush shedding its last petal, gathering dusk) rather than remaining static description. The world feels particular and thematically tuned rather than generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor and submerged pavilion are rendered with precise, textural detail—“drowned lantern,” “glass ribs,” barnacled balustrades—that feel both concrete and lived-in. Setting is not mere backdrop: tides, submergence, and ruined infrastructure dictate timing, access, and the very existence of hidden cavities for her notes. The recurring inkwell and pavilion are effectively used as micro-settings that charge the final images of submersion and hidden archives. A touch more tactile interaction with danger (slipperiness, cold, risk) could further emphasize physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken city and breathing, forgotten library are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“blackout fell like velvet over rust,” “water held respectfully still”), tightly filtered through Mara’s attention. Environmental specifics—the depths, blackout, lantern, stamp, mineral-stained aisles—aren’t mere backdrop; they condition what she can see and do and charge the final discovery. The rules of this underwater world feel internally consistent without exposition dumps. The only reason this doesn’t breach the 9-band is that the environment constrains mood and perception more than it directly blocks or forces specific physical choices in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are not decorative; they shape the ritual, the illegal economy, and the path of Liora’s shadow, and the transparent spiral bridge literalizes her descent through herself. Environmental specifics (lanterns among tea shrubs, moons stored as prisms, moss-soft tables) are consistently filtered through Liora’s craft and grief. World rules—dream recording as contraband, shadows detaching and ascending—remain stable and legible. The final image of the kingdoms sleeping under a sky of folded sorrow is both setting and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory, ruined desert, and orbital array are sharply and economically rendered, always filtered through the narrator’s traumatized, technical gaze. Setting is not postcard: orbit enables the kind of god’s-eye manipulation the story interrogates, and the desert rubble grounds stakes in physical loss. The geode functions as an object-as-setting, linking ground and orbit and charging the final image when the narrator grips it to redirect the model. World rules (quantum market analytics, “wells” as vortices) are consistent enough to feel lived-in without stalling the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, dome breach, and rusted telescope are not mere backdrop; they actively shape the revelation by allowing actual starlight to fill the chip’s missing squares and by forcing a specific bodily posture at the eyepiece. Details like “light thinned to a brilliant dimness” and the dome “open to the dimming sky” build a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors Mira’s liminal emotional state. The environment literally completes the data structure, charging the final image of the glowing chip. A hair less lushness in a few phrases could make the setting feel even more organic rather than curated, but it already operates at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt terrace, the crumbling steps, and especially the driftwood-strewn shore are vivid and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; the world feels sparse but precise rather than generic. The environment directly shapes action: he must go down from the terrace to the coded shoreline, and the physical act of sifting carvings is the investigative engine of the climax. The pocket watch as a recurring object effectively charges the final images, binding setting, family, and code into one visual logic. A slightly deeper sense of the wider world’s social texture (beyond the shore and terrace) might add even more dimensionality, but what’s present is already publication-level.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, sea roar, moon, and swinging lantern create a vivid, embodied environment that feels both physical and symbolic without tipping into cliché. Setting elements actively shape the scene—the sea erases sound, the narrow wet stone focuses movement, the lantern over waves becomes an action point, and the moon’s phase structures the ritual. Details are filtered through the negotiator’s mindset, so the world-building never feels like a neutral tour. The only tiny limit is that environmental constraints could pressure tactics even more explicitly at the exact moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal setting and weather are vivid and purposeful: fog, tide, and pylons are not postcard detail but active pressures that shape his options and imagery. The utility poles and the kayak launch are deeply integrated with his professional past and present crisis, and the water genuinely constrains what he can do (paddling out of sight of shore, risk of disorientation). The astronomical compass and the kayak act as micro-settings that charge the final image (compass thumping during the return strokes). A tiny step down from 9+ only because the environment never quite forces a concrete tactical workaround beyond the decision itself.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The world is sharply rendered, from pigeons in oil slicks and soot-wearing towers to the dust-drowned stadium and the bioluminescent lake. Details are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, giving the setting a lived, biased texture rather than a tour. Environment meaningfully constrains action and charges the ending: welded doors, the oxy torch, the sloping tunnel, and the cold, reactive water all shape what he must do. The lake, in particular, functions as both physical place and moral mechanism, strongly charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard, moon, cauldron tree, and spices are vividly rendered and always in play—no white-room moments—and the environment directly shapes the options (only this orchard and its cauldron tree can host the conjuring; the narrator ultimately becomes the grove itself). The permanent moonlight and listening soil mirror and then literalize the theme of an attentive, memory-bearing world. The final image of the phoenix scattering embers into “new, listening seed[s]” is strongly charged by earlier environmental details. At times the density of description edges toward luxuriant excess, but it remains legible and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The midnight glade above the cloud-sea is vivid and functions as more than backdrop: the clouds as “altar” and “weather system of cloudbound repentance” actively frame his guilt and the visionary bridge. Recurring objects (cards, tablecloth strip, porcelain shard) are integrated into the environment and culminate in the moss-and-hand image that precipitates the climax. Weather and altitude shape tone and perception, and the final decision is inseparable from this elevated, liminal place. The piece fully meets the object-as-setting and setting-as-pressure gates for the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The recycled spaceship, dead star, archive deck, and the Tear together form a vivid, coherent environment that is both atmospheric and functional. Setting details (low spin, orbiting currents, archive as “chapel and wound,” magnetic cradle) are filtered through the narrator’s priorities and consistently shape tactics (using weightlessness to reach panels, increased weight to anchor the ship). The Tear in particular operates as object-as-setting, charging and constraining the final image. There’s little sensory breadth beyond visual and kinesthetic, but the chosen focus suits the stark, devotional tone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is exceptionally strong: the black sand beach, banked-coal volcano, and sky “bent around an eclipse and a wandering comet” create an atmosphere that’s precise, uncanny, and tonally unified. The environment isn’t just decorative: the volcano’s geography determines the camps’ peril and the possibility of lava reaching the sea harmlessly, directly shaping Niko’s tactical choice to route people sideways. Lightning bugs as “tame constellations” and the observatory details are filtered through character and theme rather than reading as tourist catalog. The physical world and celestial choreography jointly charge the final image of lava cooling short of the camps and the hush of gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The luminous fort with bottled daylight, the gate tower, seized portcullis gears, and inner ramparts form a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and functional. Setting is tightly integrated with action: the gatework, hidden circuits, and daylight tubes all matter to what Iri can do and how she can do it. The fort’s identity as “cradle of sparks” and as a glowing promise versus smoky bruise under blackout directly charge the thematic stakes and the final image. World rules (regulated light, machinery, coded tools) feel consistent and are conveyed through use rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the frictionless sea, tidal bluff, and aurora are not just backdrop but active rule-sets that govern what is possible (eels gliding in air, still rock pools, the risk of “sliding forever”). The environmental shift at the end—the first messy wave, the scrape of stone—directly charges the closure image and reweights everything we’ve seen. Details like “colors poured across the sky like melted compasses” and the eels as “silver thoughts” are precise, memorable, and POV-filtered. The only small limitation is that non-visual senses are comparatively underused.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory above the storm, with its slit dome, brass fittings, and “stormlit” sky, is vividly rendered and tightly bound to the story’s concept of scars in the ionosphere. Environmental constraints—the altitude, the storm, the limited window when the phenomenon appears—directly shape what is possible and why this vigil matters now. Details feel filtered through the poet’s sensibility, turning weather and machinery into extensions of theme rather than postcard scenery. The final image of the sky’s “luminous bruise” depends entirely on this specific, coherently built setting.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and light-beams are rendered with precise, motivated detail that consistently shapes perception and tactic—the beams literally route arguments and define Darius’s craft. The environment is not postcard scenery: glass, mirrors, broken paint, and moving light are integral to how he manipulates disputes and to his final gesture. The recurring objects (sundial, tin, rapier) all tie into the setting’s physics and aesthetics, charging the last image. This is one of the piece’s most fully realized strengths, with the environment doing clear narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rusted, roofless ex-prison library is sharply evoked and keeps shaping choices: open roof admits moonlight and rain, scrap bars and loose floorboards provide both vulnerability and concealment. Details like “boots crunching glass in the courtyard” and the coffee tin under the floorboard integrate environment with suspense and tactic. The final image of the floorboard swelling “as if breathing” under the officer’s boot and then being lifted charges the place itself as a living, resistant body. Setting is never postcard-static; it’s a functioning constraint and metaphorical engine.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings—the station, the attic, and especially the tidal arbor—are vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through the story’s musical and mechanical motifs. The arbor’s roots, clouds, and hanging compasses do more than decorate: they embody the refuge of hesitation and physically host the final choice. Objects like the broken clock and film projector subtly constrain options and charge the closing image. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment under decision pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, integrated, and filtered through Kael’s work: ridge, lagoon, meeting house, monsoon sky, and even the shell designs and goat behavior all feel like extensions of the island’s dreaming. The “ancient ridge in bloom” and “uncertain silver” sky recur and evolve, culminating in the dream where the ridge sprouts the knowledge-tree, so environment literally and symbolically charges the final stakes. Weather and geography don’t force tactical maneuvers yet, but they shape the window of decision (“before monsoon arrives”) and the ritualized place of listening. Detail is rich without lapsing into catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The islet, weather, and sea are vividly and economically rendered (“sky the color of rinsed ink,” “wet soil releasing a smell like opened books and seaweed”), and the environment feels genuinely inhabited. Setting elements—especially the compass, lace, grove of bonsai, and offshore seam—directly constrain and charge choices and the final image. World rules around the severance and ghost ships stay consistent and are learned through observation, not exposition dumps. The atmosphere is integrated tightly with character perception, making setting a genuine pressure-bearing layer rather than scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "sunken orchard" and "ashen forge" actively shaping the acoustic and visual palette of the story. Details like "glass breathing out" and "ribs blooming rusted anemones" ground the fantastical elements in concrete sensory experience. The environment constrains the action and colors the protagonist's perception effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the station, "green as bottled oceans," is rendered with immersive specificity. The fleeting "golden hour" lighting does not just color the scene but actively constrains the magic and the meeting, integrating setting deeply into the plot's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, effectively blending high-tech ruin with primitive craft ("dead panels," "frozen rivers"). The atmosphere is vivid and anchors the theme well. However, the reliance on visual description over other senses and the static nature of the environment limits the score slightly below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "rusted library" is an exceptional setting, blending decay with the artificiality of the soundstage ("books sealed in clear plastic") to mirror the protagonist's identity crisis. The environment actively charges the final realization about the "illusion of invincibility," satisfying the 9+ criteria for setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is palpable and specific ("stubborn barnacle," "broken hinges"), with the setting actively constraining the characters. The environment functions as a pressure cooker that forces the oracle's task.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    The sensory environment is exquisite; the "organ pipes" of icicles and the "thick eyelids" of the sky actively charge the narrative mood and constrain the action. The setting isn't just a backdrop but the instrument of the protagonist's transformation, particularly in the tactile interaction with the ice violin which bridges the gap between setting and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "crystal whispering forecourt" and the "spent thunder" create a vivid, immersive texture. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, as the "mindfield" of silent exchange is the very thing she must enter to resolve the plot. Sensory details are specific and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The contrast between the "glass office towers" and the "green thought" of the maze is established with sensory precision. The sensory details—tasting soil, the feel of the marbles—ground the speculative elements in tactile reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist and mirrors his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and immersive, blending the mechanical and the organic effectively ("metallic dusk," "iron tang of thawing samples"). The atmosphere strongly supports the "icy warmth" tone, grounding the speculative elements in sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting functions as an active antagonist and collaborator; the "patient tide" and "swollen leaf" program constrain movement and dictate the plot's central mechanic. Sensory details are precise and transformative, turning the flooded pit into a "sunken cathedral" that actively shapes the musician's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the isolation and the "thin air" amplify the feverish, confessional atmosphere. The physical details of the station—the humming lung, the green auroral light on the glass—mirror the internal state of the protagonist and the oracle's data.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Atmosphere is a standout strength, with tactile and auditory details like "mineral cold" and "machinery running underwater" grounding the supernatural elements. The "beaded valve wheel" serves as an excellent anchor object that bridges the industrial setting with the devotional subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is an active participant in the story rather than a backdrop; the library's roots and the obsidian refuge physically constrain and guide the narrative. The transformation of the room into the river refuge is vivid and meaningful, serving as the external manifestation of the protagonist's internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is a strength; details like the "oxygen tubing looping... like a halo" and "shadows sharpening like ink" effectively ground the moment. The setting creates a specific, textured mood that supports the quiet drama.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "reclaimed silo library" with fireplaces sunk into the floor is vivid and specific. The sensory details ("bronze quiet," "skylight filmed with dust") effectively ground the abstract premise in concrete imagery that shapes the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Atmosphere is a standout strength, with details like "bricks salted and pitted" and the "lantern room shuttered like a half-closed eye" creating a vivid, tactile world. The setting is not just a backdrop but the mechanic of the plot; the lighthouse and the bar are integral to the flow of information and the protagonist’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly realized, blending the physical (dust, stained glass) with the metaphysical (dimensional anchor) effectively. The auditory landscape—the "lattice of sound"—is treated as a tangible part of the environment that constrains the antagonist, integrating setting seamlessly into the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strictly integrated with the character's internal state; the frozen lake and glass spire act as mirrors for his "chronological" mapping. Specific details like the "nautilus shell segment" and the imagined "fluorescent diner" ground the surreal premise in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The viaduct setting is atmospheric and tightly integrated with the protagonist's power and the central metaphor of falling. The "drop and ripple" motif anchors the magic system in the physical environment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    The drum maker's cavern is an active participant in the story, not just a backdrop; the stone, dust, and vibration are essential to the plot's mechanics. The sensory details are rigorously filtered through Eira’s tactile and visual perspective, creating a vivid, immersive atmosphere that grounds the more fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atmosphere is evocative, with "smears of copper and glass" grounding the scene in a specific, lived-in reality. A minor logical friction exists in the "rogue" zone being described as "forgotten by central monitors" yet explicitly "labeled" on their maps, but the mood remains cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, utilizing the "island of crystal shadows" and the ultraviolet tool to constrain and shape the scene's climax. The sensory details are highly specific and active ("condensation glitter," "light buzzing like trapped bees"), grounding the magical elements in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset; descriptions like "torn auroras," "cooled clay," and the "wound and a womb" metaphor effectively ground the abstract conversation in a physical reality. The sensory details ("smelling faintly of metal") are specific and vivid, though they occasionally verge on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is actively hostile and inspirational; the "diving suits hung like ghosts" and "barnacle-sugared pipes" are distinct, tactile constraints that shape the story's acoustic metaphor. The environment does not just house the action; it teaches the protagonist the central lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    The amber grotto is a superb, constraining environment that amplifies the sensory themes (preservation, filtration). Details like "fossilized resin" and "copper filaments" ground the metaphysical transaction in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "breezy library under stars" is established with strong sensory details like the smell of rope and brine, effectively grounding the abstract themes in a physical reality. The setting actively supports the tone, though the atmosphere occasionally leans into romanticized softness rather than grittier texture.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystalline orchard is a vivid, imaginative setting that anchors the tone and provides strong visuals like the "obsidian arbor." While the description occasionally leans into static observation, the environment is integral to the plot and charges the final image of the collaborative sculpture.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is outstanding, with the "giant's nap" providing a tangible rhythmic constraint on the world. Sensory details like "shadows locking like teeth" and "air tasted like old bells" create a unique, immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but a mechanic; the "stalactites drip like slow clocks" and the "mute" orchard constrain the pacing and atmosphere. The specific, tactile nature of the glass eyes and mosaic grounds the abstract magic, charging the final image with resonance.

Spatial choreography holds through single night-walk.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Winterglass conservatory is not postcard but instrument: frozen ivy “shook snow from the rafters,” now quivers under actuator impulses. Glass ceiling, sensor-gloves, and tuning forks form a micro-setting that constrains every choice; remove it and the science-music conversion fails. Body-as-instrument detail (“his ribs felt it”) supplies tactile choreography. City fires seen through panes mirror internal auroras, but overt symbolism is avoided. Speculative tech (thermal-music rig) reads plausible because mechanics are shown in action, not lectured.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Harbor town rust, seaweed reek, and drowned moonlight are filtered through Elias’s undertaker gaze; every detail is selective, never touristic. The underwater library is rendered through motion—books drifting like fish, shelves bending where geometry fails—so setting actively constrains movement and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment, body, and tool triangulate to force each beat: the brass camera’s weight against the spine, the tiled archways funneling the last stripe of sun, the jar’s quiver threads that climb pillars once uncapped. Sensory hierarchy is photographer-narrow: vision first, then haptic (brass chill, glass warmth), finally smell of damp marigolds. The station clock “shrugging into twilight” is not postcard colour but a live dial that pressures the shutter press. Final image of the “cool, unspectacular moon” externalizes the narrator’s stripped lens after the conceptual price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Frost-dust-light, frozen cables, and the kiln’s ember constrain movement and metaphor: ice melt dictates timeline, console surface supplies the literal pedestal for the final image.

Sensory hierarchy skews visual but is filtered through POV’s wonder, never touristic. Spatial choreography clean: Corin’s boots among cables, narrator tracing erased labels—bodies track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted library is no postcard: metal ribs orange with decay, plastic-wrapped books like cadavers, a seashell wired to hiss when wind slips through girder holes—every detail is tactile and stakes-contingent. The body-as-micro-setting appears when her “body kinks around fear like a wire around a magnet,” a literal constraint that later enables her to weaponize the same tremor. Spatial choreography is clean: boy limps in, nurse exits, table becomes shared altar; no impossible positions. Final image recharges the shell’s fake tide as synchronized breath, environment forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ridge fort’s broken hinges and rain-slick drum-table constrain posture and tool use; bodies must tilt, pages must be flattened, so setting actively shapes the only possible choreography. The flaking gold booklet evolves from cargo to lamp to compass, its material fragility dictating why the map must be finished now—flakes lost cannot be reclaimed. One-star clock and marbled hush function as micro-settings that compress scale and force interior attention, charging the final image when darkness swallows walls yet leaves gilt outlines. Environmental mirroring (storm = internal dread) is present but subordinated to utilitarian pressure, avoiding overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frozen courtyard, icicle organ pipes, and the black-stone plinth are selective, tactile, and mirrored in the violin’s fragility; environment literally melts under contact, constraining the climax.

Weather is not backdrop but catalyst: rain schedules the concert and enables the final silver-mist communion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden maze is not postcard scenery; its leaning hedges and scent-schedule constrain Elias’s tactics and supply the final image’s “question mark” curvature. The cracked marbles act as micro-setting: their fractures decide how light refracts and therefore how Elias reads portents. Spatial choreography is spotless—visitors enter, exit, leave emotional residue that he maps onto soil and plant. One pinch of specificity short of 9.0: we’re never shown how the public fortune screens physically interface with the maze border.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ice-sheathed cliffs, twin-moon dusk, and frost-polished lever are vivid and selective, filtered through Ilen’s mechanic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mountain station, iced railings, and auroral glow constrain escape routes and supply the oracle’s wind power; the Feverwhisper illustration is handled twice—first as relic, finally as extinct casualty—charging the closing image. Micro-setting (clipboard, monitor glass) doubles as emotional mirror without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment meaningfully shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: it is physically handled twice, its plastic beads clicking like prayer counters, and supplies the only light-reflecting surface in the dark, forcing the narrator to confront Evan’s guilt. Spatial choreography is impeccable—rails, gravel, drip, valve—each element tracked across moves. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: the mineral cold and flashlight cones narrow to the valve’s carnival crown, mirroring the narrator’s reluctant focus on Evan’s evidence. The tunnel’s “breathing” and underwater-machinery cadence charge the final image, making the setting inseparable from the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment (courtyard ash tree, flagstones, eclipse light) directly constrains the action: music must stay low, bodies must stay still, eyes must use cardboard viewers. The “baby hair curl” functions as micro-setting in the drawer, charging the final sky-image when its color swirls into the eclipse. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s musician bias—sound and light dominate, smell of sage threads throughout. Specificity is irreplaceable: remove Sage Ridge slope or the tree and the communal hush collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The reclaimed silo library is not backdrop but instrument: spiralling shelves guide Brann’s literal descent and metonym for cultural descent. The fireplace’s “blackened mouth” and the tapestry’s “interrupted orbits” are handled twice each, their material history altering his sensory route. Dust-filmed skylight, bronze-quiet air, and soot temperature all return in the final image, charging the CR with tactile cost. Setting micro-constrains every probe.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, bar, and salt-rotted bricks constrain every move; the shuttered lantern room functions as both tool and antagonist. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—“bricks salted and pitted,” “lens groaned like an old musician.” Micro-setting (soy-sauce canisters, reflection on bottles) rewrites espionage logistics without exposition. Final image of refracted beam “spilled letters across the bottles” charges closure and reweights earlier visual motif.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the single square of ultramarine functions as both tool and environment—its “strange attention” constrains the exorcism to one hue, one question. Dust-softened stained glass is not mere mood; it literally muffles sound, letting the loop lattice breathe. Spatial choreography is clean—guitar case, palette, pew, pedal—every object handled on-page and re-weighted at exit. Gate met: environment charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell function as micro-setting: every physical detail (ice doubling sky, spiral as ruler, horizon as tunnel) constrains Eli’s creative method and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys his obsessive need for precise increments of space/time. The mirrored horizon is not backdrop; it is the workspace where he literally draws and folds time, making environment inseparable from agency.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The viaduct’s wet-stone reflections and drain-whispers are filtered through Lio’s hyper-attention to gravity and surface; every sensory pick is purposive. Micro-setting bonus: the clay tablet’s refusal to absorb water becomes a tactile rule that foreshadows its later rejection of “rain”/possibility. Spatial choreography is flawless—hover, fall, sideways step—bodies track. The final image of the tablet sliding into black water recharges the earlier “darkening brightness” motif, earning high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern is not backdrop but instrument: drilled tunnels and filament paths constrain how silence can be routed, charging the final image.

Setting constrains: the hollow’s thermal and visual intimacy forces the existential conversation that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Glass ribs, diving-suit ghosts, barnacled pipes—each detail is filtered through Elio’s acoustic bias and later constrains the final image when the upside-down bowl catches “unfinished echoes.” The greenhouse micro-setting literally shapes the closing gesture; removing it would collapse the conceptual reprice. Sensory hierarchy favors rust, lime, distant tides—precise, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amber grotto is not backdrop but dielectric: honeyed sorrow light refracts perception, copper shelves ground the static field, and the blotter-petal acts as wick and electrode. Sensory triangulation—resin glow, copper tang, burnt-sugar scent—mirrors Eve’s synesthetic static, fusing setting to body. Spatial choreography stays clean: dealer on crate, shelves growing from stone, Eve’s palm opening to receive the petal. Final image of “scaffolds to climb” re-uses the grotto’s golden ribs as metaphor, charging the setting with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Breezy library under stars” is not backdrop but active resource: open doors let salt air turn pages, guiding Elias inside; lanterns later become the emblematic prop for the reading scheme. Micro-setting of the envelope and locket constrains every beat—Elias fingers it, Marin re-centers it, both treat it as contract. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; sensory economy favors sound (sea, symphony fade) and touch (paper, locket, shelf edges). Final image re-weights the lanterns as social currency, fulfilling 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are not backdrop but tactical: the arbor’s facets literally swallow starlight, forcing the protagonists to squint, lean, discover grooves. Micro-setting (Mira’s chalk lines, Elian’s sap-green palms) constrains movement and dictates kneeling/standing positions. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—Elian notices reed-like gleams, not tourist vistas.

Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a child notices crossbars as “hands held out,” tastes metallic silence, fears sky-as-ceiling inversion. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies track across beams, distances hold, weather (storm bruise) tightens the final inversion. The porcelain doll evolves from relic to resonance chamber to sacrificed object, charging the final image when it drifts away.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    The obsolete-satellite snow, citrus-ozone water, and hour-glass fruits are sensually concrete; orchard’s camera-trees and translucent OS-steps function as micro-setting that literally constrain footing and record choice, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across waterfall → orchard → chapel → stair is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mushroom-lit cavern, moisture gauges, and the bolt’s brass cold are tactile filters for Mara’s scam-honed eye for shiny promises. Environment constrains choice: darkness slows concept-manifestation, giving her a决策 window; hatch geometry mirrors bolt, turning setting into tool. Sensory hierarchy—bioluminescent pulse, metallic sigh—mirrors internal shift from passive caretaker to active risk-taker. Final image of bolt clicking against hatch wheel fuses body, tool, and place into one resonant gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Palatine Library is no backdrop; dust motes become “mute constellations” that guide Aurel’s attention, the moth-eaten cloth shrouding acoustic evidence. The oak table’s old-tea glow concentrates the dynasty’s genealogy into tactile guilt. Micro-setting triumph: the bare platter and sticky crank transmit literal tremor, allowing the room itself to speak. Setting thus charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alchemical orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains final choice: only here can masks of future selves be lifted. Metallic trees, bottled-dawn fruit, and silver soil are selective, not catalogued; each detail hums or chimes under touch, guiding Calder toward the decision fork. Glass veins breathing frost returns in final image of “unsnapped strings,” charging closure. Spatial choreography clean: threshold → rows → mask tree; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The file room is rendered through lived indexes—bowed shelves, shaky handwriting, brass button worn “to a tired gleam”—each filtered by Mara’s archivist gaze. Spatial choreography is pristine: fingers trace, folders flip, dust lines appear. The micro-setting (the button) constrains her imagination and later charges the brother-visitor beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selective sensory filter—cold brass sweat, cracked glass, diluted-metal glow—grounds orientation and later constrains action (key must fit, lagoon must be stepped into). The tram-yard’s broken tiles and peeling warehouses are economically sketched; the lagoon’s impossible glow functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto functions as micro-setting: its mineral patience, weeping stalactites, and prism atrium actively filter and reshape sound, constraining how the protagonist can play. Dewdrops serve as a living metronome, marking both time and rests. The patched sax case and the uninked lake are tactile, character-filtered objects that charge the final image—notes scratched like “slow handwriting” that must then be unwritten. No static postcarding; every detail is woven through action or sonic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment and tool converge in the final beat: the arbor’s hollowed trunk, grooved niches, and root-floor literally constrain the planting act and charge the closing image. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Lio notices weight, color, forgotten-wind angle—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (seed grooves, bark crescent) doubles as stage for monuments, so spatial choreography stays legible. The moonstone speck is a recurring object whose final gleam re-illuminates the entire map-leaf, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subterranean waterfall is not backdrop but hydraulic pressure that literally undermines the depot and Eli’s creed. The greenhouse’s leaf-swirl and roofless sky externalize the compass-rose logic of open possibility. Every object—mineral-salt pedestal, furred moss door, clock-stem planters—constrains movement and supplies tactile texture. Micro-setting qualifies: the brass disk’s warmth and mineral crust charge the final choice to let clocks drift.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The foundry’s single live coal and steaming crucible function as micro-setting, literally melting the zodiac coin that charges closure. Rain-turned-mirror and rust-turned-ink are not decorative; they foreshadow the “kintsugi” alchemy of sealing fracture with meaning. Spatial choreography is immaculate: doorway → crucible → vapor projection → night exit, each move tracked without drift. Weather is causally active: rain cools iron, feeds the crucible, and mirrors the sky that once held the constellations now being rewritten.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Echo gorge is not postcard scenery; its cliff-harp is a tool that literally re-tunes choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s ear—wind temperature, wire-scrape laughter—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: pebbles knocked downhill track her descent; sunrise angle shifts mark beat changes. Micro-setting (tooth, harp) constrains tactics and recharges the final image—sunrise now “gently veiled” by the laughter she released.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ultraviolet forest and pewter strap function as micro-settings that constrain choice; the strap’s coil “like a discarded question mark” physically anchors the decision to submit. Sensory selection stays urgent—UV light is “a bruise… invisible to ordinary eyes”—and the frame’s cables into soil track spatially. Environment charges the final image: pain factoring into light equations.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is the story’s nervous system: the swaying planks, brass alembics, and breathing pigments are not backdrop but tools that teach the narrator how to read silences. The lighthouse shard itself becomes micro-setting in the final beat, bending light and meaning in the palm—this constraint on future action charges the closure. Spatial choreography stays clean despite dream logic; every dangling frame and night-wind eddy is tracked. Only the city below remains a postcard blur, but that distance is thematic, not error.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective sensory economy nails the abandoned midway: “cracked plaster,” “elevator grease” cold on breath, the brass barrel’s polished circle. The ticket office functions as micro-setting—its ceiling becomes the inverted floor that reconfigures reality. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and distances track cleanly as the narrator kneels, the boy leans, the bulge swells directly overhead. The final image of mirrored elevator doors charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass orchard, brass letterpress, and bottled whisper each constrain tactics: frost patterns literally dictate typesetting, the press’s “revolving moons” limit layout options, and the emptied bottle’s fogged glass visually signals spent possibility in the closing image. Cloud-sea altitude, sideways-turning wing, and prismatic light are not postcard scenery; they react to the printed page, forcing librarians to renegotiate shelving policy. Sensory hierarchy aligns with Ilen’s artisan attention—ink, brass, frost, translucent paper—grounding abstraction in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Baroque asteroid as micro-setting: nickel-iron cornices, mirrored copper vines, and magnetic storms physically constrain choices—covering glass becomes tactical against visible time. The shard’s frozen-breath clarity recurs to re-charge the ending, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the chamber itself: stone sphere of dangling chimes whose acoustic logic forces Elias to externalize his repair as song. Micro-setting—the blackwood box with its “ring of polished emptiness”—literally contains the fix and later carries residual heat as proof. Spatial choreography stays crisp: droplets ring, rust recoils, light seeps along metal. The environment is not backdrop; it is the instrument Elias plays.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Abandoned rail, chemical ditch, limestone cave, and still lagoon form a causal chain that successively constrains movement and charges the final mirror-surface. Sensory hierarchy skews to smell and touch, matching Elias’s collector bias. Spatial choreography is clean: the skiff’s rotted ribs echo factory ribs, tightening the motif. Environment directly shapes the final tactic—boat as only path—qualifying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Storm-tossed archway is not backdrop but navigation instrument: its throat shapes her new cartography. Driftwood tangle altar, salt-and-burned-sugar smell, lantern slide crusted with barnacles—tactile specificity every paragraph. Micro-setting (the slide glass) literally refracts her future, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The etched window itself functions as micro-setting: its vine-shadows physically map where night soil must lie, directly constraining Ira’s tactical realization and later mural placement. Selective sensory triage—ink-and-match scent, low-angle sun sliding “like water through layered rock”—mirrors Ira’s painterly attention without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track his body up the narrow stair and back down to the nave. Environment charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; only a hairline repetition of “dawning hush” keeps it just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating library ribs, swaying book-lanterns, and obsidian lagoon that “drinks the sky” are filtered through Maris’s archival gaze; each detail doubles as tool and metaphor. Micro-setting—the diary warming in her palm—constrains the choice to descend the rope ladder. Spatial choreography remains clean: rope ladder, dunes, debris-letters track without drift. The lagoon’s return in the final image recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Paper-lantern cove is lived-in through alchemist-perceptual filters: “hulls knocking softly like teeth,” salt-flaking skins, workshop amber catching fractured light. The bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains his final choice—its refusal to open forces the reimagining experiment. Sensory economy is strict; every visual or haptic detail mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient orchard atop steel is not mere postcard; it supplies the very stones and gauze labels that enable Lan’s archival rite, constraining how the wax is handled. Micro-setting—the velvet-lined box, the fig tree as altar—becomes tactile extension of the tower’s skeleton. Spatial choreography is clean: gravel path, stone altar, Lam’s robed shuffle track logically. Only gap: no sensory acknowledgment of height (wind, sway) to remind us we’re on a skyscraper crown—tiny but keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound atrium is not backdrop: the rimed balconies and blue-lit cradle physically constrain movement and focus attention. The oak acorn cap micro-setting reappears at climax, its polished rim imaging the price of fifty swapped years. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—cold glass, tidal breath, frost on skin—mirroring the internal freeze/thaw. One hairline slip: “starlight” is named but never filtered through dome glass again.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sanctuary’s stone ribs and silver dishes actively guide the climax: their shiver is the cue that nearly pulls the rope. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist—wind veers, pressure jitters, solstice hush is a rule written into the culture. The cathedral rope’s fibers carry the drowned town’s memory, constraining Elias’s grip. Micro-setting (rope grain against palm, dishes trembling on gimbals) charges the final image; environment earns its 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tracking dome functions as micro-setting: console dust “crushed nebulae,” monitors “almost remembered how to listen.” Yellow lantern glass recurs, constrains final stance. Sensory triage—metallic tang, ozone—filters through janitor’s professional eye. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The apiary’s warped frames and glassy dunes filter every decision: proximity to the shed dictates ritual, the cracked hives embody abandonment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—beeswax dust motes, wind-hiss—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography holds as Mara phases through the wall and dust constellations briefly swirl. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; without its colored spill the covenant could not refract onto the ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald silo breathes like a sleeping animal, its glow feeding on spilled chronology; this micro-setting actively constrains the narrator’s tactics—he stays underground, speaks to glass, accepts payment in obsolete coins. Weathered garage-sale objects (chipped mugs, rusted tools) function as tactile calendar ticks, their descriptions anchoring time through texture rather than number. Sensory economy is disciplined: sound of breathing concrete, sight of fogged glass, touch of warm fragment—each detail recurs only when it sharpens choice or stakes. The final image of “anticipated mysteries” is charged by the silo’s algae-light, meeting the 9+ gate, but a single over-ripe qualifier (“storm glass”) slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lagoon, rain-wet stone, and spiraling color strands are filtered through Elian’s synesthetic attention; every sensory note guides his next micro-choice (barefoot steps, feather to ear). The feather itself acts as micro-setting that constrains—its warmth and pulse dictate the harmonizing beat. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kite, child, whirlpools, bird-being all track without drift. Only the kite’s final disappearance lacks a mirrored environmental echo, keeping this just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The temple orchard is no backdrop; its basalt pillars breathe, veins of moss contract, and hidden seams unlock only when copper conducts lightning—environment as active negotiator. Every sensory pick is filtered through the caretaker’s professional gaze: tide lines, wind damage metrics, lichen graffiti, bird-gossip—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is immaculate; wires, tools, body, and cliff track cleanly across the final storm beat. The stone itself constrains the success and cost of the remodel, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment functions as micro-setting: the tower’s rain-washed stone, the spiral clearing’s bare earth, and the fly-amber bead each constrain attention and finally charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—astronomer’s eye for “old telescopes,” chemist’s eye for “cooled metal after lightning.” Spatial choreography is clean; descent from tower to clearing tracked through boots, drizzle, lichen. The spring rain and bronze quiet evolve from backdrop to felt pressure, mirroring the world’s metallic listening after contact. Setting specificity is irreplaceable: remove the rainwashed tower and the entire tonal engine collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “blooming jetty at twilight” functions as micro-setting: its warped planks and rusted railings physically guide pod placement and force the coachman to kneel where ammunition swells. The dead reef—an “absence so complete it seemed like a statement”—acts as negative environment that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: lantern beam, horse-ghost breath, smell of ash; no tourist catalog. Tool-as-setting gate met: the wooden seed-case and its illegible labels constrain every tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Scrapyard constellation, rusted junk, waxed leaf—each detail is filtered through the narrator’s sound-oriented gaze and constrains the final choice to broadcast rather than bury. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies, bench, shelf, dog position track. No static postcard dumps; sensory economy favors tactile and aural over visual excess. The leaf above Barrow charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observation deck doubles as micro-setting: viewport glass, compass inlay, and dilated starfield physically constrain movement and attention. Environmental details (recycled-dust taste, shutter stutter, thickened void under the ring’s shadow) are filtered through Elian’s cartographer gaze and sync with his slowed heartbeat. The gilded compass rose—handled twice: once as warning tape, finally as tactile brace—steers the literal footing of the ending beat. Spatial choreography is clean: edge-of-compass, lift of eyes, palm-on-glass sequence tracks without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The spire’s glassy rungs, bruise-colored sky, and wind that “died as if decapitated” are selective, POV-filtered, and pressure the climb tactics. The sundial lid itself acts as micro-setting, constraining the final choice by its refusal of temperature and time. Meets 9+ gate: the icebound needle and wrong sky together charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic arcs literally let strangers divorce without eye contact and let the narrator write apologies into stone. The chessboard’s pawn-absence is handled twice—first as morgue-drawer, finally as phantom knight-moves—charging the closing question of refused promotion. Micro-setting (the curved floor) constrains every step and dictates how text can be archived; the dome’s draft is the final image that reweights the city’s vacancy. Environment, tool, and recurring object all meet the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bookstore-mountain functions as a living constraint: moving shelves, lanterns of stained pages, and the spring-fed ink all shape navigation and possibility. The niche’s glass that feels “feathered” is the micro-setting object that literally unlocks the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating rooms. Just shy of 9+ because the exterior storm is only acoustically registered—no tactile consequence on skin.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ivory pawn functions as micro-setting: its worn crown constrains every tactical decision and is charged in the final image. Platinum tower plates, suspended droplets, and frayed tapestry threads are selectively sensed through Elior’s chess-tutor eye—geometry, weight, reflectivity—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography remains crisp as he crosses the square, climbs, tugs; bodies and objects never float. Environment mirrors internal state: frozen village = frozen conscience, thawing only when he forgives himself.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment is protagonist: bone spires dictate acoustics, femur chamber supplies furniture, mist occludes sight and moral certainty. Every object—knuckle chimes, polished vertebra table—constrains how bodies move and speak. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s narrowing attention (smell of river, insect song) rather than tourist catalog. Final mist-bands refract her multiple selves, charging the closure image as required for 9+ gate—only just missing the extra half-point because spatial anchors arrive ~140 words, fractionally late.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Acid sea, ticking gears, and emerald vats are filtered through Corin’s priestly-precision sensorium; every descriptor serves his quest (corrosion as script). Micro-setting—glass lung cylinder—literally constrains breath and supplies the neutralizing vapors that enable the vision. Spatial choreography is clean: trapdoor descent, strap-in, socket alignment, fracture crawl. Final image of dripping statue tears recharges earlier “acid sea climbed higher,” welding setting to emotional beat. No white-room syndrome; environment actively gnaws the floats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is filtered through painter perception—color as emotion, stone as wave—so the coastal cave functions as both place and palette that physically constrains him (no exit except the shaft he entered). The spiral stalagmites echo the childhood shell early and return in the final tableau, charging the closure image. Salt-taste, lime-smell, and moon-glow are selectively layered, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: every squeeze and chamber is tracked without floating bodies, culminating in the impossible “glass-before-breaking” pool that justifies the invented vista he must paint.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cobalt tower, cooling basalt, wet rope, and the lens-as-tool all constrain tactics: only scent can pass through the quartz, not sound. The lighthouse itself becomes both environment and instrument; its stone “stopped radiating anger” mirrors internal de-escalation. Micro-setting (chipped cork, cloudy vial) reappears at closure, charging the final image. Sensory economy is flawless—every detail either filters POV bias or enables the scent transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Signal station breathes phosphorescence, cables droop like “tired veins,” moonlight slips through cracked ceiling to green the censer foot—details constrain choice by giving Rian only analog tools and tide-tightened concentration. Salt-flat town, bronze-smith stall, dry fountain are economically named yet evoke entire lost civilization. Spatial choreography clean: receiver lifted, censer foot cupped, charcoal scratches backward rivers. Final image—moonlight on corrosion—charges closure by turning artifact into holy compass.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ravine-orchard is not backdrop but physics: cables hum, ladders vibrate, storms crawl; these constraints shape when and how the narrator speaks. The glass eye’s evolving tactile detail (cloudy → transparent) is the micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is ruthless—salt-and-dust velvet, iron taste—each chosen to tilt the next choice. Environment, body, and tool jointly constrain tactics and are reweighted at closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal dock’s moonstone glow and cataract-blind lighthouse windows are not backdrop but tools: the planks literally color the investigator’s perception and the caged lantern mirrors the keeper’s occluded memories. Mist is both atmospheric and functional—it hides the “invisible” memory objects the keeper manipulates, making setting participatory. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single long take down the dock. Environment constraints directly shape the final stance; this satisfies the 9+ gate, but the dock’s physicality could bite even harder into the investigator’s body to reach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting mastery: the matrix chip and pollen-dripping cavern physically constrain the final crawl-and-choice; petal-water temperature rising around ribs is a live clock. Sensory triage matches POV—ant trails as “black punctuation,” iron-and-blossom air—each detail steering the next move. No static postcards; every image either guides or resists Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mountain path, goat-hut, storm-bruise, and cobalt grotto are filtered through Isera’s urgency; every sensory note (metal-and-fruit air, shattered-glass ceiling) constrains forward motion. The grotto’s pulsing stone literally guides her final step, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective heat imagery—“discarded heat gathers like migrating birds”—filters through Lio’s thermal vocation, constrains later choice to trap that heat in shell. Slag basin, rusted rails, and flicker-lit notes all double as emotional thermometer; setting guides access to guild vs exile paths. Final shell mirror catches pocket-sun light, charging last image with re-weighted meaning—meets 9+ gate. Micro-setting (ampoule glass) behaves as habitat, literal constraint on star’s flare.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and glowing crosses are sharply sensed and filter through the ranger’s professional eye; the graveyard reprise supplies the final image. Thin air and resin scent constrain action—he must fly to breathe/escape—meeting the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on tactics; only the instant shift from bunk to sky keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water-clock columns, brass floats, and fogged glass constrain every gesture; spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions. Micro-setting (screw-thread, brass stain) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: Mara notices sound, metallic chill, reflected constellations—never scent. Weather (lifting fog) evolves causally, paralleling internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating tea-platform, storm below, and flickering talismans constrain every motion; a single gust could doom them, so environment shapes tactics. Steam, rock, and cup recur as handled objects that carry final image. Sensory economy is tight—“saturated hush,” “motes of tea steam”—yet tactile (porcelain chips, tether chains). Detail never stalls beats; it is woven into rune drawing and bodily tension. Micro-setting qualifies and charges closure, but not quite a 9-level indispensable constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Copper-veined floor, reel-to-reel spinning without tape, and the perfume bottle as micro-setting constrain every spiritual move; their final alignment ignites the closing image. Selective sensory triage—ozone, toner, citrus—mirrors Mirabel’s pulse. Exterior orchard waits like held breath, but spatial choreography keeps interior geography clear. Enough specificity for 9-band; one extra exterior anchor would lock it.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library is not backdrop but prosthetic mind: shelves that dissolve from astrology into grammar enact the encyclopedic drift of memory itself. Spatial choreography stays coherent—nested rings of books converge on a blank exactly dictionary-sized—so the setting literally constrains the final choice. Micro-setting (the cracked obsidian lectern, the candles that flare sideways) doubles as sensory register of the cosmic hiccup, anchoring scale in body. Because the environment supplies the only possible stage for the ritual, the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station itself—“its walls furred with salt and the memory of storms”—functions as both body and tool, constraining every micro-choice he makes. Sensory economy is ruthless: sound of wind in pipes trusted “more than any ticking” compresses world-rule and character bias into one clause. Spatial choreography is clean from ladder to parapet; no floating props. Horizon line, brass pipes, and key each evolve in tactile handled states. Setting charges the final image directly: the unwinding sea is only felt because the station’s ruled angles have been so sharply etched.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bioluminescent grids, breathing mycelial nets, and scratched plastic constellations are not backdrop—they constrain movement, supply the protein stakes, and finally charge the closure image. The hangar’s cold metallic geometry versus the soft fungal pulse mirrors the protagonist’s rigid vs. permeable world-models. Every sensory pick is filtered through the POV’s security-trained attention: pallets become threat vectors, breath fog becomes timing signal. The setting’s permeability literally enables the final decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rainwashed library functions as micro-setting ship: wet-wool scent, clover-green tint, and the antique lantern’s mica pane directly constrain the daughter’s decision to linger rather than race to ICU. Subway car interior becomes second micro-setting; etched plastic philosophy literally reroutes her emotional vector, fulfilling 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean—note, phone, cup, plastic line tracked without drift. Weather never decorative: rain streaks windows, turns tunnel lights into “smeared comets,” mirroring internal blur but guiding final forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Concrete throat, rusted gate, dripping dark—tunnel details are filtered through Lena’s professional attention and shape her acoustic ritual. The glass disc functions as micro-setting: its icy sound literalizes “haunted” and enables the coaching beat. Spatial choreography is clean—receiver cord, shelf, alcove—no floating bodies. Final image of tunnel-as-bridge reconfigures place from trap to conduit, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jetty, tide, and paper bruising are tactile and filtered through archivist priorities; barnacle roses and phosphor footprints evolve with causality. Micro-setting (locket hinge, damp rail) constrains action—photo must be flattened, ledger braced. Twilight timeframe is signaled early and narrows perception. Final image of “stars came out and the paper finally felt heavy enough” recharges every prior sensory layer. One notch below 9 only because weather never complicates tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-strangled platform, fern-invaded tile, and moon-rock that makes ivy “tremble as if it heard a far train” are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through Kenji’s awe. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara steps over a fern, benches are sanded smooth by waiting, bodies circle the crude concrete map. The station constrains the experiment—no one can leave until reciprocity is satisfied—so environment shapes tactics. Final image reuses the station’s broken-river map as the stage where meaning is reconfigured, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting that constrains navigation: the root-tangled hollow literally thins sound to transparency, forcing the final stance. Platinum ring’s temperature shifts act as embodied barometer, charging the closing image. Selective detail (sap-slow grammar, staccato insects) stays inside Orrin’s haptic POV; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: it tilts objects, heats the pen, deepens with each edit—environment constrains every tactic. “Dawnless cycle” and “floor buckled” give tactile specificity; no visual catalog. Observatory and anomaly are reused anchors; spatial track stays clean. Final cradle image charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Harbor moonlight is not postcard scenery; it literally supplies the silver that “washes the inside” of the camera, constraining the final act. Body-as-setting (her signing hands) and tool-as-setting (film-less camera) both charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: gulls, stones, rigging tracked across moves. One micro-slip—“low tide” coat color is visual extra—does not dull the tactical role of light; environment materially enables the conceptual flip.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Selective sensory triage—soot air, bronze hooks, lantern-lit fresco—guides movement and charges the final tapestry image; spatial choreography stays coherent through tunnels and well-shaft; the archive itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the climb-and-read tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sound-wave garden, auric lagoon, and railing converge to constrain the perch decision; environment literally trembles under choice. Selective sensory layering—subsonic chords translated into gold light—keeps texture without overload. Space stays coherent: pillar → gravel → rail → lagoon → sky replacement. Final image of sky-in-place-of-water reuses prior concrete to reconfigure meaning.

    The container labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: grated shafts carry breath, dented blue wall becomes turn-signal, diesel scent vectors rescue. Micro-setting (key pressed to vent) literally steers plot. Only the tourist-rubber vs foreman-heel taxonomy feels slightly catalogued rather than lived-in under storm urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt dock, bruised-glass canal, and wet-plank constellations are rendered through selective sensory detail that constrains tactics: the guardian must use water-surface as canvas, the dentist must angle mirror off damp wood. Micro-setting (mirror, shutter slats, lamplight on certificates) functions as environment that alters choices. Spatial choreography is clean: guardian’s hand → ripples → plank glints → upward to window. No static postcarding; each descriptor is filtered through POV urgency and returned in the final fade.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is selective, not touristic: cobalt library mist, magnetic grotto iron-veins, low-hovering dusk fog—each returns to constrain or charge action (compass tug, window light sharpness). Spatial choreography is crisp across the single evening campaign. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-true: Daniel notices angles, windows, chessboard symmetries; bakery= c4 anchors the scheme. The “forests of second thoughts” image re-weights the final balcony view, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor tick: “Maple Street” named once and never re-used, but it never matters to tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Harbor pilings, barnacled hulls, and the sublittoral fringe are filtered through Mara’s professional gaze; the whalebone itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Viaduct and bell-as-setting actively constrain tactics; tide and peach dawn charge the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Midnight ridgeway and mirrored reservoir function as micro-setting that literally constrains movement—he must walk the thin bruise between water and town. Upside-down lamp posts and skeletal piers charge the final image when he holds the photograph against that same reflection, forcing neighbors to see both eras at once. Algae-furred label and sucking mud provide tactile specificity that anchors each recovered memory in bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard–waterfall–pool triad is not backdrop; spatial access shapes every beat—spray feeds the light corridor, pool surface dictates lens angle, branch geometry frames starling diffraction. The copper alembics and mirrored lenses are tactile tools whose positions are tracked beat-by-beat; the final lens twist is the fulcrum of closure. Micro-setting (crystal, flame ring) doubles as environment that literally rewrites perception. All 9+ quick-test boxes ticked: setting constrains tactic and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nocturnal arbor, braided-ladder lightning scars, and swaying branch-crotch seat constrain every movement; the parachute buckle micro-maps storm history and presses against ribs during judgment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (thin-air static, metal warmth); environment charges the final image as branches “steady” after the report, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rocks, glass tendrils, and history-flicker skyline are selective, never touristic. The brain jar’s fizz and the translucent sound-floor constrain footwork and swordplay, integrating setting into action. Micro-setting qualifies: the childhood bedroom projection is the battlefield where choices stick. Final image—dojo stones drifting closer—recharges the “history rewrites” motif with spatial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    The brook, mill shadow, and iron-smelling mud are returned to in every beat, tightening space around the seed. These environmental micro-details literally constrain where he can dig and charge the final image of the town “remade from below.” Meets 9+ gate: setting alters tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Echo-tunnel as micro-setting constrains every tactic: the roar can only escape via nail holes, vents, mouse runs—this directly enables the laughter resurrection. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lysander’s sound-engineer ear: auditory > tactile > smell (cut-grass/shampoo draft). Spatial choreography is clean—crescent of blowers, snouts toward brick, distance tracked. Tool-as-setting (pull-cord) charges final image. Minor slip: visual overused in “bruised resonance shaking mildew” but image is brief and serves pressure. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Frozen fountain as paused question-mark, ember trapped inside dull glass, marble bench biting through clothes—every object is micro-setting that constrains stance. The “boundaries of light” corridor is not metaphor but physical pass/fail: step past, lose shadow; stay, remain caged. Sensory economy is ruthless: only taste (paper dust), temperature (clean cold), and sight (ember flicker) are allowed, each filtered through the narrator’s map-making bias. Spatial choreography is pristine; guardian crouched at far path end, pendant dangled exactly between them, narrator’s step-by-step clock-ticking advance all track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ember nexus is not backdrop but crucible: heat pins skin, cinder sucks at boots, and the crozier’s temperature decides the moment he can touch it. Selective sensory triage—guttering braziers, metallic ash sigh, spring-rain scent released by fracture—mirrors Corren’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography is clean: concentric rings, arcade vantage, central pyre, all tracked without drift. Environment directly constrains the climax: if the coals had still been roaring he could not have lifted the shaft, so the cooling plaza is the silent cost of his success.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hanging tower city is not backdrop but antagonist: its creak, rust drift, and moon-slick platform force micro-choices (blanket spread, tongue cooled, breath steadied). Micro-setting (star fragment, shard) constrains the final tuning act. Sensory selection mirrors internal dilation—visual fragments narrow to tasted silence. Gorge depth and lunar glare return in the closing image, recharging earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective, urgent detail—“boards shone like wet moonlight,” “static like a nest of metal bees,” “grotto…mapped glow of subway routes, nerve fibers, and constellations”—anchors the metaphysical frame in tactile objects. The hourglass, radio, and ferry itself act as micro-settings that constrain Eli’s final tuning action, directly charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The optical-illusion gallery is not backdrop but active constraint: walls tilt, corridors respawn, the thread anchors to a nail that did not exist until willed. Setting literally supplies the only tools—sinew, nail, mutable planes—that enable or forbid movement. Spatial choreography stays clean as the narrator walks ever-shifting vectors while the architect floats. Final image of the silhouette-doorway is charged by every prior geometric violation, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Diamond blister viewport, thermal-current charts, and the chain link itself act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only through the blister can edge-geometry be seen, only the chain lets the narrator literalize the lesson. Black nodule plain and humming alien spires mirror inner absence/attraction, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ex-helmsman notices pressure, sound below hearing, starlight translated into wavelength. Detail economy perfect; nothing is tourist scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium and cabbage-scented stairwell are filtered through Eren’s attuned ear, turning acoustic detail into spatial texture. The hearing aid itself functions as micro-setting: its plastic crack and temperamental wheel constrain every dial-turn and timing choice. The photograph’s pier setting is re-inhabited in the final sentence, charging the closure with an off-page breeze that reweights the whole municipal archive. Weather is not backdrop but a muffled lung that forces the hush inside.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sea-as-sleeping-beast, rust flakes “choking” stairwell, cables “arterial undersea links” supply tactile specificity that mirrors Noah’s rising dread. The sphere-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice: its “almost negative” mass reweights the entire mission. Spatial choreography is flawless: hatch → corridor → archive → core lab, each step narrowing ceiling height and options. No object drifts or impossible positions; environment directly guides his descending route and compounds claustrophobia.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Opal dome, creaking ribs, pixelated snow—each sensory hit filters through astrophysicist-bereaved attention. Porcelain shard handled twice, second time charges the ink epiphany; micro-setting qualifies. Observatory’s glass and dying servers constrain time—lights dim as processors choke, forcing final tactic. Final image of waveform on screen is inseparable from setting architecture; environment shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The canyon’s jagged vs. polished walls literally shape the rising vowels he must speak; the flawed diamond’s micro-fractures act as micro-setting that refracts his options.

Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Underground garden, inverted trees, and bone bowls are not backdrop—they force the narrator’s methodological surrender. Micro-setting rule met: the cordless phone and arrowhead physically constrain passage and perception. Sensory triage (metallic air after archway) mirrors epistemic rupture. Spatial choreography spotless; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sky-bridge, cracked violin, locust shell, and sap-slick bronze each constrain choices and charge the final image. Iron flakes as “snow,” emerald runes in stone eyes, and “sap-slick trunks” are selective, POV-filtered specifics that mirror interior thaw. Tactile lived-in navigation: Lio touches shell with back of finger, steps onto bough, feels leaves brush ankles. Spatial choreography clean; distance from bridge to orchard and mechanical city stays consistent. Micro-setting objects (violin, shell) function as geography that alters tactics. No filler exposition; every detail either pressures choice or re-weights at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)

Micro-setting of Mara’s ex-token stall—circuit boards in brine—supplies unique resource for healing. Cobalt light motif recurs in floor reflections and bottle glass, charging final image. Selective sensory economy (hum, violet flash) keeps density high without tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Paint-flake lions, sunken wheels, breathing halo—selective, POV-filtered details scaffold the emotional arc without catalog bloat. The half-assembled horses function as micro-setting that literally constrains choice: only their unfinished state allows Eli’s song to re-start motion. Halo reprises inside the final image, charging closure. One hairline slip: “time folded inward” edges toward abstract metaphor, but dust motes immediately ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scientific poetry library is not backdrop but instrument: aisle names (“planetary sonnets”) steer Mariel’s paths, carpet grain signals memory density, fluorescent hum sets the key of “observed solitude.” The scarf’s fray stands in for years of night shifts, a micro-setting object that returns at closure trailing “like a comet tail,” re-weighted from tool to relic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: left at fiction/fluid-dynamics, right through neutron haiku, stop at unmarked junction—every move legible. Environment constrains the final insight: only that junction’s air-fold yields the collapse of infinite map into single stance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The watercolor palette’s glass shards function as micro-setting: they refract dawn, alter the rocks’ color, and literally enable the photograph that vitalizes the archive; removal would break both method and climax. Archipelago whispers act as environmental pressure—routes fade, birds forget, a child loses her name—forcing the nightly ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean: pier, cliff, library, and horizon track without drift. Weather and mist are not backdrop but causal (“mist climbed the pier post by post, as if erasing her arrival”). The palette reappears at the climax, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    The viaduct is no backdrop; its height and river-roar pressure the choice to drop guard. The vial functions as micro-setting—its glass skin, daylight smear, and uncorked tilt materially constrain action and camera. Starlight arrives as a timing device that forces the beat of release. Every environmental detail is filtered through POV dread; no extra postcard clutter. Meets 9+ gate: object-as-setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned cathedral of glass and salt water is handled as tool, not backdrop: the broken panes literally pattern the star-map that drives the climax. Ship-wreck masts slice “shards of trembling night,” constraining where the narrator can step and where the reflected constellations fall, so environment shapes tactics and charges the final image with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library is lived-in: dust motes mingle with steam, shards turn into “thin, dark reservoirs,” and the low table’s chipped cup constrains the tea-leaf ritual. Spatial choreography is clean—boot-echo aisle, west-wall mirrors, Jun behind the stack—anchoring bodies without white-room drift. The afternoon shadow caught in glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. While environment does not alter tactics mid-scene, it frames every choice and reprises at closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    The parapet-waterfall micro-setting functions as constraint: the fray-and-braid stone is the only place the seed can be planted, so geography directly shapes the final act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—bruised-leaf scent, mist-cool cheek—never touristic. The orchard’s “twisted trunks” and shifting iridescence in the seed charge the closing image without ornamental drift.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, salt-thick air, and stiff net are filtered through Ilan’s restorer-eye—light “bent into patient planes,” net “ghostly with moonlit dust.” These micro-details constrain his ritual movements and charge the final image when the grounded stillness settles into the same stone. Spatial choreography stays clean as he circles the net; environment mirrors interior without overt symbolism, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault is not backdrop but micro-setting that constrains action: boots hover above painted fragments, gray-haired woman apologizes to wounded walls. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices walnut grain, tape smell, the diagonal tear—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: monitor beside reel player, lens tilt down slick stairs. The final image of the chapel-as-listener is charged by these tactile particulars; environment shapes the exact closure mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting—the rib-cage hull, pulped-book forest, glass spheres adrift—constrains every move: the narrator must decide what can ascend through the same water that dissolves the rest. Sensory selection is POV-biased: a “cracked ribcage” and “dumb pages” filter wreck-mechanic’s shorthand for entropy. Spatial choreography is clean; globes tethered to a collapsed chandelier stay trackable. Environment charges the final image: the compromise is literally what will float versus what will remain entombed.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Misty courtyard above clouds functions as both stage and pressure cooker—its silver mist conducts the literal circuit and narrows perceptual field to lantern-glow and damp stone. The flower-press bolt plate evolves from conservatory relic to resonant ignition key, constraining the final interface. Spatial choreography stays clean: palm on stone, four screws, hovering petal-moths track without drift. Weather (lightning-to-thunder interval) works as live clock that forces the encode/decision before thunderclap applause.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Icebound spire is more than backdrop: frost locks the corridor, metal warms under compassionate touch, prism light is the literal key—environment constrains every beat. Goggles act as micro-setting/tool hybrid, their cracked tint teaching the decryption rule early and charging the final image. Selective sensory economy—silver ferns of frost, amber-green tint—anchors without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Environment, body, and tool triply constrain choice: the cooling gondola floor dictates her bracing stance; the brass telescope’s cold ring cues the first log entry; the angry cumulus tower literally pulls her laterally. Sodium halo, sodium silence—sensory selection mirrors professional bias toward light spectra and radio noise. Spatial choreography is immaculate: cable stump above, city grid below, lantern pendulums marking unseen wind. Final image recharges the dusty starlight motif, now re-priced as archive.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Tree-library is not backdrop but tool: shelf grain mirrors branch logic, dictates how Mara navigates by touch; demolition countdown supplies ticking clock that halts brush at exact moment of physical limit. Micro-setting (coin, boards, shelf spine) constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—smell of books, turpentine whiff, boards warping—mirrors internal pressure. Final image of compressed sky pages could not exist without fractal shelf geometry taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Antique airship and starling murmurations are not mere backdrop; their physical interaction—spirals folding into a corridor—literally clears the route. The chalk board micro-setting anchors every beat; hull planks, dust, stray photons constrain how evidence can be gathered. Sensory hierarchy obeys a cartographer’s bias: light angle, flock density, plank vibration over sound or scent. Final image re-uses these setting elements to charge the sky-corridor, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the story’s protagonist: frost-feathered atlases, mirrors that swallow lives, a bottle of melted centuries—each detail is tactile, selective, and charged. The “crystal vertebra” metaphor risks excess but is earned by internal consistency. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the bottle’s lead cap and the gear teeth constrain the final acts. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects never float. The environment literally softens as emotional pressure rises, mirroring internal thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rock arches and the glass bell are returned to in tactile ways—chains bite, mineral ghosts cloud, auroras catch. Spatial choreography is flawless: arches collapse behind the evacuees, ladders spill like vertebrae. The butterfly-less garden’s watering bell constrains the final choice: ring until it cracks, then move. Environment is not backdrop; it is the evolving scaffold that dictates tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Environment is vividly selective—brine, dust, halted-storms metal—yet stays tactile (door resists hand, shelves carved). The broken puppet itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when the key should have waited. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean in a single room. The lighthouse and clock charge the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. One hairline slip: “pane of hush” is used twice without a physical referent the second time, slightly diluting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment (orchard, cliff, birds) literally rewrites footpaths; the nut functions as micro-setting that constrains route-selection. “Bruised silver fruit” and “iron wings clicked” compress world-rules into sensory hooks. Spatial choreography stays clean across ghost-path overlays. Final image—orchard as living blueprint—recharges every prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Braided ravine is a living character—stones slick, channels arguing—constraining Mara's daily movements and mirrored in polymer architecture. The empty chrysalis micro-object charges the final image, tying river biology to lab rebirth. Environmental specificity never stalls momentum; sensory economy favors sound and touch under overcast light.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass orchard is no backdrop; its “branches like fragile bells” chime at arrival and re-chime when the branch cradles the slate at exit, making environment an audible character. Spatial choreography is tight: vendor behind invisible counter, woman between “ripening atlases,” both perched on a branch that later becomes the filing shelf. Sensory economy matches POV—he notices translucent trunks and spectral reader-silhouettes because they directly bear on his fear of being unread.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Desert fortress, post-rain flagstone depressions, coral ice reef—each is a lived body that constrains movement and choice. The cracked tile is not scenery; it is the hinge that legally admits Rafi to the underworld and later admits cold air back into dawn. Sensory hierarchy obeys Rafi’s chef gaze: cumin first, then tide-pool geometry, then frost breath—never tourist checklist. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track his knees, tongs, grater, vial without a single misplaced prop.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clock tower, grain-elevator ribs, and swaying pinecone weight are tactile tools that constrain tactics (chain route dictates repair sequence, bins become organ pipes). Sensory triage—dust applause, “mice and memory,” floury accents—mirrors emotional arc without catalogue glut. Spatial choreography is clean: chain runs down fissure, volunteers circle bins, final plaza gathers farmers beside bankers. The astronomical dial and hourly chimes function as micro-setting that pulses the ending, satisfying 9+ gate for charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon’s seismic pulse and bioluminescent moss literally guide the interface calibration; their quieting is the visible confirmation that the archive upload succeeded. The broken mirror shards constrain every optical alignment he attempts; their fractured state is echoed in the final composite gaze. Body-as-setting (filamented wrist) is tactile and limits motion. Sensory economy is tight—no tourist catalog, only moonlight, tremor, glow.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment, body, tool trifecta: the eastern wall’s changing thickness, the archivist’s gloved palm/heartbeat, and the calcified-ink chain literally constrain access and final image. Sensory hierarchy follows his profession—dust weight, ink breath, stone sound—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we trace upward drift across veils, juts, hovering shelves without a single impossible placement. Luminous fog refusing inversion is the specific that elevates from vivid to choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Body-as-setting (palms on bark, feet in leaf litter) constrains the strum angle and charges the final shared tremor. Porcelain insulator returns as micro-setting that governs wire tension. Sensory economy—mushroom tilt, hedgehog pause—mirrors internal state without catalogue. Spatial choreography across two bodies and seven trees remains seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Magnetic nexus is not backdrop: its humming rocks and worn groove physically guide Oren’s kneeling and literally “translate” his silence into covenant speech. Micro-setting—the stone’s dent—functions as portable landscape that constrains every thumb-press and final acceptance. Twilight stormlight and iron veins are filtered through his aching teeth, anchoring time and body early. Spatial choreography across the four monoliths is clean; the final image of dual thumb-prints is charged by these tangible elements.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop’s skylight, brass scraps, and umbrella ribs are not backdrop but tools that constrain method—he can only sample silence because the roof is open to the stars. Micro-setting obeys the 9+ gate: the diary’s leather surface becomes the final antenna, so object-as-setting charges closure. Spatial choreography is flawless; jars, cables, and body angle track without drift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elias hears textures before he sees them—so environment is filtered, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Treetop village is no postcard: swaying walkways, creaking houses, resin ghosts constrain every step and literally steady her heartbeat; the corpse-flower cradle on the highest branch is the charged final image. Olfactory micro-setting (salt fear, metal storm, crushed moss) filters every detail through Liora’s professional bias. Spatial choreography clean—rope bridges, platform arrival, moss patch—all tracked without impossible moves. Environment forecloses retreat: storms stranger, roots thirstier, hence elders consider descent; setting materially shapes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating arches, levitating wells, sap-constellations—each detail later constrains flight path or seed logic. The copper sky color returns in the arrow’s dried-blood hue, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across 3-D drift. Minor excess: “stone remembering forests” drifts toward perfume ad, but it’s brief.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Container labyrinth is not backdrop but causal actor—walls channel air, alter drone corridors, and force the investigator’s bodily survey; the missing crane and new generator shed are named early, return to explain wind shear, and charge the final recommendation; spatial choreography is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: icicles act as tunable prisms, the amber sheet as score, the aurora as amplifier—each constrains Ilen’s timing and timbre. Micro-setting (frozen bell, insect-wing staff) directly shapes the tactical choice to leash/unleash sound. Spatial choreography is pristine: finger on icicle, breath visible, aurora mirrored in ceiling. The setting’s specificity is inseparable from the climax; remove any facet and the resonance collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Thunder-echo Range is not backdrop but active pressure: sound-swallowing snow, bowl of stone that folds every word. Driftwood markers and sun-faded silk are micro-settings handled with tactile care; the worn finger-holes of the flute literally constrain what note can emerge. Environment forces Cael’s shift from ritual demand to listening stance. Final image charges the same stone walls with the new, imperfect music.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Topaz surfaces, inked type, and halo fragment are tactile tools that alter tactics; the translucent sheet refuses to admit it is ice becomes the final image’s pond.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-as-lover detail—“crooked apple trees rose among bamboo stalks like old men lost at a festival”—constrains her solitude and later the bare-loom image. Bamboo swallowing paths explains why no search parties return, thus shaping her puzzle gamble. Micro-setting object (amber bead) is handled thrice and charges the final image when it becomes the “small sun setting in cardboard sky.” Weather and graft history evolve causally with plot; no static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Floating rock arches, glowing cobalt pears, and calcifying orchards are vivid, specific, and immediately filter through Corren’s smith-eye for texture; every sensory note is tethered to his craft (anvils as promises, mineral husks). The mine gallery collapse is spatially tracked; distances and body positions hold. The environment’s rule-set (stone floats up, gravity warps) is learned by touch, never narrated, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the pear-light refrains from altering his final choice; the setting dazzles but does not ultimately constrain the closure beat, capping Q3 at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Abandoned repair bay functions as micro-setting constraining choice: flaking stripes and ozone tang limit movement and cue memory. Green shard’s slice-spectrum property charges final image by letting Lio cut probability threads in situ. Spatial choreography clean: Archivist resolves from haze without teleporting props. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound currents, heat, probability—mirrors map-maker’s professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lantern room functions as micro-setting: the dead lens, iron steps, and stone spiral physically constrain every move; the curved glass fragments the black ocean into a film Elias must edit with his body. Sea glass and kerosene smell are returned in the final image, charging the green halo that reconfigures safety. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions—while the lighthouse’s verticality mirrors the tightening decision ladder.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse itself—emerald glass, layered server-farm lenses, total-internal-reflection physics—functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactic; Orrin can only “steer” because the architecture has already folded starlight into memory slabs. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through storm-herald priorities: taste of static, sideways starlight, the “cackle on the wind” he is known by. Weather and optics evolve causally with events; the hum changes refraction indices, not just mood. One hair under 9.0 only because open-ocean spatial markers are impressionistic rather than mapped.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tea-house-as-setting actively constrains the climax: its slats let dusk-light slice in to ignite the wing, enabling the re-framing image. Selective sensory economy—“valley-mist wonder seeped,” “surface trembling like mica”—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, kettles, wing track cleanly. Environment, body (chest), and tool (wing) triangulate to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, rooftop garden, and sextant-as-micro-setting constrain every move: only Milo’s skeleton keys and drainage cisterns grant access, and only moonlight on the ledge revives the brass. Storm and moonlight are not backdrop but tools—rain codes messages, moonlight heals metal. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track his climb up the hidden stair and the exact pot where moonlight pools. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through maintenance priorities: sound of leaks before thunder, feel of brass temperature before visual gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The black-mica ceiling and glass-root soil are not postcard garnish; their refusal to admit daylight forces the entire memory-restoration gambit, and their final color-refraction is the visual proof that the tactic worked. Spatial choreography stays clean—Mara’s satchel, the tagged pear trees, and the window form a straight path whose every step is tactile (ash-filmed fruit, chiming under-soil). Micro-setting gate cleared: the window’s re-crystallized surface literally powers the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Shelf curved like question marks” is environment-as-body; the crumpled invitation functions as handled tool returned in final image with reweighted meaning. Fluorescent hum and municipal grout root us early; no white-room lapse. Micro-setting meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment acts as coercive tool: rust-filled joints between tiles dictate tentative steps; steam from kettle becomes breathable proxy for absolution; cracked marble forces the low, cross-legged stance of confession. Every descriptor passes through POV filter of micro-decay, showing palimpsest geometry rather than postcard scenery. The courtyard’s living map—fig roots splitting balustrades—mirrors protagonist’s recognition that neglect has grown around him. Final image of defiant steam uses setting as micro-charged object, satisfying 9+ gate.

    Frozen library as micro-setting: frost on cuffs, quartz hush, conductive prickle—each tactile detail constrains Serin’s speed and precision, directly shaping calibration moves. The lantern slide’s warped silver and alien constellations re-appear at closure, re-weighted after the amendment. Clouded abyss below functions as off-page vertical pressure, sharpening stakes without diluting spatial coherence. No excess inventory; every sensory note either slows or hastens his gloved gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pirate market under the pier is not backdrop; the soft planks, lantern swallow, and barn-wood stalls constrain Loretta’s stealth route and tempo. The watch fob itself becomes micro-setting—its cold weight against her thigh re-grounds her after the sonic blow. Sensory hierarchy obeys her backwoods training: ears before eyes, smell of rot before color. Final image reuses the pier’s decay as a destined seat, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lavender bluff, spiraling grass, weather-cloth coats, and a sea mimicking sky are vividly selective; the tin compass-turned-metallic vein serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Every descriptor funnels attention toward the convergence ritual; place is not just backdrop but gravitational. Meets 9+ gate: the compass-vein constrains the closing assent.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cave is not backdrop but crucible: crystals “sprout like frozen fireworks,” refracting lantern light into the colors that later bathe his tears. Spatial choreography is exact—tunnel mouth seals, path narrows, domed chamber bristles—each detail alters Elias’s bodily stance and emotional tempo. The broken lock and yellowed paper are micro-settings that carry the weight of entire backstory without exposition. Final image of crystals paling with “morningless, auroral sorrow” recharges every prior glow, locking setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Glass ribs, numbered leaves, and gold-veined vines are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Lio’s professional eye. The zinc plate’s corrosion is matched to humidity stains on the map, turning setting into evidence. The final image—the observatory exhaling “stale ink”—uses environment to body the stakes of stored speech, charging the closure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting = kinetic tower; its brass arms and mirrored vanes constrain where/how the shard is cradled and directly charge the final sonic image. Selective sensory economy: wind, altitude, glint of light through ice—each filtered via Lio’s tuner perception. Spatial choreography clean (“climbed its narrow ladders…carved a cradle”). Tone of hushed altitude supports theme of unsayable wonder. Weather actively participates (wind drives chords). 9-band gate met: tower’s kinetic bones foreclose placement options and determine climax timbre.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dome, roses, crate, and android chassis serve as micro-setting that literally constrains the burn route; dried root-trenches become fire corridors, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays robotic—mineral scent, servo hiss, magnetic tremor—yet filtered through caretaker priorities (water ration, petal hardness). Spatial choreography across irrigation lines and glass ribs is flawless; no white-room lapse. Setting materials evolve: soil cracks, roots contract, glass ribs “tremble with low, musical stress,” all feeding back into the protagonist’s sensorium—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.2)
    The courtyard is not backdrop; its brass mailbox wall, cement dust, and laundry lines constrain tactics (how to open, who can witness) and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows Mara’s curator gaze—colors first, sirens last—so every detail is filtered through her stake. The micro-setting (mailbox #9) functions as both lock and key, literally determining legal fate; no swap-in prop would serve the same mechanical role.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment, body, and tool converge: the pressure-dome, calf-high water, and dice-box together constrain every routing decision. The fractal-ink “shorelines” in the bloomed notebook provide the charged micro-setting that re-weights the ending. Spatial choreography is pristine—no impossible moves in three-dimensional flooding. A hairline slip: “windowed box bolted to the bulkhead” floats unmoored until paragraph 5; quick recovery with “rusted” tactile fix, so only −0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor’s moon-slivered whale, the warehouse’s glass trays, and the father’s cracked cup are not backdrop—they are gravity wells that constrain every beat. The salt chamber’s “clean sting of mineral air” is felt in lungs before it’s seen. Micro-setting (the cup’s porcelain edge, the crystal’s crooked tide-marks) charges the final transfer. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dock to tray to spiral vision—no floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    The brook-as-micro-setting actively receives the silence-lattice; its “low, companionable murmur” is the altered state that lets the valley exhale. Paper crane, reed gossip, and firefly orbits are tactile, never touristic, and each is re-handled to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible wing angles or water placement. This is the rare 600-word piece where environment, body, and tool fuse into one constraint engine.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—still the prophecy’s echo—tightens once: when Ilen lays hush inside each far-off tavern-hole, his bones gain weight, options narrow to endurance. No reversal, but the density shift is legible and irreversible. Cost is visible—“weight added to his bones”—and shapes the final poise. Could push higher if the prophecy had fought back with a micro-turn, but the single deepening is purposeful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rooftop garden and antique seal function as micro-settings that literally channel the building’s grammar; the seal’s brass softness is re-handled in multiple beats and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—sugar-jar emptiness drives the first trespass, meteor-tinged basil focuses the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: fire-escape ladder, planter boxes, and the seal’s placement track without drift. Environment constrains the final choice—only while lying on the roof under meteors can the narrator “listen for the next story.”

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Garden functions as micro-setting: shelved roses become literal shelves for quarantined sorrow, constraining Neris’s choice to listen rather than flee. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—sound of salt-laced hush, visual of lantern-shadowed cheeks—guiding attention to shell and bench. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: shell found on bench, caretaker emerges from hedges, lantern placed beside them. No tourist catalog; every detail is filtered through her skeptical, physics-leaning bias.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Marble sanctuary, aurora light, and stalactite drip act as live clock and moral witness; crystalline apertures soften edges, literally letting Irian see his work anew. Ink, vellum, and observant stone constrain how quietly the pen can move—environment shapes tactics. Rose thorn handled twice, key once—objects qualify as micro-setting. Descriptive load stays selective; no static catalogue. Spatial choreography clean across lectern, floor, columns.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Canyon as pressure chamber is tactile: stone “throat,” “tongue,” grit-bearing wind; spatial choreography clean as Liora pivots from rim to kneel to rise. Shell functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice (she “lifted the shell” to hear surf). Sensory hierarchy matches singer’s ear-centric worldview. Meets 9+ gate: environment (canyon body) charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice shrine functions as micro-setting: walls funnel candlelight, the snow-bench forces intimate confession, and wax rivers glue the globe to the altar, literally binding past wreckage to present reckoning. Sensory hierarchy favors cold, flicker, and hush—mirroring the emotional narrowband of sleepless guilt. Glacier creaks timed at emotional spikes act as environmental dialogue. The melted dome is handled twice, its cloudy water re-appearing in the woman's frozen tears, a clean environmental echo that recharges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Whispering parapet, firefly lanterns, and moon-silver ladders are vividly selective and filtered through apprentice POV; the bamboo whisk serves as micro-setting that constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track across slick stone. Environment never forces a trade-off or failure, so it charges but does not ultimately constrain the closure image—capping entry below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: radioactive dust narrows perception to “faint geometric scars,” the fused chain physically tethers the dig site, and the diamond’s ice-glass touch crystallizes the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Theo’s investigator bias—UV lamp, notebook, spade—each tool later weaponized. Micro-setting (diamond as portable stillpoint) constrains the closing choice. No exposition dump; world rules discovered through shovel and ultraviolet glow.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory-as-teacup and cobalt portico function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: Ilen must physically stand beneath the glass to seal the bargain. Sensory triage under stormlight—taste of metal, sound of gravel on drums—mirrors his eroding psyche. Spatial choreography is clean: tea mug knocked over, mold pilgrims marching, rain turning panels into warped aquarium. One hairline overdraft: “bruised purples and feverous greens” edges toward palette-list, but it’s POV-filtered, forgiven.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loft’s broken ribs, cracked slats, and sand crust charge the final image when he steps down, leaving the skeleton behind; micro-setting serves as constraint. Salt-scoured ballerina and wax-stoppered jars recur with re-weighted meaning at closure. Sensory pick is selective—briny mutter, wind through ribs—never catalogue. Spatial tracking stays clean: hatchway, threshold, descent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: its groaning pilings supply the wrong note Elias must tune, and the grinding floes physically warp the artifact’s frequency. The lighthouse’s “metal bones” and the stone crypt constrain movement and acoustics, forcing Elias to climb and descend as part of the sonic circuit. The fleeting golden sunset is a live clock—its draining color tracks the tightening window and charges the final image when it filters “as if through water.” Micro-setting (the key against ribs, salt-veined sphere) directly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Basalt, frost-etched iron, and snowmelt conduits are tactile, selective, and return charged in the basin scene. The frozen lake shifts from scenic backdrop to moral crucible—its clear ice becomes the lens through which “slow lightning” enters the body. Micro-setting (basin rim) directly shapes the climactic perception shift. Minor over-reliance on visual register keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tunnel wetness, brass lantern, and rail vibration are filtered through investigator’s risk-calculating gaze; each sensory note guides choice (darkness forces lantern use; lantern flare triggers vision).

No spatial drift. 9+ gate met: lantern’s glow directly shapes the culminating decision.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shop’s layered ticking and brass gleam are handled, not catalogued; every gear constrains attention and filters Elias’s guilt. Rain turns the window into a “wavering mirror”—a concrete perceptual cue that refracts his self-interrogation. The micro-setting of the clockwork heart itself serves as the final environmental pivot, its altered beat dictating the chaplain’s next move. One notch below 9+ only because the exterior street remains a backdrop rather than a tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    The workshop-as-cathedra and the cart-as-mongrel are handled as tools that constrain launch angles and supply the copper threads; the acid sea’s hiss and the ozone stink of the kaleidoscope eyepiece charge the ascension beat, so environment directly shapes the final image—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The chilled racks, black-square time-gap, and 7:01:03 silences are specific, sensory, and filtered through the POV’s tech-ritual gaze. The archive’s humming choir and “commercial jingles” tether mood to theme. Environment directly constrains the final move—only the archive’s paradox-loving logic allows silence-as-content to yield coordinates. One notch off only because spatial choreography of the Deep Cold gateway is implied rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard’s “bare-limbed trees,” swinging lanterns, and grinding ice act as environmental antagonists, physically creaking under Ira’s boots while optically feeding the mirror-shop. Micro-setting triumph: the broken crystal fragment becomes terrain—its glass skin determines how futures can be handled, stored, or re-framed, and it is literally in hand at the last beat, charging the finale. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the chosen images constrain tactical movement, so the 9-band gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop; the creak/kiss of floes supplies the actual sound the protagonist came to hear, hence directly charges closure. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, its ivory state altering as it moves from relic to tuning fork to water-contact sensor. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → bunk → boat three → cut engine → water-touch. Weather (razor air, fog breath) affects action (coat unbuttoned, motor cough). Specificity is selective: no tourist catalogue, only the details that vibrate.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    The amber pavilion, rusting railings, and hillside mist constrain movement and mood; the bench becomes a confession box. Vineyard rows supply the central metaphor that crystallizes the closure. Sensory triage is POV-driven: he smells “crushed thyme and old perfume” on ash, not a generic fall checklist. The autumn light physically bisects Tomas’s face, externalizing his mediator role.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pavilion’s silk walls that “sighed with every movement” and the kinetic parapet whose stones grind louder with each denial function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: the walker notices tremors in minds “like gusts along wire,” a selective, professional attention. Spatial choreography is clean—cable, clearing, tent city, dunes—never floating. The final image recharges the earlier “whisperfield calm,” now crystallized into an environmental wall that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender rows and rusted factory are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the scent, heat, and bee-hum filter through the archivist’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography is clean—card table, chairs, bolt, lunchbox all tracked without drift. Environment does not yet constrain a final tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the micro-setting (photo edges “like dried petals”) participates in the closure image, satisfying the 8.8 ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Library, chandelier, cracked crystal, and sonic hush are not backdrop but equipment: the crack enables replay, the hush shapes how he listens, the glass orbs focus sound that will later expose him. Spatial choreography clean across ladder climb and fingertip placement. Dawn light and dust are filtered through Elias’s reticent attention. Final image of hush-as-armor recharges setting; meets 9+ gate via crystal reprise at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog garden is not mere scenery; its dissolving statues force Mara and the narrator to navigate by ear, not eye, steering them to the unmade-bed sculpture where the breathing sound hides. Driftwood arrows function as a micro-setting: their nightly erasure by tide literalizes the prophet’s forgetfulness and forces fresh builds. Videotapes become body-extensions when pressed to the ear, turning thrift-store plastic into stethoscopes for aging. All environmental elements recur with altered states, charging the final image of chalk on metal that outlasts the prophet’s memory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lunar observatory is lived-in: micrometeorite ticks, regolith groans, console vibrations felt through boot soles. Camera Three’s housing, the spinning relic clock, and shaking pylons each constrain tactics—every manual bypass risks mirror misalignment under literal moon-flex. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Ilias’s repairer gaze: auditory cues guide circuit cuts while visual star-field lurches mark stakes. Setting directly supplies the final image (archive shutters) that recharges “ephemeral” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cloud-sea outside the hospice windows is not scenery; it functions as an environmental lock-in that removes exit routes, forcing the intimate bare room to become the entire world. The cracked radio and single cologne bottle are micro-settings whose tactile presence anchors beats—tuning the radio precedes the song, the citrus-pine scent threads antiseptic with memory. Spatial choreography is clean: guitar case down, shard poured into palm, tray by the window tracked without drift. The final image of clouds as “unpicked cotton” re-weights the setting from escapist fantasy to field of unpaid labor, a conceptual turn that charges the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Floating-isle observatory, brass domes, mirrored spoons, and hidden-hour bell are filtered through Lysa’s scholar gaze; the spoons’ straightening/aperture function directly constrains her final choice. Micro-setting (key socket) charges closure; only narrow miss is absence of sensory layering under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The secret garden is not backdrop but instrument: its shifting hedge walls and glass tools constrain how Mara can move and what she can “set.”  The moonlit cloth in the breathing tin box is a micro-setting object that literally warms her palm and charges the final image.  Sensory hierarchy follows bone-setter priorities—she notices weight, torque, temperature—so the tooth’s impossible warmth is noticed first, not its color.  Spatial choreography is clean: the maze opens “as always” onto the hidden plot of ground where the final re-alignment occurs, keeping bodies and distances trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Grotto, basin of sand, body-as-workbench all constrain the only possible tactic—hand-polishing. Sensory triangulation (lemon-rain air, slick stone breathing) is filtered through the narrator’s professional vigilance for hidden stars. Micro-setting (the shard itself) charges the final image; without its glow the children see nothing. Environment never drifts into tourist catalog; every detail is worked by hand or breath.

The metal case and illustration plate act as micro-setting: their clasps and padding constrain pace and storage, literally shaping where the map can rest. Spatial choreography is flawless: every kneel, uncork, and bead-drop is trackable across the frozen grid. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism; the orchard’s paused metronome trunks echo the planet’s stilled heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cavern’s scarred marble and mineral veins are not backdrop but tooling surfaces—chalk lines and mirror beams physically redirect sound/light, constraining how the timer can be mended. Micro-setting (the flattened pillar, wet hush) doubles as workbench and resonating chamber, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys the POV: metallic tang, mineral cold, lantern fracturing into “slender beams” mirror his peripherally focused perception. Weather is internalized as “wounded season,” a temporal climate that affects civic attention rather than literal temperature—plausible and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bronze grotto’s metallic breath and whalebone lamp ribs are not backdrop but tools that constrain technique—flame must be braided, not scattered.

Sensory selection is POV-filtered—orange glow on lacquer, rasp of cardboard, wind carrying “rumors of drone beehive failure.” Spatial choreography is clean: boy stops outside the light-cone, tower axis aligns with bridge. The lacquer box recurs, reweighted from forgotten curio to vault of the new secret toll, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is not backdrop but actuator: the rust-stain coastline mirror, the corner that hoards darkness, the tide-exhaling floorboards all constrain Eli’s tactics and ultimately reposition his body in bed. Micro-object—the orris shard—functions as mobile setting; when it wedges in the corner it re-weights spatial meaning. Sensory hierarchy skews haptic & olfactory (violet chill, old rain in flour sacks) fitting Eli’s synesthetic bias. Final image re-uses the bay-window metonym to reconfigure stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lantern-corals, barnacled stone ribs, and the foxglove-ampoule’s color scatter are worked through action, not postcard lists. Micro-setting (the cracked column) physically constrains the final consent beat and later collapses, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography keeps diver, statue, and column in tight triangulation. One anemone-painted lion drifts past like a pale fish—vivid, but could have returned to charge the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The staircase is rendered through tactile difference—warm railing, darker stone—rather than architectural blueprint, letting the environment mirror Arin’s internal asymmetry. The velvet bag’s nap, die clatter, and notebook margins act as micro-settings that constrain choice: he can’t roll fairness, only continuation. The final crack is a literal rupture in the stone that lets the alternate staircase press against his skin, charging the closing image with spatial cost. Selective sensory hierarchy keeps the blankness from feeling like a white-room; every detail is POV-filtered for motion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse is not backdrop but apparatus: glass panes receive the lost-language sentences, condensation breathes back on her hands, moonlit smog acts as diffuser. Micro-setting (brush, jar of rainwater, moon) constrains every tactical move; removing the greenhouse collapses the experiment. Spatial choreography is clean—she angles lamps away, plants loom as silhouettes, streets remain distant but legible. Environmental detail evolves: saffron haze thickens then thins as kindness bleeds downward, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Waterfall mist, yeast-stone scent, and lantern terraces are filtered through the narrator’s archivist gaze; the emerald opera glass acts as micro-setting that re-weights the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across spiral stair and kitchen.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is not backdrop but tool: the basalt ribs, backward-numbered stairs, and crack “leading directly into the sea” funnel every motion toward the stone. The lighthouse’s brass gleam against dust is handled, not admired, and steers Aurek’s gaze to the yoyo hollow. Receding tide acts as live clock, narrowing the window for initiation. Final image recharges the “latent radiance” motif as the yoyo’s spin pours that light back into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Funhouse mirrors, rotting bulbs, and river-pier planks are tactile, smell of wet velvet/formaldehyde, and constrain every step Elias takes; the clasp operates as micro-setting that literally locks him to the drowning moment. Spatial choreography is flawless—ticket-booth ledge to corridor to mirror to pier and back—each transition taught through the mirrors’ inward twist. The Polaroid’s temperature shift (cold→warm) functions as a charged object that anchors the final image. No credibility errors; carnival decay and resuscitation details read accurate.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: salt-roped timbers groan in chord progressions, blossoms become percussive shrapnel, tide-casks double as bass drums. Micro-setting (body, mallet, mast) constrains every tactic—Aera can only act by sounding what her hands can reach. Sensory hierarchy follows crisis logic: wind roar first, brine-sweet petals second, cloud cartography last. Spatial choreography survives the tilting deck; distances remain legible as children cling to trunk-rails and ballast stones answer back.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The barnacled turtle-shells function as both geography and communication medium; their slow tremors constrain every tactical choice Keth makes. Salt-glare on rusted iron, spiral archives, and sun-pooled rooftops are filtered through Keth’s cartographer gaze—every visual detail doubles as navigational data. Spatial choreography is clean: western balcony → Council colonnade → sealed harbor gate, bodies and shells tracked without drift. Final image: stylus-carved question on a living shell—setting-as-tool that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivy through cracked panes and petal-less rosebush are not postcard decay but tools: the station’s secrecy enables the meeting, its dereliction mirrors Elias’s loss of control. The illuminated letter’s glitter catches the station’s dying light to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—bench, folder, T, tracks all tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Submerged pavilion is not backdrop but antagonist: barnacled balustrades force her kneeling, cracked mosaics mirror her cracked interior, tide-level sets the ticking clock. Brass inkwell’s crescent shine is micro-setting that charges the final pocket-weight. Sensory hierarchy obeys her surveyor gaze—dimensions, load tolerances, salt-light refracted through glass ribs. Spatial choreography tracks skiff→steps→column hollow without drift; weather (tide pressing higher) alters egress.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment (drowned towers pressing windows, mineral-stained aisle) literally buckles under the same hydrostatic pressure Mara now applies to official narrative. The library’s “papery hush” and the brass lantern’s stubborn star constrain visibility and timing—she can search only within its wick-span. Final image of the crude imitation stamp reweights the setting itself as co-conspirator: the building once smuggled in the forbidden folio. Setting never drifts into postcard; every shelf-gap is noticed because it blocks her indexing path.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and copper polishing wheel are not backdrop; they supply the only means by which grief can be alchemized. Spatial choreography is immaculate—shadow up, Liora up, cranes aloft—so environment literally steers the ascent. The basilica’s crystal buttresses “catch moons the sea has forgotten,” a specificity that reappears inside the final glowing cranes, satisfying the 9+ gate of setting charging the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Floating observatory dragged its shadow across the ruined desert like a question mark” immediately anchors who/where/scale. Micro-setting (geode in pocket) constrains the final moral choice—repair vs ruin—charging the closure image. Sensory economy favors irradiated light, engine hum, violet teeth: all POV-filtered, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory’s rusted rib-cage telescope and cracked star charts are handled, not displayed: Mira leans her eye to the eyepiece, the stone floor receives the chip’s click. Starlight pooling through the dome breach directly constrains her mapping choice, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (the chip on stone) doubles as celestial punch-card—irreplaceable, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt terrace, bruised-purple dusk, and salt-slick driftwood heaps are filtered through the narrator’s guilt-narrowed perception; visual and tactile detail guide every beat. The broken watch and forked carving function as micro-setting—objects whose physical state (shattered glass, softened grooves) constrains recognition and choice. Spatial choreography is flawless: tools laid out → railing → steps → sand → wood piles. Environment is not backdrop but archive; the shore’s symbols literally re-write his possible futures.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    parapet granite, torch-smoke tang, and rope fibers under thumbnails all filter through the negotiator’s professional habit of cataloguing. Setting constrains choreography: the narrow walkway forces two-for-two limping exchanges and keeps archers at bay.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel’s mineral-cold air, the welded door’s rust cough, the bruised turquoise lake—each sensory layer is filtered through POV urgency and guides next tactical choice (torch the door, wade, stay). The lake itself constrains the final stance: it glows brighter under his skin-sins, making retreat impossible. Micro-setting (baseball stitching, seat 42B) doubles as charged object and spatial anchor. One decimal off 9 only because the stadium exterior gets broad-brush “dust” and “soot” before the specific seat focus.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Orchard, moon, and cauldron tree are not backdrop but apparatus: the hollow trunk receives spices, the moon nails the sky, petals hum secrets—these constrain ritual steps and final image. Body-as-setting occurs as feet root into listening soil and later as the narrator becomes grove. Spatial choreography stays exact: beasts circle, embers fall, seeds form. The environment literally digests the protagonist, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Midnight glade above clouds is not backdrop but tactical resource: thin air literally tightens throat, clouds become “altar” awaiting penitent, and the porcelain shard from that same sky-altar later charges the bridge image. Object-as-setting (birthday cloth, porcelain) constrains the final hand-press ritual and is inseparable from closure. Sensory economy favors cold, star-savaged air and onyx dust weight—never catalogued, always filtering through Lysander’s cartomancer eye.

Meets 9+ gate: the body-weight trait constrains final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black sand, active volcano, bottled green-gold constellations—setting is not backdrop but tactical resource: the jars become signal flares, the beach the evacuation corridor. Sensory hierarchy obeys Niko’s skin: hot ground beneath bare soles, clinking glass at belt, taste of ash. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track him uphill vs Lila quarryward with zero drift. Final image reuses the volcanic pumice metaphor as literal heart-scrape, so environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Luminous fort with “bottled daylight” walls is sketched in two swift strokes yet continuously pressures choice—darkness grants Iri her window. Micro-setting objects—bronze quill holder, copper rods, half-painted sundial—function as terrain: rods re-wire gatework, sundial delivers cipher. Sensory selection is POV-driven: Iri notices “winking hush,” “smoky bruise” tint, the hum of gears “clearing their throats.” Final image of disoriented locks is charged by these prior environmental specifics, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment (frictionless bluff, glassy sea, aurora) actively constrains tactics: eels can be accompanied, not caught; stones stay where placed because world-rules forbid drift. Micro-object—the vial—charges the final image as its grains align along vectors that re-impose friction. Sensory economy is ruthless: “colors poured like melted compasses” fuses sky, tool, and epistemic collapse in five words. Spatial choreography survives headcount of one; body, stones, eels, and dust track cleanly across the cliff lip.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)

The atrium’s reflective floor and fern-shadows literally guide where he places feet and tempers, turning setting into tactical map. The tin’s spiral constellation and the half-painted dial are micro-settings that constrain the final choice to fence rather than mediate. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted library is no backdrop; its missing roof funnels moonlight and rain onto the page-press, forcing the candle-stub workaround and the hiding of the tin under a swollen floorboard. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: starlight silvers the rafters, boots crunch glass, the metal lid remembers letters—each detail either enables tactics or tightens risk. Spatial choreography is clean: patrol beams cut between stacks, Lio crouches left, narrator right, floorboard center. One micro-drag: “contraband birds” metaphor is vivid but slightly recycled from earlier “contraband secrets,” blunting freshness by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked piano, scarf-wrist loop, and brass compasses dangling from root-ribs are handled under pressure and charge the final image; the arbor itself is the tool that narrows their choices to “stay hovering” or “return off-beat.” Sensory economy is strict—mist-waves roll like distant trains, chrome-blue sky invites night—each detail mirrors the internal tide of hesitation. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is flawless as film grain buzzes and walkways sway.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ridge, seed, lagoon, meeting-house ceiling poles, and dream-tree are all specific, sensory, and POV-filtered; flowers closing “as if unwilling to overhear” turns environment into moral witness. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, set seed on stone, sideways fall. Weather (early thunderheads) is causal, not backdrop—it forces the council’s summons and Kael’s night vigil. The seed functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; without it the dream’s revelation would lose its pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The islet’s wet stones, warped box, and salt-sweet air are not backdrop but instruments: the grove’s scent of “opened books and seaweed” cues memory retrieval; the compass warms only when soil is touched. Micro-setting (lace between fingers) literally translates apology into color, constraining the final gesture. Weather shifts coincide with emotional inflections without overt symbolism. Environment charges the closing image—ships materialize because place allows tides of remembrance to intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.6)
    The water clock shop functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every beat: fogged glass teaches occluded vision, ticking water replaces speech, and the cracked oldest clock becomes the site of ritual repair. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s anosmia—sound and touch dominate, scent is absent yet palpably missed. The birthing clamp screw’s placement at the base of the column transforms the environment into a vessel of inherited time. Final image gains resonance because the setting has been both crucible and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock platform isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices (a gust could shove them into thunderheads), while the crow quill and tea cup function as micro-settings that constrain action. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: steam spirals into unreadable glyphs, thunder thickens silence, talismans flicker blue only when ripples reach the edge. The final image—cup cradled “as if it were an inkwell of weather”—charges closure by fusing tool, body, and environment into a single resonant object.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)

Environment doesn’t just mirror—it enables the covenant’s regeneration, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    The disused station functions as micro-setting: ivy trembles at the moon rock, cracked concrete maps broken rivers, benches sanded by “uncountable waiting.” These details constrain and charge choices—the rock must be placed at the platform’s center, the ceiling’s height dictates Mara’s stature. Final image reweights the setting: shelves of stalled prayers become active catalysts. Environment isn’t backdrop but co-conspirator in the experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: its bone-loud hum guides Orrin, its trail of notes dowses him, and its silence in the clearing makes the hidden melody legible. Sensory detail is purposefully skewed—sound bypasses ears for skin and bone—reflecting Orrin’s blindness without exposition. The platinum ring and moss-bark textures charge the final image, where soil contact becomes both tool and terrain. Every atmospheric element tightens around the stillpoint, culminating in a setting that doesn’t just reflect but generates the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: movement must be slow “from fear of drifting away unfinished,” directly shaping the protagonist’s cautious posture. The dried-up pen—a recurring object—charges the final image when its glow rewrites dust-traces, and the observatory’s buckling floor triggers the climax. Sensory detail is purposeful (“sullen, trapped light,” “microscopic dust held the prints of countless footsteps”) and filtered through professional bias (celestial interpreter noticing stellar shifts post-revision). Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism: the anomaly’s pull evolves from threat to “cradle” as the protagonist accepts revision over erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    The harbor isn’t backdrop but active collaborator—the moonlight “spilled stars,” water “licking stones,” rigging “clinks”—all constrain and charge Lena’s choices.

The bench holds the letter; the rails receive her lament; the fading taillights mirror emotional distance. Sensory detail (ash smelling of thyme and perfume, copper light on Tomas’s face) is selective, urgent, and filtered through POV. The setting culminates in the final image, where darkness and held breath make the station a vessel for hope.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the murmuring pavilion’s silken walls and conjured clearings shape where truth is spoken; the kinetic parapet beneath dunes physically reacts to denial, pressuring the line walker’s mission. Sensory detail (“wind that tasted of iron,” “lanternlight sharp and precise”) is filtered through liminal perception. Final image ties environment to theme—the dunes rest because the parapet sleeps, proving setting charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lavender field isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics (guiding the archivist, hosting the table) and charges the closure (“healing threaded through lavender air”). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: bees hum, machines creak “like restless whales,” tea is poured “careful not to spill on the lavender.” The rusted factory ruins contrast with purple rows, mirroring industrial death and organic renewal without overt symbolism. Setting constrains choice (the archive must exist *here*, amid ruin and bloom) and irreplaceably fuels the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shadowed library at dawn is not backdrop but active constraint: its sonically reflective orbs enable the central action (replaying voices), and the chandelier’s cracked crystal focuses intention, not just sound. Dust, grimy windows, and humming glass orbs create a tactile, sensory-rich atmosphere filtered through Elias’s scholarly attention. The setting charges the final image—the “suspended hush” following him down—as both environment and emotional state. Crucially, the library’s status as “the quietest” since the dictionary’s end directly pressures Elias’s mission, making place inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    The fog sculpture garden functions as active micro-setting: its dissolving statues pressure choices (e.g., following driftwood arrows into ambiguity) and charge the closure (collapsed bed = unmade life). Sensory detail is purposeful—salt mist erasing chalk, fingernails on glass—filtered through the narrator’s tactile obsession. Environment constrains action: tide rearranges paths, forcing collaboration with impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.4)
    The lunar observatory functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choices: regolith tremors destabilize mirrors, shielded dome limits access, and altitude isolates them from rescue. Tools like Camera Three and the numberless clock are handled repeatedly, their states evolving under pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Ilias’s expertise—sound over sight (“judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling”). Final image charges the setting: archived data becomes the only proof they weren’t “another crater.”

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” isn’t postcard backdrop—it pressures choices by isolating the room from worldly stakes (“sickness and rent and mistakes”), enabling the farewell’s purity. The broken vinyl shard functions as micro-setting: its jaggedness constrains action (unplayable yet kept), and its cloudy-light shimmer charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s priorities (citrus-pine hope over antiseptic), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly (guitar case down, pouch poured into his hand). Weather actively shapes tone—milk-white sea vanishing the city makes the “waiting room between worlds” physically plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating isle, brass observatory, and warped spoons aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the island’s drift into the broken moon’s penumbra enables the ritual; the spoons’ impossible curves are salvaged tools that must be arranged precisely.

Final image (“noon held more night”) is charged by this environment, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    The secret garden functions as both setting and micro-setting: its shifting hedges, rusted tools, and starlight-humming instruments actively constrain choice and charge the ending. The tin box “breathing faintly” and the tooth “still wet with impossible warmth” fuse environment with emotional stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless—from bone-setter’s table to violet sky—and the dawn “snagging on the hedge” crystallizes the return. Every detail serves pressure, never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    The serpentine grotto isn’t backdrop—it breathes, coils, and listens, actively shaping the protagonist’s rhythm and emotional state. Tools (stone wheel, basin) and body (damp knees, cupped palms) function as micro-settings that constrain action: polishing requires slow circles, silence, intimacy. Final image charges the setting—the cave’s throat holds a “pearl of stillness” made real through collective glow. Sensory hierarchy (ocean hush, lemon-rain mist) reflects urgency and memory without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.6)
    The abandoned data center isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: moss dictates movement as “stepping stones,” rusted racks frame the planting site, carved skylights allow light for regrowth.

Crucially, the silo’s transformation from grain store to observatory reweights its meaning and the protagonist’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian spire isn’t backdrop—it hoards reflections like Elian hoards futures, its muteness contrasting his creative burden. The frozen lake’s advance directly invalidates prior maps, forcing tactical adaptation. Crucially, the kingfisher quill functions as micro-setting: its trapped river-colors symbolize fluid possibility versus rigid ice, and handling it charges the climax. Weather (snow clouds, thaw cycles) constrains every choice, making environment inseparable from agency.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ember alcove, ash, coals, and dial glow aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. The alcove’s isolation allows clandestine copying; ash becomes medium; the radio’s green light is trusted over “official” lamps. Every detail filters through Lina’s occupational bias (copyist noticing smudges, stroke accuracy). The final image—mist at their backs, coals warming them as they listen—charges the setting with thematic weight: memory survives in liminal, fragile spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery isn’t backdrop—it’s an active micro-setting: ash lines reshape spatial choreography, extinguishers signal false safety, and dimming lights compress time. The rocking chair and porcelain mask function as charged objects that constrain choice (Mara scatters only when chair stops; Grandmother’s presence hinges on it).

The environment culminates in the final image: drones rising like fireflies, proving setting actively shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    The crooked house isn’t backdrop but active agent: floorboards sigh, sunlight avoids the bed, rust stains echo coastlines. These details constrain Eli’s choices—he walks carefully, rotates clocks, moves his bed—and charge the final image where he sleeps inches from the “altered corner.” The bay, gulls, and streetlights aren’t decorative; they sync with the house’s breath and frame temporal shifts (“blue minute,” storm arrival). Crucially, the setting directly enables the climax: the gap by the bedroom corner receives the orris shard, making the environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting and active constraint: barnacled ribs flex, lantern-corals sway, weakened columns enable escape. Every detail is filtered through the statue’s perception—marble lions “animate lifeless,” mosaics receive color like “memories breaking surface.” The ampoule’s dyes interact with ruins; structural weakness dictates the climax. Final beams of light “spear down in savage, forgiving” contrast earlier “dim blue hush,” charging closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The infinite staircase isn’t backdrop but active constraint—it denies return, enforces forward motion, and supplies the asymmetries that pressure Arin’s choices.

The stone floor’s residual glow in the finale proves setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt terrace, driftwood shore, and broken watch form a micro-setting ecosystem that actively constrains choice—the carvings are both archive and map. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven: “bruised purple” dusk mirrors moral bruising; sand giving way to driftwood signals narrative descent. The watch’s missing hand and forked emblem directly charge the climax. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography from terrace to shore is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The parapet functions as micro-setting: wet granite, mist, broken merlons, and swinging lantern all pressure choices (neutral ground dictates behavior; storm obscures signals; slick walkway slows wounded transfers). Sensory detail is selective and crisis-narrowed (sound erased by sea, cold mistaken for fear). However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* the final choice—the drawer pull and internal conflict do—so it falls just short of 9+ despite vivid specificity. The moon’s strained light supports tone but isn’t tactically decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as active constraint and mirror: fog limits visibility and forces internal reckoning; utility poles mark both physical route and emotional gridlock; the compass and kayak hull embody inherited tools and fragile balance.

    The fort functions as micro-setting: its bottled daylight, gatework, and ramparts directly constrain choices (e.g., blackout enables rebellion; sundial must be read by residual glow). Objects like the quill holder and copper rods are tactile extensions of environment. Sensory detail is selective (winking hush, smoky bruise) and filtered through Iri’s mechanic POV. Final image charges closure: darkness makes the fort’s hum louder, proving setting shapes thematic resonance.

    The tidal bluff functions as active micro-setting: its black stones receive painted symbols, its edge channels the Fibonacci path, and its lip becomes the site of ritual. Aurora and frictionless air directly pressure tactics—eels glide through sky, dust drifts sideways—and charge the final image when the wave finally breaks against it. Sensory hierarchy reflects Arin’s focus: visual (aurora colors), tactile (stone scrape), proprioceptive (knees pressed). Environment constrains choice and reconfigures meaning at closure.

    The observatory functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its altitude places it “above the weather so no minister of culture can reach it,” directly enabling the vigil. Stormlight, brass handles, and chemical tang are filtered through the poet’s sensory bias. The telescope isn’t backdrop—it’s the conduit for revelation. Every detail serves pressure or closure.

    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and mechanical arm aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice. Light angles dictate argument paths; the brook’s burble contrasts dignified chaos; the tin’s spiral mirrors architecture. Sensory detail is selective (fractured sunlight, clink of steel) and filtered through Darius’s philosophical perception. The setting charges the final image: beams intersect where tempers soften, making environment inseparable from tactic and theme.

    The rusted library isn’t backdrop but crucible: its open roof lets rain water resistance, loose floorboards hide the tin, and iron-bar ghosts shape present tactics. Sensory details (“ink-stained fingers,” “candle stub,” “crunching glass”) filter through the poet’s urgency, avoiding tourist cataloging. The coffee tin functions as micro-setting—its false bottom directly constrains the climax’s hiding action. Final image of silver moonlight through rafters recharges the opening, proving environment shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the tidal arbor’s root-walkway constrains movement; brass compasses physically manifest stakes by pointing to “remembered choices”; mist-tides mirror emotional suspension. The station’s cracked piano and missing glass dome charge early beats, while the attic film reel’s “hidden sections” enable the transition. Final image—“stuttering monochrome” pathways unfolding—directly reweights the arbor from static refuge to dynamic map. Every detail serves pressure or closure, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ancient ridge, lagoon, and storm-bruised horizon aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the ridge is where dreams are tested, the monsoon deadline forces urgency, and the knowledge fruit seed—a micro-setting—charges every beat. Sensory specificity abounds (“flowers... closed as he passed,” “lantern light washed their faces in shifting gold”), filtered through Kael’s ritualistic attention. The environment directly shapes tactics (climbing before dawn, sleeping on stone) and culminates in the dream-tree rooted in that very ridge. Weather, flora, and geography cohere as lived-in, pressurizing forces.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The islet functions as micro-setting: wet stones, leaning pines, and grove soil directly shape action (compass points inland, lace found between stones). Rain-swollen lace and salt-stained air aren’t backdrop—they charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt-sweet breeze, smell like “opened books and seaweed”) and filtered through the tutor’s bonsai-trained attention. The environment constrains nothing physically but emotionally enables the apology’s emergence.
