  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon setting provides atmospheric grounding ("stars stitching the ink-black sky," "crystalline air"), and the greenhouse frost functions as a micro-setting element that reveals the ledger's code, directly enabling the middle turn. However, spatial choreography inside the workshop is vague (we never see Kaelen handle tools or navigate space concretely), and the mineshaft supplies information rather than constraining a tactical choice. The frost pays off at closure by teaching Kaelen "the language of silence," but environment does not pressure the final artistic decision—Kaelen's stance shift feels internally motivated rather than spatially constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly established with specific details (frost-kissed panes, orchids under glass, thermal scanner) and the setting does constrain choice: the protagonist selects the conservatory as her sanctuary, and the plants serve as her test subjects. The tuning fork case and scanner function as micro-setting elements that shape her method. The spatial choreography is clear, though the conservatory itself remains more backdrop than active pressure; it provides resources but does not force tactical adjustments in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.7)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered with pressure-controlled vaults, gelatinous manuscript cases, and fish darting between shelves. The seaside workshop and lighthouse provide coherent spatial anchors. However, the library functions primarily as scenic backdrop; its pressure or architecture does not constrain Marcus's choices during the restoration—he closes his eyes and works in a "liminal state" disconnected from the physical environment. The lens itself, as recurring object, charges the closure more effectively than setting.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ridge, terra-cotta arbor, and cabin table are established early and provide spatial grounding. The silver bell is handled concretely ("tested it one windless evening," "its surface dull with fingerprints"). However, the arbor functions primarily as backdrop—its "pillars like sentinels" is decorative rather than constraining choice. Sensory detail is selective (bell's chime "settle[s] into the bones") but the setting does not shape tactics or charge the closure image beyond providing a meeting place. Spatial choreography is clear (Lena moving through the village, baskets on doorsteps) but remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The twilight viaduct with wisteria offers vivid opening detail, but spatial choreography blurs once the camera obscura projections begin—where Elias stands relative to pedestrians and how the projection physically works remain vague. The setting pressures no choice; the viaduct could be swapped for any atmospheric location without altering tactics. The camera obscura as micro-setting constrains one beat (breathing onto the lens), lifting the score modestly, but the body and tool usage lack the specificity needed to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    The living bridge garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven imagery (bridges "pulsed faintly, as if breathing," "looped into the canopy," "writhing"), and the hyperbolic geometry constrains Elias's navigation ("paths folding back on themselves"). The tree of light at the center charges the final image. However, spatial choreography drifts—distances, exact positions, and the staircase's sudden appearance lack coherent anchoring. The garden functions more as symbolic backdrop than lived-in space that alters tactics through proximity or access.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned carnival setting is vivid ("stale popcorn and decay," "piano bench," "dust motes") and the piano keys function as micro-setting that constrains Kael's method. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (beam, bench, floor split), and the collapsing wall provides ambient pressure. The ironwood arrow and seed vault are integrated into the world logic, though the vault's appearance—"shelves of seeds bathed in soft light"—feels generic after the specificity of the carnival above.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse, forge, and shipwrecks are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (aurora bleeding violet, embers glowing, hulls groaning). The forge functions as a micro-setting that constrains the imprinting action: Elias must press his ear to its surface to capture the sound. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (forge glowing gold), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the constraint is more procedural than a live obstacle that alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The emerald station and golden-hour light are vivid and consistently rendered across the piece. Sensory detail (moonbeams "like liquid starlight," "misty veil") is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image with tactical consequence; it functions as backdrop. The jar of moonbeams is handled twice (unscrewed, capped) but its use does not alter the environment or test a physical limit.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    The abandoned control room, rust, dust, and icicles are vividly rendered and filter through Finn's philosophic eye. Spatial choreography is clear (console, torch, bucket, window). The environment does not constrain a choice or materially shape the final act—Finn could execute the same glass piece anywhere with a torch and water. Sensory detail (steam hiss, cobalt glass color, molten press) is sharp and purposeful, elevating the score within the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted library and stars are evoked repeatedly but remain decorative postcards. Spatial choreography is unclear—kneeling beside a child's cast, then confronting the betrayer in "the ruins of their old laboratory" with no transition. The seashell half and child's cast are handled physically in multiple beats, qualifying micro-setting use, but neither constrains a tactical choice or charges the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    The fort's "cold stone embrasure," "ancient timbers groaning," and "storm-tossed ridge" provide spatial grounding and weather pressure. The booklet is handled across multiple beats, evolving from record to map to glowing artifact, which qualifies as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (bruised violet sky, pebble-shore, ambered hush), though some phrases ("flaking gold leaf") repeat without functional variation. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice mid-story, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen courtyard and twilight are vividly established and recur throughout. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes 734's decision to play the violin or alters tactics during the timeline convergence. The ice violin is handled in two beats (pickup, playing) and its melting charges the ending, meeting the micro-setting allowance and lifting the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    The crystal whispering stones and rain-pooled forecourt anchor the setting with sensory specificity (hum, shimmer, lamplight) and recur throughout, charging the final gathering. The abandoned theater and shattered desk supply spatial coherence and trace the post-verbal world without exposition dumps. The lens object and kettle function as micro-setting anchors that enable the registrar's choice to invite the figures inside. However, the setting does not constrain a choice under pressure—it amplifies atmosphere rather than narrowing tactical options—so it does not meet the 9+ gate despite its vivid presence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    The garden maze and weathered vines ground the story spatially, and the low-luck zone adds world texture. Sensory detail is selective—moonlight through dusty windows, swaying vines despite still air—and the vine at the maze's center charges the final image. However, the environment functions mostly as backdrop until the climax; it does not constrain Elias's earlier choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The luck-measuring device vibrates at the end but remains a prop rather than a pressure tool.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    The research station, viewport, dome, and habitat provide spatial grounding. The magnetic nexus's "mechanically warm" surfaces recur across beats and charge the final moment, creating micro-setting specificity. The xenobiology specimens (winged creatures from Kepler-186f) anchor the nocturnal timeframe but do not constrain Elias's choices. Sensory detail leans visual (purple glow, holographic auroras); twilight-to-night progression is clear and modulates atmosphere without forcing a clock-driven decision.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    Flooded opera house and flickering lanterns anchor early and return throughout. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (wading, submerged seat, conductor's podium above water). The antique program—warped pages, translucent from water—functions as micro-setting that charges multiple beats and the final image. However, sensory detail defaults to visual (dancing shadows, flickering lanterns) without touch, smell, or temperature under stress, and the setting does not constrain any choice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain weather station supplies concrete constraint (isolation, meteorological charts, the sextant) that pressures Elara's reckoning. The botanical illustration becomes micro-setting, handling it across multiple beats (touching, smudging twice, placing beside the sextant) with evolving symbolic charge. Sensory selection is purposeful—hum of station, wool blanket texture, fogged breath on paper—grounding the abstractions. The final juxtaposition (smudged flower beside cold brass sextant) charges the closure image with spatial and symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tunnel is vivid (cold seeping through jeans, stagnant puddle, rust-stained concrete, ozone-and-regret draft) and the beaded valve wheel is handled in multiple beats, constraining Elias's attention and charging the final turn. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, gripping, turning—and sensory detail (cold, smell, visual decay) filters through Elias's skeptical, detail-oriented lens. The valve's beads and the warm draft emerging when turned anchor the closure image, making the object inseparable from the final act. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) meets the 9+ gate criteria and shapes the final image with clear physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.1)
    The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and origami swan are vividly described with sensory specificity and consistent internal logic (vine-cracked stone, volcanic glass, paper geometries). However, none of these settings constrains a choice or alters tactics; they remain postcard backdrops for drift. The final observation of crystallized obsidian does not charge the closure because no closure decision or stance crystallization occurs. Micro-setting allowance (body, tool, recurring object) is not met—objects are mentioned but never handled in a way that shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sage Ridge is named and the oak/roots are invoked lyrically, but the setting does not constrain a single tactic or supply a resource that alters Leo's response. The eclipse functions as backdrop spectacle rather than a spatial or sensory trigger that narrows choices. Micro-setting potential (the curl, the harp strings) remains ornamental; neither object pressures a decision in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The silo library is anchored early with evocative detail ("bronze quiet," "circular silence"). The tapestry fragment and containment field provide concrete objects that Aria handles across multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a backdrop for exposition. The final image does not charge the space with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse, rocks, and tavern are named and spatially coherent. The microdot tin and transmitter are handled, constraining Elias's method and shaping the final beat. Sensory detail is selective (salt, ink, waves, coffee) and filtered through Elias's focus. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a force that pressures a choice or charges the closure image; the lighthouse beam is symbolic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and violet pigment are named and reappear, lending atmospheric specificity. The chamber's "muffled clarity" and the pedal's hum provide sensory anchors. The violet circles "pulsing" and "expanding" participate in the final beat, pushing back the stillness, which charges the image slightly. Spatial choreography remains coherent (priest kneels, stands, walks), meeting micro-setting and object-as-setting standards for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid and purposeful: the nautilus curve of the stairs guides Ai's ascent, the cold seeps through his slippers (embodied constraint), and the mirrored horizon shifts from static reflection to pulsing aurora as his symphony gathers. The alcove, window crack, and kite-shaped flaw serve as micro-setting anchors that structure his memory-mapping method. At closure, the dawn light shatters the "upturned hush" and the mirrored horizon reverts to "just a lake and a sky," charging the final image with loss and making the environment indispensable to the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing viaduct, rain-slicked surfaces, and neon veins supply vivid imagery, and spatial choreography (edge, water below, rails) is initially coherent. However, the viaduct's repeated transformations ("twisted into obscene shapes," "shattered, its fragments dissolving") are asserted without anchoring Kael's movement or choices to those changes. The final plain street appears as backdrop rather than constraint, and the tablet's physical state (warm, runes pulsing, burning palm) never alters a tactic or charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: wooden drum shells as "sleeping giants," wood shavings on the workbench, stone floor conducting bass vibrations. The setting constrains Elara's choice—she needs the "audibly muted" quality to discern phantom vibrations, and the turntable/floor become conduits for her sensory plan. The micro-setting (her body, the turntable, the record) charges the final image when she feels the pulse through her skeleton. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The courtyard is grounded with concrete details (stone walls, cobblestones, rustling leaves) and the quarantine zone's haze charges the atmosphere. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elias's calm observational mode. The message tube functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his choice, appearing in multiple beats (finding it, examining it, opening it, pocketing it) and charging the final image as rain falls. However, the courtyard itself does not pressure the ending action; it remains backdrop rather than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The terra-cotta grotto offers vivid sensory anchors (rust-colored walls, honey-thick viscosity, shadow-origami), and the rope physically engages the environment across multiple beats (tracing patterns, slipping through thresholds). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the pedestals and devices appear conveniently at the end without prior spatial grounding. Micro-setting (the rope as tool) shapes mid-story moves but the closure remains detached from environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse with fractured dome and shipwrecks is vividly anchored, and sensory details (wood damp from mist, amber/rose light) are purposeful. The mendicant's bowl is handled physically (traced, held to ear, set on floor) and the sapling's emergence provides a concrete image. However, the environment does not constrain Lyra's choices—she could perform this ritual anywhere. The shipwrecks "loom" and "groan" but remain postcard backdrop rather than active pressure on her decision to play or speak.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber grotto at dusk provides consistent atmospheric anchoring with recurring sensory detail (thickening light, shimmering walls, static electricity). However, the setting remains largely decorative; spatial choreography is vague (polished stone table, walls that close in and then feel warmer) without constraining the dealer's choices. The blotter petal functions more as symbolic object than spatial element. The grotto shifts from workplace to sanctuary via assertion rather than through environmental pressure that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The symphony hall and "breezy library under stars" are anchored with vivid, purposeful detail (marble columns, golden dome, night readers like moths). Sensory selection serves atmosphere and the locket is handled twice with tactile specificity. However, setting does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image—the library functions as backdrop for the coincidental manuscript discovery rather than shaping Marla's tactics or closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystalline orchard, floating prisms, and crater's edge create vivid, consistent imagery. Micro-setting (marsh-reeds, obsidian arbor) is handled across beats and charged at closure when vines transform sculptures into beacons. However, the environment does not constrain a choice; characters move freely without spatial friction. The recurring prisms and reeds accumulate texture but do not force a tactical trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rooftop canal system and twin moons provide vivid anchors, and sensory details (damp metal, primal musk, neon rivers) are purposeful and POV-filtered. However, spatial choreography wobbles: Elias moves from rooftop studio to terrace to skiff to canal junction without clear transitions, and the "rooftop canals" are introduced as both external cityscape and navigable waterways without reconciling scale or access. The Whispering Knot—central to the climax—is described only as "a convergence of three canals" and "a vortex," offering no tactile or visual specificity when Elias arrives. The setting does not constrain his final choice; the "being" he encounters is abstract ("a shimmer of potential"), and the canal's role as map or guide dissolves into metaphor at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: bioluminescent fruit, drip-drip-drip of mineral water, mosaic stepping stones, stalactites. The chipped mosaic stone constrains Elian's ritual method (glass eyes placed in depressions) and the dripping water anchors his "mathematics of emotion" metaphor. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image when tears land on the mosaic and create steam, linking his emotional release to the cavern's physical properties. Micro-setting use pushes this into the 7+ band despite some decorative passages.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and atmospheric—"wooden beams that held the building together like aged bones," "sapphire hush of early morning," pipe chases and crawl spaces. Spatial choreography is clear throughout Elias's movements. The crawl space constrains his visibility and his flashlight enables navigation, linking environment to tactics. The power outage provides a timed window that he exploits, though the return of power at the end does not materially alter his final action. The library's hidden infrastructure is well-drawn and specific to his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mossy trellis, rain, wind, and ozone-thick air actively constrain Elias's actions: the plastic shield he improvises "agitates" the leaf, forcing tactical failure. Sensory hierarchy reflects his scientific gaze ("slick and fragrant," "taut wire vibrating") until the final shift when he feels rain "pierce his skin." The trellis and leaf charge the final image by anchoring his embodied participation. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The environment matters to choice and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    The tidal island, causeway, and convergence are vividly rendered with brackish edges and salt-fresh separation. Spatial choreography is clear. The convergence itself constrains Elara's painting project and charges the vortex scene, qualifying as micro-setting that shapes a key beat. However, the island's isolation and post-war scarcity are told rather than shown through resource pressure or tactical choices, limiting full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered with luminous walls, amethyst clusters, and overlapping shadows. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and sonic (resonant hums, complex patterns) with occasional tactile notes (ice and fire at fingertips). The cave pearl functions as object-as-setting, anchoring the transformation beat, which lifts the score. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elara moves "deeper" repeatedly without legible distances or obstacles that constrain her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "ivory harbor after rain" and "mist-shrouded docks" establish locale, and the recurring image of rain-washed ivory buildings bookends the narrative with purpose. The trumpet valve as micro-object constrains Elara's archival method and charges the closure exhibit, satisfying the constraint-choice test. Spatial choreography is clean (docks, examination table, archive chambers, harbor lights), but sensory detail leans heavily visual without embodying touch, smell, or sound during high-pressure moments. The setting supports rather than actively pressures Elara's choices; her work could proceed similarly in a different locale with minor edits.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "starlit vault in mist" and phantom platform create atmospheric pressure, and the cracks/arrows function as micro-setting that guides movement. The fortress spires and hall of mirrors are vivid but remain postcard backdrops—no tactile interaction or constraint on choice. Spatial choreography is coherent (tracks, gate, hall), but the mist and fog are recycled without evolving causally. Cap applied per Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tower's circular room, open roof, and humming floor are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean (stairs, pedestal, sitting cross-legged under stars). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elara's actions would proceed identically in any quiet, elevated space. The tile's warmth and glow serve atmosphere but do not alter her tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "prismatic escondite" and "crystalline labyrinth" are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice or shape tactics; the immortal "moved through" it without spatial friction. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual abstraction ("light-prisms," "watercolors," "impossible angles") without grounding in body, tool, or micro-setting that alters action. The amulet fragment and magnetic fields function as thematic devices rather than objects with weight, temperature, or resistance that the character must navigate. The setting does not pressure the climactic moment—geometry "frayed" conveniently where needed.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    The funeral home prep room supplies concrete resources (refrigerated units hiding Elena, embalming equipment framing the space, UV light in Maya's sleeve) and the setting's "deathly vitality" charges the final image of redemption amid death work. Spatial choreography is clear (prep room → corridor → alley). The ink pot as micro-setting object constrains Maya's tactics (careful not to touch it, precise UV activation). The phrase "deathly vitality" recurs but remains more atmospheric than a constraint that alters a key choice, limiting the setting's causal grip on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and glass workshop anchor early and create a distinct micro-environment. Sensory detail is vivid ("gilded-leaf," "morning dew," "faint hum") and filtered through craft focus. The lamp's hum constrains the dawn ritual method, and the labyrinth "holds its breath" as a witness, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across workbench, lamp corner, and labyrinth exterior, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and specific ("steel canyons," "corrugated walls"), and the tidal rhythm is woven through ("high tide a blur of activity, low tide a hush"). The poison label—wedged between containers, "brittle paper...edges softened by salt and time"—anchors the climactic layering moment and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, holding it to light, slipping into pocket) is clean. The micro-setting (label as object-setting) constrains the protagonist's ritual and supports closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned observatory on a cliff is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (jagged cliff, tempestuous sea, decaying dome). The painted seashell's warmth and color-shift create concrete sensory moments tied to plot movement. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop—the cliff, sea, and crumbling walls don't constrain Elias's choices or provide resources that affect the outcome. The seashell (micro-setting object) does charge the closure moment by pointing inward, narrowly qualifying for the 9+ gate, though its mechanics remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The floating carnival is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (neon, glow paint, artificial snow) and the raft structure pressures choices through spatial choreography. The foundation stone chip as micro-object recurs and charges the final image with moonlight texture. However, the setting often serves as backdrop rather than active constraint—the developers' barges arrive but don't force tactical shifts tied to specific raft geography or carnivalesque infrastructure in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lunar setting is vivid and consistently realized (dust, vacuum, crater floor, summit). The nightwatch grain and camera equipment are handled in multiple beats, and the crater's changing light provides atmospheric pressure. However, environment does not visibly constrain a choice—Elias proceeds on schedule with no spatial obstacle or resource scarcity forcing a trade-off—and the final image charges the moment thematically without a micro-setting element (tool, body, proximity) altering the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mist-coated depot, fountain, and workshop are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (water refraction, drip of fountain, rusted tracks). The fountain's refraction patterns guide one diagnostic choice mid-story. However, the environment does not constrain the final beat—Elias completes the repair without spatial or material friction. The ship's horn and depot clock mark time but do not alter access or pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and windowpane condensation are vividly anchored and filtered through Elias's cartographical eye. Sensory detail is selective (cold seeping, yellowed pages smelling of distant places, purple shadows) and purposeful. The condensation patterns function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's understanding and charges the final image of ephemeral knowledge. However, the outpost itself does not force a spatial choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop. The ending gains resonance from the condensation's fading, lifting the score into mid-6 range via closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    The archway with sigils, cobblestones that glow and hum, and the broken clock tower supply vivid anchors for the accumulative design. The tuning fork and cobblestones function as micro-setting that charges the closure image ("his footsteps remained, infinitely patient, etched into the cobblestones"). However, spatial choreography is vague—rooms, streets, square, and town edge blur together without clear distances or layout. Orientation debt in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the global rule.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    Spatial choreography is incoherent: the story opens with a ship in "the void of space," then approaches an "underwater temple" without clarifying whether this is a submerged structure on a planet or a metaphor, and Marina dons a "diving suit" while aboard a spacecraft with "life support" and "oxygen reserves." The crystal vial, temple spires, and corridor geometry are described but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Orientation debt persists past the allowable window and is never resolved, capping Q3 at 7.0 per the global rule.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef is vividly anchored with copperlight, salt scent, and crashing waves. The confessional lattice constrains the escape method by encoding the passage map, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Spatial choreography remains clear: cell → narrow door → outer walkway → lighthouse steps. The reef's "broken teeth" and tower's lower chamber (concealing bodies) charge the final image with concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with bioluminescent flora, silver-barked trees, and luminous pomegranates that establish a distinct sensory palette. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The carved stone bead, which could serve as micro-setting, is handled passively (held, hummed, flared by magic) rather than enabling or constraining a decision. The final image of the orchard "listening" is evocative but ornamental, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Vivid sensory anchors (cracked tide pools, slivered moon, canyon walls "glowing like internal organs") establish atmosphere. The red canyon and ancient looms provide purposeful micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography wobbles: Elara moves from barren shore to red earth canyon without clear transition or distance cues, and the labyrinth's interior geography (narrowing passages, colossal ruin at the heart) is sketched rather than tracked. The copper plate and kelp-silk constrain the weaving action at closure, meeting the 9+ gate test, but the sleepwalking paths that "glow beneath her feet" are metaphoric rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly specific: ghost-white trees, roots gripping limestone, perfume of twilight blossoms. The sundial base itself becomes micro-setting, its weight felt across beats and its socket discovery drives the final turn. Spatial choreography (descent, tree-roots, tomb entrance, crypt) remains clear. However, the orchard pressures mood more than choice; Elara's path through it is described as "purposeful yet wandering" without on-page constraint or tactical cost imposed by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.1)
    The golden arcade and ebony clipboard are described vividly, and the chalk codes provide tactile anchoring. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the final image—Elliot's workspace could be almost anywhere without altering his internal process. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling on the pathway, standing, brushing knees), and the futuristic details (quantum processors, nano-particles) read plausible within the speculative frame, lifting the score above purely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt observatory is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics—Elias could embroider anywhere. Autumn winds "howl outside" and leaves "cling to trees" in postcard fashion without affecting action. The eternal candle is handled across beats and returns in the final image, providing the sole instance of a recurring object that charges closure, lifting the score above ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with skeletal roots, brackish water, and salt-laced air; sensory details are selective and support the mystical tone. The shard's physical warmth and the condensation mechanism give tactile specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—the medium moves freely, the spirits guide without friction, and the moonlight clearing appears exactly when needed. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atrium is anchored early with selective sensory detail (mist on ferns, stone bench, hidden fountain) that recurs and evolves to support emotional progression. The anesthetic creates a specific perceptual filter ("fuzzing his thoughts but also sharpening his instinct"), and the coral fragment functions as micro-setting—a tactile object whose pulse and coolness constrain and charge key beats. The fountain's revelation and re-concealment by mist mirrors the emotional arc, and the twilight deepening to "bruised purple" charges the final exit. Spatial choreography (bench, cast brushing hand, leaning closer) remains legible, and the mist operates as both atmosphere and thematic vehicle without becoming static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ruined orchard and fresco fragment anchor setting vividly, and sensory detail is purposeful (fog, moss, skeletal trees, "tiny ghosts" of breath). The fragment functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a stage for Elara's unchallenged gift. Spatial choreography is clean; tone supports the concept. The fragment's warmth at the end is a micro-constraint on meaning but does not reshape options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden is rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail—"crystalline petals that chimed underfoot," "trumpet-shaped flower" that echoes touch as a chord. Spatial choreography within the garden is clear (path, reflecting pool, lily), and the setting charges the thematic question. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara is a passive observer rather than an agent navigating obstacles. The hobo nickel functions as a micro-object that anchors the transition and charges the final image, partially compensating for the lack of environmental pressure during the garden sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse is vivid (moth wings, formaldehyde, pinned beetles, bioluminescent fungi, monstera) and returns at closure, but it does not constrain a choice—Silas could meet anywhere. The community garden becomes the active setting in the second half: soil, marigolds, zigzag pattern, and the raid's "scarred earth" all pressure the plot. The wildflower's survival charges the final image. Sensory detail is dense and POV-filtered ("bloody chaos," "cool under his nails"), though some descriptions (iridescent beetles "frozen mid-scuttle") veer decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The gargantuan shell receives vivid description ("pearlescent walls humming with the ghosts of long-dead tides") but functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The cliff and reef-shadow sea frame the blossom's arrival yet remain postcard imagery rather than micro-setting that pressures tactics. The galaxy postcard appears in the poet's pocket at the cliff, a minor spatial detail, but its presence there does not affect the action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful in places (the off-key wind, the blossom's shimmer), lifting the score above pure ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    The opal library above clouds is vividly rendered with iridescent shelves, glass orchids, and velvet paintings; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The cracked bamboo tube functions as a constraint that drives the first repair sequence, and the locket requires physical handling. However, the setting does not evolve causally—no environmental change follows from the song or memory sacrifice—and spatial choreography is vague (we never learn how the caretaker moves between shelves or where objects are positioned relative to one another). The environment charges mood but does not alter tactics or supply resources at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archive is vividly rendered with "dust and silence," leather tomes, and the glowing ink well, providing atmospheric grounding. Sensory detail (ink "like liquid starlight," shelves humming, shadows dancing) is textural and sustains mood. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices or complicates her magical act. The glass ink well charges multiple beats and its shattering appears at closure, meeting micro-setting criteria, but the archive itself does not pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amphitheater and volcano are vividly sketched with purposeful sensory detail (geothermal warmth, dappled sunlight, crumbling tiers). The surveyor's chain—handled, stretched, aligned with the basin drain—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the amphitheater's spatial features do not constrain the machinist's actions; he could perform the same sequence in any room with a flat surface. The "building breathes" motif recurs but does not tighten a choice or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The attic setting constrains Elian's world to a single grimy skylight, the loft, and the dust-filled beam of light, creating spatial intimacy that charges the final release into open sky. The meteorite chip's "metallic coolness" and the storm-cloud pigeon's color are tactile and visual anchors. The skylight itself becomes a frame for his cosmology, and the dust motes function as micro-setting that recurs in the closure beat ("blooming, withering in the solitary shaft of light"), reweighting the ending image with pattern and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prism terrace, wood grain, and logbook are vividly described but function as postcard elements; they do not constrain a single on-page choice. Spatial choreography is vague—Elea kneels, moves to the edge, stands—without coherent distance or object placement. The "fractured light" and "drifting" recur as texture but never alter tactics or charge the closure image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underwater facility setting is vivid (reinforced windows, bioluminescent plankton, dormant machinery) and the facility's transformation supplies resources. However, spatial choreography during the discovery sequence is vague—Elara moves from "observation screen" to "archives" to activating "the system" without clear movement or proximity. The burnt feather's physical location and Elara's handling of it remain abstract. The setting does not constrain a choice at closure; it provides backdrop for automated wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The geode cave is rendered with vivid sensory detail (iridescent crystals, light splintering into rainbows, crystalline floor) and recurs across beats. Spatial choreography is clear: Aelia positions herself, seeds fall and scatter, she works on the floor. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains postcard-pretty backdrop. The crater glass object functions more actively than the cave itself; the cave's beauty underscores tone but does not pressure tactics. Micro-setting strength is present in the glass and seeds, but the geode as location remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arcade under stars is vividly rendered with iron-and-glass vaulting, cobblestones, salt air, and the frozen clock monument. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (lamp post, clock at far end, crowd movement). The clock itself constrains the final choice—Elias must reach it, and the woman's key becomes a tool that enables closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elias's attentiveness, though some descriptions ("sky bruised with constellations," "silver" music) lean decorative in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight garden is anchored early with concrete details (crystalline dome, obsidian stones, constellations). Sensory selection remains generic (starlight, moonstone warmth) and does not reflect character urgency or professional filter. The twelve obsidian stones at the garden's center supply a spatial anchor for the climax, meeting the micro-setting test minimally. The moonstone dust speck functions as both object and body-setting when it "dissolved into liquid light," but the transformation feels ornamental rather than constraining a prior choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("milky light," "prism atrium in mist," "wet sand cool beneath worn boots"). The mist and light do charge the atmosphere and the dissolution of the prism atrium marks time's passage. However, the bay itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as a backdrop for passive observation rather than a pressure that shapes the outcome. Micro-setting credential (body, tool, recurring object) is met by the stone and the glasspanes, but neither constrains a decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ridge path, moon, valley, and cracked box anchor the scene with selective sensory detail. The box functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged at closure. However, the celestial imagery becomes ornamental ("celestial slow dance," "ancient, unhurried rhythm") without constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean, and the scarred landscape mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, but the environment does not actively pressure Elias's final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The grotto is anchored early with vivid tactile detail (tide-polished, lucent shells, tidepool), and the rising tide distorts her patterns in a moment that could pressure choice. However, she observes the distortion without fear or adjustment of tactics; the environment remains postcard rather than constraint. The gauge and decorations function as props described rather than tools that alter her approach, missing the micro-setting constraint test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage, damp walls, and hearth are vivid and recur across beats. The film negative strip appears physically ("coiled like a snake," "slid… into his pocket"), and the ivy's final "lean in" charges the exit moment. However, the passage does not constrain a choice—Elian moves through it without spatial friction—and the manor's geography remains vague (unclear how diaries found "yesterday" relate to today's corridor). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, lifting the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and post-rain light are vividly rendered and recur across beats, shaping the painter's workspace and ritual timing. The cathedral bells impose a hard time constraint that governs the action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though at times the lush register drifts slightly elevated. The prism parapet charges the final image by continuing its refractive work after the painter departs, satisfying the 9+ gate partially but not decisively constraining a mid-scene choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The terrace setting is signaled early and anchors the ritual with sensory details (stone worn smooth, sun rays, celestial alignment). The ebony clipboard functions as a recurring object that frames the ritual. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain choice—Elias could perform this act elsewhere without altering the narrative stakes. Sensory detail is selective and vivid (humidity, golden light) but remains more atmospheric than tactically pressing on the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Salt flat setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystallized earth, bruised sky, reflective surface) and micro-setting elements (salt crystals arranged in vanished flight paths, micro-fractures mirroring the map) that charge the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Silas follows his predetermined plan without spatial pressure. The 平整 character mid-sentence is a jarring artifact that breaks immersion. Setting supports atmosphere but remains largely postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary offer vivid sensory anchors (snow, crystalline facets, refracted colors), and the threads pulse like living things. However, the setting remains postcard-static: snow and stars do not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The sanctuary's interior mechanics (how threads are woven, why they resist) are asserted but not shown through tactile interaction. Micro-setting credit: the threads themselves function as setting-objects that she manipulates, pushing the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The radar dome is mentioned three times (opening, night work, final performance) but never constrains a choice or alters a tactic—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The seedy bars receive vivid texture ("The Rusty Compass," "grimy surroundings") yet spatial choreography within any single performance is absent; we never see Elias navigate proximity, sightlines, or audience interference. The campfire story stick and puppets function as props described rather than tools that impose physical or tactical limits during a live beat.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto setting is vivid and atmospheric—mosses drinking from clouds, wet stone, ozone—and the verdant backdrop frames the monarchs' flight. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's focused attention, and the space remains coherent across the construction sequence. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a backdrop rather than an active pressure. The moth wing and fallen monarch are present as objects, but the environment itself does not force a trade-off or charge the final image beyond aesthetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors, and the rope's braids constrain the caster's method across multiple beats. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—kneeling position, tray placement, and rope coiling are mentioned but never affect movement or choice. The "snowmelt ardor" scent appears late and ornamentally. The setting charges the final image but does not narrow tactical options during the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and spiral descent into the ozone-scented core chamber are vivid and purposeful, grounding Kael's isolation and the decay premise. The conduit burst overhead and Kael's preemptive sidestep demonstrate spatial choreography that serves his foresight trait. The wafer seal—a "flake of crystallized code" with "glowing fractures"—functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax (touching accelerates decay, forcing the mental-intervention solution). However, the storm outside serves primarily as atmospheric punctuation rather than a tactical constraint; it "rattles the bunker's thick hull" but does not pressure Kael's choices or complicate his access to the core.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Babylonian palace is vivid and purposefully detailed (ziggurat silhouette, crumbling bricks, ancient courtyards), and sensory selection reflects the liminal timeframe and Elias's scholarly focus. The tile's bronze mirror and reed stylus anchor micro-setting, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. However, the environment does not materially constrain a choice or force an adaptation—Elias executes his plan without environmental friction. The final image does not lean on setting to charge the closure; the palace stands "silent, ready to be reclaimed or forgotten," functionally inert at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sanctuary's shifting walls and "soundless" quality are mentioned repeatedly but function as wallpaper rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague—visitors "approach" and "depart" with no sense of distance, doorways, or layout. The music box is handled in multiple beats and its broken pin is concrete, elevating the score slightly; however, the sanctuary itself never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Sensory detail defaults to generic ("starlight," "dim light") without POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard district supplies vivid, selective detail (cobblestones, frost, fog swirling like ghosts) filtered through Elian's craft focus. The broken sextant and mirror shards function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual's assembly. The final image of glass mountains charges the closure by reweighting the district's ruin with impossible beauty. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid and specific, filtering through the mender's trade and loss (stained glass, rope ladder, roots clinging to arches). The ribbon pressed into soil and the seed planted between trees are tactile, micro-setting moves that constrain her ritual. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (orchard as bridge), meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but does not alter a mid-scene choice under pressure—it functions more as symbolic stage than active constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.1)
    The pistachio shell cameo and astral orchard are vividly imagined—"crystalline fruits," "inner curvature"—but the orchard never constrains a choice or alters Margaret's tactics on the page. The museum's restricted wing and staff restroom anchor locale briefly, yet spatial choreography dissolves during the orchard sequences (no clear entry/exit mechanics). The cameo charges the final image by reappearing on the desk, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of environmental pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Serpent Stack is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: spiraling staircases, aisles that dead-end into themselves, compasses that spin uselessly, and the scent of aging paper as "an unheard symphony magnified to a deafening volume." The setting constrains Elara's method (she cannot search physically; she must study) and the rotunda becomes the stage for her climactic renegotiation. The river of flowing light and the dissolving wall are specific to the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the mountain's consciousness as a grammatical entity integrates setting with concept.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.1)
    The carnival ship setting supplies vivid images (carousel horses, fog, rusted railing, engine room) but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental feature narrows a choice or alters tactics; the emerald swatch card opens paths conveniently without resistance. The garden of forgotten names appears as wish-fulfillment rather than hard-won destination shaped by prior spatial or resource limits. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, not filtered through urgency or POV-specific priority.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    The clock tower mechanism room is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (brass oil, aged parchment, gears). The rope's texture and the infinite library's visual architecture are specific. However, the environment supplies atmosphere more than constraint—Elias encounters no spatial obstacles, tool failures, or resource limits that force adaptation. The setting stages the puzzle but does not pressure tactics or choices, keeping it functional but not essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harmonic caves, ice cracks, and echo chamber stone anchor setting vividly and the stone's glow constrains Lorne's method across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, pressing stone to ice, standing within the bloom), and sensory detail—cold air, fogging breath, crystalline hum—grounds the action. The ice cracks function as micro-setting that shapes the climactic choice, charging the final image when the bloom expands. However, the energy beings remain external decoration without altering Lorne's spatial options or access, and the caves' "hammered repose" at the end is asserted rather than demonstrated through changed environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass humming pavilion supplies vivid sensory anchors—spiral stairs, crystalline vibration, transparent dome, wind-driven hum—and the prism housing mechanism provides tactile detail during the adjustment sequence. Spatial choreography (summit, prism, focusing ring, beam trajectory) remains coherent. The environment does not constrain a choice or provide a resource under pressure; Kaelen's success depends on his calculations and the shard, not on pavilion features that complicate or enable tactics, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit observatory, solidified fog, and crystal forecourt are vivid and particular. The shadow-measurement detail and the fog's "own timeline" constrain Kael's interpretive work. The forecourt whispers return at closure ("silence where the whispers used to be"), charging the final image. Sensory selection (crunch of boots, crystal hum) filters through professional attention without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    The blooming fortress, mosaic courtyard, and starless sky are vivid and filtered through Marlo's perception (lavender perfume, flickering torch light). The fire spinner's knot constrains the method of discovery and the mosaic tiles shift meaning under fire—environment enables a key choice. However, spatial choreography in the courtyard remains generic; we lack concrete distances, entry/exit paths, or how Marlo moves between walls and floor mosaics. The setting charges atmosphere but does not tighten tactics or impose a material obstacle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto setting is anchored early and consistently—tidal pools, stone floor, stars, rising water—and the incoming tide functions as both atmospheric pressure and temporal constraint that charges the final image. The jade cicada operates as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and shifting meaning. Sensory detail (water lapping, cool surface, starlight) is selective and POV-filtered through Elian's chronicler lens. Spatial choreography remains clear (across the pool, cicada placed between them). The rising tide constrains the conversation window and charges closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The xenial trellis, silver vines, and inverted-gravity setting are vividly rendered and sensory—"rain and starlight," "moist silence of a cloud's belly." The bunker anchor grounds Elara's return, and the trellis's lattice structure shapes her floating path. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or impose a visible obstacle; she moves freely, collects, and descends without tactical friction. The doll warms and cools, but this is reported rather than used to alter her actions. The setting charges the lyric mood but remains closer to backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.1)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly described with strong sensory anchors (crystalline structures, refracted light, humming rails). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara's path is frictionless. The storm glass vial and prisms are repeatedly described but do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting potential exists but is not leveraged to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The futuristic setting supplies vivid details (floating cities, artificial moon, android guards, kaleidoscopic waterfall) that establish atmosphere. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during key movements—the temple structure's relationship to the orchard and waterfall remains unclear. The ruby flake's "strange frequency emissions" disabling guards reads as a convenience without prior setup of this capability. Sensory detail trends decorative rather than filtered through Elias's professional or emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ashen sanctuary under starlight provides vivid visual texture, but the space does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—"outside" and "through the charcoal-black archway" lack concrete distances or obstacles. The doorknocker ring is handled twice, but its weight and serpent shape do not change her approach or enable a specific action. Sensory detail leans heavily on the visual ("constellations that burned cold," "smoke in wind") without touch, sound, or smell to ground the crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly described (glowing caps, damp earth, ozone scent, shadows rippling). Spatial choreography is coherent: Leo steps deeper, kneels, presses the bolt into soil. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The bolt and mushrooms brighten and dim on cue but do not impose physical limits or tactical friction. Micro-setting option is present but not leveraged for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sepia reading room, mahogany desk, and gramophone are vividly established and return with shifted meaning ("the gramophone crank handle…resting in his hand like a verdict"). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric; the golden shadows modulate with pressure. The gramophone handle constrains one choice (picking it up again "with purpose"), lifting the score above ornamental, though the room itself does not limit options or supply resources that alter the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.1)
    The greenhouse and orchard are described with vivid, fantastical detail (glass panes magnifying endless night, fruits pulsing, tree hung with gears), but setting remains postcard backdrop rather than constraint. The knight moves "through forgotten patterns" without spatial choreography that tracks his position or limits his options. The gear tree at center could be anywhere; no environmental feature forces a tactical choice or charges the final image with grounded cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The file room is anchored with sensory particulars (fluorescent hum, dust patterns, brittle pages, brass button). The button's tactile presence (cool, weightless) and the archival sleeve constrain Elias's final choice to pair objects rather than re-file them. Spatial choreography is clean (bottom shelf, ledger, sleeve), and the setting shapes the closure image (endless shelves reweighted). The micro-object (button) charges the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test, but one slip—"листing" (a typo or code artifact)—touches the opening and prevents higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The auric lagoon, puddle reflections, and phone booth are introduced with vivid sensory detail (golden hue, mineral deposits, weathered logo). The puddles function as a communication method that shapes Maya's route, satisfying the micro-setting gate. However, spatial choreography blurs: Maya moves from Ministry to lagoon to shed without clear transition anchors, and the shed's interior layout (loose floorboard hiding a phone booth) strains plausibility. The lagoon's auric glow "intensified" during the broadcast but does not constrain or enable Maya's action—it remains decorative. The ending invokes "city shadows" and "starlight" generically, missing an opportunity to charge the final image with environmental particulars that reconfigure earlier details.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, and dewdrops create a vivid, recurring micro-setting that charges multiple beats: Elias positions himself before the atrium, his music fractures into colored beams, and the final dewdrops reflect his face. The spatial choreography is clear (path downward, stone walls, glass structure) and sensory detail is purposeful (damp surfaces, mist, birdsong filtering down). The atrium constrains his tactic—he uses it to scatter notes into light—and returns in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Slightly mechanical recurrence (dewdrops appear in opening, middle, and close with similar phrasing) and the phrase "quietly vivid" repeated verbatim at start and end feel decorative rather than dramatized, but the core setting work is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ashen arbor is vividly rendered in the opening third with selective sensory detail (dangling roots, drifting trees, midnight blossoms during celestial alignments). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elias works at his tray, the speck grows, and the transformation unfolds without spatial friction. The micro-setting (balcony, room, sorting tray) is present but ornamental; no tool, object, or proximity shapes the outcome. The piece satisfies basic anchoring but does not reach the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge the final image).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subterranean waterfall and greenhouse are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (glowing moss, mist, rusted tools, swirling leaves), and the compass rose recurs across beats, but the environment's constraint effect is minimal—the tinkerer's descent and discovery feel guided by atmospheric curiosity rather than spatial or material pressure that narrows his options. The compass "tugs him forward" without clear stakes tied to the physical space; the pool and pedestal are postcard staging rather than resources or obstacles that alter his tactics. The final image of the compass pointing "toward the horizon" is generic rather than grounded in the cavern's particulars, missing the chance to charge closure with setting-specific weight.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-washed foundry is vivid and specific: sulfur smell, tin roof rhythm, bare bulb, melting pot, bellows. The forge constrains Elian's redemptive gesture—he must work the bellows to achieve heat for the repair—and the coin's chip becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his alchemist's priorities (weight, metal properties, heat bloom). The foundry's half-finished projects (thermos, compass, sculpture) add texture without clutter. No spatial confusion; objects track cleanly across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered early ("cliffs swallowed sound," "misaligned harp," "sunrise filtered through cracks") and the acoustic properties recur through multiple beats, shaping the collector's method. The crocodile's tooth functions as a tactile anchor (coolness, serrated edge, pressed into earth) across three moments. However, neither gorge nor tooth constrains a choice or alters tactics; they ornament rather than pressure. The ending image (tooth left behind, collector walking onward) charges thematically but does not demonstrate how the environment forced a tradeoff, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid—ozone, decay, violet-to-indigo glow, bark texture—and the phantom pewter mask strap functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's recall and charging the closure moment when its pressure recedes. Spatial choreography (back against tree, hands bracing ground, taking a step forward) remains clear. The forest's light modulation at the epiphany directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test, but the setting does not constrain an earlier choice, capping the score near the high 7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist's market is vividly rendered (glowing ropes, mist, bottled starlight) and provides a functional frame, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist moves through it as a catalog rather than a crucible. The lighthouse lens fragment recurs across beats and charges the final image when it "fades into ordinary glass," offering mild object-as-setting weight. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the sensory detail is selective, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned ticket office is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (peeling gilt, water-stained medallion, grimy panes) that filter through the technician's observational lens. The ceiling itself constrains his action—he must climb, work loose lath, retrieve from a cavity—and the space's history (circus, trapeze fall) charges the final image. Dust accumulation and the ceiling's latticework function as micro-setting elements that shape his method and the object's concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard library, translucent fruit, and cloud-sea are vivid and consistent. The press and the bottled whisper function as tactile anchors. The final leap uses the library edge and clouds to charge the image. Micro-setting (press lever, frost on glass, bottle in pocket) constrains Elias's hesitation and choice, meeting the 9+ gate test and justifying entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque asteroid museum with visible time drifting through corridors is vivid and purposeful, creating a textured environment that pressures Kaelen's choices. The maintenance suite with clouded mirrors becomes micro-setting that enables the ritual method. The crystal shard itself functions as object-as-setting, constraining the vision and charging the final image. Sensory details—golden thread light, burnished twilight color in crystal—are selective and POV-filtered through Kaelen's poetic attention. Minor issue: the "artificial weather system" announcing meteor shower feels like convenience staging rather than integrated world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered and constrains the repair method (specific frequencies reveal invisible fissures). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear. The chamber functions as micro-setting that enables a key beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement, but does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and selective: the lab of amber vials, the post-factory silence, the fissure "breathing cool, damp air," the phosphorescent lagoon. The subterranean descent constrains movement and intensifies pressure through tactile detail ("boots scraping on stratified whispers"). The lagoon environment charges the final image decisively: its "impossible" clarity and magnetic pull anchor the explorers' dissolution and Elias's renunciation. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The timeframe (post-factory shutdown) subtly enables the descent by removing toxic discharge, a purposeful constraint. Minor issue: the "turquoise water" in psychometric vision slightly duplicates the lagoon's later reveal, reducing surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archway, slide, and sculptures are named and revisited, and the storm brackets the journey. However, spatial choreography between lighthouse, tide pool, and cave is vague—distances and transitions are elided without POV justification. The archway's "turbine-hum reverie" recurs as label but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with concrete detail. Sensory selection is generic (waves crashing, dim light) rather than character-filtered or tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Setting shifts cleanly through studio, flea markets, amber pavilion, and chapel, each anchored with selective detail (night jasmine murals, etched glass windows, stained glass depicting botanical mysteries). The amber pavilion and chapel glass supply the discovery mechanism, meaningfully constraining Lena's investigation and charging the final mural. However, spatial choreography within the pavilion remains vague, and the seasonal markers function more as chapter headings than embodied environmental pressure that alters tactics. The etched glass—visible only at a precise morning angle—is the strongest constraint, justifying the setting's role in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The obsidian lagoon, driftwood letters, floating library, and beach debris function as active setting elements that constrain Elias's method and charge the closure image. The rope ladder descent, kelp and manacle use, and debris circle around the zeppelin's shadow ground spatial choreography. Sensory detail is vivid ("bruised violet," "obsidian," "searing reverie") and filtered through archivist idiom. The lagoon's surface "crawling with names" at the retrocognitive peak directly pressures his final choice to arrange "REMEMBER," satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is anchored with selective detail: sand "smooth as powdered glass," lanterns glowing without fire. The cove's response to Elian's decisions (lanterns dimming/brightening, structures shimmering) creates a feedback loop that constrains his choices. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; no physical object or spatial constraint alters tactics in a peak beat. The final image of the transformed town charges the closure moment adequately, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite limited beat-by-beat integration.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard garden atop the spire is vividly rendered with "thousand-year-old olive trees" and "engineered soil that tasted of both earth and sky." The wax cylinder as micro-setting object constrains the final choice—Elias must press it to his temple—and charges the closure when it dissolves into his skin. However, spatial choreography during the transformation remains abstract; we lose concrete grounding as "the boundary between himself and the archived promises dissolved."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The icebound atrium and starlit dome anchor setting early and vivid sensory detail (cold enough to crack stone, ice crystals rearranging) is selective and purposeful. The oak acorn cap's physical interaction—pressing into the floor depression, sinking into pliant ice—constrains the protagonist's action and charges the closure beat when it fuses seamlessly. The transition to the warmer, soil-scented Temporal Stasis Chamber offers contrast that supports the thematic shift. Micro-setting (the cap, the floor seam) functions as tool and anchor, meeting the 9+ gate test by shaping the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The windblown sanctuary, thin air, and cloud-sea below establish vivid altitude atmosphere. Sensory detail (wind shifts, aurora, "solstice hush") is selective and voice-consistent. However, the setting functions largely as backdrop; the anemometer, bell rope, and control panel are described but do not materially constrain Elian's choices. The "microclimate variation" he notices does not alter his test sequence. The final image invokes the sanctuary but does not charge it with new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tracking station is described generically ("forgotten marvel," "obsolete instruments") without spatial choreography or concrete detail that constrains choice. Sensory work is abstract ("whispered," "gentle hum") and never grounds the body in space. The yellow lantern glass appears as a symbolic prop without tactile handling or physical properties that alter action. Micro-setting could function here but the glass and observation dome remain postcard elements rather than pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The beekeeping oasis, scorched wasteland, and "strange geometry" are vivid and anchor the premise early. Sensory selection is present (heat waves, blood-and-ash dusk, amber hives) and filtered through Elisha's reverence. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the oasis's protective geometry and the hives' physical layout do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The box is placed atop the central hive, and bees swarm around it, but this interaction remains atmospheric rather than mechanical—removing the hive's specific location would not break the ritual's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The emerald silo anchors location and supplies the alcove discovery, meeting minimal constraint. Sensory detail is selective (metallic sheen, cold air, dim lights) and filtered through Elias's curatorial attention. However, the silo's mechanics—how the "no shadow" clue works spatially—remain vague; the alcove materializes conveniently without prior setup. The urn fragment and journal function as micro-setting objects but do not evolve across beats. Cap applied per Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the poet's contemplative attention (petrichor, salt, cobalt lagoon, damp sand). The feather and string function as micro-setting objects and constrain one mid-story choice (the weaving). However, the final third abandons physical grounding for summary reflection, and the sculpture on the rock never pressures a subsequent choice. The lagoon remains postcard backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The temple orchard, oaks, stone pillars, and copper wire anchor setting vividly and recur across beats. The wire and pillars constrain Kaelen's method (wrapping branches to specific carvings), and the final image—glowing wire, leaning pillars—charges closure. Deduction: spatial choreography remains general (we never track his path between specific monoliths), and the "unknown civilization" backstory is exposition without POV filter. The setting does one job well—symbolic resonance—but does not pressure a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed tower, weathered statues, and crumbled roof supply vivid spatial anchors that guide the ascent and frame the pedestal moment. The fly amber functions as a micro-object that charges the ending when it pulses and vanishes. Sensory detail (bronze quiet, rain, moss, metallic scent) is consistent and purposeful. The setting directly enables the closure act—pedestal, converging footprints, gaping sky—lifting this above mere backdrop and reaching the 7+ band through clear constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The blooming jetty, spectral horses, and luminescent roots supply vivid, selective detail filtered through a ceremonial tone. The jetty's weathered planks and sea flowers anchor the ritual spatially, and the seeds finding "crevices where hope might take root" tie setting to action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift; it serves as backdrop to predetermined ceremony, preventing 9-band eligibility per the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scrapyard setting is vivid and anchored with specific details (metal mountains, salvaged tech, twin moons). The wax leaf and phonograph cylinder function as tactile anchors that constrain Elias's method. The "thermal function he'd jury-rigged" and the special plate show setting shaping tactics. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the workshop sequence, and the wasteland's sensory details (dust, decay, cracked earth) filter through Elias's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The time dilation observation deck constrains and charges the final image: its "temporally stretched" nature enables the ghost-sky overlay, and the deck's oppressive silence modulates from tomb-like to "alive with potential." The compass rose and parchment function as micro-setting elements that anchor Elias's ritual and discovery. Spatial choreography (window, console, deck) remains clear. The phantom constellation's angle and brightness details demonstrate selective, purpose-driven description filtered through Elias's cartographer lens, though occupational depth is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound spire, wrong-colored sky, and skylight entry create vivid, specific anchors early. Spatial choreography through the workshop and chess table is clean. The sky resetting to "rightful blues and golds" at closure charges the final image with environmental consequence. However, the workshop's "labyrinth of wonders" remains generic postcard description; no tool or micro-environment constrains Kaelen's choices during the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering gallery amplifies footsteps and breathing, creating sensory texture that supports the reflective tone. The chessboard without pawns is handled (she kneels, traces empty squares) and charges the final metaphor of "luminous absence." Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single location. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or shift tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that pressures Elara's documentary mission.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore supplies vivid sensory fragments ("scent of aged paper mixed with something metallic," "shadows thick as velvet") and the mountain setting frames the action consistently. The mirror, stone, and feather anchor repeated beats and the bookstore's rearranging corridors provide light world-logic pressure. However, spatial choreography within the bookstore remains generic (vaults, levels, spire room) without specific passages or thresholds that constrain her search or practice, and the environment never forces a choice with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The time-frozen village, cobblestones, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry anchor space vividly. The shifting grid of platforms and luminescent light create a distinct environment that constrains movement choices. The labyrinth's "ruthless logic" and the final platinum chessboard charge the closure image directly. Sensory detail (metallic air, refracted rainbows, rain on cobblestones) is filtered through the tutor's chess-tuned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers and mist-shrouded canyon are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail. Setting constrains movement (climbing the highest tower) and amplifies both sound and emotion, directly shaping Elaran's method. The pale spire evolves from sketch subject to containment device to crumbling structure, charging the final image with spatial consequence. Minor weakness: the "hidden studio" and settlement appear late without prior spatial grounding, briefly disorienting the reader before the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    The acid sea, floating workshop, gears-and-cogs machinery, and the statue's pockmarked surface are vividly rendered and consistently present. The acidic water threatening the hull creates spatial pressure, and the key ring charm as micro-setting object recurs across beats. However, the workshop's spatial choreography during the wave-crash remains vague—how does he "clutch the statue tightly" while submerged yet continue his work? The gears and mechanisms hum in harmony at the end, but this evolution feels decorative rather than a constraint that shaped a choice. Sensory detail is strong but doesn't narrow options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.7)
    The quay, cliffs, and coastal cave network are vividly rendered with phosphorescent moss, tide pools, and sea-to-earth scent shifts. Spatial choreography is coherent through the descent and cave sequence. The tide pool functions as micro-setting that constrains the shell's release and charges the final act, satisfying the 9+ gate test. However, the studio mirror is introduced only in retrospective summary, weakening its presence as a recurring anchor. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the painter's attention (bristles, salt, damp earth), and the cave's "quiet energy" and "droplets like tiny metronomes" avoid generic postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse, spiral stairs, and narrow balcony supply vivid spatial anchors, and the phantom garden scent charges the final sequence with purposeful atmospheric contrast. The cork's rough-hewn texture and the salt-stashed rock create micro-setting that supports the protagonist's ritual focus. The setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost—the balcony and wind enable rather than complicate—but it charges the closure image strongly enough to enter the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The signal station is vividly anchored (failed hydraulics, dusty glass, cold floor, rotary phone) and the censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining the map ritual and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the navigator's grief-laden attention. The station's silence and the moon's phases subtly guide the ritual's tempo, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint and closure linkage, but pervasive abstract phrasing ("geography of loss," "tomb of static") slightly dilutes spatial immediacy at peak moments, capping the score just below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    The hanging orchard over a storm-battered ravine is vivid and specific, introduced early and sustained through sensory detail (swaying containers, damp earth, lightning, thunder). Spatial choreography is clear (descent, oldest tree, path above). The environment constrains Elara's choice by isolating her and timing the decision to the storm's return, and the ravine's precariousness mirrors her psychological exposure. However, the setting's direct tactical impact is modest—Elara could activate the relic anywhere; the orchard functions more as atmospheric backdrop than physical crucible. Truffle-foraging detail is minimal and doesn't meaningfully shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with purposeful atmospheric detail. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The glass case and logbook function as micro-setting elements that enable investigation. The Edelweiss constrains Hemlock's final choice to place flowers nightly, charging the closure image. Economy is strong; sensory selection reflects the reflective pace without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shop, creek, cavern, and bioluminescent fungi are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (night-blooming jasmine, ivy curtain, pulsing walls). The matrix chip and map constrain the final action: pressing the chip opens the doorway, and finding his map changes his stance. Spatial choreography is clear (shop → steps → creek → ivy-hidden entrance → crevice → room of maps). The "blooming cavern at midsummer" setting charges the ending by providing the literal and symbolic space for Elias's realization, though the creek's rising pressure is mentioned but not causally integrated into his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt grotto, ember patterns, and crystallized starlight provide vivid sensory anchors, and the ridge climb offers spatial progression with mist, rain, and fireflies that modulate atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no tool, terrain feature, or physical constraint forces a tactical choice or alters the queen's options during ascent or inside the grotto. The fireflies appear as symbolic recurrence without constraining action, and the embers "flare and die in patterns forming words she could almost read" but never compel a decision. Solid description but decorative rather than pressure-driving.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember nexus supplies vivid imagery ("last light of day bled into the earth's molten veins") and the nautilus columella is handled on the page, but neither constrains Elara's choices—she could perform her light-weaving anywhere. The pocket-sun's warmth and the nexus's flicker create atmosphere but don't alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is vague; we never learn how close Kael stands or what physical actions Elara's hands perform beyond "practiced" and "guided."

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain cabin anchors throughout; wind, cold breath, and bruised-purple dusk are woven into Elias's emotional state without postcard excess. The birch bark scroll returns with reweighted meaning at closure, and the physical act of stepping into darkness charges the final image. Spatial choreography (table, door, mountain darkness) remains coherent and the setting's isolation mirrors his existential solitude, constraining social escape and forcing introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The water clock shop is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—mist, dripping water, grime-streaked windows—and the loupe functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout and the fog's lifting mirrors the emotional arc without overt symbolism. The screw's physical texture (worn threads, dimpled metal) charges the final recognition, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock platform, tea mat, and enchanted lanterns establish a vivid micro-setting that directly constrains action: Aeris writes on the platform itself, and the storm's arrival marks the ritual's completion. The crystallization imagery is grounded in specific physical detail—"delicate, almost clear lattice," "milky stone"—and the quill's transformation (midnight gloss to river-stone grey) charges the ending. Sensory detail is filtered through Aeris's perception (pressure in the air, warmth of the quill, cold water of the storm) and modulates with urgency. The environment evolves causally: tea cools, storm gathers, crystal softens, establishing a lived-in progression.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sheet music archive is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("fine dust," "dissonant chorus"). The perfume bottle is described but not used as a spatial constraint—it could sit on any shelf. The orchard frame is mentioned twice but never affects Eloise's choices or the ending image. Micro-setting (the bottle, the oscillator) functions adequately but doesn't charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "ancient temple library" functions as evocative backdrop but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Columns spiral, corridors contract and expand, yet these shifts remain decorative; no spatial logic or tool affects the protagonist's path. The softcover dictionary glows and levitates but its physical properties don't enable or block an action with stakes. Sensory detail is selective but filtered through abstract philosophical register rather than urgent perception.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fjord, station console, and hydraulic clocks are anchored early and consistently. The glass-faced clock with blue fluids and the leather pouch contribute tactile detail. The setting constrains Elias's attention (he must observe the clocks, adjust with the key) and the counting-backwards method ties him to the instruments' behavior. The final image—long shadows across the fjord, hydraulic clocks as boundary markers—charges the closure by making the environment conceptually active in his epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rainwashed library, mica-pane lantern, and subway seats anchor the journey with sensory specificity (ozone, rain streaks, violin notes), and the lantern returns at closure to "cast a warm light on his face." However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara moves freely from train to library without spatial friction, and the lantern remains symbolic rather than functional. The recurring light motif charges the final image modestly, lifting the score into the 6-band, but the setting itself does not pressure decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tunnel setting is vivid and specific (rust, ozone, glass staircase, dripping acoustics), and the glass harmonica disc functions as a charged recurring object. However, the environment remains decorative; it does not constrain a single on-page choice. The micro-setting (the booth, the disc) is poised to pressure action but never does—Archie traces patterns during calls, yet no consequence or tactical shift results. Spatial choreography is coherent but static, limiting the setting's participation in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming jetty is vividly established with luminous flowers and moonlight, and the conservatory with its walnut-ink jars provides concrete setting detail. The jetty's peak bloom timing constrains the anniversary ritual, and the single large flower at Melina's vanishing spot charges the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the conservatory remains generic (shelves, windows) without tactile interaction, and the body/tool axis (walnut-ink, brush) is mentioned but not shown constraining a choice during the documentation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The railway station is vivid (ivy, rust, damp earth, brass plaque) and the cupola's sensory symphony directly shapes the closure choice—Orion's realization hinges on hearing "the rustle of the ivy on the walls, the distant city hum, the frantic beating of his own heart." The moon rock functions as micro-setting (tactile object carried and exchanged). Spatial choreography is clear (platform → ladder → cupola). The brass plaque's revealed word "Listen" supplies a concrete cue that tilts Orion's stance, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge. Minor: the station's overgrowth is described more than used tactically in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful: pulsing bark, tremor-speech ground, shifting tree-hum all filter through Kael's sensory hierarchy and the environment narrows as he approaches the stillpoint. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting, absorbing vibration and feeding warmth; its coolness at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography (forest floor yielding, trees bowing) stays coherent, and the forest's acoustic texture constrains his dowsing method throughout. One minor slip: "across the pause of shifting constellations" recurs as poetic frame but never constrains an on-page tactic or alters a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.9)
    The desk, pen, crystal page, and warped skyline are vivid anchors. The gravitational anomaly functions as atmospheric constraint (tilts the floor, pulls signals off-course) and charges the final image when it "hums in agreement." Sensory detail is selective but filtered through concept rather than body: "faint hum," "nib glowed softly," "anomaly shuddered." Spatial choreography is loose—window, desk, and anomaly positions shift vaguely. The exotic nib and "residue of a forgotten signal" offer texture but remain ornamental; their properties don't constrain a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moonlit harbor is vivid and sustained throughout, grounding every beat. Sensory detail (ripple, seam of silver, lapping waves, ship horns) filters consistently through the lyric POV. The lighthouse appears as backdrop but doesn't constrain a choice. The camera's mechanical click and Lyra's gestures are handled tactilely across multiple beats, meeting the micro-setting allowance. Strong atmosphere, but environment remains postcard-descriptive rather than pressuring action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archive is vividly sketched ("dust and forgotten ink," wax-sealed scrolls) and the cave behind a waterfall provides spatial grounding. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—none of the locations pressure her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The body and tools (paints, linen) are mentioned but do not constrain a key choice or charge the closure image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "sound wave garden" is evocative but remains abstract; crystalline stalks hum and sway, yet no spatial layout, access constraint, or physical limit shapes Kael's choices. The "auric lagoon" exists only in memory and provides atmospheric color without grounding the present scene. Micro-setting (the body, the stalks) is present but does not constrain action—Kael's drumming succeeds on first attempt. The ending invokes the garden's "waves" and "auroras," charging the final image modestly, but the setting never pressures a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with corrugated sides, storm energy, and metallic acoustics that directly enable the whisper test. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the junction and chamber. The key's "disguised seam" and the chamber's humming walls provide tactile grounding. However, the geomagnetic storm functions mostly as atmospheric decoration—static crackling and whipping hair—without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The zodiac coin's glow and the storm's "feverish pulse" resonate but don't shape the outcome, capping the band below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cobalt dock, wet boards, canal district, and shutters along the east bank provide spatial grounding. The dental mirror constrains one micro-choice (verifying angles), lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail leans visual ("cobalt," "scattered memories," "gleaming shapes") with minimal tactile or auditory texture. The shutters appear in multiple beats but their physical mechanics remain vague—how many, exact placement, how light travels through slats—limiting the environment's pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and mist-curled columns supply vivid atmospheric anchors, but spatial choreography across multiple locations (library, grotto, bakery, observatory) remains impressionistic rather than concretely tracked. The grotto's "unique geological properties" are described but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Arthur's tactics. Sensory detail is lush but often ornamental—"starlight filtered through cracks... like scattered silver coins"—without pressing against the dominant stake in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sublittoral fringe and coral reef glow anchor the opening; water texture recurs across beats. The disappearing island is visually evocative but remains postcard-like—sand, single tree, whalebone charms—without constraining her choice or altering tactics. The scrimshaw's surface and glow are mentioned repeatedly, yet its physical properties (weight, curve, temperature) do not shape a single action. The dock reappears at the end but her movements there are described identically to the opening, offering no environmental evolution or spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The farmhouse-and-turbines frame is signaled early and the turbines' "hollow synchrony" and "mechanical breath" provide atmospheric pressure that mirrors the Mandate's regulation. The kitchen table, whittling shavings, and floorboards hiding the bouquet create micro-setting that constrains Elara's defiance spatially. However, the wind turbines function primarily as backdrop metaphor rather than constraining a tactical choice at closure—they hum constantly but do not alter Elara's final action. The sensory palette (birch shavings, dried petals, tea-kettle steam) is concrete and purposeful, anchored in the POV's ritual focus.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid, purposeful sensory detail anchors each location: "polished obsidian," "lantern-moth hush," "humming quartz colonnade." The frozen lake and colonnade constrain Kael's approach and dissolution method, shaping the mid-scene turn. The cobalt atrium charges the final passage, where "colors shifting in ways his eyes could no longer fully process" reflects transformation. Spatial choreography is clear across lake edge, pillars, and interior vault, satisfying the micro-setting and constraint tests for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glassblower's courtyard is anchored early (kaleidoscope light, stone bench, Lyra's workbench) and the concertina reed resting on velvet cloth grounds the barter scene. The reed's tactile hum and the studio's worn wood easel charge the awakening moment. The phoenix's ascension shapes world rules (old things gain new properties) but remains backstory; the courtyard itself does not constrain Leo's choices during the barter negotiation as much as frame them.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with golden shadows, glass shelves, and tuning forks labeled by date. The carbide lamp lens functions as a recurring object that bends light and charges the final image, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the lab's response (shelves humming, instruments shivering) integrates setting into action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with cost—it amplifies mood without forcing a tradeoff—which caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory's brass dome, celestial maps, and telescope create atmospheric specificity, and the "curtains of intention" supply a metaphysical constraint. However, the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical pressure—no choice hinges on spatial access, proximity, or environmental constraint. The timeless quality insulates characters from urgency rather than sharpening it. The mourning jewelry and origami figures gain tactile presence through handling, elevating micro-setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    The loft setting is anchored through concrete details: skylight, rain, wooden table, onyx ink. The measuring tape recurs across multiple beats, and the rain-beaded skylight frames both the opening and closing, providing visual rhythm. However, the environment doesn't constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics—she works uninterrupted, and Chen's arrival introduces no spatial friction. The setting remains descriptive rather than pressure-generating; the skylight and rain function as atmosphere, not as elements that force decisions or charge the final image with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bronze prism pagoda and underground chamber anchor space consistently. Sensory detail leans visual and generic ("fractured light," "shimmer and shift") without POV filter or tactical constraint. The archive supplies no resource scarcity, access puzzle, or environmental pressure that narrows her choices. Micro-setting allowance: the pagoda's alignment shafts trigger the ritual, a functional beat that lifts the score modestly, but the structure never resists or complicates her work.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The blooming library above clouds supplies vivid, specific details (crystalline window, breathing shelves, cloud-void) that anchor the reader and constrain Elara's world. The river stone's velvet-lined box and the viewing chamber provide micro-setting that shapes her method. However, the floating gardens and shadow-drift mechanics remain decorative—they do not alter a tactical choice or close off an option. The final sanctuary and "shadow gardens" are named but not experienced, reducing their closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The misty workshop under stars is established early and recurs purposefully; the chameleon's tail tip changes color as a micro-setting object that tracks Maria's process. Spatial choreography (workbench, door, stool) is clear. Sensory detail (shimmering stillness, celestial canopy, night mist) supports tone. However, the workshop does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure, preventing high-band entry despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower at dawn, coffee rings, and frosted hourglass supply concrete anchors and the plants become a functional micro-setting that constrains Maya's perception. Sensory detail is selective (silver sand, rustling fern, meteor hush) and the final image reuses the hourglass with thematic charge. The apology visit to Samuel lacks spatial grounding—no description of his environment or the drive's landmarks—but the tower frame holds coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    The projection booth is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (scent of aged film and ozone, hushed thunder). The film strip constrains the gazer's method and returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects his psychometric focus. The setting pressures his method but does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, keeping it just below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe receive vivid sensory treatment, and "stardust" recurs as a physical residue. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: the archway's mechanics, the cold, and spatial choreography do not shape Elara's choices or tactics. The astrolabe is handled across beats but its operation remains generic; no environmental detail narrows options or charges the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune with luminescent crystals grounds the scene and the seedling's "crystal-veined leaf" ties micro-setting to closure. Sensory detail is vivid ("ravenous sky," "perpetual twilight," "acidic soil") and filtered through the guard's duty-focused perception. The archive's shimmering edges and the chess clock materializing in hand create a coherent speculative texture. However, spatial choreography of the archive itself (does he enter? move through corridors? or observe from outside?) remains abstract; "no physical entrance, yet occasionally everywhere" reads as lyric evasion rather than embodied navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and specific—brass vines, copper trunks, aluminum birch, iron oak—and the gear functions as a micro-setting object handled across beats. The convergence of seven tree varieties constrains Elian's final choice of location, and the small gear's surface and teeth are tactile anchors. However, much description remains postcard ("calculated life," "harmony that only those with awakened perception could truly appreciate") rather than filtered through urgent need. The gear charges the final image but does not demonstrably alter tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.1)
    Spatial choreography is vague—"veiled ridgeway," "overlapping horizons," "mist-laden path"—generic placeholders that never ground who stands where or how far they travel. The mirror pool at the end appears without setup and does not constrain the traveler's choice. Sensory detail defaults to visual abstraction (glow, veil, mist) without touch, smell, or lived-in particulars. The body and tools (ticket, satchel) are mentioned but never used to alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and spiral staircase are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (faint thrum of machines, crunch of snow, air thin enough to taste). The piano bench bolt constrains the middle beat—its discovery and use as key—meeting the micro-setting/object gate for 9+ eligibility. However, the setting does not pressure the final choice; the bellhop's resolve to remain is internal, unaffected by environmental constraint at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient library is vivid and specific: tilted shelves, dust motes, starlight through the dome, ceramic dish, reed brush. The ink pellet is handled in two distinct beats (preparation, final flick) and its physical state (dissolving, pulsing) alters with the narrative arc. The library's "graceful collapse" and "temporal eddy" constrain Kael's options (he cannot leave, can only work through books), and the dome's constellations mark time. Setting charges the closure image when the library "began to stabilize" after the pretender's fall, linking environment to thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sea level monitoring station functions as both literal workspace and thematic anchor; its creaking, rusted frame, and periodic data cycles ground the piece in tactile specificity. The atlas page and console constrain Elias's search—he cannot leave, he must work the data—and the station's isolation charges his final departure. Sensory detail (salt air, metal groaning, tide pulling at ankles) is filtered through Elias's scientist perspective and modulates with his emotional state. The station's "eternally periodic pulse" recurs meaningfully at closure, reweighting the opening image. Micro-setting (the torn page, the console) alters his understanding and thus his final action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered with selective detail (grimy skylights, scorched tools, ozone scent, cracked concrete) that grounds the protagonist's movement. The stone circle embedded in concrete supplies a tactile focal point (glyphs, vibrations) that the protagonist handles and kneels before, charging the final image when she places her palms flat and feels the hum ripple through her. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting's desolation mirrors her internal lull, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The volcanic hot springs supply vivid sensory anchors (geothermal vents, steam, ancient ferns, boiling calderas) and the setting shapes Maeva's path. The amber's placement in the deepest spring creates a spatial challenge, though the descent itself is compressed. The hot springs constrain the final action (unsealing underwater) and the environment charges the closure image with new hybrid species sprouting. Scope fits; setting does purposeful work at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arboretum, cliff edge, greenhouse, and lighthouse are spatially coherent and textured with salt-laced wind, turquoise-to-amethyst sea, and plants that "refuse to surrender." The garden constrains Maya's choices—tending plants becomes the language for grief—and charges the final image when she places succulents beside the photograph. The sea thrift's roots gripping rock directly mirrors her endurance, shaping the transcendent moment. Sensory selection is consistent and filtered through her botanical focus, meeting the 9+ gate (environment charges closure).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The forgotten library inside the lighthouse provides vivid atmospheric anchoring ("shelves of waterlogged books sagging," "Filterless light," "salt and time"). The tarot box and cards function as micro-setting objects that the artist handles across multiple beats, constraining his physical and symbolic reconstruction. However, the environment does not meaningfully alter tactics or impose a spatial constraint on the final choice; the library "opened, into a world he had made anew" without resistance. The setting charges mood but does not shape the closure decision with material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The wind-carved encampment, eastern ridge, and scorched earth provide spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective ("dust-coated tents," "sandstone shards," "wind picked up") and filtered through Kael's tracker focus. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the vial and ink are found half-buried but their discovery does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics—he kneels, uncorks, observes. The final image of shadows and wind-carved walls supports tone but does not charge the closure with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "echoing library under snow" is vividly rendered with frost-coated shelves, blue emergency lighting, and dormant servers; sensory detail is purposeful and atmospheric. Snow recurs throughout and bookends the piece, creating textural coherence. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she moves through it unopposed, and the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The final image of snow blanketing fires is poetic but ornamental; the library itself becomes a symbol rather than a space that shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass-domed rose farm and desert setting are vivid and specific, with sensory detail (scent of soil, wind against glass, glowing roses). The sandbag scrap and knife are handled as symbolic anchors but don't constrain a present choice. Spatial choreography within the dome is functional but remains a backdrop rather than a pressure element that alters tactics or charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (humming air flowers, vibrating petals, oppressive silence) and constrains the fisher's method—he must carve voids through the symphonic air. The sleepwalking constellations and the rail spike's materiality charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous scene, and the setting's hum-and-silence interplay directly enables the ritual's success.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory setting is vivid and specific (brass celestial sphere, rosewood desk, dome's external platform, hidden maintenance route), and the space provides the hidden star chart that advances the plot. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop and clue repository rather than constraining Elara's choices in the present moment. The setting does not pressure her decision at closure; she could reach the same conclusion in any location with the same documents.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly anchored with antique cabinets, resonance equipment, and the grandmother's desk, and these objects recur throughout. The amber on the examination table constrains the climactic beat (Orion touches device to amber, triggering the memory translation). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (whiskey-burning static, spidery script, meteor hush), filtered through Orion's professional lens. The micro-setting (amber, desk, tattoo equipment) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or shape closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto is vividly established with sensory detail (misty air, damp environment, curved surfaces, ethereal rhythms) filtered through Elara's artistic perception, and the emergent hush alters the grotto's nature as a recurring constraint that shapes her actions. The tile flake's physical presence (sparkled sheen, warmth, vibration) functions as micro-setting, anchoring tactile interaction across multiple beats. The grotto's whispering-gallery acoustics inform her mandala's circular formations, and the environment directly charges the closure image when the hush "shifts around her like a living thing." The setting exceeds postcard description and supplies resources that affect outcome, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, skeletal walls, and defiant minaret anchor a vivid post-apocalyptic setting. The mosaic stepping stone and tessera constrain Elara's physical action (tracing, fitting, pressing) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("warm coldness," "tessera's jagged edges") and filtered through POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (mosaic, tessera, stone void) directly shapes the ritual action and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mystic orchard garden with silver bark and blue leaves offers vivid, purposeful detail that anchors Arthur's synesthetic experience. Spatial choreography between auditorium, backstage, and garden is clear. The tarot coin's physical presence (warm in his palm, oil paint that never dries) is concretely rendered and constrains his final choice to leave it. The setting charges the closure image—Arthur returns to the stage and sees restoration plans—though the orchard itself does not reappear in that final beat, slightly weakening the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The light painting studio is vividly anchored with LED strips, prisms, adjustable arms, and the muscovite sliver at center; spatial choreography is clear throughout her movement. Sensory detail (diffuse glow, color bleeding, fractally precise rainbows) is selective and filtered through Elara's artistic POV. The studio enables her method (light painting) and the final image (crystalline rainbows), charging the closure, which pushes the score into the 7+ band despite the lack of constraint—nothing in the environment forces a trade-off or narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    The coastal cave network is vividly established with sensory anchors—"damp limestone," "brackish water," "walls narrowing"—and the tidal pool and chamber provide concrete spatial progression. The elm leaf fossil and spiral shell are handled on the page and guide Elara's deeper movement, linking micro-setting objects to choice. However, the caves themselves do not meaningfully constrain tactics; Elara encounters no obstacle, only invitation, so the environment functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a pressure that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.8)
    The amber warehouse and canyon echo jar are vividly described and anchored early, and the tactile handling of buttons (star-shaped, blacksmith's thumb imprint) adds lived-in texture. However, the space functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no door locks, no shelf collapse, no spatial limitation alters her approach. The hourglass ticking and "sand a relentless descent" offer urgency labels but never force a triage choice; she completes the cataloging without friction from the environment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Zephyr Bluff, mist, frozen ground, and the snow-covered plateau are vividly rendered with consistent atmospheric detail. The pillbox's engraving and the stamped cipher in snow supply tactile specificity. The environment enables the message-creation choice (wide plateau, wind that will erase the code) and charges the final image (mist swallowing his form). Spatial choreography is clear across the bluff and plateau. The constraint of ephemeral snow as medium directly shapes his method, meeting the gate for choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Fog, river, and rain gutters establish atmosphere and the gutters function as a timed constraint (waiting until they stop ticking). The boat midstream and the figure's arrival provide spatial choreography. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive in key beats—"shades of gray," "canvas," "spindrift"—without constraining a micro-choice or altering tactics. The yarn needle anchors as micro-setting object but its presence is more symbolic than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The beekeeping oasis—hives, crystallized honey, frozen bee, stone chimney, keeper's cottage—grounds the investigation with vivid, purpose-driven detail. The faded lantern glass functions as both tool and recurring object, constraining Kael's perception (he must use it to see fractures) and charging the final act. The chimney smoke as timeframe is a strong micro-setting beat: Kael waits for it to flatten, creating a visual plane that reveals the anomaly's core. Spatial choreography is clear (wasteland → apiary → cottage → chimney → nexus point), and the setting's contradiction (life amid scorched earth) directly embodies the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    The luminous harbor and fire escape provide vivid spatial grounding, and the bitting gauge tooth becomes a tactile anchor across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—mirrors could be adjusted with any fine tool, and the fire escape functions as backdrop rather than pressure point. Sensory detail is selective (moonlight, rusty metal, pink-orange dawn) but does not narrow the gardener's options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tidal library and brass sundial are vivid as images but function as postcard description rather than constraint. The sundial is handled twice, but neither touch alters a choice—it reflects her state without shaping tactics. The floating library's tidal nature is asserted metaphorically but never pressures movement or access. Sensory hierarchy is absent; the narration offers visual tableaux without embodied perception filtered through urgency or professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-rain sensory details (ozone, damp earth, prismatic light) are vivid and selective. The sculpture "The Rejoin" functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's path ("his path dictated not by the designated floor arrows but by the shape in his palm"). Spatial choreography is clear: pond edge, meadow, sculpture interior. The nest twig, though small, acts as a tactile anchor that charges the final movement, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion (object constrains choice and charges closure). Minor penalty: the meadow/installation transition feels slightly abrupt, and the "adjoining meadow" anchor could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.1)
    The university radio station and astronomical charts provide functional setting anchors, and the control room is introduced early with selective detail (headphones, dim glow, charts). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara uses the facility without friction, and the subsonic generator appears as a convenient solution rather than a spatially embedded resource. The setting remains backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "star-dusted darkness" offer atmospheric labels but no spatial choreography—walls shimmer and "breathe" without clear positions or distances. Sensory detail skews heavily visual and abstract (prismatic shards, captured auroras) with minimal tactile or auditory grounding beyond the organ's "reverberation." The compass point and floor coordinates could anchor micro-setting choices, but the explorer's movements and the nexus geometry remain vague throughout the procedure, weakening any constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quarry is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail—"stone lips parted by mist," "water's glassy surface," cold seeping through gloves—and the mist functions as both atmosphere and a recurring image that charges the final moment ("mist seemed to thin...exhaling"). The ribbon fragment constrains his method, pinned at the corner as he sketches, grounding the abstract work in physical particulars. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (kneeling by dark earth, spreading paper on flat rock, walking away). The quarry's specificity (abandoned, pooled with rainwater, jagged cliffs) shapes the tone and final image rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.6)
    The weather station and copper nail are named and present, but setting details are largely atmospheric window-dressing ("spongey dread," "flickering emergency lights") rather than constraints that shape Elias's tactics. The nail slot and console mechanics appear functional but are not grounded in sensory specificity—no texture, weight, or spatial choreography that would charge the act of insertion. The shifting horizon in "geometric patterns" gestures at the uncanny but remains visually abstract, and the station's "monument to bravery" conclusion is thematic summary rather than lived environment.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.3)
    The mountain pullout, old stone bridge, and construction site scaffold appear but function as interchangeable backdrops rather than constraints that shape Elara's tactics. The scaffold wrap is discovered on "the third day" and decoded "for hours," yet no physical detail—wind direction, scaffold height, visibility angle—alters her approach. The wet-plate glass flake returns in the night examination and final moon scene, shifting from relic to musical resonator, which charges the closure image moderately. The Q2 Orientation Test penalty was applied; Q3 remains capped at 7.0 per the waiver consequence rule.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The circus train setting is vivid and specific ("iron elephants and carved horses...petrified beneath decades of rust," "rooms that...felt more like home"), and the foreign money functions as micro-setting that constrains curious teenagers. Spatial choreography is clean across the train cars and startup office. However, the setting does not pressure a key choice at closure—Jasper's sanctuary remains unchanged, a backdrop rather than an active constraint in the final beat. The glass-and-steel office contrasts effectively but lacks tactile engagement during the pivotal board meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Observatory anchors early with brass fittings, telescope, western window, star charts. The daylily telegram and star charts appear multiple times and charge the ending image slightly. However, the environment does not constrain a choice; Elara and Whitmore could have this conversation anywhere. Sensory detail (moonlight, dim light, sunrise) remains decorative rather than pressuring tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "cursed lake" and "orchard vortex" are vividly described with purposeful sensory detail ("cold seeping into his bones," "warlike serenity"). The flesh-eating plant seed's warmth and glow anchor micro-setting tactility. However, spatial choreography remains generic; the vortex does not constrain a specific choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it simply disappears at closure. The environment decorates rather than pressures, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt glade, crag-bound oak, and jagged bark constrain the passage ritual concretely: the clipping must fit a groove, the scar must align with a fissure. Sensory detail (ozone, wet earth, "blue and the absence of blue") is selective and purposeful. The perpetual eclipse and the single piercing point of silver light charge the final image directly. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the journey and return. The nexus as "a landscape of shifting logic where emotions took physical shape" verges on abstract catalog but remains tethered to the two mirroring figures.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific: roots that pulse with dim light, bones cradling roots, the natural altar of twisted roots. The star-shaped fruit charges the final image by literalizing the burned Star card. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (damp earth, forgotten perfumes, warm fruit skin). The setting constrains Elian's ritual choreography and supplies the fruit that completes his arc, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quarry trailer is vivid and purposeful: dust, stale coffee, vibrating walls from dynamite provide sensory anchors filtered through Leo's roadie past. The grille-cloth scrap is handled twice (discovery, then pocketed at closure) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (tablet on desk, scrap beside it, Leo locking the door) tracks cleanly. Micro-setting (the scrap, the trailer, the echo valley outside) constrains the reflective choice and supports the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered with specific details (metallic leaves, zero-gravity roots, ninety-thousand feet altitude) that establish atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics during the breakthrough moment. The seed's containment field and soil matrix are mentioned but their properties do not pressure Maris's decisions. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tidal atrium, titan-gears, and smelting station are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (wintersun light, metallic surfaces, water's rhythm). However, the setting functions purely as backdrop—none of these environmental details constrain a choice or charge the final image. The bamboo creel returns at the end but as a static object placed by a door, not one that alters tactics or reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the world rules remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered with refracting light and pulsing radiance, and the pearl's glow creates atmospheric specificity. However, the bunker interiors lack spatial grounding—the "central chamber" and "connecting chambers" remain generic. The caves do not constrain Elias's choices; he moves through them "with practiced caution" but no environmental pressure shapes his decision to take the pearl. The final image invokes the caves' "latent radiance" as thematic echo rather than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The station's ivy, rusted rails, graffiti, and river are vivid and purposeful. The accordion bellows functions as micro-setting, its tape and weight grounding Elias's tactile world. Spatial choreography is clean (tracks, bathroom, river's edge, ivy-clad beams). The environment charges the final image: he tosses the bellows into the water, the station fades behind him, and he turns south—setting constrains the symbolic geography of north (bad waters) versus south (calm).

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing library and mist are vivid but remain postcard description; shelves, stairways, and chairs are catalogued without constraining a choice. The confidence man's watch functions as a prop whose backward ticking and warmth are described but do not limit or enable a tactic that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is unclear—no anchor for where the archway stands or how propagation delays manifest physically. The micro-setting allowance is not met: the watch and veil are mentioned but neither shapes a live decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    The velvet observatory, botanical garden, and crystalline violin constrain one key choice: Clementine uses the greenhouse to verify the violin's history through plant telepathy, and the blooming flowers signal her broadcast thought. Sensory detail is vivid (indigo dome, starlight refraction, mulberry taste) but largely ornamental; the setting provides atmosphere more than tactical pressure. The observatory clock at eleven creates urgency, yet spatial choreography in the final beat (Clementine's departure route, the Agent's entry point) remains vague. The micro-setting (violin on velvet cushions, coffee cup beside a string) charges the final image modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (obsidian slab, "radiant hush," shimmering curtain). The emerald chip's physical properties (facets scattering light) charge the final moment when it glows. The setting does not constrain a choice (no resource scarcity, no spatial obstacle), but the aurora's flare in the penultimate beat and the grotto's sigh add atmospheric weight to the closure image, meeting the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The umbral grotto, crystalline floor, cloud-filtered light, and Great Sentinel are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail. The setting anchors the caretaker's ritual and provides spatial clarity (grotto floor to two hundred feet up to rebirth pool). The environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The antique hairpin and rebirth pool are handled on the page and return, but their presence charges mood rather than driving action, keeping the score in the mid-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse spire, chimes, and hollow mirror shard constrain the method and charge the ending image when Elian decides to hang the shard among the chimes. Sensory detail is selective and integrated: "misting breath," "breaking glass" voice, wind circulating the spire. The campfire below serves as temporal anchor. Micro-setting (the shard, the chime apparatus) alters tactics and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for constraint and final image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, and pond are vividly established and return at closure when Elara stands in the water. The starlight-infused grooves and magnetic hum supply atmospheric texture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Elara could vanish anywhere. Spatial choreography is clear, sensory detail selective, but the environment remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: "towers of bone" amplify wind into sighs, dust holds history, and spatial choreography remains coherent. Micro-setting elements—the arrowhead, skipping stone, Kael's perch—constrain perception and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("the dust beneath his feet seemed to shimmer"), anchoring the abstract quest in concrete environment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire, clouds, and mist are vividly rendered with sensory detail (wind, cold, golden luminance). The keystone and railing are handled objects that ground action. The spire's height and automated systems below create spatial pressure, and the mist-walking sequence uses the environment to constrain movement. This clears the 9+ gate requirement (environment constrains a choice or charges the final image), supporting a score in the 7-range.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken library inside the wreck is vivid and pressure-functional: glass cases, tilted shelves, and waterlogged space constrain Orion's movements and shape the ritual beat. The sky lanterns serve dual purpose as cover and cosmic timer, directly affecting tactics. Micro-setting (diving gear, luminous rope guide) grounds the descent sequence with concrete anchors. The final image—seagulls as "streaks of amber and rose"—charges closure by transforming earlier sensory anchors, though the beach-glass dawn color feels ornamental rather than choice-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "ambered observatory deck" and "foreign coins" are vividly named and return across beats, charging the final image when coins become "part of the cosmic background." Spatial anchors (console, deck, singularity) remain consistent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice; Elara's actions would proceed identically in any observatory. Sensory detail leans visual and declarative ("thin atmosphere," "last starlight") without urgency-driven selection.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory's cracked bronze dome and scattered prisms actively shape the crystallization method, moving beyond postcard detail. Sensory selection—"lavender and rose" sky, "liquid amber" glow, cold air as monsters freeze—modulates with the ritual's pressure. The pedestal and falling light constrain where and how the reaper acts. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the final image of glowing monsters charges the setting with witness and promise.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sapphire viaduct is vivid and purposeful, its crystalline arches and "glassy surface" grounding the scene. The dried riverbed and smooth stones anchor loss economically. The viaduct's resonance at closure charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is selective without catalog excess, and the dawn light frames both opening and ending. Minor slip: "crisp air" and "fogging breath" are stock seasonal cues rather than POV-filtered particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridgeway, reservoir, and photographs create vivid spatial grounding with purposeful sensory detail (gravel grinding, water lapping, twilight deepening). The sapphire-hued label recurs across beats and charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—the warden's patrol proceeds unimpeded. Micro-setting (the photos, the flask) functions more as symbolic texture than as a tactical pressure point that alters his options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and laboratory carved into an ancient tree are vividly rendered and filter through Elara's alchemical lens. Spatial choreography is coherent across the workbench, flame, and starling observation. The flame and crystal constrain her preparation choices (heating without direct contact), and the waterfall's prismatic light charges the atmosphere at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nocturnal arbor, fog-sea canopy, and parachute harness are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (thin air, cold buckle, distant insect hum). However, setting remains largely atmospheric; the arbor does not constrain the leap or alter tactics. The parachute buckle appears repeatedly but functions as symbolic anchor rather than a tool that shapes choice. Spatial choreography is clear and the body is present, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    The floating rock dojo and collapsing timelines establish atmosphere, but the environment does not constrain Kael's choices—he could fight anywhere. The brain jar is handled twice (rattling the pedestal, slamming hands against it), yet its physical properties (glass, liquid, distance) never alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: the clone "lunges," Kael "sidesteps," but distances and body positions remain floating. The void and rewriting history read as conceptual backdrop rather than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tunnel is vivid ("wound in the earth," "concrete ribs," "thick with dust and the scent of damp earth") and the leaf blower becomes a charged tool. The "darkest patch of wall" where laughter is embedded provides spatial focus. The setting constrains his method—he must work in this specific echo chamber—and the final motes guide him through tunnel to house, so environment participates in closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his grief-honed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen garden, glass-rose, and mist are vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through Sylvan's foggy lucidity. The pendant's "tiny, captured vortex" functions as micro-setting, constraining his choice not to shatter it. Spatial choreography is minimal but legible. The setting charges the final image (ivy-draped rosebud, softened vortex) and the sensory hierarchy reflects the POV's priorities. However, the garden remains more symbolic stage than tactile constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember nexus is signaled early and returns in the final image, but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or supplying tactical resources. The crucible is handled across multiple beats, yet spatial choreography remains vague—no clear sense of room layout, distance, or how Elias physically manipulates fragments through five attempts. The "frozen bloom" image recurs but reads as decorative metaphor rather than environmental pressure that alters Elias's options.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tower city, gorge, and lunar perigee are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (latticework bones, wind as chorus, moonlight refracting through the fragment). The fragment itself—handled, placed in the resonance chamber, pocketed—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Elias at console, edge of gorge) and sensory hierarchy reflects his professional lens (copper glinting, static dissolving, crystalline hum). The environment constrains action (isolation, nighttime tuning window) and the fragment's warmth and facets enable the discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    The spectral grotto, starlight refraction, and crystalline walls are vivid and consistent. The empty hourglass returns at closure with a visual transformation (sand flowing both ways), charging the final image. Spatial choreography (deck, docks, cavern ceiling) remains clear throughout. However, the setting description occasionally stalls momentum ("prismatic patterns," "luminous walls") without shaping a tactical choice until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gallery's impossible geometry is vivid ("walls curved inward without bending"), and the sinew thread is handled across multiple beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Siran moves from stairway to corridor without clear transitions or distances. The setting pressures perception but does not visibly constrain a choice; he could perform the same actions in any surreal space. The thread qualifies as micro-setting and does charge the final image, lifting the score moderately.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The benthic city is vividly rendered with pressure seals, bioluminescent corals, and the Mariana Trench context, and these details filter through Elias's professional expertise (chief navigation instructor). The observation dome's holo-projector functions as micro-setting that enables the lesson, and the anchor chain link's metallic composition interacts with the projector to create the stellar simulation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, though the setting does not visibly constrain a choice at closure—the viewport corals resemble stars in a lyric parallel but do not alter Elias's tactics or options in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mist-clad atrium establishes atmospheric specificity and the "boundary between worlds thinning" anchors the premise. The hearing aid and amplification system function as micro-setting tools that constrain method. However, the music box's hidden compartment materializes late without prior spatial setup, and the documents resolve the mystery through summary rather than tactile discovery. The atrium's "reeling hush" shifts to "relief" in the final beat, a purposeful tonal reconfiguration that charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    The submerged facility is vividly anchored: "water that seemed somehow thicker," monitors frozen in 30-year loops, undersea cables "draped across the lab floor like electric serpents." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Eliza's perception. The gold fleck functions as micro-setting, constraining her path and charging the final image when it "blazed with sudden intensity." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The environment directly enables the phase-transition closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.7)
    The opal observatory under snow is established early with vivid visual detail ("crystalline doors," "captured dawn in the moonlight"). The porcelain shard is handled twice (held at entrance, tapped against desk to disrupt patterns), giving it tactile presence. Snow and ink serve as recurring sensory anchors that charge the atmosphere. The setting does not, however, constrain a key choice—Elias could perform the defragmentation ritual in any location without altering tactics or outcome. Spatial choreography is clear; the micro-setting (desk, ink, shard) has presence but remains ornamental rather than decisively shaping the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers and canyon are vivid, purposeful, and tactile—porous surfaces, grainy texture, hollows and ridges constrain Kaelen's method (pressing palms to translate texture). The diamond's light fractures into "liquid sound" that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: canyon entrance, tunnel, towers overhead. The micro-setting (bone texture, copper veins) functions as constraint and charges closure, satisfying the Q3 quick test. No orientation debt applied; setting serves pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underground garden with floating mushrooms is vivid and purposeful, constraining Elias's movements and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (damp earth, crushed mint, frost trails) and filtered through POV. The arrowhead's tactile sharpness and the phone's metamorphosis into gnarled wood provide micro-setting anchors that shape beats. However, spatial choreography between Elias, Lyra, and the doorway mushrooms lacks precision during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sky-bridge and enchanted orchard are vivid and purposeful, grounding the violinist's spatial choices and the statues' approach. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through metaphor ("towers of rust and glass," "brittle edges stark against weathered wood"), though the orchard's mechanics—how she moves "like smoke"—remain gestural rather than tactile. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to play and charging the final image when planted. The Q3 9+ gate is narrowly missed: the shell and bridge shape key turns, but the orchard's constraint is more atmospheric than action-altering during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt arcade, neon ghosts, and glass coffins anchor atmosphere and return in the final line to bookend tone. The shuttle's hydraulics, decking compartment, and drone patrol altitude provide tactile micro-setting that enables Kael's tactic. However, the arcade itself remains ornamental—a waiting room that does not constrain his choice or supply a resource; the active setting is the shuttle and drone grid, which shape his three-second window and hidden-compartment solution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned circus train carriage is vividly rendered with colorful tapestries and crystalline case, and the setting supplies the halo fragment that drives the ending. Wind bells recur as atmospheric anchor. However, the environment remains largely decorative—spatial details don't constrain Elian's choices or tactics. The "hidden oasis" feels convenient rather than earned by prior pressure, and the setting doesn't evolve causally with events.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "scientific poetry library" and "hyperbolic geometry" are named but remain generic placeholder concepts without tactile detail or spatial constraint. The scarf's frayed silk and the dusty shelves appear early, and the scarf returns at closure, creating a purposeful reprise that reweights the librarian's journey; this lyric callback lifts the score into the mid-5s despite the lack of environment-as-pressure. The "odd hours" timeframe and browsing patrons supply ambient setting but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "whispering archipelago" and "tide-worn shelves" are evocative labels but remain generic postcards—no micro-detail (tool, body constraint, spatial layout) alters a choice or charges the closure. Sensory selection is uniform lyricism rather than POV-filtered urgency. The palette and sunrise are described but never constrain an action or force a tactical shift. Orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) caps Q3 at 7.0 per cross-cap; execution weaknesses lower the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "gap between worlds" remain metaphoric placeholders; no concrete spatial anchors (walls, tools, dimensions) constrain movement or choice. Sensory detail—lavender, rain, "impossible color"—is vivid but ornamental, not tactical. The workshop's geometry "slips sideways" during the climax, yet this effect does not alter the locksmith's method or force a spatial workaround. Micro-setting test fails: no object or body constraint shapes the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid and repeatedly anchored (glass dome, fairy ring, shipwreck shadows, tidal rhythms). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's folklorist POV. The setting participates in her method (light refraction through mineral deposits, shipwreck positions as star charts) and charges the final image with shipwreck sentinels. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it remains primarily descriptive backdrop rather than active obstacle, capping the score below 7.0 per the gate.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    The forgotten library and shard-mirror walls are anchored early and return in the final image, offering micro-setting coherence. The "afternoon shadow caught in glass" functions as a recurring object that frames the exile mechanics. However, the library remains atmospheric rather than constraining—no spatial detail alters a tactic or choice, and the "twilight realm" metaphor is evocative but not load-bearing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The waterfall mist, silver-barked trees, and ironwood root anchor the setting vividly and serve the ritual: the root becomes a gateway, the mist supplies essence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("scent of petrichor," "cool taste of morning dew"). The environment constrains the act spatially (kneeling, the depression in the root) and charges the final image (spray into rainbows). Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the parapet setting participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prism sanctuary is vivid and purposeful: fractured starlight, rainbow shafts, and crystal ceiling create a charged atmosphere that reflects the spirits' emergence. Spatial choreography is clear (Elias kneeling, Anna pacing, spirits circling). The setting materially affects the closure image—color intensifies as starlight refracts, soothing spirits—thus constraining the final moment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency. However, "years of accumulated silence" and similar phrases rely on metaphoric assertion more than concrete sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vault setting is vividly rendered with rain-scoured frescoes and rust-colored tears, establishing atmosphere effectively. However, the environment remains largely decorative; it does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources that alter his approach. The ancient henge appears only on monitors, never pressuring the protagonist spatially. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but the setting does not reach the 9+ gate of constraining choice or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken-ship library provides atmospheric specificity—waterlogged encyclopedias, reinforced portholes, Amelia Earhart's trench—grounding the reader in a vivid, impossible space. The snow globe recurs with changing meaning (glitter swirling, then motionless, then swirling again), charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent: Elias moves from shelf to desk to Arthur's perch without confusion. However, the library's unique properties (water pressure, salvaged artifacts) never constrain a choice or alter tactics; the setting functions as backdrop rather than active constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The misty courtyard above clouds and the flower press bolt plate offer vivid sensory anchors, but spatial choreography remains vague (how he accesses the wall, his physical perch). The storm timeframe pressures the work pace in the middle section. Late orientation (anchors unclear until ~180 words) triggers the Q2 penalty and caps this category at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The bolt plate constrains the encoding method and charges the final beat when tucked away, meeting micro-setting standards, but the courtyard itself functions mostly as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystalline elevator and icebound spire provide vivid anchors, and the "scattered light from a passing sunbeam" momentarily constrains the decryption action at floor seven. Sensory detail—fogged breath, darkening sky, frozen architecture—is selective and atmospheric. However, the spire functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature limits Elara's choices or charges the final image, and the ten-floor structure becomes a countdown rather than a spatial crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gondola as micro-setting provides a contained spatial frame and charges the final landing jolt. The brass telescope recurs across beats, anchoring tactile detail (cool weight, fogged lens) and family history. However, the sky itself remains a catalog of cloud types without constraining Elias's choices—he observes rather than navigates hazards or resource limits. The final circle of clouds is a convenient visual payoff rather than an environmental pressure that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hollowed tree trunk library, the hidden safe, and the crystal lenses provide concrete spatial anchors and constrain Elias's method (he must align indentations, position lenses to catch dawn). The "fractally precise" visual motif recurs but remains decorative—it does not alter a choice or charge the closure image with new weight. Sensory detail is present (dust, decaying paper, grain of wood) but filtered through a generic art-catalog register rather than Elias's embodied priorities. The demolition timeframe is mentioned but not tracked beat-to-beat, so spatial pressure exceeds temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    The antique airship, observation deck, tarpaulin, and hopscotch board provide vivid spatial grounding. The starling murmurations offer atmospheric resonance and serve as visual analogue to the board's patterns. However, the airship functions primarily as a picturesque container rather than a constraint that shapes Elias's choices or alters his tactics. The recurring objects (phrasebook, board, starlings) charge the final image thematically but do not impose a physical or spatial cost on Elias's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen library supplies vivid atmosphere—crystalline windows, frost-coated walls, icy floor—but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice. The clockmaker's gear assortment sits on a pedestal and the mirrors pulse, yet neither object's spatial position alters her access or tactics. The hall of mirrors "stretched before her" without coherent choreography of distance or movement that would test her approach. Micro-setting allowance applies (gears, mirrors as charged objects) but they do not block or enable a meaningful on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Floating rock arches and butterfly gardens are vivid labels, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The watering bell hovers "untouched" and pulses light; no character handles it or adjusts tactics due to its presence until the told epilogue. Spatial choreography across arches is abstract—"easternmost arch" supplies a discovery site but no legible distance or access friction that alters a choice. The orchard-planet idiom remains generic pastoral-SF without sensory hierarchy or POV-filtered detail.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse setting provides atmospheric detail but does not constrain a single choice or tactic. The spiral staircase, lantern room, and pane of hush remain postcard elements. The puppet head is handled twice (pressed against the pane, then floating in void) and charges the final image with its "cracks now filled with light," meeting micro-setting participation. Spatial choreography is coherent but underutilized for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost line, and orchard light are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear (labyrinth mouth, cliffs, orchard). The nut's tactile presence ("warm against palm") and the device's blue-light path constrain Tomas's method and guide the traveler, charging the final third. Loose gravel and frost accrue pressure. Minor slip: "晶体者 forming delicate daggers" includes untranslated Chinese that breaks immersion and suggests a generation artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss-covered stones, river foam patterns, canopy light). The chrysalis and foam patterns are integrated into Elena's thought process and carried forward to closure. However, the ravine itself does not constrain her choice—she could have had the same insight anywhere water flows—and the laboratory setting where the actual polymer work occurs is absent. Spatial choreography within the ravine is clear, but the setting functions more as contemplative backdrop than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    The glass orchard library and swirling clouds establish vivid atmosphere, but they never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—they remain postcard description. Spatial choreography is coherent (counter, shelves, door), and the bottled moonlight recurs visibly across beats. The micro-setting (Elias's counter and blade) does contribute to the incision action, lifting the score slightly, but the fantastical environment itself (floating library, clouds) exists as backdrop without affecting tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    The desert-fortress-after-rain frame is vivid and anchored early. Sensory details—"rain-slickened stones still weeping moisture," tidal pools as star mirrors, bioluminescent coral—are purposeful and POV-filtered. The pavilion's icebound coral columns and the hexagonal ripple constrain Kael's method (he follows anomalous wave patterns), meeting the micro-setting standard. The final return to "fortress baked in the returning desert heat" recharges the opening image with thematic weight. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting supplies the resource (rain-formed pools) that enables the goal.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly described (spiral staircase, celestial dials, star-faced clocks) and anchors the single scene. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the environment remains a postcard backdrop; no spatial element constrains a choice or pressures the broadcast action. The cuckoo clock weight and transmission mechanism are handled but do not alter tactics or charge the final image with embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    The moonlit canyon supplies vivid images ("parted synapse," "infinite shadows and possibilities") but functions as backdrop only—it does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The broken periscope mirror is described three times but never handled or used; its fractured reflections remain metaphorical. Spatial choreography is vague (equipment "arranged," neural interface "adjusted") with no tactile engagement. The Orientation Test penalty was routed to Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The serpentine grotto receives vivid atmospheric detail ("mist coiled around her ankles, whispering in languages that predated human speech") yet functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through library, streets, quarries, standing stones, and grotto passages. The gravity inversion is described but does not materially limit Elara's choices; she passes through unimpeded and returns when the hour ends without tactical cost. The crystal formations appear as discovery objects rather than environmental pressure that alters her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.1)
    The siskin alder grove is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (hushed leaves, hedgehog foraging, rustling in time with rhythm), and the porcelain insulator's tactile contrast is well-drawn. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Eliara enters, kneels, uses the insulator, and succeeds without spatial or material friction. The setting functions as atmosphere rather than active pressure, missing the Q3 9+ gate of forcing a decision or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    The magnetic nexus supplies vivid sensory detail (lavender/charcoal twilight, basalt texture, hum) but remains postcard description—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The worry stone's dent is described repeatedly yet never used to solve a problem or block an option. Spatial choreography is clear, and the twilight atmosphere is consistent, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    The workshop is vividly described with specific objects (oscilloscopes, tuning forks, frequency generators) and the encroaching fireworks establish temporal pressure. However, the setting remains postcard-like; tools are named but do not meaningfully constrain or enable Silen's choices—any frequency device would serve equally. The stars, candles, and shadows contribute atmosphere but don't shape tactics or charge the final image. Micro-setting allowance applies (body, tool) but the oscilloscope and generator are interchangeable props.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    The treetop village is vividly anchored early with selective sensory detail (rope ladder, moonlight-caught web, misty canopy) and the corpse flower's paradoxical scent filters through Elara's olfactory gift, giving the setting a character-specific texture. The porch and soil bowl recur across beats, grounding the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a backdrop for internal reflection—preventing entry to the 9-band. Spatial choreography is clean and the idiom is consistent, but the village's physical properties never pressure Elara's decisions at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and bioluminescent flora anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The arrow tip embedded in a boulder and the central tree with pulsing roots constrain Kael's path, and the "sweet decay and new growth" olfactory detail filters through her mission focus. The gravity inversion timeframe shapes urgency ("the whirling silence returned as the gravity shift neared its end"), and the *Gleaner*'s anchoring maneuver reflects lived-in piloting. The final tree "swaying not in wind but in rhythm with the echoes" charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    The container labyrinth creates vivid spatial particulars—corrugated surfaces, artificial canyons, unnatural wind spirals—that constrain Elias's survey work and guide his discovery of the convergence point. Container Z-379 functions as the epicenter where wind and chemical evidence intersect. However, the setting remains largely postcard-descriptive in service of atmosphere rather than forcing immediate tactical choices; Elias moves through it without spatial friction. The port city backdrop and sodium lamps add texture but do not alter his options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with synesthetic layering (violet echoes, emerald aurora, honeyed light). Spatial choreography remains stable. The amber sheet and aurora function as micro-setting elements that enable the song's mechanics, meeting the bar for choice-constraint. However, sensory density is uniform rather than modulated by urgency; the crisis moment receives the same textural treatment as the opening, flattening momentum. The setting charges the final image through the cavern's responsive singing, lifting the score into mid-6s despite excessive ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Thunder-echo range is vividly rendered with carved driftwood, towering rock spires, and the canyon's "reluctant light." Sensory detail is filtered through the Keeper's purpose (arranging markers, listening for echoes), and the natural echo chamber enables the flute's effect. However, the environment supplies atmosphere more than constraint—the canyon does not meaningfully limit options or force tactical adjustments. The driftwood markers function as symbolic anchors rather than active obstacles, and the gateway transition bypasses spatial challenge. The final return feels peaceful rather than pressured by the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The topaz workshop, amber glass ceiling, and letterpress anchor setting vividly. Stars vanishing overhead recur across beats and charge the final dissolution. However, the workshop functions as backdrop rather than constraint; Silas never wrestles with tool limitations or spatial pressure. The halo fragment remains abstract—its "impossible geometries" never translate to tactile handling that alters a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and northern-light palette establish vivid atmosphere early; the dragonfly-wing pendant is handled repeatedly and its iridescent scales catch light. Spatial choreography remains clear (path, cave, ridge's end), and the setting's mist-shrouded peaks and ethereal glow filter through the courier's nervous attention. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the storm forces shelter, but the hermit encounter unfolds without the cave's physical properties mattering. The setting charges mood but does not charge the final image with spatial or material pressure, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost-patterned car window, and bare feet on cool stone create vivid, purposeful anchors. The prism's facets, the car's windshield filigree, and the arbor's dripping ice are filtered through Elias's attentive mystic lens and constrain his ritual method. The setting directly enables the communion attempt and charges the final image when he touches the ordinary metal hood, fulfilling the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—pure postcard description. The loom appears in nearly every paragraph yet remains abstract; no detail about warps, shuttle, or thread tension shapes her weaving tactics. The jigsaw edges and amber bead are handled, but their physical properties (weight, texture, how they attach to the loom) are omitted, leaving the mechanics vague. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard planet with floating arches and violet sky is vivid and consistently rendered. The cavern's phosphorescent lichens, the wagon's false-bottomed crates, and the dawn light catching "azure defiance in the stone" provide purposeful sensory anchors. However, spatial choreography in the cavern ritual—how Elias arranges fragments, unfurls silk, presses hands—remains generic; the arch "floated—whole and silent" without friction from the environment. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elias's meticulous weather records never matter on the page. Micro-setting (body, tool, object) does not charge the final image; the arch's glow is observed by others, not by Elias in a moment of embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rust-eaten repair bay is introduced early with sensory texture (metallic tang, corroded tools), and the green shard's location under the spanner ties setting to object discovery. The parallel-universe bay ("gleaming starship, crisp uniforms") provides contrast but remains postcard description—Kael moves through it without spatial constraint or environmental pressure altering his tactics. The setting does not constrain the datapad nudge or charge the final image; micro-setting (body, tool) potential is unrealized because the shard's cyclical spontaneity controls transitions rather than environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, and sea-glass object are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (saltwater scent on letters, aquamarine fragments scattering). The haunted lantern room supplies atmospheric pressure and the setting guides Jonah's movement up the spiral stairs, but the environment doesn't constrain a key choice—he relights the lamp without obstacle and the "ghosts" remain decorative. The sea glass on the windowsill charges the final image with visual specificity, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object must charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern wick are mentioned frequently and return in the final paragraph, creating a purposeful frame. However, environment functions primarily as backdrop: the wick "sings," shadows "dance," but no spatial or material constraint visibly alters Kaelen's choices. The "total internal reflection" mechanism is named but not made tactile—how the lens adjustment works or how starlight bends remains opaque, reducing the setting to lyric decoration. Micro-setting credit: the glass wick recurs with slight reweighting ("pulsed with awareness"), lifting the score above pure ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating rock tea house and valley-mist establish atmosphere; the morpho wing, crystal teapot prism, and sun-trail floor marks ground tactile action. The prism-refracted beam constrains the climactic moment through specific optical geometry. Sensory detail is purposeful (soft morning blues vs. harsh noon silver) and filtered through dye-master perception. Does not reach 9-band: while the prism enables the key turn, the tea house itself supplies mood more than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    The labyrinth's intricate passages, skylights, and tower are vivid and purposeful. The sextant as recurring object constrains Elian's research method and charges the storm-tower climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (rain, lightning, moonlight breaking through clouds). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The piece satisfies the micro-setting allowance: the sextant and tower setting participate in the final image, though the trees themselves remain distant backdrop rather than proximate constraint on a pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mica window and greenhouse setting anchor the space and recur with purpose: the keeper traces the warped glass, presses his palms to it, and light spills through at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual glow (phosphorescent trees, glowing blooms, shimmering facets) without tactile or auditory texture during peak beats. The "alchemical orchard" and "mirror world" remain high-concept labels; no occupational or physical constraints (soil, temperature, tool maintenance) pressure the keeper's choices. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library setting is vivid and specific—"nestled between a tailor shop and bakery," leaded glass, locked compartments—and the invitation as micro-object recurs across beats (smoothed, traced, folded, placed in cardigan pocket). The invitation constrains her ritual and charges the final departure, qualifying as object-as-setting. Sensory detail is selective (moonlight, dust motes, clock chimes) and filtered through Elara's tranquil focus. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tea house and overgrown courtyard provide vivid sensory grounding—moss on stone, damp earth, phantom bread scent—and the setting charges the final image when wildflowers "grew stronger, real now." Spatial choreography is coherent (balustrade, hedge, patch of soil), and the micro-setting (barren soil, yew hedge) enables the planting action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions as backdrop and mood rather than as a tactical pressure that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The frozen library, crystalline air, and cloud-piercing windows are vividly rendered and consistent. The frequency sampler and magic lantern slide anchor action. However, setting remains largely decorative; the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics under pressure. The final image does not charge setting details with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pirate market beneath the pier is vividly established with "rotting timbers," "dim lantern light," and "ancient pillars," and the setting clearly frames the underground economy. However, the environment doesn't constrain Emmie's movements or choices in a way that charges the closure—she moves freely through the market, and the "sunrise" deadline is told rather than shown tightening space or access. The watch fob and canvas tent are handled on the page, but spatial choreography during the three attempts remains vague (shadows, guards, diversions mentioned without concrete blocking). The final sunrise image is poetic but doesn't reconfigure the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender bluff and aurora are vividly described with sensory specificity (copper taste, ozone, salt). However, setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop; the bluff's edge and lavender bushes do not constrain Elara's path or enable a tactical choice. Spatial choreography is coherent. The micro-setting (body as setting via luminous skin) is present but ornamental, not integral to a decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with auroral light and refracting crystals, and it charges the final image when the light shifts from tears to reverence. The cave's sensory detail (humming crystals, smooth stone wall) supports the protagonist's act of creation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or create a tactical obstacle; it functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse city under toxic skies and the calligrapher's workspace are established early with sensory detail (iridescent dust, warped floorboards, garden lamps). The postal tubes provide a concrete infrastructure that enables the climax. However, spatial choreography during the distribution hub exploration remains vague—we don't track Elara's movement through "piles of rust and crystal-dust" in a way that constrains her search. The gilded leaves and zinc plate constrain the final choice (she uses her calligrapher's tools to copy and send fragments), qualifying for micro-setting credit.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bluff, clouds, and workshop are visually rendered but remain postcard settings; none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The iceberg fragment is described ("edges glisten-ing") yet never pressures the protagonist's actions—it melts passively. Spatial choreography is vague (pendulums "swung," the fragment "tilted") without clear distances or physical consequences. Sensory detail leans visual and repetitive ("glisten" appears four times); urgency does not narrow perception as the tuner works. The micro-setting allowance (tool or object constrains choice) is not satisfied; the fragment decorates rather than charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and cultivation tank ground the setting effectively, and the magnetic-north shift pressures the systems. The box of childhood fears is handled in multiple beats (trembling approach, retrieval, miniaturization, placement), and its iridescent pulsing charges the atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice—L-734 executes the plan without spatial friction or resource scarcity altering tactics. The final image of iridescent rose petals offers a purposeful callback but does not shift options, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The courtyard's mosaic tiles return in first and final paragraphs with a tonal shift ("cool" to "warmed," "possibilities"), offering purposeful bookend reprise. However, the tiles never constrain a choice or supply a resource during escalation; the setting functions as postcard backdrop. The elm tree and library appear mid-story as waypoints without spatial grounding, and the neighborhood itself remains generic—no sensory hierarchy or POV-filtered detail that reflects Elias's curatorial eye under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken laboratory provides vivid atmosphere (water pressure, visor, waterproof doors) and the countdown spider-web constrains the timeline. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the guards' entrance and Elara's simultaneous dance-decryption blur logistics. The dice and journal function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, lifting the score into mid-6s despite the postcard-like "mysterious familiarity" framing that never concretely pressures a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered ("walls covered in massive salt crystals that shimmered under her lantern's light") and the harbor's gravity pockets provide spatial texture. However, setting details—whale beaching, marine research institute, maintenance key—function as convenient backdrop rather than constraining Elara's choices or supplying obstacles. The chamber amplifies the ritual but does not pressure tactics; she enters easily, arranges the elements, and succeeds without environmental resistance. Spatial choreography inside the chamber (kneeling, pouring grounds, lantern rising/falling) remains clear but decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    The brook and nocturnal haven provide atmospheric detail but remain postcard-level; spatial choreography is vague (kneeling "by" the haven, walking "with the flow" without concrete distance or obstacles). The origami wing is handled across beats, yet its physical properties (paper, creases, transformation into a sphere) are asserted rather than shown constraining choice. Sensory selection leans heavily visual and metaphoric without urgency-driven narrowing. The setting does not meaningfully constrain the summoner's success.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower anchor the opening effectively, and the seal is handled physically across beats. The unexplained teleportation from rooftop to study ("they were in her study now") violates spatial coherence at a key pressure point. The jasmine and meteors return at the end but function more as atmosphere than constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The velvet garden at twilight is vividly established with midnight-blue roses, silk-textured leaves, and nocturnal insects. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, but the garden does not constrain a choice—Elena arranges crystals among flowers without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The seashell appears repeatedly but functions as an oracle rather than a tool whose properties Elena must navigate. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not charge the final image; the dawn light is mentioned but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites anchor space and atmosphere effectively; the cold floor and dripping water constrain Elara's endurance across hours. Sensory detail is vivid ("emerald waves," "pearl twilight") and filtered through her craft focus. The heritage rose thorn as micro-object charges the final image when she tucks it "close to her heart like a prayer," transforming from betrayal token to devotional object and constraining her final gesture. Minor cap applied: some details (stalactites forming "translucent pillars") read ornamental rather than tactically relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine nexus and canyon setting constrain Kaelen's method (he must be at this specific acoustical site) and charge the final image with the Spire's "cracked silhouette against the starlight." Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("stone throats catching fragments of starlight," "reed-blown melancholy"). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location. The seashell and canyon function as micro-setting that enables the core action, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the ending does not fully reweight the setting's meaning—it remains consistent rather than transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glacier shrine, candle-light, and melted snow globe anchor setting with sensory specificity ("ethereal blue light," "breath fogging in the circled air"). The globe constrains Elara's method and appears in the closure beat ("glinting with captured light"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography between shrine, ghost-ship, and research stations tracks cleanly. However, the wreck-diving occupation and arctic environment remain largely decorative—no tactile detail of diving or cold affects a present choice, and the shrine's carved-ice walls serve atmosphere more than action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    The whispering parapet, glistening stones, and firefly-lit loom are vivid and purposeful, returning at closure to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (parapet → archway → lanes → workshop → return). The bamboo tea whisk and loom serve as micro-settings that constrain attention and shape the climactic recognition, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, sensory detail skews heavily visual; wet earth and old wood/metal are mentioned but not integrated into choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The radioactive orchard is vivid and specific, with amber apples, crimson pears, and hazed sky creating a coherent impossible-ecosystem backdrop. The glass pavilion and its clean air provide a constraining micro-setting that allows Maya to remove her mask, and the Flawed Diamond's physical crack (分割其中心—though the mixed-script intrusion reads as an artifact) anchors the thematic core. However, the orchard's sensory details remain largely static postcards; wind "howls" but doesn't force tactical adjustments, and the contaminated soil's isotope-processing mechanics are told rather than shown altering Maya's approach. The setting informs but does not meaningfully constrain choices at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt glass portico and storm imagery are vivid and charged; the glass "trembled as lightning struck nearby" and "suddenly luminous with captured storm energy," creating a micro-setting that charges the final descent. Sensory detail is selective (amber vacuum tubes, storm below, rain-transformed world) and POV-filtered through a reclusive astronomer's lens. However, the observatory's interior lacks spatial choreography—Elias moves between glass, radio equipment, and star charts without clear physical grounding. The "cloud-bound kingdom" and "path down the mountain" feel postcard-generic rather than tactile, and the chalk circles below remain visually inert, never constraining choice or altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes is specific and recurring, and sand intrudes physically (clearing fallen sand reveals the music box). The dawn timeframe and the train's whistle provide sensory anchors. The glass jars function as micro-setting that constrains his method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with "fractured ice," "skeletal shadows," and "cracks no longer signs of decay but pathways of light." The glowing ice in the final third charges the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice; the engineer kneels and presses the key without environmental friction. The fleeting sunset functions as backdrop rather than ticking clock that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (ice glowing with starlight, metallic structure after rain). However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature limits Elara's choices or alters her tactics at a key turn. The viaduct's "conductor of planetary consciousness" reads as exposition rather than on-page pressure, and the final approach to the viaduct does not test her navigation or resource management.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The subway maintenance tunnel provides concrete sensory anchors (curved walls, rusted panel, dampness) and the lantern's glow charges several beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear. However, setting does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elara kneels, traces, freezes, stands, and walks without the environment forcing a tactical trade-off or enabling a specific outcome at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair shop is rendered with sensory specificity (wood, metal shavings, lacquer, dust motes in single shaft of light) and the velvet cloth, tweezers, and windowed arch are tied to plot mechanics. The photosensitive trigger and crystal slit constrain the trap's logic. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The shop's "vibrant hush" recurs but does not decisively shape a choice; it charges atmosphere more than it alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The acid sea, brass-inlaid floorboards, velvet pedestal, and perpetual lightning storms create vivid sensory anchors filtered through the workshop's mechanical aesthetic. The kaleidoscope's thousand watch faces and the arrow's serrated edges catching light are specific and purposeful. The acid sea's erosion exposes lower levels, directly enabling Zephyr's descent and thus constraining the final move. Spatial choreography (pedestal → kaleidoscope chamber → lower levels) tracks cleanly, and the floating workshop's precarious position subtly pressures the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Archive and social network archive are named but remain atmospherically generic—"low thrum," "sprawling index"—without spatial choreography or constraint that shapes choice. The mission patch serves as clue rather than environment. The "pocket dimension compressed within a defunct music-streaming algorithm" is conceptually interesting but never becomes a tactile space that pressures Elias's actions. The body and tools (algorithms, credentials, filters) are mentioned but do not constrain a choice or charge the final image; they function as plot instruments rather than setting elements that impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lighthouse orchard and vintage mirrors are vivid in isolation but function as catalog rather than constraint: Shael moves through trees and raises the crystal to mirrors without spatial resistance, resource scarcity, or environmental pressure that alters tactics. The ice floes shift at the end in response to Shael's success rather than complicating the attempt. Sensory detail defaults to the visual (crystalline, silvered, frost-kissed) without embodied temperature, tool-handling friction, or micro-setting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid and particular: buckled harbor, crushed boats, salt and melting bergs supply sensory specificity filtered through Arthur's philosophical lens. The parasol tip—delicate ivory stained dark—provides sharp tactile contrast to the rough wool coat and slushy mire, and its recurrence in his pocket constrains his attention across beats. The oil drum fire and the woman's position staring at the water where her husband's boat was anchor the final beat spatially. Environment shapes Arthur's observation and charges the closure image when he realizes endurance is the sound he sought, making the setting functional rather than merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber pavilion, vineyard rows, and autumn light are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (russet leaves, amber glass, dust motes). However, the setting remains decorative—no spatial constraint alters the couple's choices, and the pavilion's "destined mismatches" backstory is told rather than demonstrated through present action. The vine tendril twisted into a heart is noticed by the narrator but not the characters, undermining its function as a choice-shaping element.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pavilion's "sand-worn silk floors," "frayed silk walls," and the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes create vivid spatial anchors. The crystalline clearing floor "shifts" to reveal deeper whispers, and the parapet's gears "grind" and "hum," providing tactile and auditory texture. However, these elements do not constrain the walker's choices—he moves through the space unimpeded, and the consecration succeeds both times without environmental resistance. The mask is the only object that charges the final image, though its cracked state is described early and does not evolve with events.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lavender field and factory ruins are vividly drawn and recur in the final paragraph, where vines "obscuring the factory's wounds" parallels the healing theme. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Elias works undisturbed, and the location functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes action. The lightbox built from factory scraps is a promising micro-setting detail but remains inert—he uses it without friction or cost tied to its scavenged nature.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadowed library at dawn is anchored immediately with sensory specificity (chill, fogged glass, suspended hush). The crystal as micro-setting object constrains the scholar's method and charges the final image when he closes his hand around it, feeling its "residual hum." Spatial choreography (window, central table, podium, seat) tracks cleanly. Setting detail reflects POV priority (untouched books, disassembled chandelier) and the environment directly enables his experiment, satisfying the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fog sculpture garden is rendered with vivid, POV-filtered detail ("rusted spires," "twisted metal shapes," "monolith of rusted car hoods fused together") and the damp ground, chalk's "powdery dryness," and cold metal create tactile anchors. The environment constrains Elias's movement and supplies the monolith that delivers the vibration he seeks, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the videotapes mentioned in the opening are never integrated into action or choice—they remain atmospheric ornament—and the "driftwood" that "wasn't wood at all" is described but never handled or shown to affect a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lunar observatory supplies concrete details (silver dome, argent light, biodome groves) and the tremors create escalating physical pressure. The leaf in the biodome functions as micro-setting that charges the final turn, and the clock mechanism anchors spatial choreography. However, the orbital mechanics remain vague precisely where they matter most—how clock tension affects station thrust—undermining the closure's physical plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hospice wing "above the clouds" and the "panoramic windows" are vivid but postcard-static; the setting does not constrain a single choice. The vinyl shard on the nightstand is handled twice (gestured to, then placed in the sleeve) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (the object) just meets the 9+ gate, but the broader environment remains ornamental, capping the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating isle observatory is anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "brass-edged rim," "concentric rings etched into the floor," "holographic star chart." The clockwork key and the observatory's core constrain Elara's tactics—she must interface with the machine to trigger the awakening. Shadows pouring "through the observatory's vents like liquid smoke" integrates setting into escalation. The nocturnal twilight and the lens through which she views the fissure charge the final image, making the environment indispensable to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The secret garden functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: impossible botany, starlight-dripping willow, and the child arranging stones create a vivid backdrop for the exchange. The hedge maze constrains Eleanor's approach (navigation by touch and intuition), and the garden's inhale when the tooth dissolves ties environment to plot consequence. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Eleanor's professional-yet-wonder-open POV. The garden's presence at closure elevates this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    The serpentine grotto is anchored early with vivid sensory selection—salt, damp stone, mist, slick walls—and returns at closure when the glass is placed "where the mist coiled." Micro-setting (water's edge, ledge) structures the action. However, the environment supplies no obstacle or constraint; Elara's movements and polishing proceed unimpeded, and the grotto functions as atmospheric container rather than pressure source. The final image charges setting mood but does not constrain the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden provides vivid, specific sensory detail ("velvet moss," "honeyed hush," "thawing icicles") that creates atmosphere and reflects the story's tech-nature hybrid theme. Spatial choreography remains clear as Elara moves through server bays and examines moisture trails. The setting enables the encounter and symbolically houses the theme of "systems that break," though it doesn't constrain Elara's choices in a way that alters tactics or outcome—it functions as backdrop and mirror rather than obstacle or resource at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist, river, and shoreline anchor the dream-space adequately, and the spiral seashell recurs across beats. Sensory detail is present ("warm despite the chill," "waves against sand") but often generic. The setting influences the collecting action by providing the ephemeral figures, meeting the micro-setting threshold, though spatial choreography remains vague—distances, sight lines, and the protagonist's physical movements lack concrete grounding. The final workshop mention shifts locale without causal integration.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The verdant arbor, harvest moon light pooling "like liquid gold," and the cricket's glass eyes ground the scene with vivid, selective detail. Sensory hierarchy (moon glow, vine rustle, metallic chirp) reflects urgency and aligns with Elias's focus. However, the arbor functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes choice—removing it would not break the closure logic. The micro-setting (vine tendril at the base where moonlight pools) charges the final image but does not alter Elias's tactics or options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    The subarctic crater and withered orchard supply atmospheric specificity (skeletal branches, perpetual twilight, cobalt glass), and the glass-pattern arrangement constrains Kaelen's ritual choreography. Body and tool (satchel, tweezers, copper plate) appear on the page and guide action. However, spatial positions remain vague; we do not track Kaelen's movements around the tree or the exact radius of the glass circles. The final resin derived from the orchard's last tree charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate marginally, but the setting mostly provides backdrop rather than a choice-forcing constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The marble cavern is vividly established early with purposeful detail (polished walls, crystal formations, reflection angles). Setting elements actively shape Elian's work: angles at different times of day, the north passage at noon, the western wall at dusk. The timer mechanism itself functions as micro-setting, constraining his approach. However, the cavern doesn't force a choice with visible cost at closure; it remains a well-described stage rather than a crucible that narrows options in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bronze grotto and starlight establish a vivid, purposeful micro-setting that constrains Elara's transformation (precise orientation, convergence point). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("metallic veins pulse like sleeping circuits") and filtered through her fractal perception. However, spatial choreography remains static; the lamp placement and body arrangement occur without tactile interaction or evolving environmental pressure. The grotto charges the closure image but does not alter tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as both atmosphere and recurring constraint, filtering light that makes the carving "seem almost alive" and charging the final image. The workbench micro-setting anchors all action, with ash wood shavings and tool weight providing tactile grounding. The kettle's boil imposes a live time constraint that shapes work rhythm. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (circus smell after rain). The loft's "rust-hued peace" modulates from stated tone to embodied setting detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    The kinetic lagoon is vivid and purposeful—mirrored planes, mist, carousel imagery—and recurs throughout to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (edge, pool, horizon) remains coherent. The camera wheel and carousel horse anchor micro-setting beats. However, the lagoon functions primarily as symbolic backdrop; it does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics in the way that would elevate into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hydroponics bay—dry pipes, dust, rust-scented water—grounds the middle sequence and constrains Elara's work (she must redirect flows through dormant infrastructure). The sextant piece as micro-object charges the final beat by serving as both tool and anchor. Spatial choreography (terminal, concourse, hydroponics bay) tracks cleanly. However, "after the carnival left town" functions as abstract metaphor rather than a concrete timeframe or location detail, and the "phantom destinations" on departure boards remain decorative. The setting pressures one key turn (opening the valve, redirecting water) and returns at closure, satisfying two of three gates and reaching mid-6s on specificity and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal forecourt after rain supplies vivid sensory grounding (droplets, transparent pillars, light) and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. The sanctuary setting and the body (weathered hand, twitching fingers) constrain Elian's choices—he must act in solitude, and the physical memory of piano keys shapes his response. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment charges the final image when the forecourt transforms from avoidance to reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canal setting is vivid and purposeful: moss-covered pylons, current swirls, silt texture all guide Elias's tactile search. The sundial as micro-setting object constrains his method (solar equation, autumnal equinox shadow) and charges the closure by contrasting celestial constancy with human fabrication. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through professional attention (current tremors, mud's grip). The dawn progression from "black to bruised purple" marks time and mirrors internal shift, though the "distant city" radio feels slightly generic as spatial anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity that anchors the scene. The fulgurite glass appears in multiple beats, charged with symbolic weight and tactile presence (hollow core, humming, flaring). The micro-setting (dock planks, coiled rope, proximity of weaver) constrains choreography and tone. The final image of snow falling and fog rolling back ties setting to the ending, though the setting does not mechanically constrain Elias's choice. Solid execution that charges atmosphere and supports closure without forcing decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    The garden is vividly rendered (barren roses, skeletal apple trees, copper signs explaining absences) and the autumn chill, iron gate, and stone bench anchor the scene concretely. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered. The setting supports theme but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias moves freely, observes, and writes. The weft thread and garden architecture charge the final image thematically, meeting the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.1)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vivid and the opening anchors spatial context early. The crystalline floors, copper wires, prism, and tangled thread appear multiple times and constrain Kael's assembly action. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than as a tactical constraint; Kael never navigates obstacles within the palace or uses its spatial features to force a mid-scene choice. The final collapse charges the ending image but arrives as summary consequence rather than a moment where the environment actively narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and dunes anchor setting vividly and early. Sensory detail is selective and serves the meditative tone; the lagoon's mirroring surface recurs purposefully. The sapling planting engages the environment tactically (cool grains, damp burlap), and the black sand's exposure during cloud migration links timeframe to place. Micro-setting via the coin and sapling constrains one choice (the tying ritual), lifting the score above decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains is richly described (cobblestone, dry basins, moss-lined inscriptions, the fish-shaped fountain, the sapling in soil) and provides a coherent backdrop. The setting shapes Kael's route and supplies discovery objects (cherub, coin, sapling/key), meeting the micro-setting standard. However, the environment never constrains a choice or imposes cost; Kael's path is frictionless. The final image of water "whisper[ing] from a nearby pipe" as the fountains "remembered how to flow" charges the ending tonally but does not alter Kael's options or carry consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nebula garden supplies vivid sensory texture ("petals of gas and light," "blossoms swayed in perpetual twilight") and the gear's "smooth as polished obsidian" offers tactile specificity. However, spatial choreography remains vague—distances, boundaries, and the sentimentalist's form are abstract throughout. The gear does constrain one choice (placement at the blossom's base), meeting the 9+ gate marginally, but the environment functions more as backdrop than active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: humid air, streaked glass, dying butterflies, and new seedlings create a charged paradox that mirrors the thematic meditation on grief and migration. The weathered workbench and gravel path are handled concretely. The carved granite and the ribbon's ink-bleed anchor tactile engagement. Micro-setting qualifies: the stone, chisel, and ribbon constrain Elias's final action and charge the closing image with the migration path motif, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, pendulum bob, and broken rake handle are vividly rendered and character-filtered. The setting's sensory particulars—cold obsidian, churning sea, storm-grey sky—anchor action and mood. The broken rake handle functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's method and charging the final beat when he presses the inscribed handle into the mechanism. The environment shapes the ritual and recurs with shifted weight at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt silo, spiral staircase, and constellated work table supply vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective ("velveteen gloom," "moonlight filtering") and integrated into action. However, the environment remains decorative—no tool, spatial constraint, or recurring object meaningfully alters Elias's choice at closure. The silo provides atmosphere but does not charge the final image or constrain tactics, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (glassy surface, fractured shards, hollow echo, torchlight) and the spire's interior architecture tracks coherently. The setting subtly mirrors the cartographer's mental state (stillness, depth, concealed currents) and the lake's fissure provides a visual response to his work, charging the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—he moves through the space unimpeded, and the spire functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ember alcove and mist are vivid and recurring, grounding the piece in a specific micro-setting. Sensory details—dust like velvet, dial glow, humming crystal—are purposeful and filtered through Elias's preservationist focus. The alcove's embers and the orchestra pit function as spatial anchors that shift meaning at closure, charging the final image. However, the "story famine" timeframe remains abstract backdrop rather than world logic that constrains action, and the broader city is featureless.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vanishing point gallery—floors sloping to an impossible horizon, white mist—is vivid and anchors the ritual throughout. The mask itself functions as micro-setting: its porcelain shards and the ash constrain Elias's ceremonial actions and charge the final image when the mask glows. The gallery's mist and light modulate with pressure, and the rocking chair's rhythm supplies a tangible clock. Environment and object jointly shape the closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but spatial choreography is sparse (no second on-page character or physical obstacle complicates access).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sunken city ruins and sewer setting provide vivid anchors (limestone walls, dripping pipes, sewer grates, flooded tunnels) and the chronometer cog is handled concretely. Spatial choreography across the underground is coherent, and the tremors/rising water add environmental pressure at the end. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop; the tunnels do not constrain a key choice or decisively charge the closure—Sebastian's emergence is enabled by a rope, not shaped by the environment's unique properties. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, but the cog and charts could be discovered in many settings without structural loss.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library is anchored early with sensory detail (dust motes, tall windows, autumn leaves) and constrains choices through its "hushed" atmosphere that students "disturb without destroying." The rosette functions as micro-setting, handled twice (desk examination, held up during rehearsal) and its carved notation system pressures Eleanor's pedagogical tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the autumn framing modulates from gathering darkness to lamp-lit stillness, charging the final image with seasonal metaphor that supports rather than overstates theme.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored (hanging pans, glass ceiling, nutrient soil) and the cosmic energy "singing softly with the cosmic energy" provides atmospheric specificity. The glass walls and scattered tools recur, but they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's actions proceed unimpeded. The final morning light and surrounding sprouts charge the ending image slightly, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment remains more backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lightning tower's "gaunt frame," spiral staircase, and hidden maintenance panel anchor space clearly and constrain Elias's path. The lacquer box is handled in multiple beats (clutched, opened, given), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "honeyed glow," "nectar dusk," the hiss of the compartment. The blackout context and dead drone carcasses create atmospheric pressure. Micro-setting (the box, the matchbox slot) functions as a constraint that shapes the reveal, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    Bayside cottage, sun porch, attic, and garden are named but remain interchangeable backdrops; spatial choreography (Elias crouching, climbing to roof, moving between rooms) is gestured at without embodied detail or constraint. The orris root's "violet fingerprint scent" and "auditory gold" hush are vivid but do not narrow a choice. Salt air and spring blossoms function as atmospheric flourish rather than pressure on the displacement ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: phosphorescent algae, stainless trellises, bronze flora, crystalline chime. The environment constrains choice—crushing pressure is immune to his stone form but not his memory; the chime is the "strongest remaining point" in the architecture, shaping his reply method. Spatial choreography (central pedestal, upward filament, chime) is clean. The micro-setting (ampoule on pedestal, chime in garden) charges the final image when he strikes the chime instead of breaking the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.1)
    The infinite staircase is vividly established (spiraling, identical steps, heavy air, groaning stone) and recurs across beats. However, spatial choreography remains generic—no anchor for scale, curvature, or how Elias orients within the loop. The dice function as a recurring object that charges the closure (chipped → split → healed), meeting the 9+ test, but the broader setting operates more as symbolic frame than tactical constraint that alters his choices mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse is anchored early with layered sensory detail (smog-choked city, damp earth, night-blooming jasmine) and purposefully contrasts the pallid orange glow below with lunar-tinged air above. The moon-tipped brush, magnolia leaf, and silver dust are handled concretely and constrain the final action (painting the script). The setting charges the closure image: the leaf on the windowsill catching moonlight becomes the proof that "connection was an element, as fundamental as air." Micro-setting (brush, leaf, moon) functions as setting, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Minor slip: spatial choreography is static; Elara's movements between vines and ferns are mentioned but don't alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto city is vividly particularized: pooled water "slick as oil," eroded steps, fading murals, the roar-to-sigh shift in the river's voice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's curatorial POV, with the emerald lens and communal ovens anchoring the space. The environment constrains choices subtly (tremor-shifted aquifer, vanishing frescoes) and the ovens' heat pushes back the "dank chill," charging the ritual. The final image ties the bread's warmth to the setting's "dead air," meeting the 9+ gate: the grotto's oppressive atmosphere shapes the stakes and charges the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and rocky island are vividly rendered and atmospheric. The yoyo and its cord function as a tool that constrains the final action. Sensory detail is strong (blue light, wet rocks, seaweed), and the tidal timeframe subtly pressures the opening. The setting does not constrain a middle choice, but the yoyo's mechanics and the stone's radiance charge the closure image sufficiently to enter the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The funhouse setting provides vivid atmosphere (distorted mirrors, shifting walls) but remains largely postcard description—mirrors form paths, but the protagonist's navigation and the physical consequences of choosing one reflection over another are summarized rather than dramatically staged. The opera cloak clasp glows and pulses, yet its physical properties (heat, weight, luminance intensity) do not constrain a tactical choice or alter the protagonist's movement through space. Spatial choreography is coherent in broad strokes but lacks the granular detail (distances, doorways, which reflection is approached from which angle) that would make the environment a pressure on the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating orchard and saltwater-adapted trees are vividly specific, and the hollow fruit functions as instrument. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting never constrains a choice—the prophet moves freely through an accommodating environment. The blue hour timeframe and cloud movements remain atmospheric rather than pressuring tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shell-city is vivid and purposeful: "curving streets following the ancient grooves carved by time and tide," the Great Elder Turtle's dome as vantage point, and the tactile detail of Elara pressing along the crack all ground the setting in action. The discovery cavity—shell as container—is a strong micro-setting choice that constrains and enables the key turn. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (visual focus through spyglasses, tactile through mapwork) and the sunset hues charge the communication scene. The watchers' distant positioning and the rusted gate create spatial pressure. However, the Western Gate and the broader city layout remain somewhat generic; we don't see how the turtle-shell streets specifically shape Elara's daily navigation or choices beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ivy-wrapped station, rusted tracks, flickering light, and fallen rosebush are vivid and selective. The station functions as both literal container and thematic mirror (decay/moral rot parallel). However, spatial choreography during the grapple is vague—where exactly are they standing, how does the letter skid "across the floor" of a platform? The rosebush appears twice but remains ornamental; it does not constrain a choice or alter the ending image beyond metaphoric echo.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The submerged pavilion is richly detailed (skeletal remains, shattered dome, foundation gaps) and filtered through Elias's professional lens. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the "deepest section of the western foundation" introduces precision late without prior orientation. The shattered glass and foundation gaps recur with shifted meaning, charging the final image. The inkwell and waterproof notes function as micro-setting tools that constrain his method, meeting the 9+ gate test by shaping how documentation occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.7)
    The underwater library is vividly anchored with the dome, hydroelectric systems, and glass allowing sunlight through water. Sensory details (flame through water, sea creature songs) are selective and atmospheric. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; the stamp's heating and the coordinate maps are tools handled, but neither the water pressure, the blackout's spatial constraints, nor the vault layout materially narrows Elias's options or charges the final image with environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating isle, glass basilica, tea garden, and tools (felt workbench, diamond-tipped scoring tool, smoky quartz) are anchored early and integrated into action. The "gentle rocking of the isle" functions as both setting and emotional mirror—"a constant, rhythmic reminder of the world between worlds he now inhabited." Sensory detail is purposeful: "aroma of steeping herbs mingling with the scent of hot beeswax and polishing oil" grounds the workspace without catalog excess. The quartz stones constrain his method and the basilica's refracted light charges the final image when he holds the crane "up to the light from the glass basilica." Spatial choreography remains clear; the workbench, tray of cranes, and lantern-light track coherently across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating observatory and thermosphere setting are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the piece in isolation and metaphysics. However, spatial choreography is vague—console, screens, and Elias's position within the circular room lack tactile grounding. The geode crystal constrains perception (mirroring screen patterns) but does not alter a present choice. The classroom target appears only in the final beat, too late to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ancient observatory is vividly anchored with sensory detail (crumbling stone arches, massive dormant telescope, brilliant dimness). The type foundry matrix chip functions as micro-setting, constraining Kai's monitoring choices across multiple beats. However, the desert landscape and energy barrier remain postcard descriptions that do not alter tactics or apply pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt terrace at dusk is vivid and purposeful, framing the conversation with a color tied to regret. The watch hand as micro-object constrains choice: Elias places it on the railing as confession-token, Mara picks it up, and her acceptance of it signals tentative reconciliation. The "forgotten shore" with driftwood carvings is mentioned repeatedly but remains abstract—no sensory detail grounds its geography or the carvings' texture. Spatial choreography on the terrace is clean (railing, approach, departure), but the shore itself never materializes beyond concept, limiting its pressure on present action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.7)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and moon are vivid and consistently present. The setting contributes atmosphere and frames the neutral-territory concept, but does not constrain a tactical choice or materially alter the exchange outcome—Julian could negotiate this deal in any fog-bound location without changing his options. The moon and mist serve as backdrop rather than active pressure. Spatial choreography (northern path, stone ramparts, sea beyond) is clear. The drawer pull functions as a micro-object but does not change a choice in the closure beat, keeping the setting in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The salt-stained kayak, gravel launch, utility poles, and compass are vivid and purposeful. The coastal setting pressures Elara's choices—she returns daily despite loss, the lighthouse is unreachable at high tide, the poles guide her drift. The compass grows warmer in proximity to water, a micro-setting detail that charges the final turn. Spatial choreography (poles inland, her drift off course) is coherent and the tactile handling of the compass anchors the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered—"organisms that pulsed in time to the dripping of water," "water cool against his skin"—and its depths pressure Elias's choice to wade in. The baseball's worn leather and "signature that shimmered like heat on asphalt" anchor tactile specificity. However, the underground passage and chamber pedestal function as stage-dressing; they don't constrain tactics or provide resources that alter the outcome. The setting charges the final image (light, water, submersion) but does not force a trade-off or enable a move that would fail elsewhere, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The moonlit orchard is vivid and consistent, with luminous flowers and moss-covered stones supplying tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is coherent (altar, arbors, smoke patterns), and the perpetual moonlight constrains the ritual timing. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than pressure; no environmental detail forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome. The orchard witnesses rather than participates, keeping this in mid-band despite strong descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (liquid mercury time, impossible blossoms, choking sweetness) and the floating boulder provides a tactile anchor for the ritual. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting, constraining her hand placement and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ascent and ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recycled spaceship, memory chamber, and faded photographs ground the search concretely; the tear-drop crystal's warmth and glow provide tactile detail. The spaceship's groaning systems and transparent walls charge the stitching sequence, and the "vast emptiness between worlds" enriches atmosphere. The crystal and photographs constrain Elara's method (she must scan microscopically), meeting the micro-setting test. Sensory selection favors the visual (shimmer, glow, transparency) with limited embodiment of sound or touch beyond "warm" and "groaned."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    The black sand beach, volcano, and celestial dance are anchored early and remain spatially coherent. The fissure glowing faintly and the half-buried box provide micro-setting details that guide Elias's physical actions. However, the environment does not constrain choice or narrow options under pressure; Elias kneels and digs without obstacle, and the setting functions as backdrop rather than tactical puzzle. The bottle and the lightning bug are handled across multiple beats (held, dropped, sealed), giving the object recurring presence, but the volcanic rumble and whispering hush remain atmospheric rather than stakes-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The luminous fort, twilight emergency torches, and glow-stone technology provide vivid anchors. The bronze quill holder's "cool metal" and the half-painted sundial's "coded angles" are handled on the page. Spatial choreography (courtyard → eastern wall → hidden panel → circular chamber) tracks cleanly. The cradle of sparks as micro-setting charges the final image, lifting the score above mid-band despite some reliance on visual catalogs (e.g., "pulsing stones") that could deepen with scent, sound, or tactile resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff, auroras, and frictionless sea create vivid atmosphere, and the bluff's resonance with stone patterns charges the final sequence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The collapse of half the bluff last month briefly constrains her caution, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stormlit observatory and swirling clouds supply vivid sensory anchors, filtered through the poet's awe. The darkroom timer and envelope constrain handling in discrete beats. However, spatial choreography inside the dome remains vague (stone table, glass edge, stairs appear without prior setup), and the setting does not force a tactical choice at closure—it remains backdrop. The micro-setting (body, timer, envelope) charges beats but does not drive the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass atrium, dripping leaves, babbling brook, and mosaic floor are rendered with sensory specificity (whirring brass joints, cool tin, half-painted sundial). The sundial's coded angles and the needle card's ridges receive tactile attention, grounding the intellectual duel in physical space. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain choice or alter tactics; characters pace and circle, but spatial choreography remains decorative rather than causal. The brook's "quickened" rhythm and the "thousand tiny rainbows" refract the intellectual stakes but do not supply a resource or obstacle that affects the outcome, keeping the setting just shy of causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library under stars recurs across the piece and anchors action (sorting books, planting seeds, teaching teenagers). The coffee tin with false bottom appears multiple times and serves dual functions (seeds, contacts), constraining tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear (outdoor sanctuary, boxes, solar-powered lamps). The moon's movement tracks time visually. The setting actively shapes the resistance work rather than serving as backdrop, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining choice or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal arbor and its bioluminescent flora provide vivid sensory anchors and the compasses constrain one action (alignment with the clock). However, the arbor functions mainly as postcard atmosphere; its "unseen forces" and tidal mechanics remain vague and do not pressure tactics in the climax. The station and fog-shrouded city set mood but spatial choreography inside the arbor is unclear. Micro-setting (the clock itself) does charge the final image, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ridge and blossoms are vivid and purposeful, described through sensory detail (sweet decay, warm stone, scent pulling him under). The flowers as "physical manifestations of stories" enriches world logic. However, the environment does not constrain a live choice or materially alter tactics; it serves as a charged backdrop rather than an active pressure. The seed's glow in Elias's hand at closure charges the final image but the ridge itself does not force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The islet after rain and the miniature bonsai function as micro-setting that reflects Kenji's enclosed emotional state. The compass is handled across multiple beats, its erratic spin and eventual steadying shaping his internal movement. Spatial choreography is clear (islet, shore, ancient pine), and sensory detail (salt-laced air, wet earth, gull returns) anchors time and pressure. The setting constrains choice implicitly—the isolation mirrors his retreat—but does not supply a resource or barrier that alters a pivotal tactic, keeping this below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse and flood-wrecked world are described with sensory precision (“condensation… fractured glass,” “mud-clogged streets”), and the neutron stars overhead deepen the thematic contrast. The setting is tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, linking cosmic violence to earthly decay. The greenhouse functions as a sanctum that both constrains and enables her work, and the environment (broken glass, drowned orchids) is literally what her power acts upon. This integration of place, image, and action gives the final panorama of stars vs. greenhouse strong atmospheric charge.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the quiet canyon, the ghost-scented workshop, luminous glass rods, frost-mapped greenhouse window, and collapsed mineshaft all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details are filtered through Kaelen’s artisan eye, and the canyon’s isolation and burned structures subtly echo the theme of fragile creation under threat. The final image of soot-laden glass resonating in the “quiet canyon” shows the environment charging the closure. The setting could constrain tactics more overtly, but it already carries strong atmospheric and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The winterglass conservatory and its frost/orchid imagery are atmospheric, specific, and sustained, and the tools (tuning forks, scanner) are well-integrated into the environment. While the setting functions more as charged backdrop than active constraint, it meaningfully charges the final image of her “stage” and aligns tightly with the tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the basement workshop, the old lighthouse, and especially the underwater city library are all textured with concrete, imaginative detail (“fish darted between bookshelves like curious librarians”). These environments constrain choices—he must dive to Mirrormere for knowledge, endure “crushing depths,” and then mount the lens in the lighthouse for it to function. The lighthouse lens as recurring object charges the final image of ghost-visible golden pulses. A slight bias toward the visual over other senses keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ridge, the terra-cotta arbor as “silent hub,” and the starless sky all support tone and situate the stakes under sanctions. Environmental details are filtered through the thematic lens more than through highly idiosyncratic character perception, but they avoid generic filler. The silver bell as object-as-setting is well used, both physically on the table and conceptually as signal and later as silent emblem. The arbor and ridge don’t quite constrain choices tactically on the page (the runs could happen elsewhere), keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight viaduct, wisteria, and metallic tang create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the liminal, spiritual premise. The camera obscura and vial function almost as micro-settings/tools, tightly woven into action rather than described museum-style. The environment charges the final image—petals falling, bridges of light over a literal crossing—but doesn’t strongly constrain his choices. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong enough for upper-band short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The living bridge garden and hyperbolic geometry are vividly imagined and consistently rendered, with details like “bridges disintegrating into petals” and the “tree of light” charging the final image. Setting is not mere backdrop; it embodies his fractured mind and literally collapses when he acts, reweighting prior images. Some sensory range beyond the visual (more tactile, auditory, or bodily immediacy) could deepen the immersion further. As is, it’s a strong, integrated atmospheric asset.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is vivid (dust motes, stale popcorn, rusted beam) and tonally apt, and the piano bench and collapsing structure meaningfully constrain action. Environmental elements evolve with events—the groaning wall, shaking floor, and splitting boards all shape the climax and reveal the vault. The setting’s specificity enhances mood and symbolism more than it dictates tactics beyond the bench and collapse, but those two are substantial. Overall, the world feels tactile and coherent, though not yet at the rarefied “setting as full crucible” level.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is remarkably rich and integrated: the sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwrecks, aurora, and ashen forge all feel specific and uncanny yet coherent. Crucially, environment and objects constrain action—the glass amplifies light/sound, the forge is where imprinting must occur, and the aurora’s behavior gates his opportunity. These elements return at the end (forge glowing gold, shipwrecks “watching him go”), clearly charging the final image. Sensory details are consistently filtered through Elias’s synesthetic perception, which grounds the world in his particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The emerald station, golden-hour light, and moonlit ambience are vividly rendered and tightly woven into the piece’s mood. The recurring contrast of emerald glow and fading gold subtly mirrors the shift from borrowed, spectacular moments to quieter, self-authored ones. The jar, the station’s luminescence, and the portrait collectively charge the final image, though the environment rarely constrains physical options beyond providing the perfect stage. Description is lush but generally purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned control room, former floodgate system, and melting-ice season are specific, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Finn's sensibility. Details like "icicles wept" and "scorpions of rust" effectively mirror the thawing-heart theme without feeling like a mere checklist. The environment doesn't tightly constrain physical options, but it does charge the symbolic logic of his choice and the final image. Overall, setting and objects are well integrated and do real thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    The rusted library, iron doors, and star-salted sky create a vivid, atmospheric container that aligns with his claustrophobia and frames both opening fear and closing release. Environmental details like rust, decay, and ozone are sensorially specific and thematically apt, though at times more decorative than functional. The library and stars do charge the final image as symbols of his altered stance, even if they don’t materially constrain tactics. The laboratory is thinner by comparison, more sketched-in than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vividly realized: the storm-tossed ridge fort, the ambered observation chamber, and the pebble-shore all feel specific and atmospheric. Details are filtered through Kaelen’s focus on the sky and pages, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The glowing flaking booklet and the silent fort against a starless sky give the ending a charged, concrete image. While the storm and geography don’t strongly constrain tactics, they do effectively frame the isolation and gravity of his task.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen courtyard, eternal twilight, and ice violin are vivid and recurrent, with the environment shifting meaningfully at the end when twilight breaks into dawn and the ice melts. Setting details are mostly visual but well-chosen, and the courtyard’s emptiness underscores 734’s isolation and sentence. The violin functions as both object and environmental node, charging the final image as the courtyard thaws. A bit more tactile or constraint-based interaction with the space (beyond cold and frost) could further deepen its role in shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting—shattered desk, abandoned theater, crystal whispering stones in the rain—has strong, specific atmosphere that supports the mood and post-verbal world. Details are well integrated into perception and action (stones humming as he steps out, the lens as salvaged relic). However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly serves as lyrical backdrop and thematic mirror. The whispering forecourt charges the final “applause” image effectively but still feels more atmospheric than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The garden maze, decaying vines, and “low luck zone” are vividly and efficiently rendered, with details filtered through a lifelong vine dresser’s eye. The environment meaningfully shapes the climax: Elias must follow the light into the maze, and the oldest vine’s location and transformation anchor the final image. The Luck Institute and urban “genetically-perfect, luck-enhanced gardens” broaden the world without overwhelming the scene. Setting consistently reinforces the theme of neglected yet resilient spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)

Overall, the piece achieves a convincing, textured sense of place without over-describing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The flooded opera house with lanterns and dark water is evocative and consistent, and details like the conductor’s podium just above water tie environment to action. The atmosphere of liminality and decay supports the ghostly premise and the “in between” theme. The flood and lanterns do influence tactics (where he lays the pages, the visual flickering in response to the music), but they don’t fully corner him into difficult choices. Strong mood work, slightly under-leveraged as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain weather station is vividly evoked (thin air, storm-lashed windows, charts, sextant) and consistently filters through Elara’s perception in ways that mirror her altered reality. Environmental elements (charts that now “look like a lie,” the sextant, the storm, altitude) reinforce the theme of unreliable measures and unseen voids. The setting also anchors the brother’s backstory and institutional disbelief plausibly. It doesn’t strongly constrain her physical choices in-scene, but it decisively charges the atmosphere and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The physical environment—peeling posters, rust-stained concrete, cold damp air, stagnant puddles—feels tactile and lived-in, and the tunnel’s claustrophobic “throat” nicely mirrors the idea of a swallowed truth. The beaded valve wheel functions as a charged object-as-setting: he kneels in the cold, handles it, and it literally mediates the final act of release. Sensory details like the warm draft “smelling of ozone and regret” effectively tilt atmosphere toward the uncanny. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain logistics, but it strongly charges tone and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is the story’s strongest element: the “overgrown library's vine-choked archways,” “geological strata of forgotten words,” and the obsidian refuge by the river create a vivid, coherent world. Environmental details are filtered through the keeper’s sensibility, with decay and reflection echoing the thematic focus on change and preservation. While the spaces rarely constrain concrete choices, they do meaningfully frame the keeper’s cyclical journey and charge the final return to the catacombs. The atmosphere is rich and specific without major confusion or white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and thematically engaged: Sage Ridge, the ancient oak, “dreaming roots,” and the eclipse are not backdrop but part of the emotional architecture. Details are filtered through Maya’s sensibility as a music therapist (garden as sanctuary, light and sound braided together), which keeps description purposeful. The recurring image of roots and sky, and the curls placed on the grass, charge the final images with a sense of depth and continuity. It falls just shy of the highest band because the physical environment rarely constrains tactics; it mirrors and frames rather than forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The reclaimed silo library, “bronze quiet,” and concrete curves repurposed from apocalypse to archive are vivid and tonally integrated, and the tapestry’s blues and golds provide a potent sensory contrast to the muted world. Setting is strongly filtered through Aria’s perception—walls that “whisper,” mortar with “emotional resonance”—which deepens both worldbuilding and her characterization. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain specific tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image of dragons “weaving themselves back into the world’s fabric.” The speculative rules (Dream Extinction, Great Fading, displaced axis) remain internally consistent and grounded in this physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse on jagged rocks, the flickering beam, ink-stained fingers, and relentless sea create a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The setting is integrated with his methods (beam as metronome, tower as workshop) and supports the mood of isolation and secret work. However, the environment rarely constrains or changes his choices; the weather and physical dangers are evocative but not operative. This keeps the setting from fully charging the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The chamber, dimensional anchor, pedal, and violet pigment create a strong, coherent atmosphere of “muffled clarity” that’s both tactile and metaphysical. Setting details are economical but vivid (e.g., silence like a vacuum chamber, pigment hanging in the air) and consistently filtered through the priest’s ritual focus. The anchor and chamber conditions evolve (quiver, flare, shudder, stabilize), so the environment feels dynamically involved rather than static backdrop. It stops short of 9-band because the physical constraints of the space don’t markedly alter tactics beyond mood and symbolic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are rich, specific, and tightly integrated with the emotional and metaphysical stakes. Environmental details (stairs, cracks, icicles, hum of the crystalline walls) are not postcard description; they directly structure his method and the ascent. The lake/sky mirror and dawn light charge the final image and conceptually reprice the entire exercise (“once just a lake and a sky, the magic gone”). The nautilus shell as a micro-setting/object is also effectively used to constrain and color beats, especially at the climax and denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glowing viaduct, neon city veins, and rain-slick water provide a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the concept and reconfigures meaning at the end when replaced by a plain street. Environment does some work as a constraint—the viaduct as path over still water, gravity-defiance as a spatial tactic—but most of its power is tonal and imagistic rather than tactical. The recurring rain and light/glow motif effectively mirror and then undercut his shifting state.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drum maker’s cavern, sleeping drums, phonograph, and the seasons outside create a rich, coherent atmosphere that mirrors her interior stillness. Sensory detail is purposeful—muted acoustics and vibrations through stone are not just pretty but crucial to her method of “hearing” with her body. The setting and tools (drums, shellac discs, workbench) actively shape what she can do and how she does it. The final image of her surrounded by “sleeping drums” and her own heartbeat neatly fuses environment and internal change.

    The courtyard, stone walls, dusk light, alarms, haze, and distant rogue-zone lights create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and purposeful. Setting mirrors and counterpoints Elias’s inner state—quiet courtyard vs. chaotic quarantine—and weather (rain, impending storm) charges the final image. Details are specific without feeling like a tourist catalog, and the environment consistently frames his solitude and decision. The setting influence is mostly tonal and thematic rather than constraining concrete tactics, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants is vividly and economically rendered—the glass panes, crystal shadows, central terrarium, and Lunaria resurgentia all feel particular and purposeful. Setting and time (moonbeam, midnight transformation, once-a-century bloom) shape the scene’s atmosphere and subtly constrain when this can happen. The environment interacts with action (he lays tools on a stone bench; the moonbeam activates the flower) and charges the final image (vial to moonlight), rather than sitting as a backdrop. It could push higher if physical constraints of the space more directly pressured his tactics or choices in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is richly realized and tightly integrated: the cracked ceiling, spirals, and shifting patterns all mirror and facilitate Langdon’s quest. Environmental details (grotto walls, grooves, hidden panels) are not ornamental; they literally gate access to deeper layers and the final chamber. The rope as handled object plus grotto architecture effectively function as a micro-setting constraint in the climax. Sensory specificity is high and consistently filtered through Langdon’s poetic-mathematical gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: a sunken orchard greenhouse with a fractured dome, ringed by shipwrecks that “loomed like broken elders,” all in the aftermath of a burned rainforest. Details are filtered through Lyra’s perception and sound-sensitivity, and the sapling plus dome/shipwrecks recur to charge the final image. The environment doesn’t much constrain her choices tactically—she could perform this ritual in many ruins—but it strongly shapes atmosphere and thematic resonance. Overall, the world feels coherent, memorable, and proportionately detailed to the scene’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber grotto, dusk light, static air, and perfumed blotter petal are vivid and sensorially rich, clearly filtered through the dealer’s craft-focused perception. The environment supports tone and method (static electricity as both atmosphere and tool) and recurs at the end as a reconfigured “sanctuary.” However, the grotto doesn’t significantly constrain physical options; its influence is more tonal than tactical. Still, specificity and recurrence meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The symphony hall and the “breezy library under stars” are vivid, tonally apt spaces that mirror the story’s attention to quiet, overlooked labor. Details like the night breeze stirring open pages and grease stains on Frederick’s cuffs feel specific and embodied rather than generic. The environments support the theme of public performance versus hidden work rather than merely decorating it. While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain choices, it does charge the final images with a soft, reflective atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, prisms, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Kael’s artistic attention. Setting is not postcard-only: the floating prism matters to the tag’s discovery, the arbor is the focal locus of action, and the final image of prisms casting “webs of kinship reborn” charges the thematic closure. World rules remain consistent within this surreal frame, and the environment strongly colors tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly imagined and integrated: the rooftop canals, twin moons, damp metal, and the sleeping giant’s breath all shape how Elias moves, navigates, and understands his world. The canals are not postcard detail; they function as a temporal map and physical route to the Whispering Knot. Environmental specifics (slick flagstone, neon-blurred lights, musk from the giant) are strongly filtered through his task-focused perspective. While the setting does constrain and enable action, it stops just short of being as tightly interlocked with choice as the very best work in this band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern orchard is richly realized—bioluminescent fruit, mineral drips, mosaics—and perception is consistently filtered through Elian’s emotional and technical preoccupations. Setting elements are not mere backdrop: the dripping stalactites, glowing fruit, and specific stepping stone all function as components of his method and recur at closure (the steam from his tears rising toward the stalactites, the orchard stirring at dawn). The world’s rules for magic are inferred through these environmental details rather than explained, giving the place a coherent, lived logic. The setting charges the final image, though it could push constraint on choice slightly harder to reach the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The library setting, crawl spaces, pipe chases, and dawn outage are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Elias’s intimate familiarity. Environment genuinely shapes his tactics: darkness as cover, hidden beams and hollows as routes and caches, the children’s section as a strategic placement site. The contrast between external “sapphire hush” and internal darkness, then returning light, underlines the final “true illumination” nicely. While the setting does not impose harsh physical constraints, it is more than backdrop and meaningfully entwined with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse, mossy trellis, and storm-season weather are richly rendered and consistently filtered through his plant-focused attention. Rain, wind, and the slick trellis are not postcard details; they actively shape his options (sheltering under the eaves, then stepping out into the storm to “become” the model). The linden leaf as recurring object charges the final image and functions as a micro-setting and tool for meaning. Environment and weather constrain behavior and reweight the ending, meeting the high-band test.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island, causeway, convergence of fresh and salt water, and altered post–water wars weather are vivid, specific, and all filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting isn’t decorative: isolation explains why she stays, rain trails literally guide her path, and the convergence is both physical constraint and metaphysical engine. The rising tide at the end subtly charges her renewed commitment, underlining a before/after separation. World rules (changed rains, limited bridges) are consistent and economical, supporting both mood and thematic concerns about memory and reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid and sensorially specific, with sound, light, and impossible geometries woven tightly into action. Details like shadows acting as doorways, crystals singing, and the cave pearl as a luminous anchor feel integral rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes the magic system and the final image (pearl pulsing with the cave’s song). A touch more use of the setting to constrain concrete choices, rather than primarily serve as atmosphere, would push this into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “mist-shrouded docks,” “ivory harbor after rain,” and rain-washed buildings create a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the themes of return and clarified memory. The archive space and the small brass valve are well-chosen, tactile anchors. Environment is more evocative than constraining—characters are not forced into or out of choices by it—but at this length the atmospheric use is effective and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “starlit vault in mist,” cracks-as-arrows, phantom platform, and fortress create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly tied to the character’s inner state. The environment isn’t just decorative: mist behaves almost like substance under his boots, the arrows guide and then halt at the gate, and the hall of mirrors materially stages his confrontation with self. The recurring mist/starlight/vault imagery returns in the ending (“The starlit vault in mist was his now”), giving the setting a charged, reconfigured role. A few details verge on generalized fantasy-symbolic rather than concrete, but the piece largely avoids white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stargazer’s open tower, night air, whales’ migration, and the glowing tile create a distinct, atmospheric setting with good sensory layering (sound, temperature, light). The environment supports theme: open roof to the stars, whale songs echoing memory, tower as sanctuary. However, the setting rarely constrains Elara’s choices or tactics; it mainly frames and colors the experience rather than shaping action. Still, the specificity and tonal fit are strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prismatic escondite, solar storm, and magnetic-field topology form a coherent, vivid environment that does real work, constraining tactics (he must move through the labyrinth to the place “where geometry frayed” at the storm’s peak). Sensory and visual specificity (“origami collapse of space,” “light bending into impossible angles”) is strong and consistently filtered through the immortal’s cosmic boredom and precision. The amulet and storm environment also charge the final image (the scar in space, the dormant fragment), giving the setting real closure weight. A minor limitation is that other senses and more tactile engagement are comparatively underused in favor of visual spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funeral home prep room and its “deathly vitality” are vividly evoked—cold steel, fluorescent lights, formaldehyde, viewing rooms—and these details feel filtered through Maya’s sensibility. The setting is not just wallpaper: the refrigerated units as hiding place, security loops tied to the facility’s routines, and the alley behind the crematorium all shape options. The world rules around the magic ink are concise and consistent. While the environment doesn’t quite become a character, it meaningfully constrains and colors the action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the bonsai labyrinth, glass workshop, fluorescent lamp, and silent town below all feel tactile and distinct. Environmental details are well integrated into action (the lamp’s hum, gold leaf application) and support the meditative tone. The world-building is strong, though the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mainly charges the atmosphere and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The port labyrinth of shipping containers is concrete, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through his sensibility (“steel canyons,” “graveyard of voices”). The micro-setting of the label wedged between corrugated walls narrows the canvas nicely and charges the middle and ending images. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it deeply informs tone and the story’s thematic register. The final walk “deeper into the labyrinth” and mention of the turning tide effectively reweight the space at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned observatory on a cliff and the tempestuous sea create an evocative, moody frame that matches the philosophical stakes. Details like the decaying dome, crumbling wall, and howling wind are vivid and filtered through Elias’s work-driven focus. The seashell functions as a charged recurring object that shapes the final image and sense of “direction.” However, the environment rarely constrains his options; it’s more atmospheric than tactically consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly and specifically rendered—neon on water, glow-paint under walkways, clean-energy barges displacing storytellers—and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The foundation stone chip and graffiti recur effectively, with the final image of the chip on the sill carrying thematic weight. While the environment shapes stakes (precarious floating society, encroaching corporate platforms), it less often constrains immediate tactical options in scene. Still, atmosphere, texture, and world rules feel coherent and distinctive at a near-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lunar setting is vivid and specific—dust, crater summit, vacuum, orbital geometry, and radiation constraints all feel integrated rather than touristic. Tools and environment (camera system, chemical developer, vacuum, temperature shifts, lack of atmosphere) are meaningfully tied to tactics and problem-solving. The “lunar morning” phenomenon and color spectrum give the piece a strong atmospheric signature that echoes at the end. It could lean more on non-visual sensory adaptation (body, suit, micro-movements) for full immersion, but what’s present is above-average and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The misty rail depot, nested workshop, and fountain are vividly and consistently evoked; sensory detail (mist on rails, warm workshop glow, water’s refraction) is specific and nicely patterned. Setting is filtered through Elias’ mode of perception—touch, sound, and water—rather than just sight, which suits a blind artisan. The fountain in particular does functional work as both atmosphere and tool. However, environment lightly shapes tactics rather than deeply constraining them, so it feels textured rather than indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation on glass are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elias’s cartographic mindset. Environmental specifics (rust, frozen expanse, fading patterns) reinforce the thematic concern with hidden structures and transient knowledge. The setting meaningfully charges the final image—the vanishing condensation and dawn over the lake as the launch point—but seldom constrains concrete tactics beyond isolation and waiting for conditions. Still, the atmosphere is strong, coherent, and integrated rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is vivid and well-integrated: cobblestones, hollow windows, archway sigils, and the broken clock tower all participate in the transformation rather than serving as backdrop. The environment responds to the tuner’s actions (humming sigils, glowing stones, pulsing archway), so atmosphere and “rules” are learned through interaction. Sensory detail is primarily visual and auditory in a way that suits the premise, and the final image of the archway as guardian feels earned. The town’s geography and evolution over the walk remain clear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater temple, crystalline spires, and impossible water spirals create a vivid, coherent environment that matches the story’s conceptual ambitions. Setting is not merely decorative: the temple’s architecture, the ocean descent, and the breaching water all shape what Marina can perceive and force the climactic choice under pressure. The recurring object-as-setting of the crystal vial feeds directly into the final image and world logic. Some details skew abstract rather than tactile, but the atmosphere is strong and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, copper sunset, and crashing surf create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that is tightly interwoven with action. The confessional lattice, narrow door, and stone wall are not just decorative but function as tools and obstacles in the escape. Environmental details (“wind howled through the lighthouse tower, carrying the scent of salt and regret”) mirror Elias’s internal state without feeling purely symbolic. The setting’s physical constraints—a remote, vertical structure on treacherous rock—credibly shape both the escape route and the hidden-crime premise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered—bioluminescent plants, silver-barked trees, winter-cracked fields—creating a rich, immersive atmosphere. Details are well-integrated into action and emotion (the pomegranate tree as the trigger-point for memory, the endless night echoing the ghost’s liminal state). The carved bead operates as a micro-setting/object that meaningfully charges the final image. The environment mostly shapes mood rather than constraining choice, but its specificity and recurrence significantly lift the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the cracked tide pools, red canyon walls “like internal organs,” and skeletal looms create a vivid, coherent environment. These details are filtered through Elara’s perception as a weaver, and the environment materially shapes what she can do (kelp fibers, abandoned looms, stone to take the plate’s impression). The final image—kelp-silk orchids pulsing with the ocean’s “abandoned heartbeat” in the labyrinth—shows the setting directly charging closure. A slight excess of lush description in places keeps it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “catacomb orchard” is vividly realized with tactile, olfactory, and visual details (ghost-white trees, roots threading bones, damp earth and blossoms) and is consistently filtered through Elara’s diasporic perspective. The environment is thematically fused to the idea of “endings feeding beginnings” and clearly charges the final image of the reactivated crypt. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, it shapes mood, symbolism, and her emotional stance at every step. The magical rule—silver light from the sundial-crypt interface—emerges cleanly from the environment without expository dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden arcade, dawn light, chalk, and ebony clipboard create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong sensory specificity and a clear futuristic nostalgia. Setting details are well-filtered through Elliot’s sensibility as a craftsman of communication and analog artifacts in a digital world. The environment (arcade, light, concrete) doesn’t meaningfully constrain his choices, but it does charge the final image of completed chalk codes and surface mail. Worldbuilding (quantum clipboard, nano-chalk) is integrated smoothly without expository clunk.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn winds, and eternal candle create a strong, coherent atmosphere that persists through the piece. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s priorities—the observatory as sanctuary-turned-threat, the candle as truth-source—rather than a generic backdrop. The candle in particular charges the final image as guardian, though the physical space doesn’t significantly constrain his options beyond mood. World rules (starlight embroidery, living chart) remain consistent and legible for a lyrical, quasi-fantastical piece.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mangrove labyrinth, brackish water, roots like skeletal fingers, and salt-laced air create a vivid, continuous atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through the medium’s perspective. Setting is not just decorative: the roots serve as platform, the canopy limits moonlight, and the single clearing where the moon “pierces through like a spotlight” directly constrains the ritual’s completion. The singing spirits saturate the air and function as an environmental chorus rather than mere lore. The gargoyle shard as recurring object is tightly bound to place (old church, threshold) and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atrium, mist, fountain, and twilight are vividly rendered and strongly modulated through Elias’s sensibility, creating a tangible atmosphere. Details like mist on ferns, the hidden fountain, and twilight’s “bruised purple” effectively echo his internal state without feeling purely decorative. The coral fragment functions as a micro-setting object, carried through to the final image with charged significance. The environment doesn’t much constrain choices, but it does meaningfully charge tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ruined orchard and fog are vividly rendered and recur meaningfully, especially in the contrast between skeletal trees and their brief abundance. Setting is strongly filtered through Elara’s artistic perception, so details (apples, cottages, smoke) feel both atmospheric and thematic. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, but it clearly charges the opening and closing images and anchors the emotional arc. Overall, specificity and tone are high-level, approaching publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The settings—the dusty chapel and especially the sound wave garden—are vivid, sensorially layered, and thematically integrated (“blooms of pure note,” “crystalline petals that chimed underfoot”). The garden is not just backdrop; its rules (sound-as-matter, reflective flowers) embody the story’s ideas about perception and art. The hobo nickel as recurring object nicely bridges locations and charges the final image. Environment shapes experience more than hard choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse and the community garden are sensually and specifically rendered—moths, pinned beetles, bioluminescent fungi, damp earth—and the botanical/coded-language conceit feels organically rooted in place. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, recurring natural details (moths, leaves, flowers) do charge the mood and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The gargantuan shell, cliff, and reef-shadow sea are vivid, specific, and tonally unified, with recurring details (pearlescent walls, moonlight through curved windows) that echo the inner state. Environment meaningfully shapes the story: the shell’s isolation underwrites his centuries of work, the cliff provides the stage for the armistice, and the sea ties into the blossom’s emergence and retreat. The setting charges the final image of dawn, drifting blossom, and constellations, integrating place with thematic resolution. A small missed opportunity is using the physical constraints of shell/cliff/sea even more tactically in his choice to step out and risk contact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The opal library above the clouds and the museum of extinct feelings are vividly rendered with concrete, idiosyncratic details (glass orchids humming names, velvet painting weeping, a whispering locket) that feel lived-in rather than touristic. Setting and objects directly shape stakes—the cracked tube alters the atmosphere, dimming orchids mark danger, and artifacts’ magical mechanics define the caretaker’s tasks. The environment also charges the final image; the mended wind chime and steady orchids embody fragile continuity against encroaching loss. At times the density of ornate description flirts with over-richness, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archive and ink well are vividly evoked—“dust and silence,” “liquid starlight,” and humming shelves effectively create a charged, atmospheric space. Setting details are well integrated with action as the environment literally responds to the promises. The glass ink well in particular recurs and then charges the final image via its shards as a constellation of hope. However, the archive functions more as mood and symbolism than as a constraint on options; it doesn’t materially shape tactics or impose limits.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dormant volcano and crumbling amphitheater are vividly rendered and consistently tied to mood—the “breathing” building, dust, geothermal warmth, and basin all feel tactile and specific. Setting elements matter to action: the basin and chain alignment physically stage his promise, and the amphitheater’s tremors echo and externalize his unease and his mother’s “warning.” The environment constrains nothing in a literal survival sense, but it strongly charges the final image and the thematic idea of ancient forces and measured restraint. A slight trim of repeated “breathing” motifs would keep the atmosphere from edging toward over-insistence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The attic, skylight, dust motes, and bird lofts are vivid, textured, and tightly filtered through Elian’s sensibility as a pigeon trainer and self-made cosmologist of debris. Setting is not mere backdrop: the skylight’s beam teaches his dust-mapping “method,” the bookshop attic enables his seclusion, and the tiny, enclosed world contrasts with the pigeon’s continental flight. The recurring dust imagery—“blooming, withering”—directly charges the final image and thematic frame. A touch more concrete interaction with the bookshop below or city outside might further integrate social context without being necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “drifting prism terrace” above “Eden’s lost marshlands,” scattered buildings, and warped threshold wood create a vivid, idiosyncratic environment that feels integral rather than generic. Setting details are consistently filtered through Elea’s obsessions: corn mazes, wood grain, weather codes, thresholds. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of her as guardian on a literal threshold between worlds. World rules around the butterfly effect and drifting prism remain suggestive but internally consistent for this lyric scale.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater research facility and drowned city are vividly realized and thematically integrated: prisms that once captured sunlight now echo in bioluminescent constellations, mirroring Elara’s pattern-obsessed worldview. The environment actively enables the central discovery (mirrors, lenses, atmospheric generators, observatory mechanics) rather than serving as a static backdrop. Details like “ocean’s ceiling,” sunken streets, and the shift from darkness to golden sunrise give the setting strong atmospheric charge that supports the ending image. The setting could constrain choice more sharply, but it already does substantial conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The iridescent geode cave, crystalline floor, sea-spray worldbuilding, and seeds-as-stars imagery are vivid and coherently integrated with Aelia’s work. The environment and tools (crater glass, cave mouth light, birds passing overhead) are not just postcard details; they’re the mechanism by which she captures memories. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices or tactics under pressure—it’s beautifully realized but functions more as lyrical backdrop than as an active obstacle or resource. Still, the recurrence of cave, light, and glass in the final image does charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “tidal arcade under stars” is vivid, sensorial, and consistent, with iron-and-glass vaulting, salty air, and the tide functioning as a recurring atmospheric counterpoint. The clock and arcade architecture matter to the plot (a stuck 11:59 that must be physically reset within this specific space). Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s aestheticized, performative gaze, reinforcing tone. Setting supports, rather than stalls, momentum and helps charge the final image of the now-ticking clock and exhaling arcade.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight garden, crystalline dome, and obsidian circle are vivid, coherent, and integrated with the magic system (starlight, gaps, anchoring). Setting is filtered through Lyra’s cosmological focus—constellations without stories, obsidian stones reflecting undistorted light—which supports tone and theme rather than feeling like a catalog. The garden’s enchantment and the obsidian ring materially constrain her options and charge the climax. A bit more tactile or sensory variety beyond the visual and luminous would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through his professional and spiritual preoccupations: Pearl Bay at dawn, “prism atrium in mist,” wet sand, and optical effects all feel of-a-piece. Environmental detail is not just scenic; the mist, light, and water surfaces actively frame his practice and the motif of transient clarity. The dawn timing and dissolving mist charge the final image of departure and “before the sun burns away the mist and the magic thins.” A few phrases are re-used verbatim, but they function more as motif than clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit ridge, charred valley, and regrowing landscape are vivid and thematically apt, mirroring his internal state without feeling purely decorative. The porcelain box and silver bell function as charged micro-setting objects that shape his attention and the story’s final image. Environmental details (moonlight, ridge vantage, remnants of the wildfire) are well-integrated into his reflections and sense of purpose. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it meaningfully charges mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tide-polished grotto, tidepool, and sea materials are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s analytic-yet-dreamy gaze. Crucially, the environment is not postcard-static: the rising tide distorts her patterns, creating new ones and directly testing her “equations for hope.” The grotto functions as a charged laboratory-temple whose conditions shape the experiment and its outcome, and the final exit into sunlight reweights the space. This integration of setting with process and theme is strong enough for high-band, though not quite transformative enough to push into 9-range.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The manor, ivy-veiled passage, damp stone, and hearth are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elian’s sensibility, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Environmental details (ivy, cracks, ashes, negative) are not mere wallpaper; they echo the themes of concealment, preservation, and memory. However, the setting rarely constrains his options or behavior beyond mood and access, so its influence is more tonal than tactical. The climate-shifted world is evocative but stays largely in the background rather than actively reshaping choices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The echoing terrace, cathedral bells, dew, and prism parapet are sensuously rendered and tightly interwoven with the ritual, clearly anchoring time and place. The environment constrains action (only this terrace, this post-rain light, this hush) and literally provides the refracted colors she uses. The closing image of the parapet “unaware” of the worlds it helped frame effectively charges the setting with conceptual weight. A slightly broader sense of the surrounding city’s life under this magic could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    The terrace, runes, midsummer sun, and celestial “slow dance” are vivid and consistently threaded through the piece, giving a strong atmospheric frame. The setting is not just backdrop: the chosen time and alignment, and the final golden light, explicitly charge the ritual and the absolution-tinged closing image. Details remain mostly visual, with limited sensory breadth or lived-in texture, which keeps the environment slightly abstract. Still, as a micro-cathedral for his ritual, the place is thematically and structurally well integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The salt flat is vivid and specific, evolving from “white expanse” to reflective mirror to crystalline resonator and finally to a surface struck by healing rain that sounds like applause. Environmental details (cracks as map, salt crystals as carriers of resonance, reflective surface doubling the egg) are tightly woven into both action and theme rather than serving as static backdrop. Weather and terrain explicitly channel the ritual and the final image, charging the ending without over-explaining. A touch less descriptive density in a few places might sharpen, rather than blur, the strongest images.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and crystalline sanctuary are vividly rendered and tightly woven into the action (the prisms literally hold echoes and respond to her work). Atmosphere is strong and consistent, with light, cold, and color shifting in step with her progress. However, the environment mostly supports mood and mechanism rather than strongly constraining her choices, so it stops just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The decommissioned radar dome and “Rusty Compass” bar are vivid, tonally apt settings that echo the themes of surveillance, threat, and marginal audiences. Details like overturned crates as a stage and the scarred story stick integrate atmosphere with action. The dome meaningfully frames the opening and ending, charging the final image of the stick lying inert beside his desk. Still, the environments rarely constrain choices in concrete ways; they deepen resonance more than they shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The grotto “clasped to the clouds,” the wet stone, ozone, moss, and sky-level vantage create a vividly particular, atmospheric setting that is integral to tone and theme. Environmental details (updraft, twilight, impending rain, high-altitude mist) are not mere backdrop; they help justify the fragility and ephemerality of the structure and the butterflies’ deaths. Sensory texture is strong and POV-filtered, avoiding generic nature description. The setting could marginally influence concrete choices more (beyond the forecast rain), but it still substantially charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound sanctum under auroras, the ancestral-hair rope, and the projections on ice walls are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the caster’s ritual focus. Environment and objects genuinely charge the final image—the aurora and rope become the medium for the remembered names and for his self-preservation. World rules around the sanctum’s latent magic and the rope’s function stay coherent and are shown through action, not exposition. It’s richly atmospheric without drifting into disorienting worldbuilding excess.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, storm, and humming core chamber are rendered with vivid, selective detail that supports the mood. Environmental elements occasionally constrain action (the loose panel, bursting conduit, storm shuddering the structure), preventing the setting from feeling like a static backdrop. Worldbuilding around the forgotten directive and rewilded world is efficient and integrated into Kael’s perceptions. Still, at the climax the physical environment recedes, and the dreamscape remains more conceptual than sensorially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “Babylonian palace reimagined,” ziggurat silhouette, crumbling bricks, and tools (reed stylus, wax tablets, bronze mirror) create a vivid, specific environment. The palace and its axis alignment with Cygnus meaningfully constrain the ritual and charge the final image of a ruin that’s simultaneously a convergence point. Description is lush but mostly purposeful, with the setting’s liminal decay mirroring dynastic and spiritual transition.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “soundless sanctuary” and shifting walls (stone/mist, starlight) create a distinct, almost dreamlike atmosphere and anchor the piece non-generically. These details are consistently threaded—reality “shifting,” soundlessness amplifying emotional release—so the environment does charge the mood and final image. However, the setting rarely constrains action or offers concrete obstacles; it’s more backdrop than pressure. The music box, as a recurring object, actually carries more structural weight than the sanctuary itself.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ruined orchard district, thick fog, cobblestones, frost, and glass shards are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elian’s craft-sensibility. The environment is not just decorative: fog and ruin are the medium through which the dream has wandered and the mirrors now reinterpret, culminating in the final image where orchard, fog, and glass mountains coexist. Weather and time of day support tone rather than tactical choice, but the setting clearly charges the closure image. World rules feel coherent for a quiet, magical-realist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard-in-the-rafters cathedral is vivid, original, and saturated with purposeful detail (“fruit that smelled faintly of regret,” roots clinging to stone arches), and it’s filtered closely through the mender’s sensibility. The environment is not postcard-like; it meaningfully shapes action and theme as a literalized space where “forgotten promises grew into apple trees,” constraining her refuge to this liminal, elevated zone. Key objects (ribbon, seed, candle, key) are embedded in the setting and reappear to charge the final movement. The only small gap is that the fantastical mechanics of the orchard are never tested against a concrete choice beyond serving as a symbolic garden of vows.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The astral orchard, pistachio shell, museum, and bathrooms are all concrete, distinctive spaces that support the tone and concept. The orchard-in-the-shell reveal effectively reweights prior images, and the cameo functions as a micro-setting charging the final image. Sensory detail is mostly visual, but the crystalline fruit and “blossoming on a lonely asteroid” are memorable and thematically apt. The environments could exert more direct constraint on her choices, but they never feel generic or interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Serpent Stack as a mountain-sized bookstore is richly evoked through smell, silence, and spatial logic, and it clearly constrains options (wanderers without purpose are consumed; compasses spin uselessly). The setting is not just backdrop but mechanism: its “grammar” is what Elara must decode and renegotiate, and the dissolving wall of “silent, shimmering notes” concretely transforms it at the climax. Details are selective and filtered through her linguistic/professional bias, maintaining tone and focus. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment during her long research phase could deepen the sense of bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship in a foggy bay is vividly evoked—carousel horses, rusted railings, hollow-eyed barkers, looping crew—and the later shift to the garden of forgotten names feels imagistically rich. Setting details are consistently filtered through the twin’s perception and support the uncanny, liminal tone. The environment occasionally exerts pressure (fog tendrils, looping crew, groaning metal) but more as atmosphere than as a hard constraint on choice. Strong atmosphere and specificity hold it short of exceptional because the world rarely forces concrete tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly evoked (oil, brass, riveted iron, parchment), and the infinite library with candle-titled spines and the ceremonial rope are memorable, specific spaces. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s vocational sensibility (logs, seals, patterns), which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. Crucially, objects-as-setting (the seal, the rope, the clock) constrain and enable choices and charge the final image of the chimes as words. It’s richly atmospheric without losing clarity, though the environment rarely poses real physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The harmonic caves, ice cracks, and energy beings create a distinctive, sensorially rich environment that genuinely shapes what’s possible (mapping via fractures, noise as pressure, silence as a constructed zone). Details like the crystalline walls and humming resonance are integrated with action rather than tacked on. The echo chamber stone as a tool within this setting helps charge the final image of the hush bubble. A bit of descriptive repetition (“gently luminous,” humming, storm of light) keeps this just below elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass humming pavilion, spiral stairs, broken prism, and celestial dome are vivid, specific, and tightly woven into the action rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental details such as the hum modulating and the starlight splitting directly shape the beats and charge the final image. The world beyond (fallen cities, scattered settlements) is efficiently sketched yet clearly informs the weight of the beacon. This is an unusually strong integration of setting and event for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the stormlit observatory above the clouds, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog all feel fresh and sensorially concrete. Environmental features don’t just decorate; the impossible shadows and solid fog actively enable the key conceptual turn about time and memory. The world’s rules (lightning that never strikes, fog with a timeline) are strange but internally consistent and learned via action rather than exposition. The final image of the silent, thawed forecourt and the observatory as “sentinel of time” effectively charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    The blooming fortress, scented vines, starless sky, and responsive mosaics create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is strongly filtered through Marlo’s sensibility as a fireworks designer. The environment matters: the darkness, flowers, and mosaic geometry all condition how the secret can be revealed and how the theme of light/dark is felt. The kerosene knot and fortress architecture effectively function as tools and stage for revelation rather than mere backdrop. It stops short of 9-band only because the setting, while lush, does not quite constrain Marlo’s options with real pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and encroaching tide are vividly realized and deeply integrated with Elian’s perception, avoiding generic seaside imagery. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain physical options, but it strongly shapes thought, metaphor, and the final image of isolated pools becoming “unified and whole.” The jade cicada as a recurring object is especially effective in charging the last beat with persistence-through-change. Overall, setting functions as more than backdrop, though it exerts symbolic rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bunker and the xenial trellis are sensuously rendered, with strong smell, touch, and visual detail tied to Elara’s perceptions (“air smelled like rain and starlight,” “cloud’s belly”). The environment meaningfully shapes experience—floating, vines, and cosmic vibrations define how she collects silences—even if it doesn’t force difficult tactical choices. World rules (gravity inversion, trellis above clouds) stay internally consistent within this lyric mode. The trellis and doll both charge the final image, giving the setting real atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prism terraces, floating gardens, humming rails, and refracted light are vivid and create a distinct, coherent atmosphere. Setting is well integrated with action—the prisms’ hum and light shifts signal changes in the terrace’s state, and the vial’s placement at the largest prism feels spatially grounded. Still, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains options or impose tangible limits on Elara’s choices. It’s strong, poetic worldbuilding that could become excellent if it exerted more concrete pressure on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The domed city, artificial moon, chrome horizon, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and hidden orchard are vividly drawn and give the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Setting details often dovetail with action—the waterfall as threshold, paint layers on the temple as literal barriers to peel back, the stairway bending light. At times, description drifts toward postcard/expository (“a phenomenon so rare that most citizens believed it was merely legend”) rather than strictly pressure-linked. Still, the recurring environment of water/light, orchard, and temple clearly charges the final images and supports the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ashen sanctuary under starlight is vividly rendered and tonally precise, with details like skeletal stained-glass frames and ash-thickened stone doing real atmospheric work. Setting is filtered through Elara’s gaze and ties to theme: a hollowed chapel as a refuge for voluntary emptiness that has become a beacon. The environment and the threshold function as constraints—the fading barrier and encroaching dark are not just backdrop but the structural problem. It stops short of fully embodied tactical interaction with space, but it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mushroom farm is vivid and sensorially specific (humidity, bioluminescent caps, damp earth/ozone) and tonally supports the uncanny-hopeful atmosphere. Setting details are integrated into action (mushrooms brightening, trembling ground) rather than static description. The environment contributes symbolically and visually to the ritual but only lightly constrains choices; Leo could do a near-identical ritual in another strange locus. Strong, evocative work, though not yet using setting as a full tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, and gramophone create a strong, unified atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The room’s history as the site of ancestral manipulation and the gramophone as a tool-object give the setting genuine narrative weight. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain choices, it does conceptually: this is the room where family truth and lies are literally encoded and decoded. The final return to the room’s “sepia stillness” and softened shadows charges the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and endless night are vividly realized, with purposeful details like glowing, color-shifting fruit and the gear-hung tree that directly anchor the climactic action. Setting evolves with events—the orchard responds to his movement, then the greenhouse walls dissolve, and the endless night shatters into dawn—so the environment clearly charges the final image. Sensory focus is heavily visual but feels appropriate to the knight’s attention and the story’s mode. The one weakness is occasional near-generic mystical phrasing (“factually mystical,” “shivering bliss”) that blurs, rather than sharpens, some otherwise strong images.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The foster care file room is vividly rendered through fluorescent hum, dust, manila folders, and ledger textures, all filtered through Elias’s archivist eye. The setting is not just backdrop: the room’s bureaucratic sterility and forgotten shelves actively frame the emotional stakes and are reweighted in the final image when he no longer sees “just boxes of sorrow.” The infantryman’s button functions as a micro-setting object that charges the climax. While strong and purposeful, the environment doesn’t quite constrain choices in a way that would push this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is one of the story’s strongest elements: puddles on cobblestones, the auric lagoon, the dusty shed, and the obsolete Phoenix Communications booth are vivid and specific. Environment use is purposeful—the puddles and lagoon’s light-based properties directly shape their communication methods and tactics, not just the backdrop. World rules around “the Revision” and the Ministry feel internally consistent without over-explaining. The final image of the lagoon shimmering with “memories” successfully charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: the misty path, radiant grotto, and cracked prism atrium are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through a musician’s attention to light and sound. Environmental elements aren’t mere backdrop; the atrium’s glass physically modulates his music into scattered light, and the dewdrops/time-of-day frame his responsibility. The grotto’s secrecy and the locals’ avoidance also underline his isolation and the hidden nature of the battle. While the place could pressure his tactics even more overtly, the environment clearly charges the final image and the story’s mood.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, floating gardens, and ash-colored trees are vivid and specific, with details consistently filtered through Elias’s occupational eye (seeds, leaves, monuments). Setting isn’t just backdrop: the Arbor’s suspended nature, drifting leaves, and balcony collection practices are directly tied to his project and to the climactic projection of leaf-language onto the sky. Objects-as-setting (seeds, moonstone dust, monuments) also charge the final image of the room becoming “infinite.” A slight excess of descriptive lushness in places prevents this from feeling absolutely taut, but it’s still a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and integrated: the subterranean workshop, neglected greenhouse, and waterfall chamber are well-textured and spatially coherent. Environmental elements shape choices—the lack of tools, the dark stair, and the cold pool all constrain his options—and the waterfall and compass jointly charge the final image. Details feel filtered through his sensibility as a tinkerer (gears, springs, mechanisms) rather than a generic tour of scenery. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk or discomfort in the cavern could deepen the environment’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-washed foundry is vividly and economically rendered—the smell of sulfur, the rain on tin, the cooled forge—and the environment meaningfully shapes mood and options (he’s enclosed with tools, alone after the search disbands). Objects-as-setting (the scales, coin, melting pot, Lyra’s unfinished sculpture) are used repeatedly and reweighted at the end. The rain and storm frame the emotional weather and the final step into the storm without feeling like mere cliché. It stops just shy of 9-band because the foundry constrains action more atmospherically than tactically—he never quite has to navigate a concrete constraint the space imposes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Echo Gorge is vividly realized and tightly integrated: the swallowed and fractured sound, “misaligned harp” acoustics, and hidden sunrise all shape how souls are summoned and released. The environment actively participates in the method (echoes wrapping his melody, gorge humming along) and in closure (harp falling silent, gorge whispering a “symphony of release”). The crocodile tooth works as a micro-setting/recurring object that charges the final image when he presses it into the earth. A slight excess of similar tonal descriptors keeps it shy of the very top band, but the setting is a genuine strength.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ultraviolet forest is sensorially rich (“sickly violet glow,” “ozone and decay”) and integrated with mood, and the bark/earth details ground the body as micro-setting. The environment conceptually matters as a space of “ultraviolet penance,” and the light’s shift from sharp violet to indigo at the climax charges the final image. However, the forest exerts little concrete pressure on action; Kael’s choices and constraints would be similar in many other alien or punitive settings. The worldbuilding stays evocative rather than functionally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemist’s market, glowing ropes, mist, bottled starlight, and the rooftop height create a vivid, specific atmosphere that clearly reflects the liminal “between worlds” theme. Details are filtered through her translator’s sensibility (whispers of forgotten languages, hidden details in paintings), which strengthens POV. The setting serves more as a charged backdrop than as a constraint on action; it rarely narrows options or forces tactics. The fragment as object is strongly used to charge the final image, which helps push this into a high band despite the mostly decorative role of place.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered, from dust and peeling gilt to the dead fluorescents and calliope echoes, and all of it is filtered through his professional and occult focus on ceilings. The environment directly shapes action (ladder, lath and plaster, hidden cavity) and meaning (cracks as wound, then as riddle solved). The circus context enriches the trapeze accident and the tonal blend of faded spectacle and lingering grief. Description edges toward lush, but it remains purposeful and integrated with his investigative process.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass orchard library, cloud-sea, frost, and bottle create a vivid, coherent environment that’s consistently filtered through Elias’s work and habits. Setting images are not mere backdrop: the frost delivers messages, the cloud-sea represents both threat and final destination, and the glass orchard becomes the arena of his de-identification. World rules (negotiable reality, compressed time in bottles) are strange but internally steady. The space could constrain his tactics more explicitly, but it still charges the final image of the leap with real atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The baroque asteroid museum, visible time, and maintenance suite are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the Chronal Refraction and drifting light become literal tools in his method, and the meteor storm frames the ritual and tone. The crystal shard as micro-setting/object is especially effective, charging the final image. A slight excess of decorative description in the halls keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The workshop, resonance chamber, bells, and twilight-stricken town are sensuously and specifically rendered, with details (bells amplifying tiny sounds, stone pulsing, starlight filaments) tightly integrated into the magic system. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s craft-focused perspective, giving the world a tactile, lived-in feel rather than a generic fantasy gloss. The resonance chamber and the music box itself materially shape tactics and the final image; the environment isn’t just backdrop but a tool and constraint. A slight excess of decorative phrasing in places keeps it just shy of top-tier economy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the mill town’s new silence, the limestone cliffs, and especially the subterranean lagoon are rendered with vivid, multi-sensory specificity that feels both physical and numinous. Details are filtered through Elias’s obsessions—sound and scent—so atmosphere and character are tightly fused. The environment meaningfully shapes action (the factory’s closure makes the cliffs approachable; the fissure and downward pull of the cave govern the delve; the lagoon is functionally a terminal choice point). A touch more attention to spatial logistics during the descent could push this toward absolute top-tier, but as is, the world feels meticulously tuned to the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-tossed archway, cliffs, lighthouse, tide pools, and shoreline are vividly evoked and consistently threaded through the action. Environmental detail serves the atmosphere and concept (sea/land, past/future alliances) and the recurring cave/archway setting charges the final image. However, the storm and landscape rarely impose concrete constraints on Lyra’s choices—they frame rather than force decisions. Strong textural work and coherence, but limited functional pressure keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The settings—the snow-streaked studio, the concentric circles of postcards, the amber pavilion and chapel with botanical stained glass—are vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the story’s nocturnal, contemplative mood. Environmental details like light angles on etched glass and seasonal shifts do meaningful thematic work, charging her realizations about hidden ecosystems. The world feels coherent and textured, though the setting rarely constrains immediate choices beyond providing the discovery site. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength and strongly supports the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating library, gondola, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly and economically drawn, with strong sensory and tonal specificity (“bruised violet,” “ledger of grief”). Setting actively constrains action—the zeppelin as vantage and haven, the lagoon as dangerous surface, the beach debris as limited communicative medium—and the final image (debris circle around the zeppelin’s shadow) directly charges closure. World rules (memory-eating water, retrocognitive visions via contact) are consistent enough at this length. A slight overreliance on visual and abstract metaphor keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is vividly rendered—the glass-smooth sand, salt-bleached wood, and self-lit lanterns create a strong atmosphere, and later details (lantern makers, fishermen, schoolhouse, market) feel particular rather than generic. The lanterns function as a visual barometer of his indecision and then resolve (dimming, then brightening) which ties setting into the emotional and conceptual stakes. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices; it’s more a charged backdrop than an active agent, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard garden on a skyscraper, the engineered soil, foghorn, greenhouse dome, and wax cylinder are vivid and integrated into Elias’s perceptions and work. Setting is strongly filtered through his professional lens (extinct watering chants, emotional archives beneath his feet), which keeps it from feeling like a mere backdrop. The environment does help charge the final image (garden responding, leaves rustling in synchrony as he transforms), though it constrains mood more than concrete choice. A bit less ornamental lushness and a bit more direct pressure from the physical space would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound atrium under starlight, crystalline dome, and geometric ice patterns are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the magic of decreasing entropy. The environment constrains tactics (she must use the acorn cap and ice floor rather than brute force) and charges the final image with the cap fused into the glowing floor. Worldbuilding (Temporal Stasis Chamber, node of absolute order) is economical yet evocative, learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The setting’s atmosphere (cold, still, glacial time) meshes thematically with entropy and stasis in a way that actively shapes the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sanctuary above the clouds, “sea of white,” high-altitude thin air, and aurora over cloud tops produce a strong, coherent atmosphere that suits the premise. Environmental specifics—anomalous sound transmission, wind shifts, the bell’s reach into the valleys—meaningfully tie the setting to the central problem. Tools and objects (anemometer, control panel, bell rope) are integrated into the physical environment and the work. The sensory palette skews visual and conceptual, but the wind and silence motif give the place a lived, distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shooting star tracking station and the cosmic dust milieu are vividly evoked and well-integrated with Elara’s role and mood; details like “monitors long since powered down” and the last functioning post create a strong atmosphere of obsolescence. The yellow lantern glass functions as a charged micro-setting object that anchors key beats and the final image. World rules are consistent at a mythic level, and the environment clearly mirrors her internal solitude. The setting, however, rarely constrains specific choices; it’s more backdrop and echo than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The beekeeping oasis, scorched wasteland, and stained glass box are vivid and integrated, with details like “impossible amber,” heat waves, and bees swarming the glass giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The setting’s rules (ghosts, geometry, oasis) are consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps. Environment meaningfully charges the final image—the oasis as rare refuge where this covenant can exist—though it rarely constrains specific tactical choices in the moment. Overall, the world feels fresh, tactile, and thematically aligned with fragility and preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The emerald silo and the lower levels provide a distinct, mildly uncanny setting, and the detail “where the emerald silo casts no shadow” is evocative. Still, the environment remains lightly sketched—air gets colder, walls echo—but rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices beyond “descend to find the alcove.” World rules about “after numbers changed meaning” and time’s fragility are gestured at but not materially integrated into scene or action. The setting supports tone and concept but could do much more work to shape pressure and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the cobalt lagoon, petrichor, damp sand, fronds, tide—anchoring mood and action from the outset. Environment meaningfully shapes behavior (the poet’s position in wet sand, the urgency of catching the kite before it hits water, the tide reclaiming the sculpture). The lagoon’s colors and post-rain stillness are woven into the emotional cadence and explicitly charge the final image (“shimmered behind them, a mirror to the burnished hush within”). Detail is selective rather than touristic, firmly filtered through the poet’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The temple orchard, living pillars, and copper-wrapped branches are vividly and economically rendered, with details consistently filtered through Kaelen’s botanical/architectural attention. Setting is not mere backdrop: the specific interaction of oak, stone, and metal underpins the entire premise and charges the final image of the wires glowing and pillars leaning toward trees. While environment doesn’t force moment-to-moment tactical choices, it fundamentally defines what choices are even possible, giving the piece a memorable spatial and atmospheric identity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and texturally consistent: “rainwashed tower,” “spring-soaked earth,” eroded statues, and the overgrown sculpture path all filter through Aris’s sensibility and mood. Environment and object-as-setting matter—rain, height, footprints, and the empty pedestal structure the action and the final image rather than feeling like backdrop. At times the description verges on decorative (“bronze quiet,” “gaping wound to the sky”) without always constraining choice, which keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s greatest strength: the dead reef, hollow ocean, blooming jetty, spectral horses, and “language of the waves” create a vivid, coherent world. The jetty is not mere backdrop; it’s the ritual site, “battlefield,” and eventual garden, and the tide’s motion interacts with his act of seeding. Detail selection is largely purposeful and tonally unified, even if occasionally verging on decorative. The final image of luminescent roots on the jetty charges the environment with clear symbolic and narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, twin moons, and “scrap-pile mountains” are sharply drawn and filtered through Elias’s technical, tactile attention. The phonograph, wax leaf, and improvised thermal setup act as tools/settings that directly enable action, not mere backdrop, and the final image of moons over junk reinforces the tone. Worldbuilding around the post–resource war remains somewhat broad, but it doesn’t contradict itself. The environment constrains options and charges the final image, though not quite with the depth or pressure that would push into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the time dilation observation deck, frozen chrono-lab, and “black velvet” void all feel specific and atmospherically cohesive. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility, especially the plasteel window and the chrono-lab as a “glitched hologram of panic,” which marry worldbuilding with his guilt. The gilded compass rose and parchments function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly “constrain tactics” beyond situating the shimmer, it consistently shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    The icebound spire, wrong-colored sky, and labyrinthine workshop are vividly rendered, with memorable touches like “air…thin enough to taste like broken glass” and “bells in a blizzard.” Setting interacts with action in meaningful ways: the precarious climb, the unguarded skylight, and the wrong/right sky all shape tactics and outcome. The environment could constrain choices a bit more in the middle beat, where the chess table temporarily becomes an abstract stage. Still, the recurring sky and spire images charge the final reset, giving the setting a strong atmospheric and structural role.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The National Archives rotunda, whispering gallery acoustics, dust on marble, and pawnless chessboard create a strong, specific atmosphere that’s tightly braided with theme. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s concerns as a “historian of small gestures,” so details feel purposeful rather than touristic. The chessboard and dusted floor not only decorate but structurally charge the final images. A small additional moment where the environment constrains or complicates action (rather than symbolizing it) would push this toward the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the living, rearranging mountain-bookstore and the mercury-glass mirror produce a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Environmental details (reordering shelves, endless corridors, the mountain “holding its breath”) mirror and support her internal transformation. The bookstore and its artifacts are the only place this story could logically occur, and they meaningfully charge the final image. A slight check is that the environment rarely constrains concrete choices moment-to-moment; it mostly enables and echoes them.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich—“cobblestones… slick with the memory of rain,” the “woven hush,” the platinum corridors and rain at the end all create a strong atmosphere. The environment does some thematic mirroring (frozen village vs. emotional stasis; storm breaking vs. guilt release) and the tapestry/labyrinth are well-integrated physical anchors. However, the world’s rules (e.g., “time-frozen” vs. moving storm) are more evocative than functionally constraining; they rarely force or limit concrete choices. The piece excels in mood and image, slightly less in using setting to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bone towers, mist, and echoing canyon are vivid and integrated into the story’s mechanics: echoes as medium, towers as conductors, the spire as containment. The setting isn’t mere backdrop—it directly shapes how Elaran can act (climbing the highest bone tower, using the canyon’s acoustics to refract and amplify poetry). The sensory palette is strong on visual and auditory, with an atmospherically consistent, funereal tone. A slightly wider range of tactile or bodily interaction with the environment under peak pressure could push this even higher.

    The floating gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vivid, specific, and integrated into action—the bobbing, the metal hull, and especially the flooding wave that submerges him. The key ring, statue, acid water, and mechanical heart all feel tactically present rather than postcard details, and the environment’s hostility shapes his methods (holding breath, charm absorbing acid). The final image of the workshop humming in harmony with the acid sea elegantly recharges prior setting details. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond visual and a bit of tactile) could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is a major strength: the quay, the narrow path, the “phosphorescent moss” and tide pools as “scattered jewels” all feel vivid and tactile. The coastal cave network is not mere backdrop; its cool, glowing, liminal quality mirrors and enables the internal shift, and the tide pool becomes the literal stage for the decisive act. Details are well-chosen rather than encyclopedic, and the environment evolves with the character’s movement. The cave and tide pool also charge the final images conceptually, linking place to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, salt air, and the conjured “midnight garden” create a vivid, sensorially layered atmosphere that clearly reflects Elias’s inner state. Setting is tightly filtered through his perspective (the lighthouse as “messenger by design”), and the garden scent becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. The environment influences meaning more than logistics; it doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does constrain what “sending a message” can look like in this world. Overall, specificity and tonal fit are high enough for near-immediate publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The starlit signal station, failed hydraulics, silent antennas, and the rotary phone create a vivid, atmospheric container that consistently reflects his isolation and stalled communication. The censer foot operates as a charged micro-setting/object, physically central to the action and anchoring the final image. Environmental details are selective and purposeful—cold floor, dusty glass, indifferent stars—serving mood and theme without feeling like a catalog. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it strongly charges the emotional and thematic stakes and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hanging orchard over a storm-battered ravine is vivid, tactile, and integrated: suspended trees, rope nets, and the ravine wall all feel spatially coherent and tonally apt. Weather and environment genuinely press on action (storms, lightning, the precarious ravine), and the orchard’s isolation directly supports the psychological stakes. Professional detail (truffle foraging, roots piercing the ravine wall) is plausible enough and filtered through Elara’s priorities. The one missed opportunity is that the ravine’s physical danger never quite constrains tactics at the climax; the setting feels more atmospheric than fate-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and tonally integrated: “opal dock,” mist, circular lighthouse interior with its glass case of objects all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Hemlock’s vocation and sensibility, reinforcing atmosphere rather than reading as a tourist catalog. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the final image—the dock as a locus of absence/presence, the lighthouse as repository of witnessed solitude. Very strong atmospheric work, just shy of using environment as active pressure on action.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the antique map shop, the swelling creek, the pulsing bioluminescent cavern, and the map-room of choices all have strong sensory presence and tonal unity. Details like “night-blooming jasmine” and the fungi’s glow are integrated into action rather than separate tours, and the recurring creek nicely mirrors the story’s concern with time and carved paths. The environment does not heavily constrain his tactics—he could, in theory, find the doorway in many fantasy environs—but it does charge the images and thematic frame. Overall, the world feels lived-in and purposeful without over-explaining its magic.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Atmosphere is vivid and coherent: storm season, mist, ridge, cobalt grotto, ember grotto, and bleeding starlight all create a strong, specific fantastical environment. The setting is filtered through the queen’s perception and directly tied to her past and identity, especially the grotto-as-former-home reveal and the starlight-turned-ruby veins. While the environment does not heavily constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully charge the final revelation and reframe her entire life. The balance of weather, terrain, and cavern detail supports tone without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ember nexus, pocket-sun, and nautilus shell create a vivid, specific, and coherent environment that feels intrinsic to the magic system and to Elara’s perception. Setting is not postcard decoration: the nexus’s temporal elasticity and molten energy, and the columella refracting the pocket-sun’s light, actively shape what is possible and charge the final image. The world-building stays focused and integrated with action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mountain ranger cabin, thin air, dusk colors, and howling wind are vividly rendered and tied to his mood (“bruised purples,” breath visible in the cold). Setting details are well-filtered through his sensibility (the scroll as ancient anchor, the grave in a clearing). However, the environment rarely constrains action or choices; it mainly provides atmosphere and metaphor. The mountain air in the last line does help charge the final image, lifting the score somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock shop and morning fog are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s altered sensory hierarchy (sight, touch, imagined scent). The recurring objects—water clock, fog, screw, loupe—are not just decorative; they charge the emotional arc and inform the final image as the fog lifts and the clock keeps time. Micro-setting functions almost as a character, with the clock’s drip underscoring time and endurance. This materially charges closure even if it doesn’t hard-constrain physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock platform, churning clouds, enchanted lanterns, and tea all contribute to a very specific, atmospheric setting that is tightly bound to the emotional stakes. The “held breath” between storms and the constricting weather pressure shape both the window for action and Aeris’s bodily experience of stress. The platform surface becomes literal page, and the transformed tool/body (crystal hand/quill) functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. World rules (runic grammar, storm magic) are implied through action rather than dumped, maintaining economy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sheet music archive is vividly rendered—the “fine dust on the shelves,” rolling ladder, and “forgotten symphonies and arias” all support mood and character. The orchard and its impending destruction nicely echo the themes of preservation and loss, even if they stay mostly atmospheric. The archive and bottle environment do meaningfully charge the final image as she returns the bottle to the shelf as a “quiet monument.” More sensory texture during the climax could push this higher, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ancient temple library is vividly and consistently rendered, with spiraling columns, shifting corridors, and the altar of floating words; it clearly anchors who/where and sustains the mystic tone. Environment actively responds to his mental state and ultimately dissolves to reveal “the interconnected web of all realities,” charging the final image. The softcover dictionary and word-cloud function as key micro-settings/objects that constrain what he can do. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual might elevate it further, but as-is the setting is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fjord-top horizon station, hydraulic clocks, glass faces, and logbook are concrete and consistently filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. Setting and tools are not just backdrop; they’re the very medium of his obsession and are present in the opening, the experiment, and the final key-in-hand image. The “fjord quiet” and high vantage effectively create a contemplative, almost monastic atmosphere that suits the philosophical arc. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it clearly charges the imagery and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and specific, with recurring details (misty aisles, phosphorescent caps, drifting spores) that feel lived-in rather than touristic. Setting is tightly integrated with theme: the permeable mushroom caps and airborne spores concretize “letting the right things through,” and the final image of spores rising recharges this metaphor. Spatial sense is coherent as Elias moves through aisles and curtains of fungus, and the environment actively shapes the mood. The only ceiling is that the setting rarely constrains tangible options; it mainly charges perception and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and purposeful: the rainwashed library, damp paper, ozone, subway cars, and busker’s violin all mirror Elara’s emotional state and the theme of ordered systems versus messy life. The mica-pane lantern functions as a micro-setting object, its warm, diffuse light contrasting with hospital fluorescence and charging the final image as the father holds it. Weather and environment don’t heavily constrain choices, but they consistently inflect tone and meaning rather than serving as backdrop only. The specificity stays anchored in Elara’s perception rather than becoming a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered (“spiraling glass staircase,” “smelled of rust and ozone”) and integrated with the premise: Cold War origins, underground isolation, and acoustics that “preserved every conversation.” Environmental features like the rats, dampness, and glass booth deepen mood without feeling ornamental. The tunnel’s acoustics and avoidance by “other denizens” subtly charge the phone and disc with eerie significance. Still, the setting shapes tone and mythology more than it constrains concrete choices, which keeps it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming jetty, luminous flowers, and ink-filled conservatory are vivid and sensorially specific, and the recurring jetty/flower image meaningfully charges the final scene where the giant bloom encloses the locket. Setting is filtered through Elias’s archivist lens (e.g., jars as moments), which gives it a strong POV bias. World rules about blooming at anniversaries and the covenant under the water remain consistent, though the underwater cities stay largely conceptual. The environment does shape options at the end—the jetty literally receding as he completes his work—though the piece could lean even more on physical constraint in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The disused, ivy-overgrown railway station is vivid and tonally apt, with tactile, olfactory detail (“damp earth and rust”) and the cupola providing a purposeful micro-setting shift. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the ladder ascent “like climbing out of a tomb” and the symphony of sound in the glass dome directly charge the final realization about listening. Use of the ivy as an early point of connection and echo of life in an abandoned place subtly mirrors the theme. A small limitation is that the station’s disuse doesn’t materially constrain options beyond metaphorical weight, keeping it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ultrasonic forest is richly realized and integrated into Kael’s sensory experience—sound, vibration, and the ring’s responses all arise from the setting. The environment genuinely constrains how he navigates and how the “map” can exist, and it charges the final image when the whole forest resolves into “a single, perfect note.” Occasionally the description tilts toward lush for its own sake, but it remains legible and thematically aligned. The ring functions as a micro-setting as well, tied cleanly to the environment and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gravitational anomaly, warped skyline, crystal page, and star-signal residue create a distinct, coherent environment that feels lived-in and tonally aligned. Setting is not merely decorative: the anomaly visibly responds to each historical edit, effectively externalizing internal stakes and charging the final image (“a heartbeat in the chaos,” “gentle embrace”). The recurring object-as-setting of the pen and anomaly together constrains choices and shapes the closure image. A bit more sensory variety beyond visual and faint auditory cues could push this toward the very top tier, but as-is it’s strong and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor setting is vivid and sustained—the silvered water, lighthouse, and moonlit glow recur and evolve, clearly filtered through Julian’s artistic gaze. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain their options, it does meaningfully charge the imagery and final moment, especially the old lighthouse as “sentinel of forgotten time.” Details stay focused on light, water, and silence, reinforcing the theme rather than drifting into cataloguing. The camera as a tool-object and the harbor together create a convincing, atmospheric stage, but the setting’s influence remains more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The settings—the mountain-shadow exile, cartographer’s shed, ruined archive, and waterfall cave—are vivid and sensorial (“air smelled of dust and forgotten ink,” “cave behind a waterfall”). Environment mostly serves as atmospheric support and resource rather than a constraining force, though the hiddenness of the library and the physical act of burning near water nicely charge the final image. Details are selective and filtered through Elara’s artistic/archival sensibility. There’s room for a bit more interaction between terrain and choice, but what’s here is strong and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden and the auric lagoon are vividly rendered, with strong sensory and conceptual specificity (crystalline stalks humming, auroras of sound and light). The environment is not just a backdrop; it responds to Kael’s drumming and carries the story’s emotional and thematic weight into the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains his choices in concrete, tactical ways—it’s more a responsive, symbolic field than a limiting physical environment. Still, as a microcosm for the dream’s embodiment, it’s effective and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shipping-container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly evoked and tied to function—acoustics, humming metal, the converging energy in the central chamber. Kael’s familiarity with the maze plus the folded maps gives the setting a lived-in and systemic feel rather than a generic backdrop. Still, the environment rarely forces hard choices; it enables his success more than it constrains him under pressure. The final charged image (labyrinth’s heart, glowing coin, subsiding storm) is strong but could lean harder on concrete, sensory specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canal, cobalt dock, rain, and reflective water are vivid and thematically integrated, especially in the opening image of puddles “holding the sky” and the closing interplay of stars and reflections. The environment and the dental mirror jointly enable the core mechanic of light patterns; the world feels coherent and tactile even in lyric mode. Setting is more atmospheric than constraining—nothing in the physical layout forces difficult choices—but it does meaningfully charge the final image and the guardian’s role as a liminal sentinel. Overall, specificity is strong and purposeful without bloating the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt library, mist, magnetic grotto, and observatory are vividly evoked and tonally unified, with strong visual texture (“starlight…like scattered silver coins”). Setting details are filtered through Arthur’s sensibility and clearly support the mood and theme of liminal thought and quiet rebellion. However, these places rarely constrain what is possible or force specific choices; they’re more atmospheric than actively tactical. The setting enriches the story but stops short of becoming structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oceanic setting—sublittoral fringe, reefs, disappearing island, the tree of whalebone charms—is vivid and sensorially grounded, with selective details (“latticed shadows,” warm shallows) that support mood and theme. The recurring objects (scrimshaw, charms) and thresholds (dock/shallows/depths/island) meaningfully charge the final image of her back at the dock, changed. Environment constrains options somewhat (she must dive, follow currents, cross from dock world into myth-world), though it doesn’t overtly complicate tactics in the climax. It’s strong, atmospheric worldbuilding that could be pushed one notch further into concrete constraint at the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The farmhouse beneath the three hundred turbines and the “remade hush” create a strong, specific atmosphere that supports the theme of regulated emotion. Details like shavings “like snow” and turbines as “mechanical breath” integrate setting with mood rather than sitting as backdrop. The bouquet and carvings function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. The turbines themselves, while visually striking, don’t significantly constrain choices beyond mood, keeping this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the frozen lake, cobalt atrium, and humming quartz colonnade are sensorially rich and integrated with action (he studies, touches, and moves through the pillars). The environment meaningfully constrains choice—the colonnade and its hum are the literal and metaphysical barrier, and the atrium’s altered physics signal the new state of being. Recurring details like the lake and hum reappear at the end to charge the final image of his shadow and the mirrored possibilities. This is a strong, immersive world whose rules feel consistent within its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard, Lyra’s workshop, and the post-phoenix world are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“fractured light,” molten glass, the gardens) that feel filtered through Leo’s constrained perception. Setting and recurring objects (glass, plants, reed) are not mere backdrop; they frame the bargain and charge the final image when color finally floods the same spaces. The micro-setting of Lyra’s courtyard directly shapes tactics—Leo must use its plants and Lyra’s tools to get what he wants—which strengthens integration. A slightly broader sense of the phoenix-altered world’s social texture could enrich atmosphere further, but what’s present is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid, specific, and tightly woven into action—shelves, tuning forks, power grid hum, and golden shadows continually interact with the bell ringer’s choices. The miner’s lens and the lab environment together charge the final image as the space shifts from archive to “sanctuary of music reborn.” World rules (electricity, silence, vibration) are consistent and learned through sensory observation rather than expository dump. The setting strongly supports tone and theme without overwhelming momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory is vivid and thematically tuned: brass dome, shifting star maps, a telescope of possibilities in a space "outside of normal chronology" all feel concrete and charged. Setting details filter through Elian’s craft and grief, tying environment to vocation (maps he traces, metal he etches). The observatory’s properties (timelessness, curtains of intention) directly underwrite the premise of teaching across eras and charge the final image of constellations of change. A bit more tactile engagement in-scene (temperature, sounds, physical constraints) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, tarot deck, and antique measuring tape are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The recurring rain/skylight image bookends the piece and charges the final image of “rain-beaded stars” nicely. The measuring tape functions almost as a micro-setting/tool, tying environment to method and heritage. While the weather and space don’t strongly constrain choices, they do meaningfully color the tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground archive, the shafts of twilight, and the bronze prism pagoda are vivid and coherent, and the alignment of light to object gives the place a functional rule. Still, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains her options—beyond the twilight requirement, the archive doesn’t significantly alter tactics or introduce new pressure, so the setting feels evocative but not yet fully exploited as a driver of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly specific and integral: the “blooming library above clouds,” breathing shelves, and floating gardens are consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility and thematically tied to preservation and fragility. Environmental elements actively shape meaning—the shadow gardens, the crystalline window, and the river stone’s placement in the viewing chamber all charge the final images. World rules around shareable dreams and hope crystallization are clear enough and stay internally consistent. This atmosphere would be difficult to swap out without breaking the story’s logic and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The misty workshop, skylights, and starlight are vivid and consistently filtered through Maria’s eye, and the recurring detail of the chameleon’s tail under varying light charges the atmosphere. Setting and object work together to support the meditative, almost surgical tone of her reconstruction. The environment, however, mainly serves mood rather than materially constraining her options or actions.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tower-at-dawn office, coffee rings, plants, and frosted hourglass create a coherent, atmospheric micro-setting that fits Maya’s interiority. The hourglass and coffee rings recur meaningfully and charge the final image, especially the hourglass-as-scar metaphor. Setting doesn’t much constrain action—she could arguably reach the same decisions in another room—but it does strongly support mood and theme. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional/emotional lens rather than generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The projection booth, film, and “hushed thunder” of the unseen auditorium are vividly evoked and tonally aligned with the story’s liminal concerns. Details like aged film, ozone, and the hum of the projector feel particular and lived-in rather than touristic. However, the environment mostly serves as atmosphere and metaphor rather than truly constraining options or shaping tactics; he could almost conduct this reading anywhere with the strip. The setting does subtly charge the final image through the cutting-room-floor metaphor but stops short of being structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The aurora-lit archway, snow-dusted stones, and stardust are vividly realized and recur in meaningful ways, especially the archway’s pulsing and dimming that bracket the experience. The astrolabe as a handled object is integrated into action rather than static description and charges the final image. The environment mostly serves mood and symbolism rather than concrete constraint, but it does frame the “door to somewhere else” glimpse in a satisfying way. A touch more tactile interaction with the cold, the arch, or weather shaping her options would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through the guard’s professional and affective lens: glowing dune, luminescent “ghost flowers,” ravenous sky, and the shifting apparitions of the archive. Environmental details are not mere wallpaper: pressing his palm to a particular bloom triggers access, and the toxic/acidic landscape charges the stakes of planting the seedling. Recurring objects (crystals, chess clock, dune) meaningfully charge the final image. The world’s rules—post-forest-burn future with probabilistic archives—remain internally consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly and consistently realized, with specific materials (brass vines, copper trunks, birch-like aluminum, oak-wrought iron) and the artificial breezes creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Setting is well integrated with action and concept: different tree species producing distinct frequencies directly inform the “key” Elian uses. The recurring small gear and the trees’ hum charge the final image of the gear reshaping to Elian’s neural pattern. While environment doesn’t impose hard constraints, it meaningfully shapes method and thematic charge, just shy of the absolute sharpness expected at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “veiled ridgeway,” overlapping horizons, and shoreline imagery create a strong, consistent liminal atmosphere. Setting is specific in its surreal logic (ticket punch making star-paths, mirror-pool of possibilities) and clearly integrated with the metaphysics. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choices—the characters rarely have to adapt tactics because of the ridgeway’s properties. The final pool image does good work thematically but still reads more like a symbolic set-piece than an active pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and cold mechanical hum are vivid and recur with purposeful variation, and the dusty spiral staircase and west-wing piano room are spatially coherent. Environmental details like the cold, the dust, and the fortress’s machinery are integrated into action (discoloration, the bolt in the dust, the chill of the wing). The setting also supports tone and theme: the fortress as a machine of erasure and control. While the environment does not heavily constrain tactical options beyond chill and isolation, it clearly charges both his investigation and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient, decaying temple library and drifting constellations are vividly drawn and strongly atmospheric, with details like “dust motes danced in the bands of starlight” and tilting shelves reinforcing thematic instability. The micro-setting is clear and tactile; the iron gall ink, ceramic dish, and reed brush give the magic a grounded, physical locus. While the environment supports theme and mood and slightly shapes tactics (he can only act through books), it rarely constrains moment-to-moment choices in the climax. Still, the final stabilization of the library nicely charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sea level station and ocean graveyard are vividly rendered and threaded through nearly every paragraph in tactile, voice-filtered ways (“creaked like a dying whale,” “salt-fried parchment”). Setting is not just backdrop; it embodies the stakes of climate loss and frames his role as caretaker, then charges the final image of him stepping into the tide. The station’s “eternally periodic pulse” functioning as a heartbeat at the end is a strong integration of environment with thematic closure. Minor deduction only because the physical environment rarely constrains specific tactical choices beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered—the dust as galaxies, scorched tools, and embedded stone circle all cohere tonally and spatially. Setting and objects (bay, stones, opera glasses) are integrated into her actions rather than feeling like a backdrop, and the environment evolves slightly with the light shift. The stone circle in particular functions as a micro-setting that focuses and channels the turning point. While the bay doesn’t strongly constrain options, it does charge the final image and supports the atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The volcanic hot springs and reconstructed landscape are vividly evoked and meaningfully entwined with the plot—the springs both hide the amber and serve as a crucible where new species emerge. Environmental details like geothermal vents, mists, ferns, and the caldera descent are integrated into Maeva’s movement rather than offered as static backdrop. The setting also carries thematic weight by bridging “ancient sacred place” and “postwar reconstruction.” Additional sensory specificity under peak pressure could deepen atmosphere further, but the current level is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cliffside arboretum, salt wind, and abandoned lighthouse are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Maya’s attention to hardy, salt-tolerant plants. Setting and weather are thematically aligned with resilience and exposure, and plant specifics (junipers, sea thrift, sempervivum) add texture. The environment influences the metaphors more than concrete tactical choices, but it does charge the final image of her tending life at the cliff’s edge. Overall, atmosphere is immersive and purposeful without becoming a generic postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The forgotten lighthouse library is vividly rendered—waterlogged shelves, swaying tower, lantern beam—and the tarot box and cards are concretely staged. Setting and recurring objects mirror his internal state without becoming confusing, and the lighthouse beam charging the final image is effective. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices; it mainly amplifies mood and theme. Strong atmosphere, modest functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The wind-carved encampment, canyon walls, eclipse light, and sand all contribute to a distinct, coherent atmosphere. The environmental detail is filtered through his purpose—scorched earth, sand, wind erasing ink—rather than feeling like a generic desert postcard. While the setting does not tightly constrain his options, the wind and sand that erase the ink meaningfully charge the final image. The world-building rules (drone tech, disappearing ink) remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “echoing library under snow” and “dim blue emergency lighting” are vivid and repeatedly anchored, and the snow-muted city plus blinking cameras create a strong atmospheric frame. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics (she faces no concrete difficulty from the cold, shelves, or snow); it mostly serves as backdrop and metaphor. The setting does return at the end as a charged image (“shrine to her courage”), which helps resonance but not functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vivid and specific—the shimmer in the sun, etched panels, irrigation, inner-light roses—and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental details (how the wind sounds like gunfire, roses tilting to light, microscopic etchings as “language of stillness”) deepen atmosphere and theme. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces choices; it frames her worldview more than it pressures her behavior. That keeps this strong on texture but shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “sound wave garden” and “sleepwalking constellations” are vivid, specific, and consistently re-invoked, with sensory and conceptual precision that feels organic to the fisher’s worldview. Setting is not mere backdrop: the humming flowers, their drooping under imposed silence, and the sky’s unstable sorrow all interact directly with his method. The rail spike as profane object against a lyric environment charges the final image. A slight bias toward visual/abstract over fully embodied sensory detail is the only thing keeping this from the very top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory is vivid and thematically apt—the brass celestial sphere, the echoing height above clouds, and the rosewood desk all reinforce the blend of science, journalism, and regret. The old floor plan and forgotten maintenance route turn the setting into evidence rather than mere backdrop. Atmosphere is cohesive and supports the tone of haunted inquiry. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain on-page choices beyond providing archives and a vantage point, but it meaningfully charges the clues and final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” the grandmother’s desk, and the amber all feel specific and atmospheric, with concrete, evocative details like “ghosts of vibrations that had ceased but refused to fully depart.” The environment is not mere backdrop: the lab’s resonance equipment and haunted firmware shape what is possible, and the amber on the desk meaningfully charges the final acts of writing and tethering. The tone and world rules around trapped sounds and folded time stay internally consistent and feed into the closing image of a peace-filled lab. A slight excess of abstract phrasing in places (“spaces between moments”) edges toward concept over sensory texture, but doesn’t break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    The whispering grotto, mist, acoustics, and tactile media (chalk, sand, tile) are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action and theme. The grotto’s changing soundscape—from echoing whispers to emergent hush—directly shapes what Elara can perceive and do, and the whispering-gallery tile constrains a specific, spatially precise choice. Sensory detail (especially visual and tactile) is rich without losing spatial coherence. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of palm, sand, and tile as a reconfigured whispering space.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, skeletal walls, and lone minaret are vivid and thematically tuned to trauma and repair, with the tessera functioning as a charged micro-setting object. Environmental details recur and evolve—the plaza’s shadows lengthen and recede, the sky appears “less fractured,” and the minaret glints—supporting a sense of gradual healing. The setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, avoiding tourist-catalog description. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges the final image of a “garden waiting for its first bloom.”

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the empty auditorium, domed ceiling, and especially the mystic orchard with silver bark, blue leaves, and musical fruit are vivid and character-filtered. The environment meaningfully shapes events—the hidden garden is where Arthur finds and later leaves the coin, and the theater’s physical survival is the main stake. Sensory detail, particularly synesthetic tastes and sounds, deepens both atmosphere and character rather than feeling ornamental. The only limit is that the environment rarely constrains his options; it mainly empowers him.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The light painting studio, LED strips, prisms, and especially the muscovite sliver are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and theme. The environment isn’t just backdrop: it supplies the tools and constraints for her tactic of translating psychic noise into light, and the final image of refracted rainbows charges the closure. Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through an artist’s eye, avoiding generic “lab” or “studio” description. The only thing keeping this from a 9+ is that the setting, while strong, doesn’t quite impose hard limits or obstacles on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal cave network is richly evoked—humming, tidal history, damp limestone, carved hollows, iridescent fossils—and consistently filtered through Elara’s tactile, synesthetic mapping. Setting and recurring objects (fossils, humming, opalescent glow) charge the atmosphere and the final sense that “the world was waking up.” While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it is integral to tone and to the story’s central images.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amber warehouse, resin smell, canyon echo, and cliffs are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s work, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Objects like the hourglass and buttons are not just décor but active tools in the scene and recur in the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains choices; the setting feels more like a beautifully rendered stage than a pressure source. The world’s rules (echo in a jar, rising sand) are internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly realized—mist “like cold, ectoplasmic water,” frozen ground, Zephyr Bluff—and consistently filtered through Elias’s perspective. Environment is not merely scenic: deep snow enables the code, the plateau is chosen for aerial visibility, and the wind’s erasure of the cipher charges the ending with ephemerality and secrecy. The recurring physical elements (bluff, mist, snow, wind) strongly reinforce mood and theme. This environmental presence clearly constrains action and deeply charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, and damp inn-side details are vivid and tonally unified, creating a strong, tactile liminal space. Setting subtly structures the terms of action: he must wait until the rain gutters stop, the fog lifting reveals the boat, the river crossing marks a threshold from waiting to “becoming.” The yarn needle as a recurring micro-object ties past and present and is actively used at the climax. While the environment doesn’t constrain tactics in a high-stakes way, it meaningfully charges the mood and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oasis, cracked wasteland, apiary, chimney, and smoke are all vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Kael’s attention, giving the piece a rich, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: the chimney and smoke create the visual plane, the oasis’s resistance to decay is the core mystery, and the bee/honey concretize the fractured time. The faded lantern glass functions as a charged, recurring object that structures how the anomaly is seen and resolved. A few descriptive phrases edge toward ornamental, but overall specificity is purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fire escape, narrow alleys, and luminous harbor by moonlight are vivid and specific, and the reflective objects feel tactile and world-appropriate. Setting is filtered through his gardener’s eye and tool-focused attention, which gives the world a lived-in texture. Crucially, environment and tools (harbor light, angles of fire escapes, the bitting gauge) shape his tactics for redirecting light, not just the mood. A slight over-reliance on visual description keeps it shy of the very top tier, but the atmosphere is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tidal library above the clouds, brass sundial, and ancient stone circle are vivid and distinctive, and they’re filtered through Elara’s perceptions rather than feeling like a catalog. The environment mirrors her emotional rhythms (the tidal rise and fall, evening descent) and charges the final image as she looks down at the changed world. However, the setting rarely constrains action or tactics; it’s more symbolic atmosphere than lived obstacle or tool. Still, the recurring objects (sundial, stone circle) clearly charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the lotus temple, lily pond, post-storm air, and the metallic spiral all carry sensory and symbolic weight. Details are tightly filtered through Elias’s sensibility (the nest as “miniature galaxy,” the sculpture as “God’s-wort”). The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but the nest and installation function as micro-settings that shape his path and charge the final image when he looks back at the temple. Weather and space evolve meaningfully with his inner shift.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    The university radio station and Cygnus X-1 anchors give the story a plausible scientific frame, and details like headphones, control room glow, and charts add some atmosphere. Still, the environment rarely constrains choice or behavior beyond the abstract risk of being traced; we don’t feel the space shaping tactics in specific ways. Much of the world—the divided community, religious leaders, startups, military—is sketched at a distance instead of localized in concrete scenes. The final image of “celestial silence” is thematically apt but could be charged more through a stronger sense of the room and her body in it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight,” shimmering walls, and star-etched floor create a distinctive, concrete environment that feels specific to this world. Setting is not just backdrop: organ notes physically realign the space, shadows and starlight warp under spatial mutiny, and the floor’s geometry dictates where she must place the compass. Details like church organs across the countryside anchoring reality extend the setting into a broader, coherent world-rule. A touch more tactile immediacy (temperature, air, surfaces) under stress could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quarry, mist, and water are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood, from the “stone lips” opening to the quarry’s “exhaling” at the end. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s task, with the flat rock as table, the damp earth, and the abandoned museum giving a lived-in yet elegiac feel. The ribbon as object is embedded in this environment, and the mist returning at the close charges the final image. The environment does not heavily constrain choices, but it very effectively anchors atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The experimental weather station and the warped horizon (“shifting in unnatural, geometric patterns”) create a distinct, atmospheric setting that meaningfully intersects with plot—the station is literally the containment field and his prison. Details like the recirculated air, emergency lights, and groaning systems contribute to mood and situational pressure. The copper nail functions as a micro-setting object that charges the console and final image. Sensory range is somewhat narrow and leans abstract at key moments, so the environment feels evocative but could be more tactile under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    The mountain pullout, stone bridge, mist, and scaffold-wrapped construction site are vivid and tonally aligned with the liminal premise. Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a busker and “bridge” figure, and the environment (thin places, flapping wrap) is thematically crucial. However, the landscape rarely constrains her tactics in specific ways; it’s more a charged backdrop and metaphor field than an active obstacle. The final image returns to the bridge effectively, giving the place quiet resonance without fully exploiting its physical pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned circus train and the foreign bills are vivid, particular, and strongly filtered through Jasper’s sensibility; images like “iron elephants and carved horses stood petrified beneath decades of rust and weather” effectively fuse atmosphere with character. The train functions as more than backdrop: its precarious geometry and faded performers’ placards make it a plausible sanctuary and later a quasi-shrine where people seek him out. The office and highway-world are more lightly sketched but sufficient to contrast with the train’s “dusky harmony” and circularity. The final image of the growing archive of currencies in the train meaningfully charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    The observatory, telescope, brass fittings, and star charts create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the material, and the daylilies give a specific, tactile anchor. Setting details are well-filtered through Elara’s concerns (dream journals, telegram, variable stars). The environment largely supports mood rather than constraining choices, though the presence of charts and photographs gives plausible tools for their decoding work. Strongly atmospheric and specific, but not yet indispensable to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cursed lake and orchard vortex are vivid and sensorially specific (trees bending/unbending, rippling water, shadows). Setting aligns well with mood and theme, mirroring his internal storm, and the seed’s glow physically interacts with the environment. The space is more atmospheric than constraining—he mostly just walks forward into danger—so the world doesn’t deeply shape tactics, only stakes and tone. Strong, evocative, but shy of the most integrated environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt glade, crag-bound oak, and permanent eclipse are vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated; the oak and its bark-scars literally constrain the method of passage, satisfying the object-as-setting gate. Atmospheric choices (“scent of ozone and wet earth,” “threshold-dim air”) consistently mirror and intensify Elias’s inner state without feeling like generic mood dressing. World rules (covenant with the dreaming world, future’s scar across the sky) are consistent and legible through action rather than exposition dumps. The environment also charges the closing image, where the unchanged glade under a minutely altered sky implies large off-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, specific, and sensorially rich, with roots, bones, and dim glow all integrated into action (e.g., roots forming an altar, binding his wrist, bearing the star-fruit). The environment is not just decorative; it supplies both the mechanism and imagery of the ritual and charges the final image of the fruit and the stars above. Details are consistently filtered through Elian’s reverent attention, reinforcing tone and theme. The only ceiling here is that the setting constrains atmosphere and symbolism more than tactical choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quarry office trailer is rendered with strong, selective detail—dust, stale coffee, fluorescent hum, dynamite shuddering the walls—and those environmental notes echo Leo’s internal state. The quarry’s detonations as “giant, broken drums” and the final wind “whistling through the valley” that no longer feels empty directly charge the last image. The setting doesn’t tightly constrain plot options, but it consistently shapes tone and metaphor. The micro-setting of the desk, tablet inventory, and bagged scrap is also effectively used to stage his turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds, with metallic trees and zero-gravity roots, is vivid and distinctive, and it’s filtered convincingly through a working scientist’s eye. Setting and atmosphere strongly reinforce the liminal, suspended-between-worlds theme and charge the final image of planting the seed “between heaven and earth.” However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more metaphorical backdrop than active pressure on tactics. The specificity and coherence are strong enough to nearly compensate for that.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal atrium, titan-gears, and wintersun light are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: the rising water drives the gears and cues the smelting; fish from these waters become ink; the environment is not just backdrop. The setting’s rules feel consistent and are learned through doing (tides, smelting, repair, visitors), and the atrium’s machinery and water-patterns mirror the character’s cyclical identity. The recurring objects (creel, gears, waters) clearly charge the final image and help carry the conceptual weight. The only limit is that the setting constrains mood and ritual more than it constrains concrete options under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal caves, bunkers, and central chamber are evoked with vivid, consistent imagery—refracted flashlight rainbows, glistening walls, incandescent ceiling of light—that strongly support the story’s mood. Setting details are thematically integrated (caves and crystals echo emotional bunkers and latent radiance) and the pearl-as-object clearly charges the final image. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices beyond supplying the pearl and seashells, so its influence is more symbolic than logistical. Still, for this lyric, accumulative mode, the atmosphere is rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The overgrown station, ivy, graffiti, and river are sensuously and selectively rendered, tightly filtered through Elias’s obsessions. Setting is not postcard decor: the station’s decay mirrors his interior, the graffiti literally guides his route, and the river is an active, remembered threat. The recurring bellows-as-object also functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image. Atmosphere consistently supports the contemplative yet raw tonal aim.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glowing, misty library is vividly realized and tonally consistent, with strong, selective images like “books breathing softly” and “pages cycling through words that would never be written.” Setting integrates with the premise via temporal fissures and hidden passages that appear and vanish, rather than serving as static backdrop. The world’s rules (library exists between letters, reveals via the watch and delays) remain coherent. While atmospheric and concept-charged, the environment could constrain specific tactical choices more sharply to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet observatory, glass dome, botanical garden, and midsummer night are sharply realized and consistently filtered through Clementine’s attention to stars, plants, and coffee. Setting elements are not mere wallpaper: the observatory clock, starlight, and greenhouse all intersect with the magic system (coffee constellations, plant memories, violin resonance) and charge the ending image of the new moonflower species. World rules around the Winter Court, Midnight Bloom, and perforated futures are hinted rather than fully systematized, but remain internally consistent at this length. The environment effectively mirrors the story’s concerns with observation, growth, and destiny as a manipulable “sky.”

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, obsidian slab, and drifting constellation of chips are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her practiced calm. The environment supports tone and theme and charges the final image of her as “a silent guardian at the edge of everything.” Still, the setting is more atmospheric than constraining; very little about the grotto affects what she can or can’t do tactically. Its strength is mood and image, not functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The umbral grotto above the clouds, the Great Sentinel, and the rebirth pool are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her reverent, ritualistic perception. Setting is not just backdrop: the climb, the altitude, the clouds’ filtered light, and the pool’s placement all shape what she does and how she understands herself. The recurring “vineyard hush” and the hairpin catching sky-filtered light help charge the final images. It could push higher if environmental constraints more sharply narrowed choices, but atmosphere and specificity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, the dawn light, the height above the surf, and the wind interacting with the chimes are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the method and mood. The environment is not mere backdrop; the wind and elevation are necessary for the chime-based “translation,” and the shard’s final placement in this space charges the ending. Details like the extinguished campfire and the ocean’s glint create a consistent, atmospheric frame that mirrors internal shifts. This is strong, purposeful setting work, just shy of truly extraordinary innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magnetic grotto, starlight-drawn water, and floating rock platform are vividly rendered and consistently filter perception and action. The environment is not just decorative: it enables the trance, focuses Elara’s attention, and the pond’s reflective ripples literally and metaphorically deliver the method and final image. World rules (magnetic pull, starlight infusion) are consistent enough for this length and charge the ending with a concrete sense of place. The “sycamore hush” and hum of the grotto deepen atmosphere without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon of bone and endless echoes is vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through Kael’s sensibility (“these bones were the library of his existence”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the towers become “resonant chambers” that directly charge the final image and his new tactic. Environmental details (dust, hollows, wind, birds against the pale sky) consistently support tone and the story’s logic of resonance and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound spire above the clouds, the abandoned summit, and the mist as literal pathway create a vivid, coherent environment that’s tightly integrated with action. Setting meaningfully constrains tactics—only mist walking can reach the obsolete altar past automated sensors—and the high altitude cold and wind are felt rather than merely named. The recurring verticality (below: soulless systems; above: sacred, impossible magic) charges the final image of him descending changed. This is one of the story’s strongest craft areas, both atmospherically and functionally.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is a major strength: the pier at night, lantern-filled sky, and the “forgotten library inside the sunken ship” all feel concrete and atmospherically rich. Details are filtered through Orion’s professional familiarity and obsession (lamps, coordinates, luminous rope), and the environment directly shapes his tactics (using the festival as cover, the ship as resource). The recurring skeleton key, lanterns, and underwater library charge the final images effectively. A slight tendency toward familiar mystical phrasing (“veil between ordinary and extraordinary senses thinned”) keeps this short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “ambered observatory deck” and cosmic contraction create a distinctive atmosphere, and details like coins becoming part of the cosmic background are thematically apt. However, the observatory itself functions more as a poetic backdrop than a constraint on action—Elara’s tactics wouldn’t change much if the scene were a different control room. World rules about backward causality and static are consistent enough for this lyric mode. The setting enriches tone and theme but doesn’t significantly shape choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient observatory, cracked bronze dome, pedestal, scattered light, and emerging stars are vivid and consistently filtered through his grief, creating a charged, cohesive atmosphere. Setting is not postcardish: the dome’s crack and the dusk light directly enable the method (crystallization “through scattered light”) and charge the final image of the monsters and stars bearing his grief. The recurrence of stars and fractures (dome, prisms, facets) deepens both mood and theme without feeling mechanically symbolic. Environment and recurring objects clearly constrain and shape the key choices, qualifying as strong setting work at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sapphire viaduct and dry riverbed are vividly rendered and more than ornamental: the crystalline structure hums, resonates with the bell, and ultimately produces the decisive note that reconfigures meaning. Setting details (dawn light, crystalline arches, empty river) are selective and thematically apt, mirroring loss and tentative renewal. The environment actively participates in the closure, charging the final image of the viaduct “humming its approval.” There’s little sense of physical constraint or danger from the setting, but for this quiet, lyric piece the object-as-setting work is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ridgeway, reservoir, drowned town, and weather all feed tone and theme rather than feeling like backdrop. Specifics such as the “skeleton of a church steeple” in a drought year and the “bruised moon” reservoir carry history and mood efficiently. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does charge the final image of the water “stirring” in response to the photographs. Overall, atmosphere and place are among the piece’s strongest elements.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hidden orchard, prismatic waterfall, and living laboratory are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity and a clear POV filter. Environmental elements meaningfully charge the imagery and theme: the kaleidoscopic light, ancient tree, and murmuring starlings all mirror the fusion of logic and wonder. The setting feels coherent and consistent with the kind of alchemy practiced here, and the sanctuary’s seclusion underlines the stakes as spiritual/intellectual rather than social. While the orchard doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it saturates the atmosphere and final images.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds, the “archipelago” canopy, and the cold, thin air create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through the seeker’s pattern-obsessed perception. Setting and micro-setting (the buckle, the bark pattern, the insects’ hum) are not mere postcard details; they shape action (the need for a parachute, the high perch) and charge the final image (the arbor shrinking below as the buckle swings). The world’s rules—quiet, elevation, radio static—remain internally consistent even in their lyric abstraction. The environment and tool together constrain choices and heavily inflect the ending image, which lifts this into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The floating rock dojo above a void with history fraying gives a vivid, tonally apt atmosphere and avoids white-room syndrome. Specific details like the polished obsidian floor and the void stabilizing at the end tie setting lightly to the arc. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; the fight could almost occur in any enclosed arena without major revision. The strongest “object-as-setting” work comes from the brain-in-jar, which is well-integrated but somewhat overshadows the dojo itself as a functional setting.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The workshop, brook, and nocturnal atmosphere are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Elias’s inner state. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it meaningfully charges the tone and the final image (seed in moonlight, brook’s murmur, “storm-born silence”). Details like the brook’s “constant companion” and the lamp-lit workbench feel lived-in and character-filtered. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel as “wound in the earth” and echo chamber is vivid, rule-bearing, and central to the premise; it tangibly holds and resists the trapped laughter. The leaf blower and house interiors function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image (laying down the cord in the quiet room). Sensory detail (dust, damp earth, motes of light) feels purposeful rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics—he must work the tunnel, then re-enter the house—rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen garden in mist, crystalline flowers, and “boundaries of light” create a vivid, coherent environment that is fully fused with Sylvan’s inner life. Setting details are sensorially rich and non-generic (frost forming on a metal spine, the scent of ozone from a lightning text) and consistently filtered through his perception. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, as the pendant is absorbed into the garden and the boundaries of light “learn to bend.” It rarely constrains concrete action, but for a lyric piece it is exceptionally integrated and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ember nexus, crucible, and crozier are vivid, recurring anchors, and the environment’s “dying light” meaningfully charges both the process and the final image of the nexus seeming “reborn.” The setting functions almost as a character, its slow-burning decay mirroring and then inverting Elias’s own trajectory. However, sensory range is heavily visual and conceptual; we rarely feel the heat, smell, or tactility of the place in a way that constrains his choices in the moment. Still, the object-as-setting work with the crucible and nexus clearly supports the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned radio tower city over the gorge, the howling wind, and the oversized lunar perigee yield a vivid, coherent atmosphere, all filtered through Elias’s professional and thematic focus on signals. The Hollywood star fragment and the gorge both recur to charge imagery at the end, with the city as “witness” and the gorge “whispering approval.” While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it deeply colors perception and tone and feels specific rather than generic. This is high-level atmospheric work even if it falls just short of making setting itself a source of real, inescapable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spectral grotto, starlight through crystalline ceilings, and vanishing ferry are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elijah’s workmanlike perspective. World rules (dematerializing ferry, sideways clocks) hold together enough to feel lived-in, and the hourglass as a tool/object-as-setting is nicely paid off. Still, the environment rarely constrains action; the grotto’s properties are more aesthetic than tactical, and the supposed risk of it tearing apart remains abstract. Strong atmosphere, but not yet using setting as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly and specifically rendered (“walls curved inward without bending,” “staircases coiled into themselves like sleeping snakes”) and consistently filtered through Siran’s craft-focused perception. Environment and objects aren’t mere backdrop: the twisted stair and endless corridor both shape his tactics and define the problem he’s solving. The final image of the unchanged illusions vs. the collapsed corridor and “blueprint of his next creation” is strongly charged by place. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual would deepen this further.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The benthic city and trench environment are vividly and economically evoked—“luminous spires,” “crystal viewport,” bioluminescent corals echoing stars. Setting is consistently filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional lens, integrating tools (deepsuit, holo-projector) in lived ways. The final image of the corals mirroring the stellar lesson charges the world with thematic weight. World rules are delivered mostly through exposition but remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight, and thinning boundary between worlds create a coherent, mood-rich atmosphere that fits the premise. Specifics like the stone bench, tablet screen, and old music box give just enough texture without clutter. Yet the setting is largely decorative: the atrium and mist do not materially constrain tactics or alter choices, functioning more as a gothic backdrop than an active environment. The final tonal reweighting of the atrium’s “reeling hush” helps, but still leans on telling rather than embodied interaction with place.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the story’s standout strength: the deep-ocean facility, physics-defying water, ozone crackle, and undersea cables create a vivid, specific, and tonally unified environment. Details are filtered through Eliza’s professional background and fear history, and the environment (cables, pressure, tides) directly charges the final image. The world’s impossible qualities are introduced via perception and action rather than dry exposition. The final stillness “that weighed nothing and everything” effectively fuses physical setting with her transformed state.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal observatory, crystalline doors, snow “in silent curtains,” and ink pooling in carved stars all create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Setting details are selective and motif-driven (opal, snow, ink, shard) rather than generic, and they reliably echo the themes of isolation and shattered-yet-beautiful remnants. The environment doesn’t much constrain tactics—he could perform a similar ritual in many secluded labs—but it does heavily charge the mood and final image. The observatory and snow frame the piece effectively as a liminal, almost sacred space.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon, bone towers, drifting bone dust, and flocks of starlings are vividly imagined and tightly integrated with the mechanics of the story’s magic and its final image. Setting is not postcard backdrop: bone surfaces are literally the medium of language, and the tunnel of echoes plus the towers’ textures constrain what Kaelen can attempt. The flawed diamond’s light interacting with canyon walls and the birds roosting among bone towers at sunset gives the ending strong environmental charge. This is rich and purposeful, just shy of utterly transportive because we don’t see the setting complicate tactics as much as enable them.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground herbalist garden, with its damp earth, crushed mint, and levitating mushrooms, is vivid and specific, rich in sensory and textural detail. The setting is not merely decorative: it is the Jester’s habitat and “stage,” the locus for the arrowhead’s discovery, and the charged space of the final image. World rules (gravitationally playful mushrooms, phone metamorphosis) remain internally consistent and are learned through action. The environment could constrain physical choices a bit more explicitly, but it already meaningfully charges the mood and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the rust-and-glass towers, sky-bridge, mechanical city hum, and enchanted orchard with living statues all feel specific and coherent. Environment actively shapes pressure and options—the orchard’s enforced silence, her need to move “like smoke,” the sky-bridge as exposed stage, statues physically approaching, and the city’s mechanisms responding to music. The locust shell and later vine work as object-as-setting, charging the final image in a way rooted in earlier detail. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual textures over other senses keeps this from the very top tier, but it’s still strong work.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt arcade, drones, and shuttle are vividly drawn with a strong sensory palette and clear spatial logic. The world’s rules (neutral ground, drone web, manifest scans) are learned through action rather than dumped. Setting does constrain choices: the lone docking bay, five-minute window, and lethal web justify the EMP bottle and the manifest manipulation. Occasionally the description flirts with ornamental lyricism, but it generally remains purposeful and in POV.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus train, mist, wind bells, and hidden oasis carriage are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail that supports a hushed, uncanny atmosphere. The environment feels specific—weathered wood, rusted cars, pristine tapestries, crystalline case—and is consistently filtered through Elian’s tactile, visual attention as a woodworker. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges discovery and the final image (singing amid ghosts and bells in twilight). The circus context could perhaps bear slightly more functional pressure, but as-is it’s richly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “scientific poetry library” is a vivid, original setting, and details like dusty shelves, analog media, and hyperbolically warping aisles feel specific and integrated with her perception. The scarf functions as a micro-setting object that constrains/permits movement (compass, bridge, then charged final image). World rules—stories as living geometries—are consistent within the surreal frame and learned by watching space itself deform. The environment clearly shapes the story’s possibilities rather than serving as a vague backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering archipelago, dew-kissed archives, and tide-worn shelves are vividly realized and integrated into the character’s profession and ritual. Setting details (sunrise, waves, mangroves, gulls) are filtered through his goal of decoding longing, so atmosphere supports concept rather than becoming mere scenery. The palette as a glowing object in the archive at the end charges the final image effectively. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it consistently shapes tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and the workshop as a threshold between worlds are richly realized, with consistent sensory motifs (lavender, rain, cosmic dust) that reinforce the story’s liminal mood. Setting is not just wallpaper: the star in the sky becomes an active tool in his method, and the workshop’s geometry literally slips as pressure rises, charging the conflict. The final image of the now-ordinary lock of hair in the re-stabilized nexus gives place an aftertaste of spent magic. World rules are implied rather than explained, but they remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: a sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwrecks casting mast shadows, mineral-frosted glass refracting light into “broken constellations,” and the fairy ring at the center. Details are not just decorative; the environment is the method (light through glass and rigging) and the gate (mushroom ring) by which other beings are accessed, and it returns charged in the final image as a guarded liminal site. The world’s rules (light, glass, mushrooms, time-folding) feel internally consistent for the length. At elite level, one might wish for a slightly more tactile interaction with the water/greenhouse structure during the climax, but the current integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the twilight library, shard mirrors, and the shadow in glass create a strong, idiosyncratic atmosphere that matches the metaphysical premise. World rules (shadow as anchor, tea-leaf geometry as navigation) are implied through the environment rather than bald exposition. The space doesn’t sharply constrain tactical options, but it does meaningfully charge the final image as the library “sighs” and the shadow fades. Overall, the specificity and mood are at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly realized: the “verdant parapet beside the waterfall” with mist, light, stone, and the ironwood root all interwoven into her sensory and magical process. Environmental details are strongly filtered through her vocation and purpose—the waterfall sets her breathing rhythm; root and earth function as an anchor/gateway; air, mist, stone, and river are literal inputs to the ritual. The atmosphere of damp luminosity and living stone supports the tone and theme of liminal wonder. The final image of leaf vs. rainbows is charged by this specific place rather than a generic nature backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prism sanctuary and refracted starlight are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through the action—the light interacts with the spirits, the colors intensify with pressure, and the spirits finally “anchor in the very light that had revealed them.” The environment meaningfully charges the final image and theme, not just serving as backdrop. Physical geography is coherent, and the tool/body/environment triad (needle, net, light) feels integrated. A slight tendency toward decorative phrasing keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault, rust-teared saints, fractured parchment, and monolithic henge are all rendered with vivid, selective detail that consistently supports mood and concept. Environment is filtered believably through Elias’s map- and silence-obsessed perspective. While the vault and henge don’t strongly constrain his options beyond providing access to the ritual site, they do charge the final image—the chapel emerging from layered silences and damaged images. Strong atmosphere and specificity, with slight limitation in how much the setting forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken ship library and water-pressed portholes create a vivid, tonally apt environment, and the snow globe works as a powerful micro-setting object. Details like Amelia Earhart’s plane in a trench and waterlogged encyclopedias are specific and memorable. However, the physical setting mostly serves mood rather than constraining choices; Elias’s actions and options would be similar in almost any archive. The strongest setting work is in the recurring snow globe, which effectively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, the storm, and the intermittent lightning are vividly rendered and create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details (roiling mist, flashes revealing his work, thunder marking the window’s end) do modestly constrain his actions and timing. The flower press bolt plate and courtyard walls function as charged objects/locations tied to the final image. Some description trends toward the ornamental, but overall the specificity feels purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The icebound spire, crystalline elevator, and upper atmosphere vistas are vivid and nicely selective, with details (crystalline walls, frozen architecture, fogging breath) reinforcing tone and theme. The environment participates in the mechanics—scattered light through crystal enabling the goggles’ function—and visually charges the last image. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or behavior; it’s more an evocative backdrop than an active pressure. Still, for this length, it provides a strong atmospheric scaffold tied to the key object.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gondola, sky, and telescope are richly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s professional eye and emotional preoccupations. Details like “a cradle suspended between heaven and earth,” “dusty starlight,” and cloud types tied to mood establish a distinct, coherent atmosphere. The brass telescope in particular functions almost as a micro-setting, anchoring his body and grief and returning in the last image. The main limitation is that the physical environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it mostly amplifies mood.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hollowed tree-trunk library, dust, decaying paper, and scholar’s guild legacy create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The space (floorboard, safe, arches, cracks of dawn light) directly supplies the tools and conditions for Elias’s sky-crafting. The demolition and later city streets with a sky-reflecting puddle evolve the setting meaningfully, charging the final images with the sense of a lost yet internalized place.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The antique airship, the observation deck, the dusty hopscotch board, and the starling murmuration are vivid and specific, and they all feed directly into the premise. Environment and objects (airship vantage point, exposed yet preserved chalk, birds below) actively enable the discovery rather than sitting as backdrop. The final image of him on the airship, folding notes and covering the board, feels spatially and atmospherically grounded. Setting could push further into constraining choices, but it already does solid conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library, hall of mirrors, and gear pedestal are vividly rendered with specific sensory touches (“air tasted like forgotten winters,” frost-coated walls, crystalline windows). Setting is not mere backdrop: mirrors pulse and shatter, the library groans and later melts, and snowflake-shards drift, all intertwined with her actions. The environment subtly mirrors her internal arc from frozen nostalgia to thawed possibility. The one limitation is that setting rarely constrains tactics—she moves through it with relative ease rather than having to work around its dangers or limits.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, butterfly gardens, and the nebula of respite are vivid and specific, giving the world a distinct texture. Setting meaningfully intersects with plot via the arches’ hidden caves and the bell network that literally sustains the atmosphere. Details are generally well-chosen, though they are often summarized rather than experienced in scene. The final image of bells chiming across the arches nicely charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, staircase, and pane of hush are vividly rendered and consistently tied to action, not just backdrop. The environment and objects (especially the pane and puppet head) directly constrain what he can do and charge the final image of the memory-bubble in twilight. World-rules around the pane and void feel internally consistent, learned through what he does rather than exposition. Description edges toward lush but remains purposeful and grounded in his task.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard, cliff, labyrinth, mechanical birds, and descending frost are vivid and tightly woven into action, not just painted in the margins. Environmental constraints (abyss, motion-detecting birds, creeping frost) directly shape tactics and options. The recurring objects—the nut, the blueprint, the trees—charge the final image of Tomas returning to the orchard as its trees “rustled with something like approval.” World rules feel internally coherent at this length, with only minor opacity around the magic’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The braided ravine, foam, moss, and chrysalis are vividly rendered and threaded through the entire piece as more than backdrop. Setting details are consistently filtered through Elena’s scientific and musical sensibilities, which keeps them purposeful. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain her physical choices, it strongly shapes the conceptual leap and charges the metamorphosis motif. The final return to the ravine imagery in “wild flowers in the crevices” gives the setting a satisfying echo.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass orchard library and swirling sea of clouds are vivid, specific, and consistently evoked, giving the piece a strong atmospheric signature. Objects like the crystalline branches and bottled moonlight feel integrated rather than decorative, and the environment’s surreal qualities align with the story’s preoccupation with untethered stories. That said, the setting rarely constrains action or tactics; Elias could mostly do the same work in any magical shop. The final constellation image of bottles partially charges the ending but stops short of a full setting-driven reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: desert fortress in rain, impossible tidal pools, and the coral icebound pavilion all feel specific and sensorially alive. Environmental conditions (the rare rain, the pools) directly enable the plot, rather than sitting as mere backdrop. The mirroring of fortress brittleness and Kael’s interior state adds atmospheric depth without feeling over-explained. This could nudge even higher if physical constraints of the pavilion more visibly limited his options at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The astronomical clock tower, spiral staircase, star-faced dials, and grain elevators are vividly rendered and tightly linked to the story’s mood and concept. Details like the celestial dials, copper weight, and “borrowed starlight” feel specific to Elara’s world and profession, not generic décor. The tower’s mechanisms plausibly serve as both setting and broadcasting apparatus, integrating environment with action. While the setting does not strongly constrain choices, it meaningfully charges the imagery and the final sense of shared time and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The moonlit canyon and the quantum dreamscape are strongly evoked, with images like “shimmering veils of forgotten dreams” and the refracting mirror giving a consistent atmospheric palette. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the canyon at dawn, the glinting mirror—though it seldom constrains her options beyond providing an eerie, isolating backdrop. Details generally feel filtered through her scientific/lyric sensibility, not like a generic postcard. World rules (entangled memories, neural interfaces) remain internally consistent even if delivered more as exposition than as lived constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is vivid and specific—the inverting gravity, standing stones, and “serpentine grotto in mist” all feel textured and distinct, filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias. The environment materially shapes options (she can only enter during inversion; threshold stones and dimensional rules govern access), and the grotto’s crystal formations are meaningfully tied to the story’s core concept. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual but is purposeful and rarely digressive. A bit more tactile/embodied interaction with the environment under pressure would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The siskin alder grove, sculpture, and porcelain insulator create a vivid, coherent micro-ecosystem where atmosphere and object are tightly fused to the story’s logic. Details like the grove “leaning in to listen” and the hedgehog’s dusk effectively externalize the world’s intense quiet and gradual awakening. The insulator as a tool with prior life (telegraph voices) that now bridges silence and sound notably charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, it meaningfully colors every action and the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic nexus, twilight sky, and basalt stone create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific rather than generic mystical scenery. Details (the hum, the celestial alignment, the stone’s dent lined up with a star) are filtered through Elias’s pattern-obsessed perception and reinforce his method. The worry stone effectively functions as micro-setting, evolving from talisman of failure to charged tool in the final image. Environment doesn’t enforce hard physical constraints, but it meaningfully charges the closing act and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “shadowed workshop under stars” is richly drawn and woven into action via tools (oscilloscope, frequency generator) and the external stillness before fireworks, which legitimately supports the acoustic premise. Details like borrowed hearing aids and espionage gear emerge through Silen’s priorities, not as neutral cataloging, and the fireworks’ intrusion charges the final image. The environment constrains timing (they must work before the noise starts) but not tactics beyond that, so it enhances mood and concept more than forcing difficult choices. Overall the atmosphere is distinctive and purposeful, if occasionally a touch ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    The treetop village, rope ladders, misty canopy, and “suspended between worlds” imagery create a strong, coherent atmosphere that supports the liminal, meditative tone. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s plant-focused perception, especially scent, which feels appropriate to her vocation and gift. The environment thematically mirrors decay→renewal (dead branches as foundations), but it doesn’t significantly constrain choices or alter tactics. Still, it charges the final porch gatherings and seed-sharing with a satisfying spatial and tonal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific: floating rock arches, inverted rivers, bioluminescent flora, and the smell of “sweet decay and new growth” all feel lived-in and coherent. The inversion and water flows aren’t just backdrop—they shape how she navigates and how the environment is perceived, even if they don’t pinch hard at the climax. World rules (gravity inversion hour, echoes, energy resonance) stay consistent and are learned through Kael’s action. The final image of the tree and the glowing arrow tip leverages the environment to charge the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The port city and “towering labyrinth of shipping containers” are vividly rendered, with strong visual and atmospheric specificity (colors, corrugation, sodium lamps, wind canyons). Setting is integrated into premise: the container arrangement creates the vortex that enables dispersal, so it’s not mere backdrop. Still, in the moment-to-moment, the environment doesn’t much constrain Elias’s choices or movement; it’s more a conceptual mechanism than a lived hazard.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ice cavern and aurora are vividly realized with strong multi-sensory detail, especially where light and sound blend through the bell ringer’s synesthesia. Setting is not just backdrop: the cavern’s acoustics and the ice’s eventual “singing back” are structurally important to the ritual. At times the descriptive density verges on ornamental, but the environment consistently supports the lyrical, numinous atmosphere and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, driftwood, and echo chamber are vividly rendered and integrated with the Keeper’s mindset, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The setting meaningfully shapes action: the natural echo chamber, between-world reeds, and scattered driftwood all become functional components of the ritual and its safety line. World rules remain consistent and are revealed through action (playing the flute frays reality, driftwood markers glow in the in-between space). It falls just short of top tier because, while beautifully textured, the environment rarely constrains specific choices under pressure beyond providing an apt ritual site.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The topaz workshop, amber-tinted glass ceiling, and letterpress machinery are vivid and consistently filtered through Silas’s technical and analytic sensibility. The environment is not mere backdrop: the press becomes autonomous, churning out equations that concretize the “mathematics of emotion,” and the glass ceiling makes the vanishing stars physically present and legible. The final dissolution of the workshop walls into consciousness, with prints like “fallen constellations,” meaningfully reweights these earlier details. A touch more tactile interaction with the space at the moment of dissolution could heighten the felt stakes, but the setting already charges the final image well.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and cave are vividly rendered, with strong visual texture and a consistent, mythic atmosphere that matches the story’s concerns about time, memory, and wonder. Setting is meaningfully tied to theme—the ridge as a bridge between memory and myth, the aurora as an almost primordial backdrop to the courier’s transformation. The storm forcing him into the cave is the main concrete way environment shapes choice, and that single causal use keeps this from feeling purely postcard-like. Overall, the world feels coherent and lived-in, if slightly more scenic than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and car are vividly realized and strongly atmospheric, with good sensory layering (cold stone, crystalline supports humming, phantom chill, dripping ice). Setting feels filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a mystic, giving it a quasi-sacral, experimental-lab quality without exposition dumps. The environment lightly participates in action (prism to car, forehead to quartz, mist burning off), but it rarely constrains options or tactics. The final image of the mist dissipating and arbor glistening provides a solid, if not fully weaponized, environmental cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are vividly evoked and recur as more than postcard backdrop, shifting from isolation to threshold by the end. The loom-and-bead micro-setting is strongly integrated, especially with the bead left “on the loom” as a charged final object. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but it clearly colors perception and the meaning of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly particular—the orchard planet, violet sky, floating rock arches, and phosphorescent lichens all feel integrated, not decorative. The abandoned mine shaft as secret workshop and the fallen arches as both problem and material clearly shape what Elias can do. Environmental details are filtered through purpose (a place to work unseen; rubble meticulously cataloged) rather than touristic description. The world’s rules (crumbled arches, floating reborn stone) remain consistent and charge the final dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned repair bay is vividly evoked—rust, ozone, echoes, “ghosts of machinery”—and the contrast to the functional bay in the past sharpen the sense of loss. Details are filtered through Kael’s sensory orientation, which helps avoid a tourist catalog feel. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces choices; it’s more atmospheric than interactive. The shard, rather than the spaceport itself, does most of the work of charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse, mist, haunted lantern room, and sea glass are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Jonah’s perceptions, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The environment meaningfully charges choices and images: the dark lamp motivates his task, the climb sharpens the mood of sorrow, and the sea glass on the sill refracting light is an excellent final-image anchor. Weather and sea feel lived-in rather than postcard, and the hauntedness subtly mirrors his loneliness. While the setting doesn’t physically constrain tactics much, it very effectively shapes tone and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald lighthouse, alien constellations, and the glass wick create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with world rules that feel consistent and organically revealed. Setting and object-as-setting (the wick, the crystal walls) are tightly integrated with the premise of steering futures through light. While the environment does not strongly constrain a concrete choice in-scene, it clearly charges the final image and defines what’s possible here.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating rock tea house, valley-mist, dye vats, crystal teapot, and penciled sun trails are vivid, integrated, and filtered through his artisan’s eye. Setting is not postcard: the room’s light paths and the prism of the teapot directly shape the pivotal event, and the returning valley-mist at the end charges the final image. The morpho wing as recurring object-as-setting is central to how the world is perceived. Environment, tools, and weather all constrain perception and enable the story’s climax, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The labyrinth, corridors, stormlit tower, and sentinel trees are vividly and economically rendered, with details (skylights, worn stones, rain, lightning) integrated into action rather than tacked on. The sextant and moonlight function as micro-setting elements that materially affect what can happen when, especially in the tower scene. The atmosphere consistently supports the “mundane miracle” tone: worklike routines set against quietly numinous phenomena. A slight tilt toward conceptual description over sensory embodiment prevents it from pushing into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemical orchard, greenhouse, mica window, and mirror world of endless night are vivid and integrated into action rather than decorative. Environmental features directly shape events: the orchard blooms in response to song, the mica window channels light to the town, and the endless night makes “woven dawns” thematically charged. Sensory detail leans visual but is textured and purposeful, especially in the closing image of the window as a map. The setting feels specific and tonally coherent, though a touch more tactile or non-visual detail under peak pressure could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library and its urban niche are vividly and economically described (“between a tailor shop and bakery,” “Leaded glass…dust motes dancing”) and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Atmosphere coheres with the introspective, slightly enchanted tone, and the setting concept (Library of Unwritten Thoughts) is memorable. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her options; it serves more as textured backdrop and thematic mirror than as an active pressure on choice. The final image of the secret door closing and lantern glow is strong but not fully weaponized by prior environmental constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: mossy balustrade, damp earth, the overgrown palace courtyard, and the secret tea house all filter through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental details (silence after birds, crumbling walls) mirror her perception of unraveling and then reframe as “foundation” at the end, directly charging the final image. The tea house functions as micro-setting and symbol—sanctuary and laboratory—without feeling like a static backdrop. Slightly more use of physical constraint (how the overgrowth limits or shapes her acts) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library above the clouds, “quartz hush,” and crystalline air are richly and consistently rendered, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. Details like cloud-piercing windows and drifting breath-crystals are specific and on-tone, and the environment feels coherent with the magic-tech apparatus. The setting, however, is more a lyrical backdrop than an active constraint on choices—it doesn’t significantly alter what Elara can or can’t do. Still, as an atmospheric engine it’s strong and charges the final quiet with a distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly and economically sketched, with lantern light, weathered timbers, and rotting boards casting sunrise beams that charge the final image. The environment meaningfully shapes the story (hidden bazaar, need for secrecy, the physical tent and canvas for the recording), not just as backdrop. Details are filtered through Emmie’s familiarity, which avoids a tourist-catalog feel. Some sensory variety beyond sight and a bit more tactile engagement with the crowded aisles under pressure could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—lavender bluff, aurora rivers, forest elections, root-click voting—and these details are consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory experience (light, taste, scent). The environment and recurring object (tin ring) charge the final image conceptually: “earthly materials best suited for detecting terrestrial divinity” ties landscape, tool, and theme. While the bluff and aurora don’t strongly constrain physical choices, they structure the ritual conditions under which anything can happen at all. The worldbuilding feels vivid, internally consistent, and tonally unified with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly evoked—“auroral sorrow,” refracted light, and crystal “tombs” create a strong, consistent atmosphere. Details like the crystals illuminating the portraits and “leaning in” during the climax integrate setting with action and emotional stakes. The environment, however, functions more as mood than as a concrete constraint on choice; little about the physical layout truly limits or redirects his tactics. Still, the cave’s transformation from sorrowful to reverent does meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse city under toxic skies, the dried oasis, crystal-dust, and pressurized postal tubes create a distinct, coherent environment. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s professional lens (gilded leaves, garden lamps, ferns) so they feel lived-in, not touristic. The environment constrains and charges choices: domes as fragile sanctuary, poisoned aquifer as existential threat, postal system as the only way to resurrect lost conversations. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical hazards (toxic air, structural fragility) could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bluff above the clouds, the open-air workshop, the pendulums, and the iceberg fragment create a memorable, coherent atmosphere that feels particular to this story. Setting details are woven through action (vibrations, prisms of light, drops into pigment) and carry through to the final image of the sky “painted with the hues of wonder.” The environment meaningfully charges the premise by situating his work literally above the ordinary world, though it rarely constrains concrete choices. A few phrases verge on abstract (“world churned in silence”) but overall the specificity is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm, iridescent box, and combustion chamber form a coherent, tactile environment that mirrors and pressures the internal conflict. The dome’s integrity (cracking but holding) and the roses’ withering/survival directly charge the final image and the thematic stakes. World rules about magnetic disturbance and artificial cultivation are sketched rather than detailed but remain internally consistent. Setting details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    The courtyard, mailbox, elm, and archives are all concrete and visually legible, with the courtyard and locket motifs nicely reprised at the end. Setting contributes to mood (dawn calm, evening warmth) and frames the community gathering effectively. However, the environment rarely constrains options or shapes tactics beyond providing locations; Elias could have followed the same trail almost anywhere. The strong description feels more atmospheric than structurally integral.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater lab, glowing dice, and spider-web interface create a distinct, atmospheric environment, and details like the muted voice through water give some sensory specificity. The setting is integrated into action (she twists in water, adjusts gear, connects to the central computer), and the recurring web imagery ties to the oppressive regime. Nonetheless, the underwater aspect rarely constrains her options in a concrete way—the scene could almost work identically in a dry secure lab. Strong mood and imagery, but the environment doesn’t quite become an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is a standout: the misty harbor, anomalous piers, and especially the salt crystal chamber are concrete, sensory, and strongly integrated with the speculative logic. Environmental rules (gravity pockets, crystal amplification) are consistent and used in action, not just as backdrop. Recurring objects (lantern, coffee grounds, wildflowers) effectively function as micro-settings/tools and charge the final images. The atmosphere of charged quiet and refracted light is sustained without feeling like a generic “moody” seascape.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly evoked and consistently threaded through the piece; the brook’s murmur as “the last thread of noise” that softens after the ritual gives the setting real participation in the climax. Details like the water reflecting the wing’s shadow and the air cooling as focus sharpens are sensorially specific and tied to action. The environment meaningfully shapes choice (he chose this place “for its stillness”) and charges the final image as he walks away along the brook. A touch more non-visual sensory variety or concrete physical constraint would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop garden, jasmine, and meteor shower create a vivid, specific atmosphere, and the building’s interior as a whispering presence is a compelling extension of setting. Details are filtered well through the tutor’s obsessions (buildings “whispering,” walls softening), and the seal as an object-setting hybrid meaningfully charges the final image. The garden’s role is more tonal than constraining—the real tactical environment is the study once the magic starts—so the world doesn’t quite hem them in. Still, specificity and mood are strong and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    The velvet garden, midnight-blue roses, and twilight-to-dawn sky are rich, specific, and consistently filtered through Elena’s experience. The garden is not mere backdrop: it is her “quarantine,” the medium for the resonance grid, and the literalization of “gardening your ghosts.” Environmental details (petals trembling, colors absorbing frequencies, dew-kissed walk) evolve with the process and charge the final image. The setting could constrain choices a bit more overtly, but it already meaningfully participates in the story’s logic and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vivid, recurring, and strongly filtered through Elara’s perception, giving the piece a distinctive physical and atmospheric texture. The undercroft and cathedral credibly explain both her isolation and access to royal ink secrets, so the environment is not just decorative. The heritage rose thorn functions as a micro-setting tool, physically present by the ink and then used in the sealing gesture that charges the final image. While the aurora and dripping stalactites don’t materially constrain tactics, they do shape mood and thematic resonance very effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon, nexus, Spire, and starlit atmosphere are vividly rendered and tightly tied to Kaelen’s sensory bias as an echo singer. Setting isn’t postcard; the serpentine nexus literally conducts and amplifies dissent, and the Spire’s flickering silhouette charges the ending image. The seashell as micro-setting/object is well integrated, acting as tool and witness. World rules (echoes as memory and communication) feel consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glacier shrine, blue ice, flickering candles, and Arctic night are sensuously rendered and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The snow globe-as-window is a striking micro-setting object that charges both the inciting vision and final image. The ghost ship sequence adds tactile specificity (diesel and salt) that contrasts well with the frozen world. Still, environment mostly frames rather than constrains choices, which keeps it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is a standout strength: the wet parapet, ivy-draped archway, forgotten workshop, and glowing loom are all vivid and sensorially grounded. Details are generally filtered through Elara’s craft- and pattern-focused sensibility, which helps unify tone and world. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains tactic or choice—she’s never forced to adapt because of rain-slick stones or the abandoned space. The recurring parapet and loom images do help charge the final perception, but not yet at a transformative level.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radioactive orchard, dust-hazed sky, and glass pavilion are vividly sketched and consistently filtered through Maya’s investigative lens. The diamond as a central object meaningfully charges the setting and reappears at closure with reweighted meaning. Environmental pressure (radioactivity, clean air in pavilion) is present but rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more backdrop than active obstacle. Still, the world feels coherent and specific at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, lightning, and radio equipment are vividly rendered and tightly tied to Elias’s perspective and vocation. The storm and charged glass mirror his inner conflict, and the mountain path at the end gives a concrete before/after contrast. The environment does modestly constrain options (isolation, vantage, access to equipment) but functions more as atmospheric and thematic mirror than as a hard tactical constraint. Description remains purposeful and integrated rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes” and desert-by-the-sea atmosphere are vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the story’s loneliness and beauty. Environmental details like the train at dawn, sand beetles, gulls, and sea grass are filtered convincingly through Silas’s attention to sound. The loft as repository of jars is a strong micro-setting, and the buried music box integrates well as part of that environment rather than a random prop. Still, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mirrors mood more than it shapes what is possible, which keeps it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drift-ice marina, golden sunset, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with strong visual and tactile detail, and the ice’s transformation into glowing pathways of light is a memorable image. The environment loosely participates in the action (the key in the fissure, the ice “releasing its hoarded sorrows”) but mostly functions as lyric backdrop rather than a true constraint on options. Some description edges toward generalized “poetic” phrasing, yet overall the atmosphere is coherent and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen Lake Vesper, and magnetic viaduct are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s work and inner state. The environment genuinely constrains what she can do—the lake must be frozen and crystalline; the viaduct’s structure channels planetary consciousness—and it charges the final image of the patience wave across ice. Details like “pale winter light” and “ice glowed with reflected starlight” feel purposeful rather than touristic. Setting and micro-setting (the instruments, the window) are strongly integrated with theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The subway maintenance tunnel, the dampness, and the lantern’s physicality all create a tangible, moody environment, with some nice textural touches (rusted panel, grime, curved walls). The lantern as object-as-setting is effective, but the tunnel itself rarely constrains choice or behavior beyond atmosphere. Weather/drought are mostly conceptual frame rather than active environmental pressure. Overall, the setting is vivid and coherent but used more symbolically than tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The music box repair shop is vividly evoked through smell, light, and tactile detail, and the clockwork heart functions as both setting-object and thematic spine. Environmental specifics (velvet cloth, tools, the ticking music box) are integrated into action rather than touristed. The setting’s atmosphere (“vibrant hush”) reinforces the tension between beauty and threat, and the shop’s function as a locus of mechanical expertise is plot-relevant. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond providing an expert and tools.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and well-integrated: the gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, corrosive waves, and mechanical arms all contribute to a strong atmosphere and coherent world. Details like brass-inlaid floorboards, velvet-lined pedestal, and perpetual lightning give a specific, memorable texture filtered through mechanical perception. The environment lightly constrains action (erosion exposing lower levels; acid residue on chains) and charges the final descent, though it doesn’t yet force a concrete, costly choice. World rules feel internally consistent, and the setting is doing real work rather than reading as a mere postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Archive, social network, and “pocket dimension compressed within a defunct music-streaming algorithm” create a distinct, atmospheric techno-noir environment. Details are selective but purposeful, filtered through Elias’s archivist mindset (metadata, ghost nodes, sub-archives). The environment meaningfully shapes tactics—his role grants access; the music algorithm functions as the hidden vault; the final image returns to the hum of the archive. A bit more tactile or sensory grounding could elevate it further, but what’s here is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Shael’s task—the groaning ice underscores precarious balance, and its calming at the end charges the closure image. The crystalline fruit, shadow-stitched silk, and vintage mirrors all feel of-a-piece and avoid museum-tour excess. Setting details are purposeful and evolve with events (the floes’ violence vs. later calm). The environment functions as both atmosphere and thematic mirror for equilibrium, giving the piece a strong sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drift-ice marina and its wreckage are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail (“air tasted of salt, sorrow, and the strange, clean scent of melting bergs”). The environment feels lived-in through his work with nets, slush, and “government-issue coat,” and it tonally mirrors his internal state. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object, texturing his perception and charging the final image. The main ceiling comes from the setting influencing mood and theme more than constraining specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, and autumn light are vividly rendered and recur throughout, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details (amber glass, russet leaves, grapevine tendrils) are woven into the sentinel’s actions, especially the leaf patterns and vine heart, which mirror the emotional arc. The setting, however, functions more as mood than as a constraint on choices—the story would largely work in another quiet, liminal location. Strong sensory specificity lifts this, even if it stops short of being structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated with action: “sand-worn silk floors,” humming walls, and the kinetic parapet beneath dunes all shape the scene. The clearing, pavilion, dunes, and parapet aren’t just backdrop; they evolve with events (stirring, crystallizing, shuddering, then stilling) and charge the final images (silent pavilion, inert parapet, mask in sand). Sensory focus is primarily visual and auditory but thematically apt, reinforcing the whisper/silence axis. This is close to top-tier environmental work, though a sharper sense of physical risk or constraint from the setting could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are richly evoked and consistently threaded through: scent, texture, light, and the encroaching vines all mirror the story’s decay-to-healing arc. The final image of vines climbing and obscuring the factory’s wounds charges the last paragraph and reinforces the theme. The setting shapes mood more than concrete options, so its role is powerful but mostly symbolic rather than constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed library at dawn is vivid and tonally precise—cold glass, lost heights, “suspended hush,” and the central table/podium all working in concert with the crystal to charge the atmosphere. Details are selective and POV-filtered (spines of books, cart wheel, chandelier remnants), avoiding cataloguing while firmly anchoring space and time. The environment constrains the story’s options: the ruined chandelier begets the crystal; the empty hall and disassembled fixture literalize the end of language and force his solitary, ritualized experiment. The final image—him closing his hand around the glowing crystal in that same vast quiet—relies on the setting’s established weight to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog sculpture garden is richly and precisely rendered—rusted spires, twisted metal, car hoods, and “splinters of forgotten things” all echo aging and memory-loss without feeling like a tourist catalog. Environment is not just backdrop; it channels him toward the monolith, provides the materials for his ritual, and saturates the final image with decay and persistence. The recurring chalk-on-metal interaction charges the closure, tying object, body, and setting into one tactile act. Description is dense but purposeful and filtered through Elias’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lunar observatory, Earth’s argent light, and the biodome with its single falling leaf create an atmospheric, specific environment that meaningfully shapes action. Setting is not just backdrop: the slipping orbit defines the core problem, and the artificial grove provides the improbable but thematically apt solution. Details like the silver dome and cloud-wreathed moon recur to charge the final image of the station sailing on. Some descriptors (“luminous ache,” “fragile”) repeat enough to feel generic rather than freshly observed, which slightly lowers the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The hospice “radiant haven above the clouds” and the “scent of hope” create a distinct, gently liminal atmosphere that fits the material. The vinyl shard and albums function as micro-setting objects that charge the emotional beats and the final image. Environmental details are selective and through Elijah’s professional lens, avoiding a tourist catalog feel. Still, the setting seldom constrains choice or action; it primarily serves tone rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are vivid, specific, and integrated into action—the lens, vents, star chart, and isle’s crust all matter to what Elara can do. World rules (broken reality, misbehaving shadows) emerge organically through setting rather than exposition dumps. The final image of the isle drifting in endless twilight charged by her partial victory reuses the environment effectively. A few more non-visual sensory anchors under peak pressure could further enrich atmosphere, but the current execution is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vivid and purposeful, with details like shifting iron vines and crystallizing leaves doing double duty as atmosphere and worldbuilding. The maze subtly tests approach—“trimmed precisely to disorient anyone who approached too confidently”—which aligns with the story’s theme of humility before the unknown. The garden and willow dripping starlight also charge the final exchange with the child. The only missing step for the very top band is a more direct way in which the environment constrains Eleanor’s tactical options at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “serpentine grotto in mist,” salt air, damp stone, and night-blooming jasmine create a vivid, sensuous setting tightly fused to mood and theme. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s star-fixated perspective, with the grotto as a convergence of earth/sea/sky that clearly charges the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does function as a chosen ritual space that frames her act. Overall atmosphere is rich and purposeful, if sometimes bordering on lush excess.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly realized and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with specific textures (weathered racks, velvet moss, icicle maps) that echo the tech/biology and memory/trauma tensions. Setting doesn’t just decorate; it frames the sanctuary, provides the icicle “code,” and charges the final image of “writing new code in the honeyed hush.” While it doesn’t strictly constrain physical options, it strongly shapes emotional stakes and tone, which is appropriate for this mode. The environment remains consistent and evolving across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “feral nexus in mist,” dreaming river, and misty shoreline are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the story’s liminal, creative space. Details like his clothes staying dry, figures emerging from fog, and the river’s current all serve atmosphere and concept rather than feeling like generic fantasy scenery. The seashell as a recurring object bridges setting and theme, especially when it ends up on his desk catching morning light. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does consistently charge the images and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The verdant arbor, harvest moon, and vine tendril are vividly drawn and consistently reintegrated into action—the moonlight literally pools where the cricket is placed, and the vine physically interacts with Elias. Setting details mirror and support the ritual’s stakes rather than sitting as background; the arbor feels like a living participant. The final image (arbor exhaling, vine still, dawn) is strongly charged by prior environmental description. A touch more non-visual sensory texture or constraint on his options would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subarctic crater, withered orchard, glass circles, and skeletal apple tree are vivid and integrated into action, not just painted behind it. Crucially, the environment constrains and charges choices: the crater’s rare alignment enables the ritual, and the orchard’s last tree provides the resin that literally seals the knowledge, making setting inseparable from the final image. Sensory texture and world rules around starlight and copper feel internally consistent and specific. This atmosphere does substantial thematic work without sliding into muddled symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern is vividly and precisely rendered, with the “polished walls arching like frozen ripples” and shifting light angles tying environment directly to the echo mechanics. Setting is integrated into action—light, stone, and crystals all constrain how and when echoes can be harvested. The sacred/formerly-sacred quality deepens atmosphere and theme without slipping into museum-tour description. The final image of the fading light and the timer still working is strongly charged by the established physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bronze grotto under starlight is vividly and consistently rendered; details like “metallic veins” and “ribbons of starlight” feel specific and atmospheric. Crucially, the environment is not postcard-static: the starlight’s angle and the central bronze vein determine when and how Elara can transform, and the grotto itself becomes the structure she merges into. The recurring “whalebone reverie” and “shingled hush” tie setting to mood and theme. This setting actively constrains options and charges the final image of her as a permanent part of the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, ash wood, and circus-after-rain memories create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The recurring skylight, rain, and rust-hued light aren’t mere decoration; they frame and charge the final image of the completed carving in that same light. Environmental detail is selective, tactile (shavings like soft snow, grain under her thumb), and thematically aligned with liminality and “here and gone.” The setting doesn’t tightly constrain choices, but it deeply informs tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The kinetic lagoon, mirrored water planes, mist, and the halted carousel create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that strongly matches the story’s interior stakes. The environment is consistently filtered through Elias’s state (e.g., the lagoon “sighing,” its energy “slowing,” the horse’s painted eyes), which gives the place emotional texture. However, the lagoon rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; it functions more as mood and metaphor than as a live physical pressure. The final image of the lagoon receding into memory is resonant, but the setting still leans more decorative than decisively operative.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned spaceport and dead hydroponics bay are vividly realized and tightly tied to action: pipes, valves, grooves, and the concourse all matter to what Elara does. Details like “departures flickered with phantom destinations” and the dry hydroponics cavern create an atmosphere that mirrors the themes of lost purpose and renewal. The environment directly enables her method (repurposing water systems) and charges the final image of the terminal waking up. A bit more sensory range beyond sight and a touch of physical constraint would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial: crystalline pillars, raindrop percussion, and the “soundless sanctuary” form an evocative atmosphere that clearly reflects Elian’s inner life. Environmental details meaningfully shape his experience (the post-rain soundscape both wounds and heals), though they rarely constrain his options in a concrete way. The crystal forecourt in particular feels memorable and integrated rather than generic. Overall, description is rich but mostly supports mood and theme rather than tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The barge canal at pre-dawn, the moss-covered pylons, and the tactile reading of currents create a vivid, lived-in environment that shapes Elias’s tactics. The setting is filtered through his professional perception—e.g., differentiating sandy bottom from debris—and thus doubles as a functional tool. The pocket sundial works as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and meaningfully contrasts with the engineer’s plates. Atmosphere and place feel integral to both action and theme, not just decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The golden dock, first snow, fog, and harbor are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity and a consistent, wintry-maritime mood. Details like the weathered planks, complex rope, and harbor lights are filtered through Elias’s intent, so they feel lived-in rather than touristic. The fulgurite and the dock’s sacred status help charge the final image, even if the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices. The world rules (fog parting, rope weaving itself) feel internally consistent within the quietly fantastical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is outstanding: the harbor, the shadowed autumn garden, the copper signs, and the abandoned summer palace all feel concrete, distinctive, and thematically loaded. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility—he notices losses, labels, and residual beauty in ways that reinforce his vocation. The garden’s system of “explained absences” and the last-ship isolation both charge the atmosphere and the final image, even if they don’t strongly constrain tactical choices. This is near–publish-ready scene-building for a lyric short.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The suspended palace on stalactites and the humming mechanical cavern-world are rendered with strong, specific images that feel organically filtered through Kael’s perception. The environment is not mere backdrop: the quaking floors, stalactite anchors, and clockwork depths materially shape the stakes and closure (they groan, then snap, and their failure delivers the cost). The recurring use of mechanical sounds as atmosphere (“quaking reverie,” whirrs, hums) ties setting and tone tightly together. A touch more non-visual sensory detail or lived-in interaction (beyond awe and dread) could push this toward top-tier, but it is nonetheless very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, dunes, and migrating clouds create a richly textured environment that feels specific and inhabited rather than generic. Setting is tightly interwoven with action—the exposed volcanic sand enables planting, the lagoon’s reflective surface mirrors her inner duality, and the final image explicitly gathers clouds, sand, tree, and heart. Details are strongly filtered through her firefighter/rebirth lens, so the world consistently echoes her thematic concerns without lapsing into mere backdrop. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, it convincingly charges the final image and gives the piece much of its atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” is vivid and specific: cracked fish basins, rusted cherub pipes, moss-lined inscriptions, and soil-filled grand fountain all build a coherent, atmospheric place. Setting is not postcard decoration; the fountains literally provide the breadcrumb path and the city “breathing” at the end charges the final image and theme. Environmental change (whisper of water returning, sapling glowing) mirrors the internal shift without feeling mechanically symbolic. The only minor limit is that we stay largely in one tonal register of ruin-to-quiet-renewal without many surprising environmental reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nebula garden is vividly realized, with gas blossoms, luminous soil, and falling petals that function as both environment and temporal texture. The setting isn’t just decorative: it defines the sentimentalist’s vocation, frames the generational-pattern stakes, and is directly transformed by the gear’s integration, charging the final image. The recurring petals and light motifs evolve meaningfully (from lullaby-like repetition to quantified, evolving beauty). A couple of details (“Canada edges”) jar slightly, but overall atmosphere and specificity are strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse, dusk light, granite, and butterflies are vivid, sensorial, and tightly woven into character and theme. Details are POV-filtered through a craftsman—stone texture, light angle, humidity—and recur meaningfully (the butterflies and greenhouse as “cathedral of life and death”). The environment constrains what’s possible (solitude, ritual, spectral presence) and charges the final image of him leaving it behind. A bit of descriptive lushness approaches ornament, but most of it earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock tower, obsidian tidal ridge, sea, and town are specific and sensorially present, with the mechanism and pendulum directly shaping what Elias can do. Setting details are well-filtered through his professional and spiritual focus on gears, gravity, and timing. The final image of tide, ridge, and pendulum carrying his absolution grounds theme and closure in place.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—from “Meadowlawn Cemetery” to the “cobalt silo” with its spiral staircase, shelves, and constellation-inlaid worktable—and these details are integrated into action rather than catalogued. The lab’s specialized geography (pedestal, sovereign case, tapestry) directly enables Elias’s method, and the stars overhead mirror the constellations on the table, charging the final image. Atmosphere (“velveteen gloom”) is sustained with strong spatial coherence. The environment mostly supports and reflects mood and method rather than actively constraining tactical choices, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid, specific anchors that recur throughout and culminate in the thawing final image. Details like “liquid starlight” ink and shelves of “uncharted possibilities” enrich the atmosphere and align with the conceptual premise. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain tactics, but it strongly charges tone and theme, especially in the mirror metaphor of the lake as his craft. World rules feel internally consistent for a mythic/lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and cohesive: the orchestra hall, the ember alcove, mist, dust, and glow form a strong atmospheric lattice that’s consistently returned to and evolved. Environmental elements do real work—the alcove is the last hearth, the mist and dust embody the famine, the crystal and embers charge the final images. Details feel curated rather than touristic, and the world’s rule (dust can be reanimated by song) is legible through action. The only limiter is that physical constraints of space and environment do not meaningfully restrict tactics beyond mood and symbolic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The vanishing point gallery, sloping floors, mist, and the rocking chair create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that feels inseparable from the story’s emotional logic. Key objects (rocking chair, mask, pedestal, ash) recur and evolve, and the setting’s surreal geometry mirrors the liminal emotional state without over-explaining rules. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it deeply charges the ritual and final image. A slight tendency toward abstract description over tactile interaction is the only thing holding this back from the very highest scores.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean setting—labyrinthine sewers, limestone walls, rusted pipes, sedimentary layers—is vivid and consistently filtered through Sebastian’s practical and philosophical concerns. Environmental constraints matter: flooding tunnels, need for waterproof boxes, and rope leading upward all influence his tactics and the final emergence. The cog as an object is tightly embedded in setting via sediment context and sewer-grate shadow alignments. Atmosphere is strong and coherent, though sensory range tilts heavily visual/conceptual with limited tactile/aural embodiment under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “velvet library in autumn” is richly evoked—mahogany desk, velveteen chairs, leaves against tall windows, dust-moted light—and consistently filtered through Eleanor’s musical sensibility. The setting suits and amplifies the themes of preservation and quiet resistance and the library’s stillness is meaningfully “disturbed” yet sustained by the students. The rosette as a focal object charges both the middle explanation and the final image, giving the micro-setting emotional weight. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does effectively frame and color them.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rusted greenhouse and the post–Great Silence world are evoked with selective, purposeful detail that supports mood and premise. The setting is filtered through Elara’s professional and sensory priorities, especially in how tools, soil, and glass interact with her work and the cosmic alignment. However, the environment rarely constrains her options or tactics beyond generalized isolation and decay; the rust and ruin are more tonal than operative. The final image of a reclaimed, glowing greenhouse is strong but could be even more charged if the physical space had exerted more concrete pressure earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    The world—drone hives, floating gardens, lightning collection tower, “nectar dusk”—is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s perception. The tower functions as more than postcard backdrop, housing the maintenance panel and log and culminating in the charged descent past dark, resentful citizens. The environmental constraint is light rather than geography: the blackout and the tower’s silence shape mood and meaning more than physical tactics. The final image of dusk, lacquer box, and flickering lamp effectively ties setting to emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bayside neighborhood, 43 Harbor View, and the breathing house are vividly rendered with selective, sensory detail, especially smell (orris root, salt air) and shifting light (“streetlights daydreamed”). The environment is strongly filtered through Elias’s animist perception; houses, streetlights, and even shutters gain quasi-agency that supports the premise. Setting objects (teacup, latch, attic) are integrated into action rather than static description and recur in the charged final configuration. While the bay and season don’t strictly constrain choices, they deeply charge tone and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater city garden is vivid and textured—phosphorescent algae, stainless trellises, bronze flora, crystalline chime—and all filtered through Kael’s long familiarity. Crucially, the setting is not just backdrop: the crushed depth underlines his isolation, the garden’s architecture provides the chime through which he replies, and the “drowned Eden” frames the thematic tension of beauty vs. loss. Environmental details are purposeful and economical rather than touristic. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of the note ringing through the lifeless deep.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The infinite staircase is economically but effectively evoked—spiral geometry, groaning stone, heavy air—and its endlessness is felt as both physical space and metaphysical trap. The staircase meaningfully constrains options (only up, no end in sight) and its disintegration at the proof’s completion is central to the closure image. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and conceptual; more tactile or bodily interaction with the environment under pressure could deepen atmosphere. The final soft-lit room is a bit generic compared to the staircase but does reweight tone.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city is vividly realized and thematically aligned, with the clean, plant-filled space contrasting the polluted world below. Details like tomato vines, magnolia leaf, silver dust, and the orange city glow are sensorial and filtered through Elara’s attention. Setting is not mere backdrop: the greenhouse and moonlit window physically host the ritual and charge the final image of the leaf on the sill. The environment’s constraints are more atmospheric than logistical, but they meaningfully color and contain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is richly realized through selective, pressure-relevant detail: damp, rosewater-scented walls, aquifer shift, communal ovens pushing back chill, pooled water like oil. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional eye, and it evolves (tremor, thaw, fresco decay) rather than remaining static. The environment constrains options (they are entombed, dependent on ovens and memory), and the waterfall/underground world implicitly define the stakes of erasure. The final image—bread, ghosts of art, drip of water—feels inseparable from this particular place.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the lighthouse, rocky island, and low tide are not postcard décor but a liminal, dangerous environment that makes the hunger stone accessible and frames the stakes. The hunger stone, sea, and lighthouse beam all evolve with events (stone flares, becomes a beacon, then darkens; the beam stutters, then resumes), and these changes charge the final image. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through the tone of bleak awe. The environment clearly constrains options (he can only do this at low tide, in isolation) and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse and hall of mirrors are evocative and tonally apt, with mirrors functioning as literalized alternate outcomes. The opera cloak clasp works as a charged micro-setting object, constraining choices and powering the final image. However, sensory detail stays mostly visual and metaphoric; we don’t fully inhabit the physical strangeness of the space. The world’s rules (funhouse, mirrors, curse) remain consistent and support the liminal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story’s standout strength: the floating orchard, salt-drinking roots, bell-fruit, and wind harp create a striking, coherent world filtered through the prophet’s musical lens. Details like fruit “that had never known earth” and branches tuned into instruments are both imagistic and thematically driven. Environment meaningfully charges the premise (obstacles-into-instruments) but stops short of constraining a tough choice in-scene. Still, the world rules feel internally consistent and the final image of the spinning orchard is powerfully grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shell-city of Tortuga is vividly realized and tightly integrated: streets following turtle grooves, the Great Elder’s dome as observational perch, and the shell itself housing the hidden message and device. Environmental constraints (the rusted Western Gate, the distant horizon, the city’s physical immobility atop living shells) directly shape options and tactics. Details are filtered through Elara’s cartographic sensibility, turning shells and spirals into both setting and semiotic system. The final image—moonlight on shells as she plays the whistle—beautifully charges the world with thematic weight without feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused, ivy-choked station and the dead rosebush are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone and theme. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through Elias’s moral/historical lens, turning setting into a metaphorical extension of the lie. While the station doesn’t strongly constrain physical choice, the letter’s placement, the flickering light, and the ivy-wrapped building inform how he frames his argument. The final image of the silent, ivy-clad station as he leaves gives the environment a resonant, if symbolic, charge.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The submerged pavilion and its details—the shattered dome, exposed foundations, ankle-deep water, and acoustics—are vivid and tightly filtered through a surveyor’s eye. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the maintenance window, water level, and architectural scars all tangibly shape what Elias can do and when. The environment mirrors theme without feeling schematic, especially in the “interlaced absence” of the old ballroom. This is near top-tier atmosphere, just shy of 9-band because the physical constraints could be integrated even more directly into a consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater library is vivid and specific—the watery dome, hydroelectric systems, blackout, and candlelight are all integrated into Elias’s activity and constraints. Recurring imagery of dappled light through water and the silent machinery charges both the investigative process and the final image. The world-building about an intentionally submerged city is unveiled through the plot rather than static exposition, reweighting prior assumptions. Environment genuinely shapes what he can do and what he realizes, especially via the blackout and engineered submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s grief: glass basilica, floating tea garden, dew-slick driftwood tables, bonsais, and rocking isle all feel tactile and atmospheric. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—cranes as a constellation under refracted light in a place where gravity claimed the body and shadows rise—so setting is not mere wallpaper. World rules (floating island, rising shadows) are stable and conveyed via image rather than exposition. The setting constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete tactics, but for this length and lens it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating observatory, thermosphere setting, and the hum/fail of machinery are vivid and tonally apt, and the geode as a recurring micro-setting object is strongly handled. Environmental details are filtered well through Elias’s preoccupations (math/physics + metaphysics), avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. The world rules around the Potential Resonance Mapper and “pools of potential” feel internally consistent enough for this length. The setting could constrain his options more concretely at the end; right now, it frames mood and concept more than it forces specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient observatory, desert dusk, and “brilliant dimness” are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. The setting meaningfully interacts with events (the dormant telescope waking, the dome filling with swirling light), even if it’s more symbolic and tonal than constraining of specific tactics. Details like crumbling stone arches versus modern drone tech sharpen the thematic tension between old and new ways of knowing. The environment charges the final image of dawn and the pulsing chip more than it dictates concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt terrace, twilight, and shore/driftwood imagery create a distinct, coherent atmosphere that mirrors Elias’s inner state without feeling like generic mood lighting. Details like the “cobalt stones” shifting to “violet and blood” are purposeful and emotionally keyed. The environment doesn’t much constrain physical choice, but it does charge the emotional stakes and closure image (leaving the terrace toward the shore). The watch hand functions almost as micro-setting as well, giving the scene a tactile focal point.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, sea, and moon are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the liminal “between” the story explores. Details like moisture beading on his coat and mist “curling” around stone feel specific and grounded in Julian’s perspective. The drawer pull as a recurring object meaningfully charges the final image, functioning as a micro-setting in his palm. Still, the physical environment rarely constrains tactics or choices; it shapes mood more than outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coastal launch, utility poles, rust, brine, and lighthouse are vivid and filtered through a navigator’s eye so they feel lived-in, not touristic. Setting constrains choices: the lighthouse’s inaccessibility at high tide and the bay crossing shape her routine and the story’s physical task. The compass operates as a charged micro-setting object whose meaning shifts decisively at the climax. Atmosphere (salt, decay, tourists, fishermen) consistently mirrors her internal state without heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered and functions as more than décor, providing the physical path (submerged tunnel) and the sensory condition (“the cold”) that thematically tests him. Details like organisms pulsing with drips and light playing tricks on the mind are purposeful, not touristic. The setting evolves with his progress—from shore to tunnels to central chamber—and culminates in the final immersive image. A slightly heavy descriptive load in places is the only minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard of perpetual moonlight, impossible blossoms, and alchemical spices are vivid and sensorially rich, especially in touch and smell. Details are filtered through Elara’s priorities as a beast whisperer, which keeps the world from feeling like a catalog. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choices; it supports mood more than it shapes tactics. The setting charges the final image as witness, but it doesn’t quite become an active pressure on the story’s outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is richly specific and integrated: liquid-mercury time, impossible flora, air that “chokes” with beauty—all filtered through her grief. Setting is not postcard; it constrains options (she must perform particular tactile magic on a floating boulder, breathe in suffocating beauty, confront a realm where time is sediment). The recurring objects-as-setting (onyx ink, cracked saucer, cloudwood box) charge the final image and thematically bind grief, time, and ritual. A slight overabundance of figurative description in places keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The recycled spaceship, memory chamber, and wall of photographs are vivid and purposeful, closely tied to Elara’s method and to the story’s mood. The detail of dried tears crystallized on old photos is both sensory and functional, nicely merging setting with plot. World rules (ship as cultural ark, observation deck turned archive) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than infodump. The environment does shape tactics, but it stops short of deeply constraining choice in the climax, so the setting is strong rather than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, fissure, and once-a-decade celestial event are vividly rendered and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the fissure and buried box at the volcano’s base provide the physical locus for his thematic discovery, and the sand/sea/volcano triad embodies transformation. Environmental details evolve with events—the rumbling volcano, the glowing fissure, the shifting hush—and the final crunch of black sand under his boots charges the last image. The world rules are consistent enough for this slightly magical realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    The luminous fort, glow-stone technology, twilight courtyard, and “cradle of sparks” chamber are all concrete, legible spaces with a consistent visual logic. Setting is integrated into action via the sundial, hidden panel, and emergency torches that justify stealth, though sensory detail leans heavily on the visual. The bronze quill holder and sundial work well as micro-setting tools that shape choices, but the larger world feels somewhat generic and under-textured. Atmosphere is present but could be more uniquely tied to Elena’s specific perceptions and profession.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal bluff, auroras, and frictionless coastline are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her occupational gaze as an eel herder. Setting is not mere backdrop: the auroras supply energy, the bluff once collapsed from a misaligned pattern, and the frictionless world explicitly complicates her work. These environmental rules stay consistent and directly inform the ritual’s mechanics and risk. A slightly deeper tactile engagement with the frictionless condition in the climax could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vivid and specific, with the storm, dome glass, and churning “ink” clouds tightly mirroring his interior state. Setting is not postcard-only: the height and isolation create a liminal, almost sacred space that justifies this being the place where he breaks silence. The darkroom timer and observatory function as micro-setting tools that literally and symbolically mark the end of the vigil and prompt action. A slight tendency toward reiterated atmospheric notes is the only thing holding this back from the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and needle card are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention, producing a strong, unified atmosphere. The sundial and light angles directly shape the characters’ actions and language, not just the backdrop. Environmental details (shifting shadows, brook’s rhythm) evolve alongside the duel and subtly mirror its tempo. The setting feels integral to the concept, though it stops short of forcing a hard tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “rusted library under stars,” scrap-metal shelves, and banned flowers create a strong, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically apt. Setting details are well-filtered through Elias’ sensibility as a poet and vagrant, with the environment mirroring themes of salvage and renewal. The coffee tin, seeds, and wildflower imagery recur and meaningfully charge the final image of banned blooms and thoughts circulating. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics beat-by-beat, it clearly shapes what’s possible (outdoor guerrilla library, relocatable books, garden as cover for resistance).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the station, staircase, and especially the “tidal arbor” above the clouds are sharply drawn and integrated with the time-bending mechanism. Environmental specifics (bioluminescent flora, tidal pull, cloudline) actively shape the method and the final image (“The arbor above the clouds would keep his secret”). The details feel filtered through his sensibility as a musician—melodic language, rhythms, “tides” and “encore” metaphors. A slightly broader sensory range beyond sight and vague scent would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: blossoms as story-objects, ridge hum, monsoon scent, and “sweet decay and new life” all build a textured, coherent world. Crucially, the ridge is required for the ritual and the blossoms physically embody memory, so environment isn’t decorative—it’s integrated into the premise and stakes. Weather (approaching monsoon) and the ridge’s unique properties both charge the final images. A touch less decorative metaphor and a bit more tactical use of the environment during the dream-entering would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The islet, post-rain air, smell of wet earth, and tide sounds are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through his bonsai-obsessed, reflective gaze. The environment is not mere backdrop: the isolation, sea-tide motif, and weather all mirror and shape his interior “tides of remembrance.” Recurring objects-as-setting—the compass, lace, and ancient pine—anchor space and charge the final image, where the compass pointing to the horizon concretely reconfigures meaning. Sensory details are economical and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific ("condensation," "shattered lilies," "cracked terracotta"), grounding the abstract magic effectively. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop for the ritual rather than offering obstacles or constraints that force Elara to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is anchored well with specific details like "luminous glass rods" and the "fire-blackened brick," establishing a clear atmosphere. Sensory descriptions are vivid but occasionally veer into abstract attribution ("smelling of betrayal") rather than concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "winterglass conservatory" is vividly described but functions primarily as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the sensory details of the frost and blooms are clear, the setting does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force a tactical shift. It remains a safe sanctuary throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater library is a vivid, atmospheric conceit with strong specific details ("fish darted between bookshelves"). While the workshop scenes are functional, the underwater imagery anchors the magical realism effectively, even if the transition there is abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details like the "terra-cotta arbor" are distinct but remain static backdrops; the summary mode prevents the environment from exerting concrete pressure on tactical choices or constraining action in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    The camera obscura and wisteria-draped viaduct create a vivid visual anchor that grounds the opening effectively. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it provides a backdrop for the action but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "living bridge garden" is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong backdrop for the surreal logic of the piece. However, the "hyperbolic geometry" acts more as a repeated descriptor for "twisting paths" than a distinct spatial constraint that forces unique tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospheric, with specific details like "stale popcorn" and "rusted support beam" grounding the carnival environment. While "dust motes danced" is a cliché opener, the juxtaposition of the frivolous carnival ruins with the solemn seed vault creates a distinct texture. The physical space is mostly clear, though the mechanics of the bench-lock interface are slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, blending the "sunken orchard" and "ashen forge" into a vivid, atmospheric locale that grounds the surreal premise. Sensory details are specific and effectively filtered through Elias's synesthesia.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but heavily overwritten with adjectives ("emerald luminescence," "misty veil"). The environment feels like a static stage set for the metaphor rather than a tangible place that pressures the character. The reliance on visual abstraction distances the reader from the physical reality of the station.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting is vivid but marred by purple prose ("scorpions of rust," "icicles wept") that draws attention to the writing rather than the environment. While the contrast between the cold room and hot glass is functional, the description is often overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is rendered through heavy-handed metaphors ("skeletons," "glittering like scattered salt") that prioritize atmosphere over spatial coherence. The "iron doors" initially lock the protagonist in but cease to be a constraint when the plot requires travel.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting contains a logical clash between the &quot;pebble-shore&quot; identity and the &quot;ridge fort&quot; location that is never reconciled. Atmospheric descriptors are vivid but repetitive (&quot;ambered hush&quot;), and the storm outside exerts no actual pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmospheric and specific ("crystalline frost," "sizzling like tiny stars"). The setting vividly reflects the frozen time concept and grounds the abstract action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "shattered desk" and "whispering stones" are vivid but incoherent, clashing between post-apocalyptic ruin and urban fantasy without establishing ground rules. The setting provides mood but fails to constrain the characters' actions; the "shattered" elements suggest danger that the characters ignore to drink tea.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details like the "crushed morning glory seeds" effectively ground the atmosphere of the decaying garden. However, the spatial coherence shatters at the end when objects inexplicably transport from the hut to the maze center.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Setting details like the "reinforced dome" and "control panel" are generic sci-fi furniture; the "hush of beating wings" adds a specific texture but remains a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.4)
    Setting descriptions like "dancing shadows" and "soft sloshing" are generic and atmospheric rather than tactile or constraining. The flooded pit does not exert physical pressure on the character's choices, serving instead as a passive backdrop for the ghostly encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mountain station is vivid and atmospheric, effectively mirroring Elara's isolation and "thin" reality. The sensory details of the cold, the wool, and the charcoal anchor the abstract mental action, providing necessary grounding for the internal narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "beaded valve wheel" is a striking, specific artifact that successfully anchors the scene's surrealism. However, the surrounding atmosphere often relies on abstract descriptors ("smelling of... regret") rather than sensory particulars, and the tunnel setting serves more as a backdrop than a constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    Imagery like "knowledge crystallized into stone" provides atmospheric specificity, but the setting also relies on stock tropes ("dust motes danced," "impossible geometries"). The environment is vivid but largely static, serving as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and actively supports the narrative, with the eclipse phases mirroring the therapeutic progress well. However, some descriptors lean toward abstract "purple" phrasing ("dreaming roots," "gentle craft") rather than grounding the reader in concrete, sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "bronze quiet" and "concrete curves" of the silo create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that effectively grounds the speculative elements. The environment feels distinct and lived-in, though the interaction with it remains largely procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with clarity ("flickering lighthouse beam," "jagged rocks"), but relies heavily on standard atmospheric tropes ("grizzled old man," "wind howled"). While the lighthouse serves as a functional workshop, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or generate friction. The sensory details are competent but predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on abstract descriptors ("muffled clarity," "void") and generic sci-fi props ("dimensional anchor") rather than tactile, grounded details. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or provide specific obstacles beyond a general resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the glass spire acts as the instrument, and specific details like the "crack... resembled a crooked smile" ground the magical realism. The frozen lake and mirrored horizon effectively mirror the internal state, creating a unified atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting anchors (viaduct, rain) are established, but the description relies heavily on generic sci-fi/vaporwave signifiers ("neon veins," "glowing rails"). The "labyrinth of self" remains a vague metaphorical space that fails to impose specific, tangible constraints on the protagonist's movement until the final jump.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sensory details of the cavern—dust, wood, vibration through the floor—are well-chosen for a deaf protagonist, grounding the experience in touch rather than sound. The setting actively supports the "resonance" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is established with competent but generic dystopian imagery ("muted gold," "ancient stone walls," "flicker of shadow"). While the "rogue quarantine zone" suggests a larger world, the immediate courtyard lacks distinct, tactile specificity that would ground the scene. The atmosphere relies on stated moods like "tranquility" rather than sensory evocation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    The greenhouse setting is established with evocative sensory details that support the wistful tone. The &quot;ozone and honey&quot; scent profile is specific and grounding, though some descriptions (&quot;crystal shadows&quot;) prioritize sound over visual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details like "sandpaper" and "terra-cotta" effectively ground the abstract concept of time's texture in a tangible environment. However, the setting description occasionally drifts into abstraction (e.g., "origami made of twilight"), which distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting—a greenhouse with shipwrecks—is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid and specific imagery ("skeletal hulls," "glass dome fractured"). The atmosphere is cohesive, though the descriptions occasionally veer into ornate "purple" territory ("loomed like broken elders") rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the "honey" light offers some atmosphere, the setting is rendered via the rote repetition of the phrase "amber grotto at dusk," which appears four times in a short text. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or active pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "breezy library" with a dome "open to the night sky" where loose papers fly "like falling leaves" strains credibility—rare manuscripts would not be handled in a windy, open-air environment. The setting serves the aesthetic of the prompt but violates basic logic, undermining the story's realism.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is vivid but strictly ornamental, acting as a backdrop of "crystalline" adjectives rather than a physical space that constrains choices. The environment does not offer resources or obstacles that shape tactics; the characters float through the description rather than interacting with a concrete, resistant world.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting of a city built upon a sleeping giant is evocative and functionally integrated into the plot, influencing the timeline and the environment (canals). Sensory details like the "charcoal smudge" and "damp metal" ground the fantasy elements effectively, though some descriptors lean toward generic atmospheric phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cavern setting is atmospherically consistent and frames the ritual well, with bioluminescence and mineral details grounding the scene. However, reliance on generic descriptors like "fantastical shapes" and "impossible garden" misses opportunities for the sharper, more specific sensory constraints that define high-band settings.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    Orientation is clear, but the atmosphere relies on "literary" abstractions ("sapphire hush," "aged bones") rather than specific, tactile grounding. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of frictional constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is specific and atmospheric, with the "mossy trellis" and "slick" wood grounding the action physically. The storm acts as a genuine pressure cooker that forces the protagonist's hand. The linden leaf serves excellently as a micro-setting/object that constrains the protagonist's focus and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmospheric details of the rain trails and tidal island are vivid and establish a clear mood, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker. The "water wars" backstory provides flavor but doesn't materially constrain the immediate action or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting relies on abstract descriptors ("impossible geometries," "complex patterns") and standard fantasy tropes rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. While the cave is central to the plot, the environment functions as a passive playground for the epiphany rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with consistent imagery ("ivory harbor," "mist"), but relies on atmospheric clichés ("sunlight breaking through clouds"). The environment provides a backdrop rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting is an abstract "white room" filled with vague props ("starlit vault," "mist," "phantom platform") rather than a grounded physical space. Sensory details are decorative ("cutting a trembling circle") rather than functional, failing to constrain the character's choices or anchor the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting details are functional but generic ("winding stairs," "perfect circle"), failing to constrain the character’s movement or choices. The atmosphere remains abstract, with the tower acting as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is vividly described but suffers from "white room" syndrome, relying on abstract visual metaphors ("shifting light-prisms," "invisible lines of force") rather than tactile grounding. The specific term "escondite" is repeated seven times in a short space, becoming a distraction rather than an immersive anchor. The environment feels more like a stage for metaphors than a lived-in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with functional but generic sensory details (cold steel, formaldehyde smell). The atmosphere relies on stated labels like "deathly vitality" rather than idiosyncratic, immersive description that shapes the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    The fluorescent lamp hum and bonsai labyrinth offer specific sensory anchors, creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting remains decorative background; it does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    Descriptions are atmospheric but rely on standard genre shorthand ("steel canyons," "monoliths") rather than idiosyncratic detail. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists largely of generic atmospheric markers ("jagged cliff," "tempestuous sea") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain action. The "decaying dome" and cello provide some texture, but they function more as symbolic backdrops than as an environment that pressures the character's physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The concept of the floating carnival is imaginative, but the execution relies on generic descriptors ("neon lights," "floating monoliths") and summary. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices in a dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    Visual descriptions of the lunar landscape and the "ethereal light" are vivid and establish a clear atmosphere. However, the premise of colors "that defied lunar physics" and the scientific logic behind the chemical/sand interaction strain credibility within the hard sci-fi frame.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.7)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric markers ("mist-shrouded," "rusted tracks") rather than specific, lived-in details. The sensory description is overwhelmingly visual (light, mist, glow), which contradicts the point of view of a blind protagonist. The environment provides mood but does not constrain choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with decent sensory details ("groaned under weight," "cold seeping"), creating a functional atmosphere. However, the reliance on the phrase "worrying tranquility" to do the atmospheric heavy lifting prevents higher immersion. The condensation on the glass serves as an effective, if magical, micro-setting element.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting uses standard "ghost town" tropes (hollow eyes, silent screams, stuck clocks) without specific, grounding details that constrain the protagonist. While the atmospheric intent is clear, the environment reacts pliably to the tuner's magic rather than offering resistance or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmosphere is undermined by the repetitive, forced insertion of the phrase "gathered hush," which appears four times and often breaks syntactic logic. The setting lacks tactile specificity, relying on generic sci-fi descriptors ("crystalline spires," "pulsing orb") that fail to ground the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse prison setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, but the immersion is broken by the verbatim repetition of descriptive phrases like "copperlight repose." These textual loops make the environment feel like a static stage set built around inserted keywords rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is descriptively lush ("luminous flora," "winter-cracked fields") but functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources. The "alchemical" nature of the greenhouse is stated but does not influence the physics of the scene or the characters' tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the image of canyon walls glowing "like internal organs" is striking. The environment effectively frames the surreal nature of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "catacomb orchard" with roots snaking through skeletons is a vivid, specific image that grounds the scene effectively. However, the setting description often tilts into purple prose ("impossible perfume," "claiming a prize") that decorates rather than constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.8)
    While adjectives are plentiful, the setting ("golden arcade") is repeated as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources. The description relies on repetitive phrasing ("golden light," "golden concrete") rather than specific, sensory interaction that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "cobalt observatory" provides a basic anchor, but the setting is rendered through repetitive, atmospheric phrases ("echoed silence," "hummed") rather than tactile interaction. The environment functions more as a backdrop for metaphors than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    The specific imagery of condensation on leaves acting as windowpanes is vivid and effectively grounds the magic. However, the setting acts largely as atmospheric backdrop ("skeletal fingers," "salt-laced air") rather than a constraint that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is drowned in heavy metaphorical filtering ("twilight’s tears," "funeral shrouds") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the atrium. While the atmosphere is consistent, the relentless adjectival layering obscures the spatial geography and sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details establish a mood, though phrases like "skeletal trees" and "ghosts" lean on cliché. The specific insertion of "internal knowledge network" creates a jarring anachronism that clashes with the established gothic fantasy tone ("centuries of thick fog," "thatched roofs").

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "sound wave garden" is conceptually vivid and synesthetic, but it functions purely as scenery rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The setting presents wonders to be admired but does not force the protagonist to adapt her tactics or tools.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid, employing specific sensory details ("formaldehyde," "frantic flutter of moth wings") to ground the opening. However, the subsequent garden scenes lack this level of texture, and the world-building regarding the "Thought Tax" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.0)
    The "gargantuan shell" is a vivid, surreal image that establishes a distinct atmosphere ("pearlescent walls"). However, the setting remains a static backdrop that provides no physical constraints or resources to force the character's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is atmospheric but suffers from "white room" syndrome, relying on high-concept descriptors ("opal," "iridescent," "crystalline") without concrete spatial grounding. The environment feels floaty, and the "museum of extinct feelings" remains an abstract concept rather than a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is a generic fantasy archive ("dust and silence," "ancient texts") that serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the ink well is described vividly, the sensory details often lean into abstraction ("liquid starlight," "shadows that danced like ghosts") rather than concrete, grounding textures. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices; she simply performs her task within it.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the descriptions are vivid ("dust like forgotten confetti"), the spatial logic of a floodgate located inside a volcanic amphitheater is confusing and feels like a prompt salad. The setting serves as atmospheric dressing rather than a constraint on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The attic setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the abstract obsession in concrete sensory details ("scent of decaying paper," "grimy skylight").

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "drifting prism terrace" is evocative but functions as a passive backdrop that does not constrain Elea’s movements or force tactical choices. The setting feels abstract and "white room" adjacent, anchored only by the prop of the wooden furniture and the logbook.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the underwater visuals are established, the setting lacks tactile reality; the "warm" feather in a submerged archive is a physics-breaking artifact that undermines immersion. The facility functions as a magical black box where "archives" yield instant answers to vague queries. The environment is described through adjectives rather than interaction/constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Setting details are decorative ("nervous fireflies," "iridescent") rather than constraining. The geode serves as a static container for the scene without functioning as a pressure cooker that forces tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with decent atmospheric detail ("skeleton of iron and glass," "salty air"), anchoring the scene effectively. However, the descriptions occasionally veer into overwrought territory ("eyes like shattered glass," "sky bruised with constellations") that distances the reader rather than immersing them in the sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid but largely static, serving as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. Descriptions tilt toward the ornamental ("crystalline dome," "twilight garden") without forcing the character to interact with the environment in a way that alters her tactics. The sensory details are visual but lack tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    Descriptions are vivid but ornamental ("milky light," "fractured rainbow") and do not constrain the character's choices. The setting acts as a passive canvas for the character's projection rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is rendered with ornamental, "purple" description ("ink spilled," "silver footsteps," "celestial slow dance") that serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraining force. While the imagery is consistent, it rarely interacts with the protagonist's choices or creates physical obstacles; the ridge is merely a stage for internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is comprised of generic descriptors ("smooth stones," "lucent shells") and behaves conveniently to validate the protagonist (glowing water). The rising tide is introduced as a pressure element but is explicitly dismissed as a threat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength, with vivid details like "brittle leaves" and "veined tendrils" grounding the scene in a gothic texture. However, the "climate shifts" backdrop feels like ornamental wallpaper rather than a constraint that actively pressures the protagonist's choices. The "mapping" aspect of the cartographer role remains abstract and is not substantiated by tools or specific interaction with the setting beyond touching walls.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmosphere is consistent, but the reliance on repetitive fixed phrases ("prism parapet," "echoing terrace") flattens the specificity. The setting functions as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is generic ("ancient terrace," "stone worn smooth") and relies on clichés like midsummer sun alignment without specific sensory grounding. While the "slow dance of celestial bodies" attempts to anchor time, it functions more as a repetitive refrain than a constraint that pressures the character’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid imagery ("crystallized earth," "bruised sky") effectively grounding the surreal atmosphere. The environment actively participates in the ritual, though descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("forgotten sunlight").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting functions as a metaphorical "white room" filled with ornamental props ("crystalline facets") rather than a tangible, lived-in space. Sensory details are largely visual and abstract, lacking the tactile specificity required to ground the fable-like elements.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.2)
    The juxtaposition of the radar dome and the seedy bar offers a distinct atmospheric contrast, establishing a decent spatial grounding. However, the potential of the dome as a constraint is largely wasted; it serves mostly as a backdrop for the opening and closing rather than shaping the action. The sensory details often lean into cliché ("velvet curtain," "tarnished halos") rather than specific, lived-in observation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and provides the necessary constraints (materials, weather) for the action. However, descriptors occasionally drift into purple prose ("clung to the sky like a secret," "whisper of orange") that distances the reader. The environment is well-visualized, though the repetition of specific atmospheric phrases dulls the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("waves of jade and violet"), providing a strong backdrop for the ritual. However, the environment remains largely ornamental; the cold and the ice do not force tactical trade-offs or meaningfully constrain the protagonist's actions beyond adding descriptive color.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with functional sensory detail ("ozone," "wet earth," "vine-draped"). The use of the loose floor panel as a tool for the protagonist's foresight is a strong, specific beat. The "dreamscape" interior remains somewhat abstract compared to the concrete bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric detailing is the story's strength, effectively grounding the reader in the "ziggurat silhouette" and "indigo vault." The specific integration of the tile's geometry with the palace setting creates a solid sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.0)
    The "soundless sanctuary" presents an immediate logical contradiction as characters speak and music plays without explanation of the mechanics. While the "shifting reality" provides atmospheric set-dressing, it does not constrain action or influence the characters' choices. The setting remains a vague backdrop rather than a tangible environment affecting the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "ruined orchard" and "fog" rendered through vivid, atmospheric details that ground the magical elements. The imagery of the glass mountains and frost effectively establishes a consistent, melancholic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The surreal juxtaposition of orchard and cathedral is imaginative and visually distinct, though sensory descriptions occasionally lean into standard pairings ("dappled rivers").

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.5)
    The astral orchard imagery provides some vivid details ("crystalline fruits"), but the lack of a stable scene denies the setting any weight or constraint. Locations (office, restricted wing, bathroom, home) are visited in rapid summary without spatial grounding or sensory specificity that influences choices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "Serpent Stack" is an evocative, high-concept setting that blends the physical and the linguistic effectively. However, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop for Elara's intellect; she observes it rather than engaging with it in a tactile way that forces trade-offs (e.g., the squid ink is packed but not meaningfully used).

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on generic gothic tropes ("skeletal grimaces," "dying stars") rather than specific, sensory constraints that shape the character's choices. The fog and ship serve as backdrops for the magical item's use rather than active forces of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "brass oil and aged parchment" and the "riveted iron" provide a solid grounding in the mechanism room, establishing a tactile reality. However, the "void stitched from threads of starlight" and the "infinite library" veer into generic fantasy tropes that lack the specific, constrained physicality of the opening setting.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established clearly, though the imagery leans on standard elemental tropes ("rivers on a frozen moon"). While the "cracks in the ice" serve the plot, the environment feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker, with the "storm" outside lacking visceral immediacy inside the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "glass humming pavilion" provides a vivid backdrop, but the setting details—while lyrical—do not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adaptations. The "wind currents" and "vibrations" add atmosphere but remain ornamental rather than functioning as obstacles or tools that shape the outcome beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "solidified fog" is a compelling, specific physical constraint that anchors the scene's logic and timing. However, the observatory itself remains vague, defined by abstract descriptors ("stormlit," "crystal") rather than tactile details that Kael interacts with to solve his problem.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details ("lavender," "mosaic") establish a clear atmosphere, but the setting functions primarily as a passive container for clues rather than exerting pressure. The lack of stars is a strong visual anchor but does not constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto and tidal pools are well-integrated, functioning as both setting and primary metaphor to constrain the protagonist's focus. The jade cicada serves as an excellent micro-setting element that anchors the abstract thoughts. Specificity is generally high, though occasionally drifts into abstraction ("impossible ceiling") rather than concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details are vivid ("moist silence of a cloud’s belly"), but the "tang of rust and ozone" is a sci-fi cliché. The usage of "xenial" (hospitable) to describe a trellis is distinct but slightly jarring given the usual context of the word.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting of the prism terraces and floating gardens is visually distinct and establishes a coherent fantasy aesthetic. However, the environment functions mostly as scenery; it does not constrain Elara’s choices or force tactical adjustments. The "crystalline structures" are described but lack tactile engagement beyond the placement of the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.9)
    The setting relies heavily on standard genre tropes (floating cities, androids) without adding fresh specificity. While the "synth-skin" detail is nice, the "kaleidoscopic waterfall" feels like a postcard backdrop rather than a source of constraint or tactile pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on standard gothic adjectives ("ashen," "skeletal," "hollowed") rather than fresh sensory interaction. The redundancy of "ashen charcoal" weakens the visual precision. The doorknocker ring, however, serves as a strong, tangible anchor that grounds the otherwise abstract environment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the bioluminescent setting is visualized, the description relies on generic tropes and abstract labels ("ethereal light," "shadowseam wonder") rather than tactile particulars that constrain action. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than an active force shaping the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "sepia reading room" relies on generic aesthetic markers ("mahogany," "leather-bound") that establish a vibe but do not constrain the character's tactics. The vibration of the floorboards adds some sensory texture, but the setting largely functions as a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the clockwork orchard is a creative concept, the descriptions often rely on abstraction ("liquid thoughts," "impossible hues") rather than grounding sensory details. The setting functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker, with elements like the "endless night" feeling static until the sudden resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.9)
    Atmospheric details like the "accumulated dust patterns" and the "heavy" ledger ground the scene effectively. However, descriptors like "sterile hum" and "dusty boxes" border on generic, and the setting primarily serves as a mirror for the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting anchors the scene, but elements like the "auric lagoon" feel grafted on to satisfy prompts rather than organic to the gritty dystopian world. The sensory details ("glowed with a warm golden hue") are vivid but clash tonally with the maintenance-shed reality.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is integral to the action; the prism atrium and the specific lighting conditions ("dewdrops," "mist") function as essential tools for the protagonist's ritual. The mechanics of the grotto ground the supernatural elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting features imaginative concepts ("iron-ore acorns," "tweezers fashioned from fallen stars"), but they often appear as lists rather than interacting with the character's choices. The environment provides a backdrop but does not exert pressure or constraint on the action; Elias simply sits in his room.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    The subterranean workshop and waterfall provide a coherent, if standard, fantasy atmosphere. While visual details are present (vines, rusted tools), the geography feels constructed to serve the metaphor rather than existing as a lived-in space that constrains the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.7)
    The foundry setting is established with some sensory competence ("rain hammered the tin roof," "single bare bulb"), creating a moody backdrop for the ritual. However, the world-building falters with twee, list-like magical items ("thermos that brewed courage," "compass that pointed to unresolved grief") that feel like conceptual placeholders rather than grounded tools. The atmosphere is cohesive but leans heavily into purple description ("smelled of sulfur and sorrow") rather than concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the setting suffers from metaphorical confusion that obscures physical reality. It is unclear whether the "misaligned harp" is a physical instrument, the gorge's acoustics, or the tooth itself, making the mechanics of the scene difficult to visualize. The reliance on abstract sensory descriptions ("cliffs swallowed sound") distances the reader from the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "sickly violet glow" and "ozone" of the forest establish a vivid atmosphere, but the setting largely functions as a static backdrop for internal recollection. The environment does not actively constrain Kael’s tactical options or force specific interactions, limiting its role to thematic framing.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting uses generic magical tropes ("bottled starlight," "glowing ropes") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain action. The environment dissolves when convenient ("market dissolved around her"), serving as a backdrop rather than a tangible place with rules and friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the supernatural elements in the "grimy panes" and "fractured plaster" of the ticket office. While the sensory details are strong, they occasionally veer into standard atmospheric tropes ("dust lay like a shroud," "peeling gilt") rather than strictly constraining the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass orchard is atmospheric, though elements like "swirling sea of clouds" and "fractured rainbows" lean on generic fantasy tropes. The physical grounding of the press within the ethereal space helps.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    "Visible time" is a compelling atmospheric constraint that is well-integrated into the setting description. The specific grounding of the maintenance suite contrasts effectively with the abstract "baroque halls."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    The resonance chamber is a strong, functional setting element that actively constraints the protagonist's method by revealing the "invisible fissures." While effective, the description leans on "steampunk-lite" aesthetics that sometimes prioritize whimsy over grounded physical geography.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sensory specificity is exceptional, prioritizing scent and sound to match the protagonist's bias. The environment is not just a backdrop but the antagonist and the prize, charging the final image of the lagoon with immense sensory and narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the setting is established, the geography dissolves into dream logic where a storm-battered shoreline is easily navigable. The recurring descriptor "turbine-hum" clashes with the natural "ancient giants" imagery, confusing the atmospheric grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.1)
    The atmosphere is consistent, but the setting lacks spatial specificity and tactile interaction, functioning more as a backdrop for the montage. The "amber pavilion" and "etched glass" are vivid concepts, but they are observed in passing rather than inhabited during a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vivid but suffers from a "white room" effect masked by heavy adjectival ornamentation ("bruised violet," "obsidian lagoon"). The geography is hazy—the relationship between the gondola, the rope ladder, and the shore is functional but lacks grounded, tactile specificity beyond the purple descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Evocative imagery like "sand as smooth as powdered glass" establishes a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting lacks physical resistance or constraints, serving merely as a passive canvas for the protagonist's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details like the "engineered soil that tasted of both earth and sky" and the "overripe persimmon" effectively ground the high-concept setting. The atmosphere is tangible and specific, anchoring the fantastical elements in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.6)
    The setting is vivid and spatially clear, with the "icebound atrium" providing a solid anchor. Sensory details are present ("plume of silver," "crack stone"), though they lean toward standard high-fantasy imagery. The environment frames the action well but does not significantly constrain the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting provides a coherent atmospheric backdrop with some vivid details like the "sleeping python" rope. However, the "sanctuary" feels somewhat generic, and the specific mechanics of the "impossible structure" remain vague, serving more as a stage set than a pressure-generating environment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are generic ("monitors," "observation dome," "stellar dust") and fail to constrain action or provide specific sensory texture. The "cosmic" backdrop reads as interchangeable wallpaper rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the "impossible amber" apiary in a wasteland is visually strong and anchors the piece effectively. However, the specific mechanics of the box and the ghosts remain abstract ("strange geometry," "fractured reality"), relying on vague magical descriptors rather than the tactile grounding seen in the bees and hives.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "emerald silo" offers a distinct visual anchor, but the setting largely functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The intriguing premise ("era after numbers changed meaning") is not world-built; it is contradicted by the functional use of coordinates and fails to impact the character's interaction with his environment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details are present but veer into ornamental prose ("burnished hush," "cobalt lagoon") that sets a mood without constraining action. The setting functions as a passive backdrop for contemplation rather than a source of physical or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting details (copper wire, shifting stone patterns) are evocative but remain general backdrop due to the summary nature of the narrative. The environment does not actively constrain immediate choices or generate tactile friction in a specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.9)
    While atmospheric, the setting contains a significant physical contradiction: footprints are described as "dusty" on "spring-soaked earth" in a "rainwashed" environment, which breaks immersion. The repetition of the phrase "bronze quiet" (three times) diminishes its evocative power and feels static.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is visually distinct but relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("shimmering," "resilient," "lavender and gold") rather than concrete interaction. While the "blooming jetty" is a clear image, the environment functions more as a static backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The specific technology of the thermal phonograph and wax leaf steganography creates a distinct, grounded micro-setting. The broader "scrap-pile" environment is functional but less distinct than the central apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, with vivid details like the "frozen in a single moment of chaos" hologram and the "black velvet canvas." The setting feels distinct and supports the isolation. Some descriptions veer into purple prose ("tomb of echoes"), but the physical grounding of the deck generally works well.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    Atmospheric descriptions rely on abstract, "purple" metaphors ("taste like broken glass") rather than tactile constraints that shape action. The "labyrinth of wonders" is a generic placeholder that avoids specific, grounding details.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.5)
    The Whispering Gallery's acoustics are integrated well to amplify the "small gestures," providing sensory grounding. However, the chessboard feels like a symbolic prop teleported into the rotunda without spatial or logical grounding, serving only as a metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on familiar "magical library" tropes ("shadows thick as velvet," rearranging corridors). While the obsidian and mercury glass are vivid, the environment functions mostly as a passive container for the props rather than actively constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but heavily reliant on purple descriptors ("slick with the memory of rain") and repeated tags ("woven hush"). While the "platinum labyrinth" is central, its specific geography remains vague ("shifting grid," "platforms"), functioning more as a generic obstacle course than a specific place that constrains the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric language effectively establishes a mood, though it leans on generic fantasy markers ("shroud," "doom," "piercing") without distinct, grounding specificity. The setting functions primarily as a passive amplifier for the protagonist's monologue rather than an active environment that constrains movement or forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting of the acid sea and floating workshop is vivid and provides physical constraints (the wave). However, the "Great Drowning" and "Mechanical Revolution" feel like lore dumps rather than lived reality. The "between breaths" constraint is well-integrated into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is functional, but the descriptions often lean on standard literary tropes ("phosphorescent moss," "jewels," "tiny metronomes"). The shift from the realistic quay to the fantastical cave feels jarring and lacks the specific, grounded sensory details needed to sell the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "cobalt tower" and "salt-summoned wind" are not just backdrop but essential tools for the ritual. The sensory details regarding the "phantom garden" scent are particularly strong, grounding the magic in specific, tangible perception.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details regarding the censer foot (heat, greenish sheen) are vivid and anchor the scene. The station itself is atmospheric but functions largely as a backdrop; the "failed hydraulics" establish the stasis but do not actively constrain the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the "hanging orchard" and "swaying containers" physically manifest the precariousness of the characters' mental states. Specific sensory details like the damp earth and the storm’s fury ground the high-concept premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "opal dock" and "nautical twilight" creating a cohesive, melancholic atmosphere that anchors the tone. The sensory details ("lavender and pearl," "circular sanctuary") effectively ground the supernatural elements in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting suffers from a jarring temporal disconnect caused by the prompt integration: outside is "spring melt," but the ants lead him to a "blooming cavern at midsummer," creating an unacknowledged seasonal clash. The "room of maps" is a generic fantasy space that functions more as a metaphor than a concrete place.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmosphere is vivid but relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("ethereal visions," "celestial luminescence," "otherworldly atmosphere") rather than grounded sensory detail. The spatial relationship between the cobalt and ember grottos is somewhat muddled—it is unclear if one is inside the other or adjacent—though the visual of bleeding starlight is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "ember nexus" and "pocket-sun" provide a vivid, high-fantasy aesthetic, though the setting often feels like a backdrop for abstract concepts rather than a physical space with texture. The specific prop (nautilus shell) anchors the scene well, but the "molten veins" and "twilight" remain somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.4)
    Atmospheric details are present but rely heavily on stock imagery ("creaked like old bones," "bruised purples," "wind howled... like wolves"). The setting functions as a generic backdrop rather than a specific environment that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop and the specific details of the screw (threads worn smooth, dimpled metal) are vivid and ground the scene well. The "micro-setting" of the screw under the loupe effectively constrains attention, though the atmospheric fog feels slightly standard for this genre.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active constraint; the "held breath" timing forces urgency, and the platform's isolation amplifies the focus on the ritual. Sensory details—from the "cool, smooth feather" to the "scent of rain on hot stone"—are vivid and purposeful, grounding the magical elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific details like the "dissonant chorus" and "fine dust" grounding the supernatural interaction. The looming demolition effectively creates atmospheric pressure and frames the scene in a specific moment of time.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies heavily on abstract modifiers ("cosmic", "metaphysical", "mystical") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. While the "softcover dictionary" offers a specific, tangible anchor, the surrounding environment—"towering shelves," "shattered mirror"—feels generic to the "celestial library" trope. The space shifts to match his mental state, which dissolves the tension of a fixed physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting of the hydraulic station is vivid and specific, utilizing the "blue fluids" and "brass" to ground the abstract theme. The environment meaningfully frames the protagonist's isolation and task, contributing to the atmospheric consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is visually vivid and atmospherically consistent, offering a strong backdrop for the scene. However, the setting rarely constrains tactical choices; aside from the spores serving as a visual prop, the environment functions mostly as set dressing rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    The presence of a lit candle lantern on a modern subway train breaks verisimilitude and world logic without explanation. Atmospheric descriptors like "clover melancholy" act as labels rather than emerging from the setting's sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details—the ozone, the damp tunnel, the glass harmonica—are vivid and effectively establish a melancholic, magical-realist mood. The setting constraints are clear and integral to the concept, even if they aren't tested by active plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established clearly with sensory details ("silver warm against his skin," "luminous flowers"). However, some descriptions lean into generic atmospheric shorthand ("impossible flora," "ethereal glow") rather than specific, grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and integrates well with the theme, particularly the acoustic properties of the cupola which facilitate the resolution. The "disused" and "overgrown" nature of the platform mirrors the protagonist's internal state effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sensory details of vibration and touch effectively ground the blind protagonist's perspective. However, the setting offers no resistance ("yielding like a lover's sigh") and functions more as a compliant backdrop than a source of pressure or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "gravitational anomaly" provides a striking visual ("funhouse mirror"), but the setting otherwise feels like a static "white room" consisting only of a desk and window. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit sometimes clichéd, imagery ("sentinel of forgotten time"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the description often leans on abstract nouns ("melancholy," "wonder") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.0)
    Setting details rely on generic tropes ("cave behind a waterfall," "shadow of the mountains") that fail to constrain the protagonist or shape her tactics. The environment acts as a passive backdrop rather than a specific, pressure-filled space that forces interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vividly described but functions as a "white room" of abstract light and sound; the environment facilitates the magic system but fails to constrain the protagonist's actions or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually distinct but relies on generic descriptors like "city of steel giants" and "feverish pulse." While the acoustic concept of the labyrinth is interesting, the environment functions more as a static backdrop for the puzzle than a pressure cooker forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting descriptions rely heavily on abstract metaphors ("puddles held the sky like scattered memories") rather than concrete sensory details that ground the reader. While the cobalt dock is established, the environment serves purely as an atmospheric backdrop and never constrains the characters' choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric details—the "cobalt library," the "books about futures," and the "scattered silver coins" of light—effectively ground the magical realism, creating a cohesive and vivid world that supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is functional, establishing the "sublittoral fringe" and "turquoise water," but lacks specific, tactile grounding beyond generic tropical tropes. The "dock work" is described as brutish but not felt through sensory details of the labor itself.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sensory details of the whittling and the bouquet are specific and grounding. The wind turbines provide a functional backdrop, though the "snow" imagery in the opening feels slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sensory details like "lantern-moth hush" and "obsidian" create a vivid initial atmosphere, but the setting dissolves into abstraction ("not a place but a state of being") just when grounding is most needed. The environment functions more as a decorative backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory description effectively contrasts the gray world with the blooming color, grounding the change in specific physical perception. The setting details ("glowing glob," "soot-stained hands") are vivid and support the artisan atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "laboratory of lost sounds" offers some vivid imagery ("glass shelves," "carbide lamp lens"), establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting behaves like a mood ring, shifting physically in response to thoughts ("walls trembled," "shadows bowed"), which undermines its solidity as a real place.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established through lists of magical attributes ("timeless space," "brass dome") rather than being inhabited or utilized to constrain action during a crisis. The environment feels like a static backdrop for the concept rather than a pressure cooker for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic markers ("rain-beaded skylight") that do not constrain action or choice. The central interaction—measuring physical distances between abstract concepts on a table—lacks spatial coherence and tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy signifiers ("vast underground chamber," "ancient script") without sensory specificity. The mechanics of the "shafts in the ceiling" delivering twilight underground are convenient rather than grounded in a tangible sense of place. The environment acts as a backdrop rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting blends high-fantasy elements ("blooming library") with anachronistic tech ("silent video footage") in a way that feels disjointed rather than integrated. While individual images are pretty, the environment lacks tactile grounding or constraints that pressure the character's choices. The library acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active force in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "misty workshop" is established with vivid sensory details that support the contemplative tone. The integration of the chameleon tail tip as a micro-setting/object effectively anchors the abstract conflict in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional, with the hourglass and plants serving as necessary props. However, the environment feels static and serves more as a container for symbols than a lived-in space that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sensory grounding in the booth ("aged film and ozone") is vivid and effectively anchors the abstract psychometry, though the physical setting fades somewhat during the internal vision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting description relies on "white room" high-fantasy abstractions ("kaleidoscopic hues," "frozen dawn") rather than concrete, grounding details. The environment functions as a visual backdrop for the magic but provides no physical constraints or tactile specificity to anchor the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid visuals ("luminescent crystals," "cityscape of frozen glass") that establish a distinct tone. However, the setting remains a backdrop rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist's choices or forces a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and causally active; the specific frequencies of the trees drive the resolution. The setting effectively constrains the method, though the "clockwork nature" aesthetic feels somewhat familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is comprised of abstract, atmospheric labels ("edge of consciousness," "veiled ridgeway") that do not constrain the characters' choices or offer tactile grounding. The environment feels like a generic dreamscape rather than a specific place with rules and friction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with "frozen twilight" and machine hums creating a vivid sensory texture. However, the descriptor "cobalt" is repetitive, and the physical reality of the "nerve regeneration" remains vague sci-fi set dressing rather than a tangible environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The library setting is established with some vivid imagery ("dust motes danced," "shifting constellations"), creating a solid atmospheric anchor. However, the specificity falters during the middle summary, where the "kingdom built on lies" and "the capital" feel generic and lack the sensory grounding present in the library scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is legible but rendered through excessive similes ("creaked like a dying whale") that distance the reader. The station operates more as a poetic metaphor than a physical space with constraints that pressure the character.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details, though it leans on standard "ruined future" imagery ("grimy skylights," "ozone"). The integration of the stone circle within the spaceport feels asserted rather than woven into a cohesive world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    The volcanic setting provides atmospheric visuals ("steam," "ferns") but does not actively constrain Maeva's tactical choices. Descriptions often rely on generic adjectives ("otherworldly vigor," "ominously") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The "reconstructed landscape" remains a vague backdrop rather than a pressurized environment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cliffside arboretum is vivid and serves as an effective objective correlative for the protagonist's internal state. Specific botanical details like sea thrift and sempervivum ground the setting, though the pathetic fallacy is somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is described through mood-heavy adjectives ("waterlogged," "forgotten") rather than concrete, grounding spatial details that constrain action. The physics of the space are subservient to the metaphorical mood, making the environment feel dreamlike and weightless rather than a tangible place that exerts pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is visually established with "dust-coated tents" and "sandstone shards," but it remains a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints. The specific physical properties of the "wind-carved" canyon do not pressure the protagonist’s choices or impede the experiment. The sensory details are functional but standard.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.8)
    While atmospheric ("frost-coated shelves"), the setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or tools. The phrase "echoing library under snow" is repeated four times as a refrain, reducing the setting to a linguistic artifact rather than a physical space the character must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is the strongest element, with clear visual anchors like the glass-domed enclosure and the desert rose farm. The "engraved quiet" and microscopic etchings add distinct texture. However, the setting primarily serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices or generating immediate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "sound wave garden" is an imaginative concept, but the description relies heavily on abstract modifiers ("humming air," "forgotten notes") rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. The setting serves as a passive atmospheric backdrop rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist's choices or threatens his success.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "echoing observatory" and "brass celestial sphere" providing specific, atmospheric grounding. The environment feels tactile ("cold weight," "rosewood desk"), though the "above the clouds" aspect remains slightly abstract and disconnected from the interior details.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "laboratory of lost sounds" is established with strong, specific sensory details like static feeling like "whiskey burning through wires." The atmosphere effectively supports the magical realism tone, though the reliance on "antique" descriptors is slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with sensory details ("damp environment," "stone walls"), though descriptions often veer into purple prose ("tasted of lilac and courage"). The "whispering gallery" physics are mentioned but operate more as magic than a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting relies on generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("shattered sky," "skeletal walls") that signal mood but fail to constrain the character's physical movement. Sensory details are often filtered through heavy abstraction ("air was thick with warm coldness") rather than concrete, grounding observation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details ("silver bark," "blue leaves") establishing the setting. However, the garden feels spatially disconnected from the theater, functioning primarily as a container for the plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    The visual description of the light painting is vivid and central to the story’s atmosphere ("diffuse glow," "jagged red," "soft gold"). However, the setting details often drift into abstract metaphor ("city's worth of emotion") rather than grounding the reader in the physical reality of the studio equipment or the somatic sensations.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details are frequent ("damp limestone," "brackish water") but often veer into poetic abstraction ("ghosts of tides") rather than grounding the scene in constraints. The setting serves primarily as a passive container for the magical effects rather than an environment that pressures the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "amber warehouse" and "canyon echo" offer evocative visual potential, but the setting operates as a static stage set for abstract action. Sensory details often dissolve into non-physical abstractions ("smelled of... dust," "unearthed silence") rather than grounding the reader in a concrete physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but rendered through heavy, distancing description ("ectoplasmic water," "flat pearl") that calls attention to the prose rather than the place. While vivid, the environment functions as a static mood board rather than offering constraints or resources that pressure the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and central to the mood, successfully establishing the "gloom-hill" vibe. However, the description occasionally veers into "purple" territory ("swallowed all sound," "canvas for his spindrift serenity") where simpler specificity would be more effective.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like the "frozen amber tear" are vivid, but the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for the anomaly rather than pressuring choices or restricting movement.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "luminous harbor" and "rusty metal staircase" provide basic grounding, the setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints. The geography of the light reflection is treated as magical rather than tactile, and the environment does not force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on vague, high-concept abstractions ("cosmic energies," "frequencies") rather than tactile, constraining details. The "atomically reflective" descriptor appears as a repeated label without grounding in the physics or sensory reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the temple and the "Rejoin" sculpture grounding the action efficiently. While descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("verdine island," "shattered jewel"), the environment successfully anchors the scene and provides the physical symbols for the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("dim glow," "charts," "station") that fail to constrain the character's choices or create atmosphere. The environment feels like a white room with props rather than a pressure cooker affecting the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is an abstract "white room" populated by vague descriptors ("shadowed," "starlight," "shimmer") that fail to ground the reader in a physical space. The connection between the "church organ" and the "nexus" is never spatially or logically established.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric description of the quarry is vivid and sets a strong, somber mood. The sensory details of the cold and the materials are effective, though the "furrowed hush" and "stone lips" border on purple prose that slightly distances the reader from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting of the experimental station is grounded with specific details like the oxidized nail and the console's divot, which constrain action. However, the atmospheric tension is undermined by the mechanical repetition of the phrase "spongey dread," which breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    Setting details are functional but generic ("mist-shrouded peaks"). The specific mechanics of the "wet-plate" and "pixelated" elements clash without earning the "impossible medium" angle, and the physical reality of reading a map on flapping construction plastic strains suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    The circus train is rendered with excellent specificity ("iron elephants," "petrified beneath decades"), acting as a strong atmospheric anchor that contrasts effectively with the generic "glass-and-steel" office. The setting actively informs the character's psychology and the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic markers ("brass fittings," "leather-bound journals") that do not constrain the action. The observatory serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active environment that pressures the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "swirling orchard vortex" provides a central image, but the setting is otherwise sketched with generic fantasy shorthand ("cursed lake," "trees whispering"). The "warlike serenity" is stated as an oxymoron but not evoked through sensory details that would make such a contradiction visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is consistent and vivid in a high-fantasy mode ("cobalt glade," "ozone and wet earth"), though it frequently leans on abstract metaphors ("tapestry of old grievances") that blur physical specificity. The setting anchors the ritual well, but the "nexus" lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "catacomb orchard" offers strong visual potential ("roots snake between bones"), but the setting functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The environment yields to Elian's needs without constraining his movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting of the quarry trailer is effective, with the "faint percussion" of dynamite providing a solid atmospheric anchor. However, the setting ultimately serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker; the environment doesn't force a choice, though the vibrational detail nicely mirrors the audio theme.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of the magnetic arbor with "metallic leaves" and "suspended soil" is imaginative and clearly anchored. While the environment is vivid, it functions largely as a backdrop rather than actively pressuring the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    The &quot;tidal atrium&quot; and the specific imagery of smelting fish into ink are vivid and ground the fantasy effectively. However, the setting remains largely ornamental, providing a grand backdrop that facilitates the routine without exerting pressure or constraining the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the visual description of the crystals is competent, the placement of a "cultivated" (man-made) pearl within a natural quartz formation creates a distracting logical inconsistency. The setting details are largely ornamental and do not constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting provides atmospheric consistency with standard tropes of decay (ivy, rust), but lacks specific, unexpected sensory details that would ground the scene. The "bathroom graffiti" serves as a plot device but feels like a generic video game clue rather than a texture of the world. The environment supports the mood but does not meaningfully constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmospheric imagery is consistent but relies heavily on "white room" abstractions (mist, vapor, glowing shelves) rather than tactile, grounding details. While the "propagation delays" offer a specific sensory hook, much of the description leans on generic fantasy markers ("ethereal splendor") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "velvet observatory" and botanical details provide a vivid, cohesive container for the scene. However, descriptors like "impossible color" and "deep indigo" lean toward ornamental purple prose rather than functional grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent ("obsidian," "aurora"), suiting the high-concept tone. However, it functions primarily as an ornamental backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure that influences the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.4)
    Atmospheric details are vivid but marred by forced phrasing ("vineyard hush" in a cloud grotto) that disconnects from visual logic. The setting serves as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of constraint or resources that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lighthouse setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, atmospheric details ("dawn bled"). The wind chime mechanism leverages the setting well, though the specific geography of the campfire and the mechanics of the levers inside the lantern room remain slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting consists of standard high-fantasy elements (floating rock, glowing pond) that provide atmosphere but fail to constrain tactics or choices. The "magnetic grotto" is an abstract concept that enables the magic but doesn't feel tactile or lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "towers of bone" and "canyon of endless echoes" provide a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that grounds the abstract magical system. The sensory details—dust, wind, the weight of the stone—are tactile and effective. The setting actively constraints the protagonist's method, integrating well with the plot, though some descriptors remain slightly generic ("ancient," "bleached").

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting details are generic ("perfect, soulless melodies," "forgotten libraries") and serve as passive backdrops rather than active constraints. The "icebound spire" is bypassed easily via the mist walking spell rather than forcing tactical interaction or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the underwater library is an evocative image, the scene violates basic physical logic: a paper journal removed from a display case underwater would not be readable. This lack of credible interaction with the environment breaks suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "ambered observatory deck" provides a consistent anchor, though the description relies on repeated phrases rather than deepening sensory detail. References to "Lyran" and "Andromedan" feel like generic sci-fi placeholders rather than specific world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The observatory is atmospheric, and the use of the "scattered light" through the cracked dome as a tool to crystallize the ink integrates the setting well into the plot. The sensory details are vivid, though they occasionally lean into generic fantasy aesthetics ("blushed lavender and rose").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sapphire viaduct is excellent, functioning as both a vivid atmospheric anchor and an active agent in the resolution. The setting actively participates in the climax rather than serving as a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere is moody and consistent, fitting the ghostly premise with details like the "midnight ridgeway" and "bruised moon." However, the imagery occasionally leans into purple prose ("anise and regret") which distances the reader from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The use of the starling murmuration as a precise measuring instrument is a vivid, functional detail that grounds the magic. However, descriptors like "impossible beauty" and "ancient sap" lean into generic fantasy tropes that reduce specificity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is established but obscured by "postcard" descriptions ("spire of solitude," "archipelago in a sea of fog") that prioritize sonic and visual metaphors over tactile reality. The environment functions as an atmospheric backdrop for contemplation rather than a physical space offering constraints or resources that shape the action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.3)
    The "floating rock dojo" and "void" serve as generic cosmic backdrops that do not constrain the characters' tactical choices or movement. The setting details are visual but lack the tactile specificity or interactive potential required to pressure the narrative. The environment feels interchangeable with any other surreal combat arena.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is a strength; the "nocturnal haven" and the "brook’s murmur" act as effective sensory anchors that contrast with the protagonist's internal state. The workshop environment feels lived-in and specifically equipped, grounding the abstract premise.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tunnel described as a "wound" with "concrete ribs" establishes a visceral, grim atmosphere effectively. However, the visualization of laughter as "shimmering motes" drifts into generic imagery, softening the grit established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively establishing the dream-logic of the "frozen garden." Sensory details like "ozone from a text about lightning" and "crisp sound of frost" ground the abstract concept in specific perception. The environment successfully constrains the character's scope of action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "ember nexus" provides a vivid visual backdrop, but the setting largely functions as a passive stage rather than an active constraint. The atmospheric details are consistent but feel somewhat detached from the mechanics of the alchemy until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting of the "abandoned radio tower city" is evocative, offering a strong visual backdrop, though some descriptors ("serenely electric") feel abstract rather than sensory. The physical environment is established, but the "lunar perigee" acts more as set dressing than a pressure-inducing constraint. While the atmosphere is consistent, the specificity of the technology and its operation remains vague and dreamlike.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is described with generic, adjectival gloss ("crystalline," "prismatic," "ethereal") rather than specific sensory details that constrain the character's actions. The "sideways-running clocks" concept is mentioned but never visualized or utilized to impact the scene's mechanics or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "optical illusion gallery" is a vivid setting that actively constrains the protagonist's work, fitting the surreal tone well. Specific details like "walls curved inward without bending" effectively establish the dream logic. The atmosphere is tangible, though descriptions occasionally veer into abstraction ("weighted glass") that distances the reader from the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    The benthic setting is vivid, with strong details like "bioluminescent corals" and the "pitted" iron of the anchor chain grounding the scene. The atmosphere of luminous darkness supports the theme well, though the classroom setting itself feels slightly generic outside of the holographic display.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting provides atmospheric adjectives ("mist-clad," "twilight") but lacks spatial coherence or tactile interaction. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices; the mist merely "thickens" to aid the plot. The sudden appearance of the music box highlights a lack of spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with functional competence, but details like "ozone" underwater break physical credibility without a signaled rule change. The environment, while described as "crushing," does not exert actual pressure on the character's movements or choices, serving merely as a backdrop for the internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("opal facade," "curtains," "dark ink"), effectively establishing the "midnight solace" tone. The specific interaction with the ink on the star carvings grounds the sci-fi premise in tactile reality, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The concept of bone towers holding tactile language is vivid and imaginative, creating a distinct atmosphere. However, descriptors like "powdered memories" drift into abstraction, distancing the reader from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details like "crushed mint" and "pulsing mushrooms" create a vivid, surreal atmosphere. The specific, grounded setting of the underground garden effectively anchors the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    The imagery is vivid ("towers of rust and glass," "locust shell") but relies on generic steampunk and fantasy tropes that feel more like set-dressing than lived-in constraints. The "gap between knowing and understanding" is treated as a physical space in a way that feels like a forced conceptual overlay rather than an organic part of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting actively constrains the action; the specific timing of the "lone mail drop" and the drone patrol's zenith are crucial mechanics. The "cobalt arcade" provides a vivid atmospheric anchor that contrasts with the technical urgency of the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit adjective-heavy, descriptions ("misting hush," "rusted cars"). However, the environment serves largely as atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraints or pressure. The "hidden oasis" inside the train creates a jarring reality break that lacks grounding in the established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the concept of a "scientific poetry library" is evocative, the execution relies on generic descriptors ("dusty shelves," "frayed edges") and abstract similes ("stretching like taffy") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The "hyperbolic geometry" remains a visual effect rather than a tactile constraint that forces the character to adapt her physical movement in a precise way.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is rendered through abstract, ornamental adjectives ("dew-kissed," "whispering," "fractured gold") rather than concrete, tactile details that ground the reader. The environment feels like a poetic backdrop rather than a physical place with rules and constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is consistently dreamlike, utilizing sensory details like &quot;lavender and rain&quot; effectively. However, the setting itself (&quot;shadowed nexus&quot;) remains spatially vague, acting as a static backdrop rather than an environment that constrains the protagonist's movement or tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "sunken orchard" concept is evocative, but the spatial relationship between the greenhouse, the water level, and the "ringed" shipwrecks remains visually muddy. The geography feels dreamlike in a way that hinders basic orientation rather than enhancing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "twilight realm" and "shard-mirror" details create a cohesive visual atmosphere that supports the tone. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint, and the "playground swing" simile feels pasted in rather than organic to the library's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the imagery is consistent with high fantasy ("silver-barked trees," "radiant hush"), it relies on generic tropes rather than specific, grounding details that constrain the character. The setting functions as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prism sanctuary is a vivid, integrated setting that actively shapes the resolution by providing the light necessary to ground the spirits. The environment operates as a constraint and tool, fulfilling the requirement for high-band setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "rain-scoured fresco vault" offers a strong, atmospheric anchor that resonates with the themes of decay and silence. However, the recurring "ancient henge" remains a generic placeholder, and the "spot where a map tears" functions as a forced physical location rather than an integrated setting detail.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken library setting is atmospheric and evocative, though the physics (waterlogged books in a dry enough space for spectacles) operate on dream logic. Specific details like the Earhart trench ground the fantasy well.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    The storm provides a functional time constraint that pressures the action ("window between worlds would soon close"). However, the setting relies on generic atmospheric descriptors ("roiling mist," "spectral shadows") and feels like an abstract void rather than a grounded place with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional, establishing the verticality and "crystalline" aesthetic of the spire, though descriptors lean toward generic fantasy tropes. While the elevator provides a clear spatial frame, the sensory details are largely visual; the "icebound" atmosphere does not pressure Elara’s physical state or constrain her actions beyond the initial fogging breath.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the "brass telescope" provides a tangible anchor, the setting lacks verisimilitude; the gondola exists in a physics-free void where gravity and wind do not act realistically. Sensory details are often overwhelmed by heavy metaphorical layering ("wound in the cerulean skin"), obscuring the physical reality of the space. The environment fails to constrain the character's choices in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting of a hollowed tree trunk library is a vivid, specific image that grounds the scene. However, the mechanics of the "book safe" and the optical projection are vague, operating more on dream logic than physical consistency within the established world.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is functional, with the airship and starlings providing a necessary backdrop, but the connection between the hopscotch board and celestial mechanics is abstract and asserted. Sensory details are often generic ("faded chalk patterns," "rusting gears") rather than specific enough to ground the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details like fogging windows and crunching boots establish a vivid, coherent atmosphere. However, the "driftwood" descriptor physically clashes with the "frozen library above clouds" imagery, creating a jarring mixed metaphor in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the concepts (floating arches, bioluminescent butterflies) are visual, they are presented as static "postcard" descriptions rather than environmental constraints that shape immediate action. The setting is observed from a distance rather than navigated through a specific POV's sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("encroaching void," "shimmering barrier") rather than concrete sensory grounding. While the lighthouse is established, the environment feels ethereal and disconnected from physical constraints or tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard is atmospheric and claustrophobic, and the mechanical birds provide a specific, urgent threat. A clear text generation artifact ("晶体者") disrupts the description of the frost line, breaking immersion in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    The braided ravine is well-integrated, serving as both a physical grounding and a thematic mirror for the protagonist's thought process. While the "nature's chromatography" simile is slightly heavy-handed, the setting successfully constrains the scene and guides the focalizer's attention.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "glass orchard" and "swirling clouds" offer vivid, surreal imagery that anchors the location well. However, the setting remains largely decorative, serving as a backdrop rather than forcing constraints or tactical adjustments on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric blending of desert and ocean imagery is the story's strongest asset, creating a vivid, surreal backdrop. The specific detail of the "hexagonal ripple" anchors the magic system well. However, the setting remains largely static, serving as scenery rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is described with list-like sensory details ("muted purples," "star-faced clocks") that function as a static backdrop rather than a constraint. While the imagery is consistent, the environment does not pressure the character's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the setting is established, descriptions rely heavily on abstractions ("parted synapse," "infinite shadows") that obscure the concrete physical reality. The environment functions as a passive backdrop that "conspires" with the protagonist rather than a source of constraint or atmosphere. Sensory details are often filtered through intellectual interpretation rather than immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The gravity inversion provides a distinct physical anchor that shapes the movement through the scene, offering a nice specific constraint. However, the "serpentine grotto" and "crystal formations" lean into generic fantasy imagery that feels less tactile than the gravity mechanics. The setting facilitates the plot rather than pressuring the character.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "hedgehog’s uncurling dusk" is a creative temporal anchor, but the grove itself remains a generic backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's tactics. Sensory details are present but often filter through abstract labels ("ache for music") rather than concrete, immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic backdrop described with purple prose ("painted the horizon in shades of lavender") rather than a tactile environment that constrains action. The "magnetic nexus" functions as a magical plot device without established rules or sensory grounding. Specificity is replaced by vague "ancient energies" and "vibrations."

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is grounded with specific tools ("tuning forks," "oscilloscopes"), creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the description often drifts into purple abstraction ("celestial witnesses"), and the environment functions more as a backdrop for the theme than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details regarding the corpse flower's "paradoxical scent" are vivid and grounded, establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop; neither the treetop location nor the "wildflower hush" significantly constrains Elara’s choices or forces tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, specific imagery of the inverted orchard, "liquid spines" of water, and bioluminescence. The environment is immersive and clearly visualized, though the "whirling silence" descriptor is somewhat abstract compared to the concrete visual details.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with "artificial canyons" and "weathered reds" effectively grounding the atmospheric mood. The container labyrinth functions well as both a physical constraint and a component of the investigative logic, though the specific "Z-379" designation feels like a generic prop.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually dense and establishes a consistent, if familiar, "high fantasy" atmosphere through the "sculpted hush" and aurora. However, the sensory details often rely on accumulation ("emerald, rose, and sapphire") rather than specific, grounded interaction that constrains the character. The environment reacts to the character, but it never pushes back or forces a tactical shift, leaving the setting as a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.6)
    The "Thunder-echo range" provides a solid atmospheric grounding, and the driftwood details add texture. However, the "space between worlds" remains vague ("colors that had no names"), relying on generic fantasy descriptors rather than specific, sensory constraints that affect the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "vanishing stars" provide an effective atmospheric clock that pressures the scene. The workshop description is vivid, though the "topaz" and "amber-tinted" details feel slightly ornamental and do not physically constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually established with descriptors like "liquid silver" and "mist-shrouded peaks," but it feels generic to the fantasy genre. While the storm provides a brief constraint, the environment largely serves as a backdrop for introspection rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "quartz arbor" and "fern-like ice" provide vivid visual textures, but the setting largely functions as an ornamental backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The fantastical arbor feels disjointed from the mundane car without enough grounding to make the juxtaposition purposeful. Sensory details are plentiful but often tilt into purple prose rather than serving the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "forgotten orchard" and "bamboo forest" provide a functional atmospheric backdrop, but the setting lacks tactile specificity beyond the central props. The jarring inclusion of a "rummage sale box" at the forest's edge disrupts the otherwise timeless fantasy tone without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting details (violet sky, phosphorescent lichens, orchard planet) are vivid and imaginative, establishing a strong atmosphere. However, the environment serves largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint; the floating arches and gravity anomalies do not force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established, but descriptions lean toward "purple" abstraction ("chaotic symphony," "ghosts of machinery") rather than concrete grounding. While the contrast between the ruined and functional spaceport is clear, the sensory details often prioritize atmospheric adjectives over interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmosphere is established but relies heavily on "literary" clichés ("mist-kissed waves," "tides and time") and generic imagery. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of concrete, physical friction or specific sensory detail beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic "sci-fi/fantasy" markers ("alien constellations," "emerald lighthouse") that serve as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources. While the contrast between digital and physical is established, the environment does not pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details regarding the morpho wing and the changing light are vivid and precise, effectively grounding the "deep seeing" theme. However, the "floating rock" setting is purely ornamental; the physics of the location never constrain action or influence the plot, leaving a potentially rich element feeling like a painted backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    Setting descriptors are atmospheric but generic ("ancient oaks," "silver glow") and fail to constrain action. The physical reality of the labyrinth is abstract, serving as a backdrop rather than a tactile environment that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Imagery is vivid ("phosphorescent trees," "mica window"), but the "mirror world" lacks defined physical or logical rules that constrain the character. The setting functions as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than an environment that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "midnight blue paper," "polished oak table," and the "library of unwritten thoughts" are vivid and specific. The environment actively frames the protagonist's isolation and provides the props (books, compartments) for the ritual that grounds the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere of "ruined beauty" is consistent and sensory ("damp earth," "phantom sweetness"), effectively grounding the fable. However, the setting details remain largely ornamental; the "secret tea house" provides a backdrop but does not strictly constrain Elara's tactical choices or enforce a physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established clearly with consistent imagery of crystals, cold, and clouds. However, the descriptors are somewhat repetitive ("crystalline," "quartz," "frozen"), and the sensory experience is limited primarily to the visual and thermal, lacking the tactile grit that would ground the "preservation" aspect.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting ("pirate market," "rotting pier") is functional and atmospheric but remains a static backdrop. Spatial geography is vague during the crucial movements, particularly during the "diversion" and the sneaking sequence. The environment does not actively constrain the protagonist's choices in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sensory details of the "forest elections" and the aurora are vivid and specific, creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies heavily on pathetic fallacy ("auroral sorrow," "crystals humming") rather than concrete sensory detail. The environment mirrors the protagonist's mood abstractly but fails to constrain choices or ground the narrative in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    The visual of the gilded skin and toxic greenhouse is distinct, but the world logic is porous; the "treasure map" descriptor feels like an authorial intrusion rather than a POV-grounded observation. The setting details are often listed rather than utilized to constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on high-concept abstraction ("world churned in silence," "color of wonder") rather than grounded sensory particularity. While "ozone and metal" offers a brief tactile anchor, the "whispering bluff" and "open-air Gallery" feel like generic fantasy backdrops that fail to constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmosphere is established effectively with sensory details like the "curling petals," but the world rules regarding the physical properties of "childhood fears" remain vague. The setting pressures the protagonist adequately via the magnetic shift, though the repetition of descriptive phrases detracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with adjectives ("vibrant mosaic," "sandstorm calm") but remains a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While the courtyard is visually described, the environment does not force Elias into specific tactical choices or impede his progress.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the underwater setting is established, it functions largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices or errors. The sensory details ("familiar weight," "glowed beneath the water") are functional but generic, lacking the unique textural specificity that grounds the speculative elements.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the salt crystal chamber is vivid and integral to the ritual, grounding the magic system. However, descriptions occasionally drift into abstraction ("charged with something more than salt and sorrow") rather than relying on concrete sensory details that constrain the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is defined by repeated labels ("nocturnal haven") rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. The environment feels like an abstract void populated by metaphors ("earth's breathing") rather than a physical space that constrains the character. The repetition of the location name acts as a placeholder for genuine description.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sensory details like the "night-blooming jasmine" and "embossed griffin" are vivid and engaging. However, the sudden spatial teleportation mid-sentence breaks the physical logic of the scene, undermining the otherwise solid atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and vivid, effectively using the "velvet" and "cloth-like" textures to ground the magical realism. The garden functions well as a containment vessel, creating a clear boundary for the scene. The sensory details are consistent, though slightly repetitive in their textile metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    Spatial logic collapses: an undercroft is a subterranean vault, yet the "aurora painted the sanctuary ceiling," implying a view of the sky. Additionally, stalactites forming "pillars" implies geological timescales, contradictory to the "three winters" timeframe. These uncontrolled details break immersion significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "serpentine nexus" and canyon are vividly described and integral to the mechanics of the plot (amplifying the song). However, the imagery occasionally drifts into abstraction ("stone throats," "universe humming") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The melted snow globe serves as a vivid, specific anchor that grounds the supernatural elements. The glacial shrine offers a distinct atmospheric backdrop, though the setting acts more as a stage than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic "fable" descriptors ("whispering," "sleeping," "ancient") that distance the reader. While spatially coherent, the atmosphere is constructed through adjective stacking rather than concrete, sensory interaction that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    The visual contrast of the lush, radioactive orchard against the wasteland is vivid and effectively anchors the premise. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of immediate physical constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is a strength, with specific sensory details like the "cobalt glass" and "amber" tubes grounding the scene. The storm provides good texture, though the "city streets miles below" feel a bit abstract from the immediate viewpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "feral loft" is an evocative concept, but the setting is rendered through abstract metaphors ("secret tucked under a tongue") rather than concrete spatial constraints. The sand and jars provide some grounding, but the environment feels more dream-like than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("drift-ice marina," "fractured ice"), providing a strong visual backdrop. However, the description relies heavily on abstract, synesthetic metaphors ("hues of fire and forgiveness") that distance the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "basalt sanctuary" and "crystalline ice" provide strong atmospheric grounding. However, the "planetary consciousness" mechanics feel abstract and disconnected from the otherwise grounded physical setting, weakening the world's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is technically present but obscured by heavy-handed metaphor that distances the reader from the physical reality of the tunnel. The lantern is treated more as a symbolic totem than a physical object, behaving with anachronistic or magical properties ("grime of ages," "steady light") that clash with the procedural tone.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of the repair shop is rendered with effective sensory details ("metal shavings," "dust motes," "sweet perfume"). The atmosphere grounds the scene well, though the phrase "vibrant hush" is used twice and feels slightly forced rather than organic to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    The steampunk aesthetic is consistent but serves largely as window dressing; the "acid sea" is mentioned frequently but fails to constrain the protagonist's tactical choices until the very end. The setting feels list-like rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is a functional, if standard, cyberpunk archive; the "pocket dimension" within an algorithm is a creative specific. However, the environment rarely constrains the protagonist's choices, serving mostly as a container for clues.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.0)
    The imagery is vivid ("crystalline fruit," "tundral ice floes"), establishing a distinct high-fantasy aesthetic. However, the setting feels static and ornamental; while the ice shifting suggests danger, it functions more as background atmosphere than a tangible constraint on the protagonist's physical movements or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with strong sensory details like the "clean scent of melting bergs" and the "slushy mire" grounding the abstract theme. The environment successfully pressures the protagonist’s worldview, though the "salt, sorrow" descriptor blends abstract and concrete in a slightly disjointed way.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the setting is established, it leans heavily on atmospheric clichés ("whispering secrets," "contemplative hush") rather than specific, choice-constraining details. The "amber pavilion" provides a backdrop but does not exert pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "sand-worn silk floors" and the "cracked half" of the mask offer vivid, tactile specificity that grounds the fantasy elements. However, the mechanics of the "whisperfield" and the "echoes" remain somewhat abstract, functioning more as atmospheric backdrop than as constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The juxtaposition of lavender and factory ruins provides distinct, grounded sensory details like the "medicinal scent" and "metallic tang." While vivid, the setting serves primarily as a static backdrop and does not enforce constraints or offer resources that alter the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is established quickly with atmospheric precision ("chill seeping," "fogged the glass"). The crystal serves as an excellent micro-setting/tool that constrains focus and anchors the abstract concept of "silence" in a tactile, specific object.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, acting as a pressure cooker for the protagonist’s internal state. Details like the "rusting car hoods" and "tangled bike wheels" ground the surreal concept, though the "unwatched videotapes" feel somewhat placed rather than integrated into the garden's organic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting creates disorientation through conflicting details; a "lunar observatory" implies an airless environment, yet the text describes a "cloud-wreathed moon" and a "biodome" in confusing proximity. While the biodome serves the plot, the broader spatial logic is muddy, and the "luminous" atmosphere feels decorative rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.4)
    Sensory details are often abstract or idealized ("radiant haven," "cotton-white peaks") rather than concrete and grounding. The "scent of hope" is a conceptual label masquerading as sensory input, which distances the reader from the immediate physical reality. The setting serves as a backdrop but does not constrain choices or provide resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established with decent visual anchors like the "brass-edged rim" and "floating isle," creating a consistent atmosphere. However, the description leans on standard fantasy tropes ("ancient machine older than memory") and the specific physical geography of the observatory is somewhat vague beyond the console and lens. The "spoons bent reality" line jars tonally with the otherwise somber mood.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting details are vivid and atmospheric, successfully contrasting the sterility of the morgue with the lushness of the garden. However, the imagery leans heavily on generic fantasy tropes (weeping willows dripping starlight, flowers blooming in seconds) rather than specific, grounded sensory details that would anchor the magic. The "secret garden" feels like a set piece rather than a pressured environment impacting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.8)
    Setting relies on repetitive, ornamental descriptors ("serpentine" x5, "mist" x5) rather than specific, grounded observation. The environment feels like a generic "purple prose" backdrop that does not constrain the character's actions or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "moss on servers" imagery is vivid and provides a strong, specific anchor for the scene. The setting actively creates the opportunity for the "Morse code" beat, though the atmosphere is slightly marred by the repetitive use of the "honeyed hush" tag.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on abstract, dreamlike descriptions ("mist," "impossible geometry," "watercolor in rain") that lack tactile grounding or specific spatial anchors. While the "current" provides a functional constraint, the environment feels like a generic "white room" filled with metaphors rather than a lived-in place. The reliance on ethereal imagery prevents the setting from exerting concrete pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.7)
    The setting is sketched with generic adjectives ("verdant," "golden") rather than concrete, grounded details. The "harvest moon" at dawn is a confusing visual anchor that seems placed for symbolic convenience rather than atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details are strong, with specific imagery like cobalt glass, skeletal branches, and the copper plate grounding the fantasy. The setting successfully evokes the intended mood of "moving stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on high-fantasy abstractions ("frozen ripples," "timeless pond") rather than concrete, grounding details. The "wounded season" remains a vague metaphor that colors the mood but never gains specific physical reality or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong visual details like the "metallic veins" and "bronze grotto." However, the descriptive language sometimes leans into abstraction ("impossible geometries," "unseen cracks") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting details—the rain-beaded skylight and the ash wood—are integrated well into the sensory experience of the scene. The visual of the "gray world" through the droplets effectively mirrors the internal state. The atmosphere is consistent, though occasionally leans on abstract descriptors ("climate of feeling") rather than concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "kinetic lagoon" offers an evocative visual, but the setting operates on dream logic (plastic wheels "dissolving") that reduces the sense of physical consequence. The environment functions primarily as a thematic backdrop rather than a tangible space that constrains the character's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established but treated as a metaphorical construct ("maze of intentions") rather than a physical space, confusing the reader's orientation. While the "hydroponics bay" is mentioned, the specific sensory details are often generic ("dusty cavern," "faded pathways") or purple ("metal veins").

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmospheric details are consistent but often lean into abstraction ("glacial hush," "symphony of petrichor nostalgia") rather than concrete grounding. The setting serves the theme well but feels aesthetically generic.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is a strength; the "bruised purple" sky and "soft lapping" water create a tangible, coherent setting. The specific use of the antique sundial to locate the spot adds a nice layer of physical grounding. The sensory details effectively mirror the protagonist's somber, investigative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric descriptions are vivid ("gleaming under the first snow"), but the "golden dock" remains an aesthetic backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources. The sensory details prioritize visual splendor over tactile interaction that specifically affects the plot choices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "garden of explained absences" with its copper signs is a specific, memorable setting that effectively grounds the theme. Atmospheric details (skeletal trees, remaining leaves) are vivid and establish a clear, consistent mood.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visually established, but clarity is severely marred by the recurring semantic error of "quaking reverie" to describe physical vibrations, which confuses the atmosphere. The "clockwork" aspect is generic, lacking specific tactile interaction beyond the "grease and dust" mention.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is vivid but functions as symbolic wallpaper rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The "obsidian lagoon" and "migration of clouds" are described in decorative terms that do not affect the protagonist's tactics. The environment feels disconnected from physical reality, serving only to mirror the protagonist's internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting offers a consistent, albeit generic, fantasy atmosphere with some vivid sensory details like the "moss-lined inscription." However, the environment functions primarily as a static backdrop for clues rather than a source of constraints or pressure that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "nebula garden" setting is established with consistent, if familiar, imagery. However, the immersion is shattered by the nonsensical phrase "Canada edges" (likely a typo for "candied" or "fragile"), which severely undermines the atmospheric authority.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The greenhouse setting is visually distinct but functions primarily as a static, atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources. Sensory details ("humid air," "scent of damp earth") are present but standard, and the juxtaposition of stone carving in a glass house is treated aesthetically rather than logically.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively anchoring the "tidal" and "obsidian" elements to the mood. However, the environment functions more as a dramatic backdrop than a source of constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details like the "cobalt silo" and "velveteen gloom" establish a strong, specific mood. The setting grounds the magic effectively, though the "unseen gameboard" metaphor feels slightly disconnected from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    The imagery is vivid (obsidian spire, kingfisher feather) but operates as static decoration rather than a constraining environment. The setting reacts to the protagonist's actions magically rather than forcing tactical adjustments. The "micro-setting" potential of the quill is noted but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric tropes ("ember alcove," "mist," "dust like velvet") that provide mood but do not constrain the character's choices. The "story famine" remains a vague, abstract concept that fails to manifest as a concrete physical or social pressure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "vanishing point gallery" offers a striking surreal backdrop, but the atmosphere relies too heavily on abstract descriptors ("smelled of... regret") rather than concrete sensory details. The physical laws of the space are established early, helping orientation, but the setting functions mostly as static scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting of the sunken city contains some functional details like "saltwater fauna" and "sedimentary layers." However, much of the description is generalized summary ("labyrinth," "acrid air") that fails to exert immediate pressure on the character until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent ("velvet library," "autumn amber"), establishing a cozy, melancholic tone. However, the environment serves mostly as decoration; the specific physical details of the library do not constrain the character's actions or force trade-offs. The description leans heavily on familiar "hushed library" tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are the story's strength, effectively grounding the premise in the "ghost-tastes" of wilted herbs and "warm bronze hues." However, the introduction of clinical jargon like "synaptic plasticity" creates a jarring tonal dissonance with the atmospheric, organic setting of the rusted greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like "honeyed glow" and "gaunt frame" effectively establish atmosphere, though the specific phrase "nectar dusk" feels ornamental. The tower's internal geography is functional but generic; the environment serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraints that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmospheric details like the "violet fingerprint scent" and "weathered paint" effectively ground the magical realism. The recurring "streetlights... silent dreamers" motif establishes a consistent, dreamlike tone that supports the premise well.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "phosphorescent algae" and "bronze flora" grounding the fantastical elements. The specific interaction with the environment—the pressure, the trellises, the chime—integrates setting directly into the character's actions. The imagery of the "foxglove-stained glass" is evocative, though the color/flower linkage is slightly loose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is largely abstract ("endless steps," "void"), lacking specific sensory details that would ground the reader in the physical experience. The transition to a "room bathed in soft light" is a generic "white room" trope that offers relief but no textural specificity. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressuring force.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse is a distinct, grounding setting, and sensory details like the "damp earth," "night-blooming jasmine," and the tactile memory of the coin are vivid. However, the "smog-choked city" remains a somewhat generic backdrop, and the atmosphere leans heavily on the repeated phrase "saffron quiet" rather than varying the sensory palette.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is immersive and sensory, blending the "wheat and ash" of the ovens with the damp, oil-slicked reality of the grotto. The "emerald-tinted" lens serves as an excellent specific tool to contrast the idealized past with the grey, immediate present.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("skeletal finger," "bruised sky") that support the tone. While effective, the descriptions occasionally lean on standard genre tropes rather than highly specific, choice-constraining details unique to this moment's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting functions adequately as a metaphorical space but relies on standard "spooky carnival" tropes without unique sensory specificity. The distortion effects are described visually but lack tactile or visceral grounding beyond the initial description.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    The central concept of the saltwater orchard is vivid and creative, but the atmosphere is undermined by abstract descriptors ("impossible gradients") and clashing technical diction. The setting functions as a passive resource for the ritual rather than an active environment that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "shell-city" concept is imaginative and visually distinct, grounding the fantasy elements well. However, the sensory details often lean into standard descriptors ("bleached white," "hues of orange and violet") rather than strictly constraining action or deepening the specific atmosphere of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.9)
    The setting is atmospheric but functions primarily as a heavy-handed symbol for societal decay rather than a grounded physical space. While the "iron skeleton" and "ivy" provide a visual anchor, the environment's logic (paper preserving perfectly in damp conditions) is ignored to serve the plot. Specificity is present but leans into cliché ("forgotten promise").

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion is rendered with vivid imagery ("crystalline puzzle pieces," "twilight's bruised canvas"), effectively grounding the scene in a specific atmosphere. However, the mechanics of the drawbridge controlling the flood levels feel contrived, and the "firm shore" phrasing is awkward.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underwater atmosphere is established with clear visual cues ("watery dome," "dappled shadows"), creating a consistent mood. However, the logic of "miraculously readable" paper in a submerged city requires high suspension of disbelief that the setting details do not fully ground, and the environment functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting physics—gravity claiming bodies while shadows ascend—are not just backdrop but essential constraints that drive the plot and charge the final image. The sensory details of the workshop (hot beeswax, diamond-tipped tool) ground the fantasy elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid, effectively blending high-tech isolation with the metaphysical in a way that supports the premise. The "thermosphere" and "cooling blue glow" ground the scene well, though the description occasionally leans on abstract summaries of the equipment's function rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The contrast between the ancient stone and the futuristic drone is established early and anchors the visual scene effectively. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop for the light show rather than a tactile environment that constrains Kai's choices. The "brilliant dimness" descriptor, while requested, feels oxymoronic and slightly destabilizes the visual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    The atmosphere is established effectively, but the specific descriptor "cobalt" is repeated five times in a short space, turning a vivid detail into a distracting tic. The setting functions well as a stage for the conversation but lacks tactile interaction until the driftwood mention.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details ("mist," "waning gibbous") establish a coherent mood but remain a passive backdrop. The setting does not constrain the characters' tactics or force active trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details ("salt-stained," "brine and decay"). While the utility poles serve as a visual marker, the environment largely acts as a backdrop rather than exerting active pressure on the protagonist's choices until the final summary of the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly standard, sensory details ("soft blue," "cool against his skin"). The bioluminescent lake effectively anchors the scene and mirrors the protagonist's internal state. However, the environment functions more as a static backdrop for the epiphany than a source of physical resistance or complication until the final submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic descriptors like "impossible blossoms" and "unnatural moonlight" rather than specific, grounded sensory details; the "stardust cinnamon" leans toward the precious rather than the immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the atmosphere of "choking beauty" is established, the description suffers from a lack of specificity, relying on abstract intensifiers ("impossible blossoms," "impossible flora," "impossible beauty," "ethereal luminescence," "ethereal plants"). These vague adjectives flatten the setting's potential vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional but leans on generic sci-fi tropes ("metallic corridors," "void"). The "memory chamber" with frozen photos is a strong image, but the sensory details are often filtered through abstract adjectives rather than concrete, immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting descriptions lean on purple abstractions ("ocean’s cool indifference," "vibrant hush") rather than concrete, constraining details. While the volcano and sand are present, they function as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist's tactics. The recurrence of "whispering hush" becomes repetitive without deepening the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "luminous fort" and "glow-stone" elements read as generic fantasy markers rather than specific, lived-in constraints. While the sundial and panel are used as props, the setting largely functions as a passive backdrop rather than forcing tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story fundamentally neglects the physical reality of its "frictionless" premise; the character stands, clutches a satchel, and stacks stones without any of the mechanical difficulty such a world would impose. This disconnect between the rules of the setting and the on-page blocking breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory setting is vivid and spatially grounded, though descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("swirling vortex," "storm-kissed"). The sensory details of the glass and timer help anchor the abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting details are vivid and specific (the tin card, the sundial), anchoring the scene visually. However, the environment feels ornamental, used primarily to generate metaphors ("transparency amplified the tension") rather than providing constraints that force difficult choices. The atmosphere is established but static.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.5)
    Visual details like the "rusted library" and "peeling paint" are evocative, but the setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints. The environment does not pressure the characters' choices; they simply operate within it.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting acts as a convenient magic room rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the "spiral staircase" and "tidal arbor" facilitate the plot too easily. Sensory details rely on abstraction ("smelled of... forgotten dreams") rather than concrete, grounded specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with high-density description, but the imagery often veers into abstraction ("tasted of sweet decay," "apologetic palms") that obscures rather than grounds the scene. While the ridge is an anchor, the description serves more as atmospheric decoration than a physical space that constrains the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "breezy islet," "wet earth," and miniature trees create a vivid, atmospheric container for the action. The micro-setting of the bonsai garden effectively mirrors Kenji's internal state. The sensory details are consistent and grounded, anchoring the more abstract emotional concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse micro-setting functions as tool: cracked glass, mossy stone, cedar box constrain gesture and limit dust application. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s astronomer bias—light refraction, particle spirals—tying cosmos to pot shard. Spatial choreography clean; weather (condensation) affects breath and visibility. Object-as-setting (dust box) recurs to charge final image. Professional astronomy detail stays relevant to metaphor; no excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Canyon, greenhouse window, and collapsed mineshaft are sketched with sensory economy; frost “stitching” the sky mirrors Kaelen’s glasslight vocation. The setting guides choice: frost-runed panes show the only readable path; mineshaft ash provides literal pigment. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Final image—sun climbing as frost “bleeds”—charges closure by marrying time, weather, and material.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: glass walls both trap and transmit vibration, directly enabling her sonic experiment. Sensory selection stays biased to touch and temperature, matching her deafened POV. The orchids’ thermal glow is returned in the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography remains stable throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Velvet-lined lens, basement clutter, gelatinous manuscript cases—detail is selective, sensory, and filtered through Marcus’s professional eye. The underwater dome becomes a micro-setting that physically constrains the revival act, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent across three dives and library moves. Only minor generic lighthouse iconography keeps it from higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ridge, cabin, arbor, and bell form a tight micro-setting whose clay-red pillars and dull-silver chime guide stealth and acoustics; terra-cotta arbor is re-imaged as sentinel hub, charging the final quiet. Sensory range is narrow—mostly sight and sound—but selective detail keeps spatial choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The viaduct, wisteria, and camera obscura are tactile, lived-in, and filter every choice; the wooden box “feels heavier” under Elias’s grip, a micro-setting that charges the final image. Bloom petals fall in the last sentence, mirroring the internal release without overt symbolism. No spatial contradictions; pedestrian choreography tracked cleanly through the lens projection. Meets 9+ gate: the camera-as-setting constrains the only possible action and is inseparable from the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The living bridges function as micro-setting: their pulsing wooden limbs actively resist Elias’s strides, forcing him to crawl the final spiral. Hyperbolic geometry is not described but performed—paths fold like ribbons, horizon bends, canopy loops—so environment constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: he smells “decay and possibility,” not botanical names. Final image of “petals” and “dying stars” recharges the bridge-garden into a dissolving constellation, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Carnival ruin is filtered through urgent granularity—rusted beam, stale popcorn scent, groaning boards—each detail pressures the body and choice. The piano bench functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final decoding act; chain length and dust motes affect visibility and reach. Spatial choreography is clean: chained arms → bench lid → arrow within reach → floor split underfoot. Environment evolves with collapse, charging the ultimate image of seeds, but one or two descriptors drift toward the generic (“abandoned carnival prize redemption center” could swap for any derelict arcade without loss).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forge is not backdrop; its cooling ash physically receives the sonic shard, charging the closure. Glass greenhouse walls refract aurora into workable light for Elias’s synesthesia, constraining when and how he listens. Shipwrecks provide tonal bass line that keeps absence audible. Spatial choreography is clean—palms on glass, ear to forge, ember glow tracking body distance. No superfluous landscape; every noun is tool or resonance chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Emerald station mist, golden sunset, and abandoned gallery are sketched with economical sensory strokes; spatial choreography stays clean. The jar acts as micro-setting/object that constrains the final choice (its dimming triggers renunciation). A hairline slip: “emerald luminescence” is repeated without new inflection. Still, the environment mirrors interior shift (glow fades as ego dissolves) and charges the last image, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Abandoned floodgate control room is not postcard; its rusted console and scorpions of rust constrain stance—Finn’s torch is the only live valve. Micro-setting rule: the bookmark becomes portable “control panel” for memory. Cobalt glass color choice is directly shaped by glacial light through dirty window. Spatial choreography holds across kneel-plunge-press sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted library under indifferent stars is viscerally anchored—“groaning shut,” “ozone,” “rusted floorboards creaked”—and the micro-setting (child’s cast, seashell) constrains decryption choices. Spatial track is clean; no orientation drift. While the macro-library could be sharper, the final image (shell on rusted table) recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cold stone embrasure, flaking gold pages, and wind-grooved timbers are filtered through Kaelen’s star-counting priorities, giving the fort a tactile, lived-in specificity. The booklet functions as micro-setting: its delicate pages constrain speed and risk tearing under urgency, directly shaping the final inscription that glows. Spatial choreography is clean—fingers, quill, booklet, embrasure keep believable positions—but the world beyond the ridge remains a hazy negative space appropriate to the sky’s erasure. Weather intensifies but never forces a practical obstacle; it stays atmospheric rather than tactical, so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting succeeds: the transparent violin functions as portable environment, its tactile cold constraining 734’s metallic grip and later melting to signal closure. Courtyard geography stays coherent—single sweep-path, center placement, frost reaction to droplets—guiding the merger beat. Twilight/dawn shift mirrors internal reconfiguration, charging the final image without overt symbolism. Selective sensory focus (crystal light fractals, sizzling droplets) keeps density high; no filler exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal-whispering stones and rain-pooled forecourt actively guide the registrar’s barefoot step and hum-backed applause moment; lens-turned-relic reweights final image, satisfying 9+ gate; projector detail could be earlier but still constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective, sense-driven detail: dew-polish scent, moonlight through dusty panes, tactile lattice walls. The maze itself is handled as extension of body—paths narrow as his luck thins, vines thicken where his devotion repeats. Micro-setting triumph: the oldest vine becomes a living cartography that forces his final stance. Only nit: “low luck zone” is societal backdrop rather than environmental pressure felt on skin.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kepler-186f, recycled-air lab, and the viewport’s fading twilight are sketched with deft, selective strokes; sound design (“hush of beating wings”) supplies an acoustic blanket that mirrors the suspended-time theme. The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting—its impossible warmth constrains every touch decision and literalizes the temporal heater. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies orbit the device without drift or ghosted props. No environmental element directly shapes the final image (the hologram, not the habitat, closes), so the 9-band gate is missed by a sliver.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Flooded pit, floating program, conductor’s podium as lone dry perch—specific, tactile, and mirrored in the “otherworldly” lantern shimmer. Spatial choreography is clean: boots slosh, pages warp, cello is rescued, water recedes. The flicker-to-stillness shift at the final chord charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor over-description (“dancing shadows on the water’s surface”) could be trimmed but never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mountain station is more than postcard: thin air frays reality, storm glass becomes a liar, and the sextant’s cold brass acts as micro-setting that constrains her final placement of the illustration. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—radio static, fever-fogged glass, charcoal grit under fingernails. Environment mirrors internal void without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: tool (sextant) and recurring object (illustration) charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tunnel as micro-setting constrains movement to a single forward vector, forcing the valve encounter; the ozone-regret draft becomes the charged final environment. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold through knees, metallic beads like frozen tears—mirrors internal pressure without checklist overload. The beaded wheel functions as portable setting/object hybrid, its surface literally re-weighted at closure. One minor spatial drift: “grimy aperture” appears only after the turn, but the flashlight gaze keeps geography legible enough.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective detail—vine-cracked mortar, moonless twilight on glass, paper creased into “impossible geometries”—is consistently filtered through the keeper’s alien attention. The obsidian wall functions as micro-setting: its changing reflective surface literally charges the final image by storing prior visitors, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean across the three shards; no floating rooms or white-room gaps. Economy is exemplary: every sensory note either mirrors decay or prepares the mirrored closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sage-covered ridge and ancient oak root system double as metaphor and physical stage, constraining where Maya can stand and where Leo plants himself; the eclipse shadow literally moves their interaction zone. Harp and silver locket function as micro-settings that dictate proximity—she must sit within arm’s reach for the curl exchange. Sensory hierarchy obeys therapist POV: sound of strings first, then visual eclipse, finally tactile hand-link. Final image—two lockets now magnetized by shared music—recharges the ridge with new emotional cartography.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    The silo’s concrete curves, containment fields, and spectral imager are tactile tools that constrain movement and enable the diary probe. The tapestry dragons return as charged micro-setting, their “shifting” re-weighted at closure to embody the re-awakening axis. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping the final image, though spatial choreography inside chamber nine could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lighthouse beam, salt wind, and cookie ink are selective, sensorily sharp, and filtered through Elias’s night-time ritual. The tower’s metronomic light literally paces his transmissions, integrating setting with action. Spatial choreography stays coherent; we track transmitter, cookie tin, and keeper’s stairs without drift. The beam’s final extinction image recharges the “directing flow” motif, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dimensional anchor functions as micro-setting: its quivers dictate when the priest pedals harder or shifts from chant to pigment. Body-as-setting is equally precise—robes whisper, breath sucked into vacuum stone—guiding his stance and tool use. Violet pigment’s refusal to fade supplies the final image that recharges prior strokes. One minor over-clocking: “muffled clarity” is repeated four times without fresh sensory tilt after the second use.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Glass spire, nautilus alcove, mirrored lake, and body-in-motion form one continuous instrument; each shard of ice or pane constrains where foot or voice can land. Cold is not backdrop but brake—slippers, seepage, shivers limit ascent speed. Final image reuses the mirrored horizon, now stripped of aurora, to show cost paid. Micro-setting (shell on alcove) literally tunes the entire score; remove it and the causal engine breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The viaduct’s humming light and mirrored water function as both arena and clock; their shifting glow directly constrains when Kael can leap. Micro-setting—the tablet’s warmth against his palm—grounds every beat. Selective sensory economy (no tourist catalog of the city) keeps attention on reflective surfaces that literalize fractured selves. The final plain street, stripped of neon, is a reconfigured environment that charges the loss of transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern is not backdrop but resonating chamber: slack drum skins act as acoustic dampers, the bench’s wood-shaving carpet supplies tactile grit, the stone floor conducts bass-line tremors into Elara’s feet. Micro-setting—the phonograph turntable—functions as fulcrum: its vibrations constrain her hand placement, timing, and final palm-press risk. Spatial choreography is immaculate: needle, disc, bench, boots track without drift. Weather’s “faint rustle of turning seasons” is acoustic curtain, absorbed into muted hush.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Courtyard stones, pigeon brass, and quarantine haze recur with selective sensory economy; the tube functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Dusk light and rain scent mirror tension without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean—tube found between cobbles, pocketed, desk-lit—no floating props. Environment does not charge the ultimate image as aggressively as the tube itself, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Greenhouse functions as pressure chamber: glass panes “cast crystal shadows” that literally guide Elias’s path to the central terrarium. The modified UV lantern is a tool-setting hybrid whose beam carves the visible scent-shapes, directly enabling the climactic choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every lantern placement, petal angle, and moonbeam is tracked. Minor waver: the wool-coat flashback is the only setting detail not anchored to a present tactile cue, slightly thinning the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Terra-cotta walls, starlight cracks, and the rope’s dust-sheathed fibers are filtered through a poet’s tactile bias; every sensory pick serves the texture quest. The grotto’s shifting spirals physically guide his path, constraining hand placement and final knot geometry—environment directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting (rope as mobile terrain) charges the closing image. A hairline slip: “quantum probability cloud” is abstract filler amid otherwise concrete carving vocab, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fractured glass dome, damp boards, and bronze bowl constrain stance—Lyra must play kneeling, ear to metal—while the charred soil and sapling supply the final recharged image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: acoustic detail dominates, visual color enters only at sunset. Spatial choreography is clean: violin set aside, bowl lifted, walk to edge tracked without drift. The shipwrecks function as metaphorical elders yet remain spatially fixed, satisfying the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is more than wallpaper: its thickening light tracks the dealer’s internal shift and the final warmth literalizes the new stance. The blotter petal serves as micro-setting; handled in at least four beats, its evolving vibration constrains the final decision. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (honey light, crackling static) rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—hand-to-table-to-pocket motion stays tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    The breezy starlit library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: open pages flutter, lamplight limits visibility, forcing Marla to notice the dropped manuscripts. Sensory hierarchy follows her cargo eye—she clocks “papers slipping like falling leaves” as freight in motion. Spatial choreography is clear across the two-shard move from concert hall to dome. The environment mirrors internal state (cool silver vs. cool night air) without overt symbolism, and the golden dome recurs as an anchor reused, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Environment rules are taught through action—light fractures via prisms, reeds absorb stray beams—never exposition. The arbor’s obsidian surface and the floating prism’s underside are tactile, distance-tracked objects that charge the climax. Micro-setting (the reeds in Kael’s hands) repeatedly constrains tactics: each strand must hum with memory or the dedication fails. Final image of vines of light weaving through sculptures makes the orchard an active agent, not postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Environment is filtered through illustrator perception—charcoal smudge, damp-metal scent, bird illustration—so every detail performs character work. The rooftop canal system is not backdrop but tactical map: its flow direction determines where Elias can "walk against the current." Micro-setting (pendant, feather, drafting table) constrains the final gesture: he must set down tools before he can sculpt time. Final image of neon rivers collapsing into silence reweights the city as both cradle and grave.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cavern orchard is not backdrop but apparatus: bioluminescent fruit powers the glass eyes, drips supply the “mathematics,” chipped mosaic routes the ritual. Micro-setting (stepping stone) literally shapes the final reconfiguration—patterns migrate as the stance shifts. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elian’s conjurer priorities—sound of silence at moon-zenith triggers action. Environment constrains and enables every beat; without it the spell collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library’s “aged bones,” pipe chases, and hollowed-out book create a micro-setting that literally channels Elias’s movement and constrains his timing; the outage-darkened stacks supply both cover and poetic hush. Sensory selection is biased to Elias’s professional intimacy—dust, metallic tape scent, flashlight blade—never tourist-catalog. The sapphire dawn re-illuminates the found fragment at closure, environment charging the final image as required for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The trellis is not backdrop but instrument: its slick lattices dictate how Elias can/cannot intervene, and the final dance is choreographed against its wooden grid. Rain’s ozone, leaf’s tremor, stem tension—all filter through botanist-biased attention. Environment constrains the culminating choice: only by stepping out from under the eaves into full storm can the metamorphosis occur. Micro-setting (leaf-as-object) charges the final image when it glistens “with a new light.”

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal island is sketched through selective sensory cues (brackish edge, opposing currents) that constrain Elara’s movements and literally separate her from the mainland; the brooch functions as micro-setting that warms against her hip and alters her stance. Spatial choreography is clear across the causeway and convergence pool. Weather (patterned rain) is active, not decorative, guiding every step. Final image ties setting to theme: isolation becomes circuit of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cave is lived-in through Elara’s fingers, ears, and skin; sound, light, and shadow are filtered by her seer’s bias. Spatial choreography is clean—footsteps recede, shadows overlap in tracked geometries, pearl hovers within reachable cluster. The musical crystals and consuming shadows act as micro-setting that directly enables the final transformation. Environment supplies both resource and cost, satisfying the 9+ gate; only the outward “world outside” line risks breadth over depth.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mist-shrouded ivory harbor is more than postcard; its reflective surface literalizes the community’s need to see their own absences. The archive’s empty shelves function as micro-setting that literally constrain Elara’s method—she can only stage what isn’t there. Weather returns in the final image of rain-washed lights, charging the closure with rinsed but persistent opacity. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → archive table → exhibit space, each locale hosting a distinct beat.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    The starlit vault, mist-thick tracks, and phantom platform form a micro-setting that actively liquefies underfoot, forcing the mapper to treat fog as solid ground—an environmental constraint that charges the final image. Lantern-circle, frost-breath, and punch-weight narrow perception to immediate survival tools, never sliding into tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: arrows converge, gate looms, hall of mirrors sequenced without position drift. The setting’s rule—“cracks glow and widen”—is taught early and paid off when the gate consumes the punch, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tower’s circular room and open roof constrain the ritual; the obsidian tile’s warmth is a micro-setting that dictates when and how Elara acts. Whale-song below functions as atmospheric clock, tightening the dawn deadline. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: astronomer’s stone, migrating sound, internal glow. No spatial drift; bodies and objects remain trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prismatic escondite is not backdrop but antagonist: its shifting facets force cautious footwork, its hollowed socket is the precise keyhole for the fragment. Light-bending at climax physically manifests the conceptual unmaking. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—magnetic fields felt as “static whisper” against skin—never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prep room's “deathly vitality” is vivid, selective, and threaded through action: cold steel, formaldehyde scent, fluorescent glare—each detail either enables concealment or signals risk. Spatial track is clean: table → refrigerator → corridor → alley; no impossible moves. The ink pot functions as micro-setting, its porcelain weight anchoring every beat it appears. Environment never stalls plot; instead the refrigerated units literally hide the living, exploiting the setting's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting triumph: the fluorescent lamp’s corner, the chilled glass workshop, and the miniature bonsai canopy are returned to in tactile motion (brushing dew, charting vibrations) so environment directly shapes technique. Selective sensory hierarchy—pine dew, lamp hum, gold gleam—mirrors internal vigilance without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible object jumps. Just shy of 9 because the town itself stays off-stage silhouette rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The container labyrinth is tactile—rusted walls as “distorted mirror,” salt-softened paper, crane tremor felt in shins—every sense filtered through the POV’s ghosted attention. The poison label itself becomes micro-setting, its brittleness and faded warning constraining how he can handle, read, and layer it. Tide rhythm is used as emotional metronome, not postcard weather. Only the crane’s physics stays off-page, but this never affects choice, so the cap remains 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory, cliff, sea, and decaying dome provide tactile constraint—wind howls through gaps, salt air requires compass reset. Micro-setting (half-built cello body) doubles as tool that channels memory; its incomplete resonance mirrors Elias’s partial knowledge. Sensory triage under crisis: sound of strings, warmth of shell, sight of color swirl—all filtered through his professional lens of “myth buster.” Final image of journal page lifting in wind reuses environment to show new direction without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is the raft maze’s perpetual neon; sensory selectivity favors shifting light on water, narrowing to the chip’s rough pores under moonlight at closure. Micro-setting—the chip on the sill—functions as charged object reweighting the theme. Spatial choreography stays coherent across 47 rafts; no impossible moves. One minor efficiency gap: clean-energy barges are sketched, not used to block or enable a beat, so environment narrowly misses constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lunar vacuum rules are learned through action—dust settlement, camera chemistry calibration, visor-view of colors “that shouldn’t exist”—never dumped. The grain functions as micro-setting that constrains the timing mechanism, qualifying for 9+ gate. Sensory economy favors urgent immediacies: glove dexterity, visor condensation, cold seeping through suit. One minor slip: summit spatial layout is sketched once then assumed, but choreography stays tractable in the single long beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rail depot is never described for tourist color; it is revealed through rail-siding proximity, mist that blurs sight but sharpens sound, and the fountain’s refractive surface that Elias literally uses as a diagnostic tool. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the depot’s metal geometries and water-light interface constrain every decision—if the fountain ripple lies, the drone dies. Spatial choreography is immaculate; drone, bench, window, and horn distances remain trackable after every reach and swivel. One hairline slip: “ship’s anchor fully cleared the water” momentarily pictures a liner inside a rail yard; the metaphoric intent is clear, but the spatial overreach keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation-coated window constrain every beat: cold limits duration, frost mirrors hidden turbulence, glass becomes both map and clock. Selective sensory detail (“smelled of distant places,” “cold seeping into his skin”) keeps density high without cataloging. The setting evolves—condensation fades as temperature drops—forcing the final packing choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobblestones, archway sigils, and the fork itself act as micro-settings that constrain every beat; removing any would break the sonic mechanics. Sensory selection is urgent—glow, pulse, echo—never tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is pristine; no impossible positions or drifting geography.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Underwater temple, crystalline spires, and gravity-defying water are vividly sketched and directly shape the descent tension; spatial choreography is clean. The vial serves as micro-setting object that constrains the final choice by “touching memories.” Sensory balance favors visual wonder; a tighter auditory or tactile pin could have heightened the hush motif. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Copper sunset refracts through every surface—door scuffs, salt air, lattice wood—creating a consistent atmospheric sieve. The jagged reef and lighthouse geometry constrain movement (the outer walkway is the only escape vector), while the confessional lattice functions as micro-setting that literally reframes vision. Final image of the beacon “cutting through darkness” mirrors Elias’s self-annihilation, charging the closure with conceptual afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—silver-bark trunks, luminous pomegranates, ozone scent all channel attention toward the bead-triggered epiphany. Spatial choreography clean: her veil brushes cheek, bead falls to damp earth, he kneels—positions track. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV botanist bias: bark texture, blossom scent, phosphorescent shed prioritized over visual catalog. Final image (orchard humming with echo) reuses prior anchors rather than inventing new scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Whorf-weaver’s perceptual filter shapes every descriptor: indigo fingers, salt-stained satchel, kelp-silk tensile in air. Labyrinth breathes as internal organ; copper plate warms, constraining her tactile choices. Canyon becomes micro-setting that alters weave tension. Final image of sunlit kelp-orchids recharges opening empty tide pools, fulfilling 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Catacomb orchard is not scenery but hydraulic pressure: roots gripping limestone dictate where she digs; perpetual twilight narrows sensory bandwidth to scent and chill. The sundial socket is micro-setting that literally shapes the final move. Spatial choreography never drifts; every shovel scrape stays anchored to the slab’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Golden arcade, dawn light, chalk dust, and nano-particle scent are vividly selective, filtered through Elliot’s nostalgic tech-sensibility. The workspace and arcade floor function as micro-settings that constrain action: he must kneel, code, and archive before the sun erases his marks. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The dawn light evolves from “long shadows” to “intensified” warmth, tracking time and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt walls, silver thread, and candle-flame interact tactilely—thread gleams, flame syncs with heartbeat—anchoring abstract stakes to handled objects; the observatory’s silence is used as acoustic pressure, not postcard décor, and constrains the final stillness that lets the coup pause.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mangrove roots, brackish water, salt-air, and fragmented moonlight are filtered through the medium’s biased attention; the gargoyle shard’s temperature shifts constrain her pacing and the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    The misted atrium/fountain is not backdrop; it dictates slowed perception, allows the quiet decoding scene, and reappears in the charged final image. Coral fragment functions as micro-setting constraining touch and meaning-making. Sensory triage (muted pain, underwater echo) mirrors emotional anesthesia. All details return in the closing beat, fulfilling 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Fog-shrouded orchard, crumbling plaster, and moss-covered wall are filtered through Elara’s painterly eye; sensory hierarchy privileges ochre light and damp chill, guiding her ritual posture. The fresco fragment’s tactile crumbling directly enables the resurrection beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment-as-constraint: the crystalline petal path literally sounds her next step; she cannot walk silently, so auditory setting shapes pace. Micro-setting extends to the nickel itself, whose warming carves a bodily limit. Final image—chapel ceiling as latent score—reprises the garden’s tonal blooms, charging closure. World rules stay consistent: sound = matter, never violated.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Greenhouse operates as micro-setting: moth-wing shadows equal syllables, formaldehyde tang undercuts floral hope, monstera leaves become war-shields. Spatial choreography clear—tables, ferns, buried jars—tracking intact. Sensory triage narrows to touch (soil, seed) under raid stress. Final wildflower image is specific, irreplaceable, recharging earlier pinned-beetle stillness with living code.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Shell, cliff, reef-shadow sea, postcard ink—each re-appears to constrain or mirror emotion; the postcard’s galactic swirl physically redirects the poet onto the cliff. Sensory triad is selective (visual, haptic, auditory lullabies) rather than checklist. Micro-setting rule met: postcard charges final image by becoming the blossom’s twin.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The opal library’s iridescent shelves and humming orchids constrain every move; the caretaker’s access to song depends on the architecture of glass and wind. Micro-setting (the mending bamboo tube) literally fuses the fracture, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sound > sight > touch. No static museum-tour; each detail is handled or sung. Weather is the internal wind of the chime—perfectly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Archive is rendered through sensory triangulation: dust motes in throat-silence, star-ink’s metallic scent, glass coolness against palm. Micro-setting doubles as tool—the ink well literally enables the bridge—so object-as-setting passes the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean: center table, shelves vibrating, door creaking behind. One slip: “tomb for words” is gorgeous but slightly generic; a more idiosyncratic archivist noun would sharpen the filter.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Amphitheater-as-throat of volcano, geothermal exhalations, and brass chain glints are filtered through the machinist’s surveyor eye, constraining his final measurement. The chain itself functions as micro-setting: its exact length and worn midpoint physically dictate the new floodgate setting. One notch off 9.0 only because the town below is named solely by lights, not sensory detail, keeping the external stakes slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The attic’s breathing decay, pipe-ghost aroma, and grimy skylight are filtered through a courier-trainer’s gaze that notices air currents as flight paths; sensory hierarchy is strict. Spatial choreography is immaculate: mesh door, waxed thread, bone tweezers, and the meteorite chip’s crimson flecks are handled in sequence without floating props. Environment directly constrains the final image—the loft door’s rectangle of light becomes the launch gate—so 9+ gate is met. One minor overripe phrase: “wildfire flowers” momentarily prettifies decay, but it is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Drifting prism terrace” and “fractured light” are vivid, selective, and mirror the theme of splintered reality; the setting is the story’s micro-environment and charges the final image. Anchors (who/where/when) emerge gradually, but the delay is purposeful disorientation that resolves into Charged Poise. Sensory economy favors visual refraction and haptic wood grain, both filtered through Elea’s maze-trained perception. Weather and altitude metaphors remain consistent with the pilot-logbook frame, sustaining internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Underwater observatory textures—prisms, reinforced glass, atmospheric generators—are concrete and filtered through Elara’s star-mapper eye. Spatial choreography keeps Kaelen’s entrance and the plankton bloom legible. The city’s pre-flood sunlight capture explains the mirror-system without exposition dump and re-enters at closure to charge the gold sunrise. Setting does not physically constrain choices here, so it hovers below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Geode cave, crater glass, and seed-stars are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Aelia’s shifting perceptual palette. Light, color, and sound are filtered through her professional priorities; no tourist catalog. The micro-setting (crater glass as warm palm-sized tool) constrains every analytical move and charges the final empty-circle image. Spatial choreography remains stable; bodies and objects track cleanly across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The vaulted iron-and-glass arcade isn’t wallpaper; its acoustics amplify the violin cue and its frozen clock supplies the literal obstacle. Salt air and flickering lamp-light narrow perception to micro-details that guide placement of props and notes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: bishop on cobblestones, scarf-trail vector, hidden keyhole behind the clock face. The setting re-enters the final image as the newly ticking clock reframes the whole arcade from stagnant monument to living stage.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Twilight garden, obsidian circle, and moonstone dust are specific, tactile tools that constrain choreography and charge the final inscription. Sensory hierarchy follows Lyra’s dancer priorities—starlight texture over sight, tidal rhythm over sound. Spatial choreography cleanly tracks her spiral within the stone ring. Weather/star-field evolve as she dances, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Prism atrium in mist” functions as micro-setting: it constrains perception, charges every refraction, and dissolves at closure, leaving the glazier with clearer glass. Sand, boots, wet stone, net-mending hands—tactile, selective, filtered through glazier’s bias for light and fracture. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather shift (sun burning mist) is timed to action, not backdrop. Meets 9+ micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moonlit ridge path functions as micro-setting that constrains movement—narrow trail, silver light guiding each step—and the porcelain box recurs as tactile “handle” that warms, charging the final pocketing. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual moonlight, thermal warmth, faint bell clink) mirrors Elias’s narrowed attention under memory pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: no impossible object positions. The environment does not merely backdrop; it supplies the literal path and reflective perch that enable the final reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tide-polished grotto functions as micro-setting that literally rewrites her patterns: rising tide distorts geometry, forcing her to accept chaos as data. Salty air, lucent shells, and swaying gauge create multi-sensory density; every decorative placement is tactically tied to her experiment. Final image—sunbreak illuminating wet stone—recharges the premise: nature collaborates, not just backdrop. Spatial choreography flawless; no anachronism.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivy-veined walls function as micro-setting: their damp cracks “pulse” and literally lean in at the end, constraining Elian’s exit and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy adheres to a cartographer’s priorities—texture, vein-pattern, acoustic drip—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: passage→chamber→hearth→wall, negative extracted, image glimpsed, ivy rustles. Tone stays hush-lost, matching post-climate quietude. The environment’s liveliness is the story’s rule-set; no 9+ only because exterior world rules (climate shift consequence) are asserted not demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prism parapet is the star: it steers the palette (refracted mini-rainbows dictating hue placement), doubles as lighting rig, and returns in the final gleam that denies the art ever existed—an environment charging both process and erasure. Terrace acoustics and spring dew are economically woven through action rather than paused description. Micro-setting rule satisfied: parapet’s surface slickness after rain almost topples canvas, a spatial risk that never stalls momentum. Sensory hierarchy honors painter’s priorities—she notices color spectra before ambient cold—keeping detail selective.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace stones, sun angle, and rune alignment constrain the ritual timing; refusal to speak before the exact solar moment would break the spell, so environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting tool—the ebony clipboard—literally absorbs and reflects the changing light, charging the final image when laid down. Sensory economy is disciplined: humidity is felt in joints, not weather-reported; visual focus narrows to “polished surface absorbing the midsummer sun,” mirroring internal absorption of guilt. Spatial choreography is immaculate—single anchored observer, no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt flat is not backdrop; its reflective crust doubles the sky and becomes the resonator that traps the bird’s song, directly enabling the closure technology. Micro-setting—the egg’s ghost image in the salt—constrains Silas to kneel and accept non-possession. Sensory economy favors glare, crunch, and sub-audible vibration over visual catalog, mirroring his narrowed guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silver courtyard snow and crystalline sanctuary return as tactile constraints: the cold threads literally burn her fingers, and the refracted starlight charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single-location scene; selective sensory detail (bare feet on crystals, pulse of light through prisms) keeps the micro-setting vivid without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The radar dome as repurposed surveillance-turned-studio is sketched with spare, tactile cues (“still reverberated with echoes”) and recurs to frame the final release performance; the campfire stick serves as micro-setting that constrains each puppet vignette, satisfying the 9+ gate. Bar interiors are generic, but selective detail keeps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sky-bound moss grotto is not postcard scenery; its moist stone, quartz pulse, and cloud-mouth constrain posture, tool choice, and the very possibility of permanence, charging the final image of dissolution. Specificity is selective, tactile, and filtered through Elias’s esoteric eye—detail never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sanctum’s cold literally slows fingers and brittles hair, forcing the caster to work delicately under time pressure; the aurora’s color-shift mirrors the rope’s golden bloom. Micro-setting—the silver tray, the sleeping-serpent coil—constrains hand placement and knot logic. Spatial choreography is flawless: tray → lap → floor → wall projection tracks cleanly. Environment and tool fuse in the final image: ice walls become the parchment on which the names are written in light.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Bunker, staircase, and core chamber are economically sketched through Kael’s bias—ozone, wet earth, cold—each detail doubles as hazard map for his foresight. Weather and decaying conduit directly shape movement and tension; the vine that breaks is both scenery and ticking clock. No object or body part reweights the final image, so 8.8 cap applies. Spatial choreography remains coherent across spiral descent and spark-dodge.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crumbling ziggurat silhouette and “jagged crown against the fading twilight” are filtered through Elias’s frugal astronomer gaze—he notices angles, twilight angles, decay as data. The palace’s axis is not scenery but the mechanical precondition for the star-door alignment; setting literally guides choice. Micro-setting objects—polished bronze mirror, cool tile—are handled in tactile, lived-in ways that charge the final image. One hairline slip: “between regimes” is stated early but the concrete difference between old/new power never intrudes on spatial choreography, so regime pressure stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Soundless, shifting sanctuary is more than backdrop—it is the crucible that forces Elias’s non-violent method. Micro-setting tools: the box’s weight in pocket, pin’s glint, starlight wall—all constrain whether he can “play” forgiveness. Sensory economy favors haptic & visual over tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean despite reality ripples; each client’s distance from wall or door signals resistance level.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Fog is not backdrop—it limits visibility, forces tactile work, and becomes the medium in which the dream-bird moves. The broken sextant’s brass gleam and frost-rimmed cobbles are filtered through a glass-grinder’s eye, giving micro-setting authority. Final image of “glass mountains rising where only ruins existed” reuses the shard motif to reconfigure space, passing the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral-orchard is tactile: roots “clung to stone arches,” fruit smells of regret, light dapples through stained glass. Setting constrains the mender’s ascent and kneeling posture, and the final image of ribbon against sapling charges the bridge metaphor. Micro-setting (ribbon, seed, rusted key) acts as choice-tool; their burial alters the symbolic field. Scale stays economical—no tour-guide excess—and sensory hierarchy favors touch/smell over visual cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Micro-setting triumph: the pistachio-shell inner curvature becomes the entire astral orchard—an irreplaceable spatial hinge. Sensory selection is POV-driven (iridescent oval, crystalline fruit) and integrates with action (she pockets, re-enters). Museum and bathroom anchors are sketched with minimal but sufficient strokes; the asteroid is lyric, not geographic, so exact spatial tracking is forgone. No environment constrains a final tactic, capping Q3 short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain-bookstore is specific, sensorily rich, and actively hostile: compasses spin, light falls flat, aisles dead-end into themselves, all of which constrain Elara’s linear search and necessitate her linguistic workaround. The “river of flowing light” micro-setting inside the unlearned library charges the final image and supplies the immediate physical cost. No exposition dumps; each detail arrives through her goal-directed attention. Spatial choreography is flawless for the two moving bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is the story’s engine: the derelict ship’s rotting timbers, fog-throttled lights, and looped ghosts constrain every step; the emerald card acts as micro-setting that rewrites surfaces. Spatial anchoring is crisp—edge of bay → ticket booth → engine room → garden—each locale tilts the twin’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clock-tower mechanism room is economically sketched through brass oil scent and gear heartbeat; micro-setting of braided rope becomes the decisive terrain. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist priorities—texture of parchment, pattern recognition—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elias moves from table to platform to final wall. The “candle-flame titles” verge on ornament but serve the accumulative glow needed for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ice-web topography, cave resonance, and the stone’s glow are tactile and selective; the cracks literally guide the conjuring, so setting constrains the final action. Sensory hierarchy stays tied to Lorne’s professional gaze, anchoring the bloom’s expansion in lived space.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass pavilion functions as both environment and instrument: its hum modulates with wind pressure, its facets dictate where Kaelen places fingers. Moonlight-into-rainbow is specific physics; “shard of hush” acts as micro-setting lodged inside the crystal, constraining the final amplification. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral ascent, summit housing, turning ring—every move tactile. The tower’s ruined grandeur is filtered through Kaelen’s astronomer-custodian lens, never touristy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog function as micro-settings that constrain movement and perception. The “crystal whispering” surface literally holds voices only Kael can hear, turning ground into archive—an environment that dictates method and stakes. Shadow lengths refuse sun geometry and obey fog-time, a world rule discovered through action that directly powers the climax. Final image reuses the setting: the melting forecourt is the exact place where the cost becomes visible.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming fortress walls, torch-flare angles, and shifting tesserae are selectively detailed and directly enable the discovery; the kerosene-soaked rag and mosaic tiles function as micro-setting that constrains the final action, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grotto, tidal pool, and jade cicada form a tight micro-setting whose constraints (rising tide, salt-etched wings) directly charge the final image. Sensory selection favors touch and temperature, matching Elian’s chronicler bias. Starlight ceiling and ancient stone are sketched economically; no white-room syndrome. The cicada’s salt-ridged surface reappears at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate by reconfiguring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bunker’s rust/ozone and the trellis’s silver vines are not backdrop but instruments: the former demands her ear-fasting, the latter supplies the lattice she must physically finger to harvest silence. Micro-setting object—the porcelain doll—constrains choice: its warming signals saturation point and precipitates the descent. Spatial choreography is precise: boots lighten, toes graze vine, thud on trellis floor tracks body in inverted space. Sensory economy obeys POV bias—only the smells and vibrations she needs to “taste” silence are admitted.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is protagonist: the prism terrace refracts both starlight and Elara’s attention, its facets steering every slow-breath decision; the gondola rails, storm-glass base, and orbital drift physically anchor the scene. Sensory triage is POV-true—she notes hush over hue, temperature over topography—so the world never feels catalogued. Micro-setting (vial, rail, prism base) repeatedly constrains gesture and timing, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and living orchard are not backdrop: they gate entry, supply genetic-fruit clues, and charge the final rainbow-streaked image of the fading temple. Micro-settings—visor, synth-skin paint flakes—constrain tactile choices. Spatial choreography is clean across the cascade crossing. Environment directly shapes tactics: sunrise clock, liquid veil, mural surface.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpent-ring, ash-stone, and starlight are tactile and selective, grounding each beat. The sanctuary’s skeletal frame against constellations mirrors her stripped interiority without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; the ring’s cold weight is tracked hand-to-hand. The micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate: the ring’s final contact against the door charges the closing image and constrains her irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mushroom-farm body-as-setting guides every action: humidity dims vision, caps dictate where to kneel, glow supplies the energy; yet the bolt’s prior naval life never constrains choice, so micro-setting does not fully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sepia room, brass crank, and serpent sigil are tactile, selective, and return re-weighted at the end. The micro-setting (crank-as-key) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. One stray spatial reference—“far end of the room”—is never anchored, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse-as-body dominates every beat: glass magnifies night, fruit emits usable light, gears substitute for fruit, walls dissolve when rule is broken. Each described detail (glowing hues, shivering air, puppet shadows cast by fruit-light) feeds the texture-escalation under the Accumulative lens. Spatial choreography is deliberately dream-like yet internally consistent—no impossible positions. The final image of dissolving walls and wildfire-spreading magic is charged by prior sensory layering, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-constraint that shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Puddle-reflection cartography and auric lagoon mineral glow are sharply sensory and plot-functional; the environment literally channels her next move. Micro-setting (weathered logo key, dusty booth window) doubles as tool and atmosphere. Spatial choreography holds from ministry steps to shed floorboard. The lagoon’s starlit shimmer charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test, but the broader city remains a generic silhouette, capping uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto and prism atrium constrain every tactical choice: only inside the tilting glass can Elias scatter the forbidden tones into harmless rainbow fragments.
    Sensory detail is selective—cold seep, dew spheres, cracked glass—each filtered through a musician’s ear for resonance rather than visual tourism.
    The mist’s recession tracks the success beat-by-beat, turning weather into a live progress bar that final image refracts back at Elias’s own aging face.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arbor is never a postcard; its ash-trees’ dangling roots and misty below directly enable the seed-sorting labor and the balcony leaf-collection. Micro-setting triumphs: the wooden sorting tray, star-tweezers, and dewdrop resin all constrain what Elias can manipulate. Spatial choreography is pristine—every speck floats to a specific corner and alters that object’s state. Only the “galaxy-eyes” of the sprite flirt with cliché, but the image is brief and immediately transmuted into the ash-leaf glyph that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Subterranean cavern, glass greenhouse trapdoor, and waterfall chamber are anchored within 120 words; spatial choreography is clean—tools, vines, pedestal track across moves. The compass-as-micro-setting constrains every tactical step down the spiral and charges the final image. Mist-caught glowing moss mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. No orientation debt; environment actively shapes access and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Foundry milieu is vividly sulfur-rain-slick, anchored by body-scale tools (scales, forge, taper). Weather and metal sensory threads run throughout, narrowing perception under urgency. Micro-setting (the chipped coin) directly constrains the final repair choice. Orientation is secure by ~100 words; environment is not merely atmospherics but materially shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Echo Gorge is evoked through acoustic behavior, not postcard vistas; “cliffs swallowed sound and spit it back fractured” immediately teaches the rule that governs every beat. The crocodile tooth operates as micro-setting—its cool ridge against lips centers bodily grounding. Sunlight through cracks evolves from eerie to lullaby, mirroring internal tonal shift. Environment constrains method: he must play within the gorge’s warped resonance or fail.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but apparatus: violet edges soften in direct response to the equation, a live variable that alters Kael’s tactical options. Bark, ozone, and pulsing canopy are filtered through proprioceptive hypersensitivity—every surface becomes a calibration tool. Spatial choreography is clean; body-to-tree orientation stays consistent from slumped awakening to first forward step. Setting charges the final image: the path literally brightens as the math takes hold.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-setting of the fragment-as-lens actively guides perception and choice. Market is sketched with selective sensory ropes, bottled starlight, but keeps economy. Lighthouse-painting interior revealed through the fragment acts as environment that alters her path, satisfying 9+ object-use gate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ticket office functions as both crime-scene and reliquary: every peeling poster and fractured plaster flake is handled or dust-scrutinised, constraining his method. The water-stained medallion becomes a literal access panel; the ladder’s ricketiness heightens the final ascent. Micro-setting (the lath cavity) supplies the hiding nook that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy stays under professional gaze—temperature drop, metallic glint—never tourist-catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass orchard, cloud-sea, and letterpress are not postcard backdrop: the glass fruit glow guides Elias to the bottle; the cloud-sea receives his final body. Frost patterns function as both oracle and countdown, constraining choice. Micro-setting—the press lever’s cold bite—charges the rupture image. One tenth off for “swirling sea of clouds” cliché phrase, quickly recovered by functional specificity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Baroque asteroid corridors and the maintenance-suite micro-setting constrain every move: only there can mirrors be veiled, exterior shutter opened, light summoned. The shard itself functions as micro-setting—its pooled twilight literally reconfigures the room’s metal surfaces. Sensory economy is severe: three senses per beat, always filtered through Kaelen’s poetic bias. No 9.0 because the exterior void is named but not exploited as pressure during the meteor shower.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting triumph: music-box gears, candle-oil stained fingers, bells-as-walls create tactile, choice-guiding terrain. The philosopher’s-stone chip’s amber pulse and starlight filaments give the final image its charge. Echoic labels (“Sevenbells,” “Great Darkening”) stay economical and anchored; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The phosphorescent lagoon is not just scenery; its magnetic water is the literal pivot that dissolves explorers and reorients Elias’s compass, constraining his final choice.

Lantern beam and dancing shadows are reweighted in the last paragraph: the same light that exposed fracture now “illuminates the path forward,” anchoring the RR. Micro-setting (tarot box, single Fool card) functions as extension of body and choice. 9+ gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Wind-carved canyon and eclipse after-image function as micro-setting: the scorched sand supplies the only surface the ink can mark, directly constraining the ritual. Drone’s metallic wings and dissolving oil-sheen provide tactile specificity without catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: Kael kneels, traces, stands; drone hovers, returns. Environment mirrors internal state only through action, not overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    The library-as-tomb is evocatively anchored—“frost-coated shelves looming like tombstones,” “dim blue emergency lighting”—and the snowstorm outside keeps tangible pressure on escape routes. Micro-setting works: the crinkling letter melts a circle of sweat, concretely linking object, body, and stakes. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly from shelves to terminal to alley. The snow never evolves past picturesque backdrop, but it successfully charges the final shrine image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dome glass, knife velvet, and ballast scrap function as micro-setting; each is handled and re-handled, charging the final glow. Sensory triangulation—rough burlap, cool glass, soil scent—anchors every beat. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or duplicates.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rail spike as micro-setting literally constrains every tactical move; its cold iron anchors action against dissolving sound-garden physics. Sky choreography is tracked beat-by-beat; star streaks slow in sync with glyphs. Sensory selection skews auditory/tactile—perfect for a fisher who “nets” frequencies. Garden returns re-tuned—environmental state change causally locked to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Brass celestial sphere, echoing observatory, and rosewood desk form a micro-setting triad that literally steers discovery (sphere → regret metaphor; desk → nib weapon; chart underside → route). Cloud-height acoustics narrow perception during solitude, then shift to claustrophobic trap once killer motive is inferred. Sensory hierarchy obeys astrophysicist-heiress priorities: visual axis of dome, tactile nib weight, archival paper scent. The environment constrains the final choice—only the press empire’s reach can broadcast what the stars “watch.”

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The antique desk and its secret drawer function as micro-setting that materially constrains discovery and supplies the letters driving tactics; amber and resonance rig recur as handled objects whose changing state alters choices. Sensory economy favors sound and hush, mirroring theme without checklist drift; spatial choreography inside the lab remains coherent across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering grotto is more than backdrop: its curved acoustic surfaces supply the literal architecture that Elara’s mandala mirrors and hijacks, making setting an engineering component of the climax. The tile flake functions as micro-setting/charged object, its vibrating energy altering her tools and tactics; this dual constraint lifts the score into high band. Sensory detail is selective—mist, lilac taste, damp breath—woven through action rather than catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The plaza is rendered through knee-level touch—warm-cold air, chipped lion mane, tessera’s bite—rather than postcard panorama. “Shattered sky” and “skeletal walls” are familiar post-apocalypse signage, but the body-scale immediacy (blood on mosaic, sun’s weak heat battling chill) keeps them fresh. Micro-setting (tessera as both tool and relic) constrains every micro-choice and charges the final garden image. One stray cliché—“ghosts of the fire rising”—dents the otherwise idiosyncratic sensory filter.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silver-barked apple trees that hum melodies Arthur can taste is highly particular; the garden’s threshold where the coin is placed becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image, constraining the next performer’s discovery and the theater’s future. Spatial choreography stays clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The studio operates as micro-setting: LED rigs and prisms constrain her choreography and literally supply the color palette that externalizes the telepathy. Fractally precise rainbows off the muscovite return in the closing image, crystallizing the emotional map she has painted, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Coastal cave network is not backdrop but instrument: narrowing walls, receding tides, and fossil “lanterns” actively pressure her path and tactics. Micro-setting rule satisfied—fossils function as portable terrain that constrain each next step. Sensory selection (brackish water, damp limestone, bone-deep hum) is filtered through her professional sensorium, never touristy. Spatial choreography is flawless: objects float, distances narrow, and she moves deeper with physical logic intact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber warehouse’s slanted light, resin smell, and canyon acoustics filter through Elara’s haptic attention; the setting is micro-scaled to her kneeling body and sorting fingers. Buttons-as-river-stones and blacksmith thumbprints supply specific sensory economy. The cliffs outside appear only in the coda; they don’t constrain tactics, so environment stops just short of 9+ gate. Spatial choreography inside remains coherent—no impossible object jumps. Overall, selective detail supports tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zephyr Bluff’s mist, frozen ground, and wind-scoured plateau are not backdrop but tools: the plateau provides the only aerial-visible canvas for the code, the bluff’s stone becomes the literal “witness” he touches to seal his vow. Weather evolution (wind rising to erase footprints) is causally tied to the denouement, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is crisp: kneel at box → stamp plateau → return to bluff edge; no impossible positions. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual cliché, keeping perception aligned with a spy’s threat scan.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fog-bound crossing is not backdrop but pressure vessel: it swallows sound, blurs distance, and forces the coachman’s ambient listening. Micro-setting—the yarn needle in pocket, mud sucking boots—grounds every beat. The river’s silhouette at lift-off supplies the final image, re-weighted from menace to aperture; environment directly shapes the timing and emotional valence of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cracked earth, crystallized honey, smoke-river, and lantern glass scratches are selective, sensory, and filtered through Kael’s potter gaze. The micro-setting (glass + smoke) literally enables the final revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; only the bee’s vanishing lacks a tracked after-image, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Fire-escape micro-setting and the bitting gauge tool constrain every adjustment; harbor moonlight is filtered through gardener’s nautical attention, not postcard catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—rust, height, angle tracked across moves. Weather (winter’s approach) tightens the timeline and justifies the light-capture quest. The final image of multiplied mirrors recharges the luminous harbor motif without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal library, brass sundial, and stone circle hum are sensuously particular and return to charge the final image. Spatial grounding is secure: floating sanctuary, cloud banks below, stone circle center. Weather and cosmic tides mirror emotional cadence without overt symbolism. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, so it stops short of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lotus temple, lily pond, and silver ribbon maze are rendered with selective sensory strokes—“prismatic quiet,” “verdine island,” “living kaleidoscope”—that filter through Elias’s poetic eye. The twig spiral functions as micro-setting: its scale and fragility constrain how he grips it, guiding every step inside the sculpture. Environment charges the final image: the same light refraction that bathes the sculpture mirrors the“spectrum” of merged secrets. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    Setting is efficiently anchored—“dim glow of the university radio station's control room”—and the astronomical charts function as a tactile tool handled in multiple beats. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual), but selectivity matches the POV’s professional filter. The station never constrains her physically (no locked doors, budget cuts, eavesdropping colleagues), so environment stays backdrop rather than pressure. Micro-setting qualifies; no 9+ gate charge because charts don’t reconfigure in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Star-dusted darkness,” “angularities,” and “prismatic shards” are selective, pressure-filtered; the nexus geometry is re-etched by each organ chord, so setting actively constrains her placement of the compass—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    The quarry, ribbon, and charcoal tools are not backdrop but tactical constraints: damp stone smudges lines, silk ribbon dictates color palette, mist obscures distance and time. Spatial choreography is immaculate—body, tweezers, paper, rock surface tracked without drift. Weather (mist, cold) directly governs pace and perception narrowing. The abandoned museum steps re-enter as closure site, completing an environmental loop. 9+ gate met: the ribbon-as-tool crystallizes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Weather station is sketched via function—groaning systems, recycled air, loose panel—rather than postcard catalog. The copper nail and console divot serve as micro-setting, constraining the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (cold/oxidized) and sound (alarms) under pressure. Horizon’s geometric shift is the single visual payoff that reweights the premise, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mountain pullout, stone bridge, and wind-whipped scaffold function as micro-settings that literally feed her music and decoding; the scaffold’s “rhythmic snapping” becomes metronome and cipher, charging the final image. Sensory selection (echoing water, glinting glass, mountain mist) stays tied to her fiddler’s ear/eye bias; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The circus train’s tilted rooms and rusted animals are tactile, specific, and constrain Jasper’s nesting impulse; the foreign bills function as micro-setting that physically marks territory. Weather and spatial angles are reused efficiently to mirror emotional stasis. No world-rule violations; “settled into the earth at impossible angles” is vivid yet physically plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cursed lake and orchard vortex are not backdrop but active antagonist: bending trees, water temperature, and spinning suction literally pull the protagonist forward and punish delay. Micro-setting is met by the seed-as-tool, whose growing heat and final sinking constrain pacing and final choice. Spatial choreography is flawless—boots at edge, lapping water, seed dropped at exact vortex core. One hairline slip from slight over-cataloguing of sensory layers mid-vortex keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt glade is rendered through scent (ozone), touch (wet earth, bark fissures), and kinesthetic spirals in palm and wood; visual data is subordinated to somatic immediacy. Dusk’s “impossible weight” and the jagged eclipse function as micro-setting that literally presses on lungs and retinas, guiding the final scar-placement. The oak’s tapestry of grievances is not decorative; its grooves are the lock that demands Elias’s own scar as key. One minor slip: “jagged” repeats three times in two sentences, a micro-loop that dulls the final image a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Catacomb orchard is not postcard backdrop—roots tighten wrist, silver powder glows, bones rattle—each detail constrains the ritual action. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: damp earth + forgotten perfume mirrors Elian’s hunger for redemption. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body shifts. The final star-fruit is the required micro-setting object that charges closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quarry trailer vibrates under scheduled blasts, turning the setting itself into a bass drum that keeps time for Leo’s memory; this environmental percussion is later answered by the wind-whistle that closes the piece. Specific tools—tablet, Ziploc, gaffer tape memory—are handled, not listed. The grille cloth functions as micro-setting: its fray anchors two beats (discovery & renunciation) and constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy favors haptic and sonic detail over visuals, matching a sound man’s bias.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Magnetic arbor is more than postcard: metallic trees, zero-g soil, and humming fields actively enable the seed experiment and mirror the in-between state of transition. Sensory economy favors Maris’s translator eye—crystalline patterns, whispering light—details filtered through her epistemic hunger. The arbor’s force-field boundary recurs in the final image, now charged with new meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only minor slack: altitude effects (breathing, cold) invoked but never constrain her movement or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass-domed tidal atrium, rising water, and metallic gears are kinesthetic, constraining movement and timing of smelt ritual; wintersun light refracts through water onto ink, charging the final inscription image. Bamboo creel doubles as micro-setting, its contents (fish, relic metal) literally fed into crucible, tying librarian’s body to mechanism. Spatial choreography clean; no generic fantasy filler. The environment is not backdrop but engine—water level dictates when ritual must end, shaping pace and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Crystal caves act as both environment and psychological mirror—refractions echo the pearl’s glow and the residents’ fractured isolation; the final image of caves pulsing “in harmony with human hearts” recharges the opening refraction. Spatial choreography is crisp: flashlight beam, quartz nest, wire pedestal, flesh meeting flesh. Selective sensory economy (rainbows, hush, tongue-glow) keeps description lean yet atmospheric; no occupational over-exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ivy-choked station and rusted tracks mirror internal decay while the river’s gleam offers directional choice; environment actively steers Elias’s north/south decision. Sensory detail is selective—grit under nails, cold metal on knees—filtered through chronicler’s gaze. Accordion bellows functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act of release. Spatial choreography stays coherent across single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glowing library is rendered through selective synesthesia—books “breathing,” mist that “rolls inward like tides”—and functions as both macro-setting and micro-object (the watch/skin interface). Spatial choreography is dream-soft but coherent; distances collapse and re-expand rhythmically, mirroring the text’s pulse. Environment constrains movement: she can only step through temporal gaps the watch reveals, so setting directly shapes tactics. Final image of veil-adjustment is charged by the library’s dissolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet observatory, crystalline violin, and blooming Midnight Bloom function as micro-setting triad that literally constrain choice: only here can the violin be played open-air under a dome that refracts star-maps into coffee. Tactile specificity—“smooths the pages,” “molecular hum,” “petals etched with perforations”—roots the fantastic in sensory body. Selector economy: we never leave the dome/garden, so every described object can charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The skyborne grotto is no backdrop; its “radiant hush” compresses the mortician’s perception and literally guides her ritual pace. The obsidian slab’s coldness, the aurora’s shimmer on the chip, and the electromagnetic hiss inside the corpse fuse setting with tool. Without that auroral light the emerald could not refract, and without the grotto’s isolation the memory could not be isolated. Environment directly enables the closure image—setting-as-instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Umbral grotto, crystalline floor, Sentinel bark, and cloud-filtered light are filtered through caretaker’s ritual attention; the hairpin functions as micro-setting that constrains her choices and charges the final image—environment and object together anchor the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse, dawn surf, and wind trajectory are precisely tracked; the lantern room’s spatial choreography stays consistent. The shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV: Elian notices wind direction and tonal texture, not tourist vistas. Environment directly supplies the tools (chimes, levers) that enable the resolution, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The magnetic grotto operates as both environment and tool: its starlight-infused water *pulls* bodies and attention, directly enabling the final vanish/appear beat. Micro-setting (the floating rock platform) constrains movement—Elara must step *off* it to complete her transformation—so the setting is not backdrop but lever. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: Elara notices tactile stone edges and reflected star distortions, never tourist-catalog sky. Spatial choreography is pristine; bodies track from platform to knee-deep water without impossible drift. Final image reuses the pond surface as mirror *and* gateway, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bone towers and dust function as micro-setting: their hollow acoustics constrain Kael’s method and charge the final flip from bars to chambers. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—vibration before sight. Spatial choreography is stable; the canyon edge and tower base remain anchored. The setting’s reclassification is indispensable to closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is not backdrop but tool: the railing’s freezing metal forces gloved fingers, the cloud-mist becomes the literal road he walks. Keystone and luminance function as micro-settings that constrain every move. Final golden haze charging the summit air supplies the 9+ gate “object that charges the image.” Minor over-reliance on visual; a hiss of wind through harness buckles would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective sensory triage mirrors Orion’s tunnel vision: salt-cold darkness, rope’s luminous filament, tilted shelves—each item pressures the next action. The skeleton key functions as micro-setting, its metal teeth dictating the only path into the case. Forgotten library supplies the ritual props; no exposition dump. Final image of amber gull-streaks recharges earlier lantern-gold, satisfying 9+ gate. One dock-to-ocean transition is clean; spatial choreography never drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ambered observatory deck is sketched with restraint—thin atmosphere, dwindling photons, console—but its materiality matters: the amber surface preserves the engraved pattern that survives reset. Coins double as micro-setting; their metallic voices give tactile culture to an otherwise abstract void. Sensory range is narrow (mostly sight and sound), yet selection mirrors the POV’s cerebral focus, keeping description purposeful and brief. Environment never blocks or complicates action, but the final image of atoms in the cosmic background charges the closure, meeting the 9- gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked bronze dome and fractured light are not backdrop; they supply the literal method (scattered prisms) that crystallizes the monsters and charges the final image. The atlas page operates as micro-setting—its sea monsters constrain every naming choice and then re-emerge as the closure object. Spatial choreography is immaculate: page → pedestal → light → crystal. Weather (dusk → night) tracks emotional cooling after the final star-pierced release.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sapphire viaduct at dawn is not postcard scenery; its crystalline arches refract light that Kael literally uses—he watches the drips on its surface and the glassy structure later answers with resonance. The dry riverbed and cracked bell provide micro-setting objects whose physical states (fissure, drip speed, bronze silence) constrain every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is clean: kneeling, pouring, stepping back all track believably. One missed opportunity: the “thousand fractured rainbows” could have tightened to a single color shift that mirrors the final note, but the setting still charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The reservoir-as-mirror, the gravel’s “dusty hush,” the sapphire label glowing at dusk—each sensory hit is filtered through the warden’s vigilance and memory, never touristic. Micro-setting triumph: the flask and photographs function as portable landmarks that constrain where he walks and what he relinquishs. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track boots, hand, wall, waterline, final placement. Environment charges the final image—the silence after the chime is the setting speaking back.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and sap-scented ozone are filtered through Elara’s instrumental gaze; light fractures are read for data, not scenery. The crystal’s “impossible warmth” functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture—she must handle it despite unknowable risk. Spatial choreography is clean; moss stones and lens angles track. Environment actively modulates the experiment rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor-as-micro-setting constrains every choice: branch width dictates stance, bark spiral governs hand-route, altitude imposes hypoxic cognition. Parachute buckle functions as portable setting fragment, its chill and heft resetting attention whenever panic looms. Final image charges the buckle once more, penduluming against open sky—environmental cost made visible. Cloud-sea and insect-wing applause are filtered through altitude-addled perception, never tourist postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Floating rock and void function as micro-setting: edge-drop constrains foot placement, jar pedestal anchors fight geometry. Sensory triage under crisis—cold feet, slosh of “dead sea,” warm glass—filters through Kael’s survival priorities. History-rewind is shown via star realignment, not told. Environment does not charge final image as tightly as jar itself, capping at 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop-brook micro-setting is tactile and selective—dim lamp, ceramic dish, storm-washed air—each detail filtered through Elias’s puzzle-logic. The corpse-flower seed itself functions as environment-in-miniature, constraining every attempt at analysis; its spiral etching and bio-electric field charge the final image with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel’s concrete ribs, blower vibration, and silt fog are tactile constraints that shape how hard he can lean, how long he can endure. Micro-setting triumph: the pull cord handle, slick with sweat, becomes a sensory metronome of stamina. Spatial choreography is immaculate; motes swirl in a vortex whose geometry is traced by the nozzle’s angle. The house interior at the end is deliberately under-described, allowing the laughter-light to colonize blank space—an intentional inversion that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen garden isn’t backdrop; its crystalline flowers and shifting mist physically embody the “boundaries of light” concept and constrain Sylvan’s acceptance of ambiguity. Micro-setting triumph: the pendant drapes “like ivy over a frozen rosebud,” integrating object into living environment. Sensory triangulation—sound of frost, scent of ozone—anchors the library-as-idea without exposition. Final image of bending light in mist is inseparable from the earned reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Micro-setting—the crucible and ember nexus—constrains every move: proximity to heat dictates timing of shard placements, while dying light color-changes signal approximation success. Tool-as-setting (the crozier) physically curves the space Elias occupies, its evolving weight shifting his stance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: alchemist notices molecular shimmer before smell, ignores decorative cathedral echoes. Final image of reborn ember-light reflecting in his eyes charges the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lattice-work tower, yawning gorge, copper receiver, lunar perigee—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s engineer-poet gaze. The Hollywood fragment’s “residual fame” warmth and the tower’s groaning steel mirror his internal shift. Spatial choreography holds as he moves from console to edge; the gorge and moon constrain mood, not tactical choice, so micro-setting qualifies. Final image of fragment in pocket recharges earlier motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Starlit crystalline grotto, brass railings, and prismatic refractions are tactile and filtered through Elijah’s polish-rag attention. The ferry itself becomes micro-setting—its shudder under merger forces Elijah’s final tuning. Hourglass moves from empty to bi-directional sand, charging the closure image. Spatial track stays clean across dematerialization beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery is not backdrop but instrument: the impossible angles, gray corridor, and snake-like stairs are tested, knotted, and finally ruptured by the protagonist. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Siran’s professional eye—he notices grain of wood, hum of fiber, scent of ozone—so detail never feels touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless: thread tightens, walls tremble, corridor collapses in sequence we can track. Micro-setting exception met: the sinew thread itself functions as the handled “environment” that constrains every tactical choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selection is ruthless: only the pressure seal click, the viewport glow, the link’s pitted iron, and the coral-star echo reach the page. Each detail does double duty—tool, body, atmosphere—while the holo-projector turns the dome into a micro-setting that constrains pedagogy. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible moves. Anchor-chain as micro-setting charges the final image; meets 9+ gate but slight over-prettiness in “luminous spires” keeps it just shy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mist-clad atrium supplies atmospheric membrane and temporal boundary (“when the dead called”), but it never constrains Aria’s actions or tools; any quiet outdoor spot would serve. Sensory selection favors haze and hush, reinforcing twilight liminality, yet the space remains a decorative backdrop rather than an active obstacle or resource. Micro-setting inside the music box finally matters, but the atrium itself stays ornamental. Strong tonal consistency keeps the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Facility corridors, serpentine cables, and water “thicker than it should be” are tactile and POV-filtered; body-as-setting (claustrophobic lungs vs. pressure-emptiness) directly constrains the climax—only by abandoning corporeal boundaries can she survive. Gold fleck operates as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its glow charting spatial and ontological thresholds. Final image reuses “crushing hush” but reweights it: pressure becomes weightless vigil, environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Opal façade shimmering like “captured dawn” and ink puddling in star-carved grooves are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered. Snow acts as acoustic blanket, forcing inward attention; the observatory dome’s fracture line is felt in the cold draft that ghosts his neck. Porcelain shard functions as micro-setting—handled twice, charges final image. Environment constrains: isolation, silence, and the ink’s refusal to fix a pattern force their joint surrender to ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bone towers, copper veins, and flawed diamond are not backdrops but instruments: Kaelen’s palms map bone ridges to sound, the diamond’s spiral tunnels echoes, bird flights rewrite grammar. Every sensory pick is used to constrain or enable the next tactical micro-move; canyon itself is the tuning chamber that makes translation possible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underground garden is tactile and selective: damp earth, crushed mint, floating bioluminal mushrooms—each detail either pressures Elias (he kneels, fingers cut) or mirrors the Jester’s anti-gravity motif. The arrowhead’s ancient/new duality and the cordless phone’s eye-metamorphosis anchor the surreal rules without exposition dump. Spatial choreography stays clean; distances and props track across beats. The setting directly charges the final image (Lyra reaching toward mushrooms), satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory triangulation—bow-screw click swallowed by void, locust shell warming ribs, sunrise petals cracking glass—grounds the fantastical in tactile POV. The sky-bridge itself (a recurring object of light and tension) constrains her last stance and is re-imaged as “strings of light” in the coda, satisfying 9+ micro-setting test. Statue geography stays coherent; stone eyes enforce silence that she pierces with sound.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt arcade, neon ghosts, drone apex angle—selective, urgent, never catalogue. The mailbag’s weight and the wax-sealed bottle serve as micro-settings that literally constrain hand movement and timing; bottle-EMP failure risk is felt in knuckle tension. Final image of deepening twilight and faltering neon recharges the opening palette, locking external atmosphere to internal absence. Meets 9+ gate for environment-tool that charges closure; capped at 8.1 because spatial choreography of the shuttle deck is skimmed—reader infers rather than sees the hidden compartment latch.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The warped door’s metallic groan, the crystalline case catching sunset, and the wind-bell cadence create a tactile, sound-rich environment that filters through Elian’s carpenter gaze. Every descriptive stroke is routed through his tool-trained attention—wood grain, metal fatigue, light refraction—so setting doubles as character perception. The halo fragment itself functions as micro-setting that ultimately constrains the choice to sing. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating objects or impossible distances.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Scientific poetry library is more than postcard: shelves stretch “like taffy,” titles are audible equations, dust records theorems—environment actively warps and guides her path. The scarf operates as micro-setting/tool: its fray, hum, and eventual silk-bridge constrain every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy tracks her curator gaze—smell of old paper, taste of ionized dust—never tourist list. Final image of walls “breathing” recharges the opening dust motes, fulfilling the 9+ gate that setting must charge the last beat.

    Setting is the story’s engine: tide-worn shelves, lantern-fractured gold, sunrise hues on a palette that literally constrains the librarian’s actions. “Whispering archipelago” is never mapped, yet its sighs, mangroves, and gull-cries pressure the ritual. Micro-setting (palette-as-tool) charges the final image; environment, body, and object are inseparable. Proper-noun economy is perfect—no place names wasted.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shadowed nexus is not backdrop but tool: its mutable geometry actively resists the locksmith, forcing him to double the hum. Starlight, lavender scent, and the ribbon’s color-shift micro-track spatial/emotional states. “Gap between worlds” is anchored by tactile cues—cool silk, thrum in air—avoiding white-room syndrome. Final image of grey ribbon on bench recharges the opening sunset hue, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse dome and wreck-mast shadows are returned to twice, each time reframing tactical options (how light hits glass dictates which rune she sketches). Mineral crust and sea-spray residue are tactile constraints on fingertip and notebook. Spatial choreography stays crisp—boots on gravel, knees at rim, thermos set down—so the body functions as micro-setting. Final image of “decades folding” is charged by the same water surface introduced in para 1.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The forgotten library functions as micro-setting: dust-thick air and shard-mirror walls constrain movement and literally multiply every choice into visible shards. Selective sensory economy—only visual dust and haptic glass—keeps the density high without checklist sprawl. Spatial choreography stays coherent as bodies orbit the glass table; the final image of merging reflections reuses the setting as closure charge. Missing smell/temperature detail is forgivable at this length, but the environment never physically impedes a tactic, capping just below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Waterfall, mist, ironwood root, and seed hollow function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the root’s cavity is the only gateway, the spray supplies refracted light later harvested. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elianor’s vocation—she reads scent of petrichor, sap stain, shifting hues—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, palms flat, hover hands, release; bodies never float. Final image recharges the “radiant hush” first established in paragraph one, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prism sanctuary operates as micro-setting: every refracted beam constrains visibility and stages the spirits’ anchoring. Fisherman’s net, tapestry needle, and crystal facets are handled, not catalogued; their tactile states alter choices (darkening needle warns of intentional concealment). Starlight spectrum evolves from scattered rainbow to grounding anchor—environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies orbit, distances tracked, no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rain-scoured vault, fresco tears, and meteorite grit are tactile and bias-filtered through Elias’s map-framer eye; the vault’s curvature literally guides his body placement and ritual, and the final image of dawn light on wet stone recharges the earlier rust-tears motif. Meets the 9+ gate: the setting itself (vault + map + meteorite mixture) constrains the final ritual and charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken library is more than postcard: the waterlogged encyclopedias and reinforced portholes constrain movement and supply the only archive Elias can mine. Micro-setting inside the snow globe mirrors the macro pressure and is handled twice, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects remain trackable. Environment never slips into static décor; it literally weighs on every breath.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Misty courtyard above clouds acts as micro-setting: altitude limits retreat, storm light supplies strobe for alignment, wall texture guides graffiti angles. Spatial choreography remains coherent—brush, plate, pouch tracked across lightning beats. Final image of hidden mural relies on place-specific concealment, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ice-spire elevator grants an automatic crucible: crystalline walls, rising cold, thinning air. Selective sensory cues (sunbeam scatter, fogged breath) integrate with the goggles’ optic trick, so the setting materially enables decryption. Luxury chambers at the end are only named, not felt, preventing the environment from charging closure; still, the micro-setting suffices for mid-length stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Brass telescope functions as micro-setting: its cold weight against cheek, fogged lens at end, constrains attention and literally frames the sky-cable scar. Gondola’s sway and wind hum are filtered through aviation-meteorologist POV—professional cloud lore narrows perception to emotional shapes, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hollowed tree-trunk library is tactile, odor-rich, and fractally mapped; its grooves “stretch into infinity,” charging the final sky-fractal. Spatial choreography is flawless—floorboard, safe, lenses, ceiling—every move tracked. The demolition roar grows from distant to imminent, tightening the clock. The coin’s indentations function as micro-setting, aligning wood grain to hidden latch, so environment literally shapes Elias’s next move.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The antique airship is not postcard scenery: its “faith and rusting gears” cradle the breakthrough, its rocking deck forces Elias to steady hand and paper, tethering observation to bodily risk. Micro-setting object—the hopscotch board—literally constrains his knees, lenses, and final map. Starling murmurations evolve from backdrop to navigational instrument, charging the final image under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Frozen library above clouds” is immediate, tactile, and governs access (icy floor, fogged breath). Mirrors act as both setting and antagonist—distort gear reflections, force stance crystallization—meeting the 9+ gate. Selective sensory economy avoids tourist catalog; only visual and thermal details that pressure motion are kept.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting specificity is the story’s chief pleasure: bioluminescent butterflies pulsing in sync with a hovering brass bell is tactile and stakes the planet’s atmospheric engine. The floating rock arches function as both landmark and mnemonic grid for the nebula-pattern hunt, constraining movement and mapping. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (chiming) and light (glow, chalk at dawn) over visual inventory, mirroring the settlers’ nightly pilgrimages. Only the orchard itself stays off-page—no blossom scent or fruit—so the “orchard planet” tag feels nominal; the cap is 8.1 not 8.8 because the environment enters the final image but does not reconfigure tactics—caretaking is already secured.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse staircase, lantern room gears, and crystalline pane are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through the adjuster’s professional eye. Nested patterns spiral “along the walls,” merging setting with conceptual rule-system, and the pane materially guides the climax: only its surface can carry the song outward. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (grooved spiral) and sound (lullaby) under crisis, matching urgency. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves—so the hidden lighthouse meets the 9+ gate by constraining the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orchard-light, mechanical-bird acoustics, and frost-crystal visuals are selective and POV-filtered; the cliff-labyrinth geography stays coherent and literally channels the traveler’s escape, while the frost-line micro-setting tightens the final ticking cost, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Braided ravine, foam islands, and chrysalis shell are rendered through polymer-chemist perception—chromatography analogy is POV-specific. The micro-setting (pocketed chrysalis) is carried forward and literally charges the final image when she palms it in the lab. Weather/terrain affect pacing: moss-slick stones keep her kneeling long enough to watch foam long enough to spark insight. Spatial choreography clean; no credibility errors.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glass orchard library, bottled moonlight, and swirling clouds are never static backdrop; they literally supply Elias’s tools and moral economy. The crystalline floor and humming books constrain choreography—every footstep is silent, every gaze refracted. Sensory economy is tight: light is liquid, memory is sliver, absence is measured. Final image of “constellation of lost chances” reweights the setting itself as archive, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Desert fortress after rain functions as both macro and micro setting: the weeping stones mirror Kael’s brittle façade, the tidal pools literally open the path to the pavilion. Coral pavilion is rendered in bioluminescent specificity, columns of crystallized regret that constrain the final absorption beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s chef-perception—salt, frost, texture—never a tourist catalogue. The impossible hexagonal ripple is a recurring object that directly gates the descent; environment constrains every tactical move. Final image reuses setting: dawn baking the ramparts echoes the opening, now re-weighted by internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astronomical clock tower is not postcard scenery: its spiral staircase, celestial dials, and pendular guts constrain how she calibrates frequency and physically swing the cuckoo weight. Starlight “borrowed” through clock-faces becomes the sole illumination that shapes her hush-voiced vigil, tightening atmosphere to match baritone hush. Micro-setting (weight, brass horn, sheets) is handled, not catalogued. Environment directly governs the broadcast’s technical success, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Canyon, moonlight, and scattered neuro-gear are economically interwoven with action; rock becomes “shimmering veils,” equipment placement follows “mathematical elegance.” The broken periscope mirror recurs as a micro-setting/object that informs the conceptual closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory palette is selective (silver light, tremor of mirror) and stays filtered through Elara’s engineer-brain, never halting momentum for tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selective, POV-filtered detail—ancient vellum, clandestine blue glow, mist that “whispered in languages that predated human speech”—anchors each move. The serpentine grotto breathes with geologic rhythm and constrains her path width, air density, and crystal access. The magnetic boxes drifting in restored gravity serve as micro-setting that charges the final image. No orientation lapses; spatial choreography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grove functions as micro-setting: proximity dictates choice—she kneels because the sculpture sits “at the grove’s heart,” and the floor vibrates, a tactile constraint. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices cracks before leaf colour. Weather is absent but not missed; silence itself is the environmental pressure. Porcelain insulator recurs as handled object, its smoothness contra the gnarled wood, charging the final image when still warm.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Magnetic nexus is sketched through vibration and lavender dusk, never catalogued; the stone rotates as micro-setting, constraining the final placement choice. Sensory economy favors touch and twilight color over visual sprawls. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Elias lowers the stone to echo a star. For 9+ gate: the stone’s dent literally guides the closing gesture—qualifies as tool charging final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The starlit workshop is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic isolation is the reason Silen can attempt frequency unlocking at all. Micro-setting objects—oscilloscope, tuning forks, espionage microphones—are handled tactilely in every beat, their states tracked (lights dim, green line pulses, candles flicker). The final firework flash is environmental feedback that instantly re-prices the sacred silence just achieved. One minor slip: “shadowed workshop under stars” is repeated almost verbatim; still, the setting constrains and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Treetop village is sketched with swift, tactile anchors (rope ladder, branch foundations, misty canopy) that constrain movement and social fabric. Corpse-flower scent acts as micro-setting, invading lungs and dictating tempo of dawn gathering. Wrapping-paper interiors function as portable setting-object hybrid, charging final image when scattered across porch. Environmental detail never stalls beats; each mention seeds later communal use.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and bioluminescent flora are sketched with economy yet continually guide piloting choices; the arrow-embedded boulder doubles as micro-setting that hosts the decisive extraction. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s profession—she notices hull vibrations and water vectors before visual spectacle. Final tree with scarred bark is re-weighted by arrow’s containment glow, nudging the 9+ gate; still, one more tactile interaction with the environment mid-scene would have clinched it.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Container labyrinth actively directs wind vectors that enable the dispersal mechanism; steel canyon functions as micro-setting that constrains sensor placement and discovery beat. Sodium lamplight, salt scent, and corrugated palette are filtered through investigator POV, guiding attention to meteorological anomalies. Environment charges the final image: silent monoliths bear witness, reweighting the port from workplace to crime scene. Tool-as-setting (surveillance kit) is handled tactilely and its readings drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ice cavern, body, aurora, and amber sheet function as one composite instrument; their refractive interplay literally shapes the harmonic method that unfetters wonder, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp—apex fissures, crystalline vaults, floor-lit honey-glow—tracking bell ringer’s stance and sheet angle. Weather (auroral bleed) is causal conduit, not backdrop. Selective detail favors optic/aural synesthesia, but the narrow palette is purposeful, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thunder-echo range is more than backdrop: its silence and echo chamber literally enable the flute’s boundary-fraying resonance. Driftwood markers, spires, and wounded-spirit winds are tactile, POV-filtered, and guide the return path—environment constrains tactics. The gilded reed flute itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight; canyon hush is heard/felt rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    The topaz workshop, letterpress chase, and crystalline fragment function as micro-setting: the fragment’s geometry fractures lamplight and later dissolves into Silas’s skin, directly enabling the final reconfiguration. Star-field ceiling supplies live clock and stakes scale. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the “return address shifted” line feels disembodied, not actionable.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and pendant function as micro-settings that constrain attention and supply the magic’s logic; the sky’s color-shift and the pendant’s warming hum charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-slanted: the courier notices strap tension, wing-vein texture, and snow-hare eyes in tight, nervous saccades. Weather and light evolve with the beats, never static; the setting’s shimmer mirrors internal flux without overt symbol-tagging.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz arbor functions as micro-setting: crystalline supports literally vibrate under Elias’s touch, constraining his barefoot grounding and amplifying sensory input. Mist and frost are not backdrop but active media—mist clings “like a shroud,” frost patterns are the canvas for communion. Car window becomes the pivotal environment-in-miniature; its fern-ice is handled, thawed, and re-weighted. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile > visual, matching mystic’s priorities. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography holds from arbor to hood-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting dominates: the loom, bead, and puzzle edges literally gate the cosmic crossing. Bamboo forest is sketched with swinging density—rustling absorbed, mist dissolving—then re-anchored at return. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s urgent narrow focus: sound drops out, touch (warm bead, sliced finger) escalates. Spatial choreography stays clean throughout the weave/collapse cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock arches are not postcard scenery—they actively pressure Elias’s life and later literalize his goal of “coaxing resilience from rubble.” The orchard planet’s violet sky and crumbling geography are filtered through his blacksmith-eye for weight and structure, not tourist catalog. Micro-setting inside the mine is lived-in: phosphorescent lichens replace torchlight, spatial choreography tracks cleanly as fragments lift. Environment constrains the final image: the reborn arch rises against that same violet sky, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The repair bay’s rust-eaten textures, ozone tang, and ghost-machinery hum are filtered through Kael’s synesthetic bias, constraining his paths (“narrowed perception to immediacies”). The gleaming past version is rendered in economical, contrasting strokes. Spatial choreography is clean: workbench → spanner → shard → collapse. While the bay itself does not charge the final image (the shard and the file do), its atmospheric weight supplies the “before” that the log reframes, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sea-spray scent of ink, spiral stair torque, cold lamp glass: sensory detail is filtered through Jonah’s seafarer gaze, never touristic. The lantern room functions as micro-setting—its cold ghost-pressure hastens his need to relight and thus to “bottle safety.” Spatial choreography is clean; stones, crate, envelope, and tiller all track. Environment does not merely echo mood; it constrains the only possible response (silent signal), satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.7)
    “Emerald lighthouse,” “glass lantern wick,” and star-shadow choreography are sensuous and specific; the beacon-as-metronome image anchors time. The setting constrains no choice—Kaelen could be anywhere with a lamp—so the 9+ gate fails. Still, the tactile glass-light manipulations supply immersive texture that feeds the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating tea-house, crystal prism, dye vats, and valley-mist are filtered through Elian’s artisan eye; each object constrains gesture (sunbeam tracking on floorboards) and charges the final image—no postcard filler, every detail bends light or attention.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory detail—metal clink, bronze gleam, rain-lash—grounds every new shard without tourist-catalog excess. The sextant itself functions as micro-setting, constraining every action; the stormlit tower supplies the final charged image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across shards. For 9.0 the tower would need to push back physically (wind almost wrenching the sextant, etc.); as is, environment enriches but does not endanger.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mica window functions as micro-setting: constrains keeper’s posture, focuses light-beam, captures final star-map. Alchemical orchard’s phosphorescent bark and perpetual-night cold supply immediate sensory stakes; greenhouse walls breathe with song-vibration. Space tracks cleanly—no impossible distances or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Library, invitation, and moonlight are not backdrop—they constrain action (locked compartments, midnight deadline). The crumpled invitation’s creases mirror her internal folds, recharged when she pockets it at exit. Dust motes vs. her stillness is a tight environmental metaphor that charges the final image. Spatial choreography flawless; no white-room. Micro-setting (cardigan pocket) hosts the charged object. Meets 9- gate: environment shapes exit ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tea-house balustrade, moss, yew hedge, barren soil—each detail is handled, not catalogued, and constrains her planting action. The bread’s crust-as-map is a micro-setting object that charges the final image when shared. Sensory hierarchy obeys her priorities: damp earth, phantom yeast, faint chirp. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule drift.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frozen library is no postcard: breath-crystals form usable time-markers, brass apparatus cools skin, mists outside press solitude. Micro-setting rule satisfied—lantern slide constrains every choice; its glass warms or dims in direct response to her probe. One minor over-lux repetition (“crystalline air” twice) does not dull final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rotting pier, lantern glint, canvas walls—selective sensory hits create lived-in smuggler warren without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: she slips “behind Silas’s tent,” canvas pressed, retreat route legible. Weather and geography stay consistent; no physics stumbles. The antique fob is the only object that constrains choice (activates recorder), satisfying 9+ gate; environment itself does not tighten tactics, so capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lavender bluff, aurora, and tin ring function as micro-setting that actively channels choice: the bluff’s edge forces slow foot-placement, the aurora’s pulse times the emotional crescendo, the ring’s warmth dictates direction. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—Elara notices flavor shifts before visual details—keeping description from becoming tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: ring hand, cliff edge, root-clicking below tracked without drift. Environment charges the final image when aurora light merges with their skins, making the sky an active agent in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystal cave is not backdrop but tool: light refraction narrows his perception to the wall, the jagged frame cuts his fingers, and the final glow reconfigures the “tears frozen in time” into wings. Micro-setting (the painting’s bronze frame, the splintered lock) constrains every pry and touch. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—only visual glare and gritty charcoal matter until the cathartic release widens to color. One tiny over-description: “auroral sorrow” is repeated twice, else flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Greenhouse city, toxic sky, dried oasis, and pressurized postal tubes are sketched with selective sensory strokes (“iridescent dust,” “zinc-etched”) that feed choices (map route, message tubes). Body-as-setting works: her wilting skin is the immediate environment that constrains secrecy. Spatial choreography clear in the under-floorboard extraction and hub crawl. No single prop or environment charges the final image enough for 9+ gate; the setting informs but does not crystallize the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bluff, pendulums, and iceberg fragment form a micro-setting that literally constrains choice: the tuner must calibrate sculptures because the altitude and cold forbid spoken commands. Copper lever, ground-mineral pigments, and ozone scent are tactile, lived-in tools. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the fragment tilts, prism strikes stone, droplets enter basin—every prop’s state change tracks. The final sky “painted with the hues of wonder” mirrors released pigment, closing the environmental loop.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glass dome, cultivation tank, and combustion chamber are specific tools that constrain tactics; the dome’s crack at closure literalizes cost. Sensory detail is selective—iridescent shimmer of fear-box, petal edges “like pages burning”—and filtered through android perception prioritizing magnetic fields. Spatial choreography stays coherent as L-734 moves from tank to chamber to exit. Environment mirrors internal static without overt symbolism overload.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    “Vibrant mosaic tiles” and “sandstorm calm” are vivid but decorative; no spatial constraint ever narrows Elias’s options. The courtyard returns as a postcard backdrop for the finale rather than a tool that shapes tactics. Micro-setting (the locket’s weight against skin) does charge the closing image, just clearing the 9+ gate, yet the cap holds because the environment never actively complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Underwater lab is vividly tactile: visor weight, water drag on sleeves, glowing dice refracted; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from air-lock to central console to emergency exit. Computer’s spider-web HUD and phoenix icon evolve from decoration to tactical clock to victory sigil, charging the final image. Micro-setting of the dice in her gloved palm satisfies 9+ gate—object state alters tactics when symbols align. A hairline slip: “hours later” surfacing compresses decompression physics, but deviation is undeclared and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Misty harbor, salt-crystal walls, and lantern-refracted light are filtered through Elara’s practiced eye—selective, urgent. The chamber’s “gleaming silence” is micro-setting that actively amplifies retrieval; crystals act as lenses, constraining her ritual. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → northern pier → institute corridor → chamber center. Weather and tide are implicit but guide gravity anomalies without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The brook, moonlit paper wing, and hush itself function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the site is chosen for its last thread of sound. Spatial choreography is clean—the summoner kneels, unfolds, presses thumb, rises; props stay tracked. Sensory hierarchy favors hush over sight, fitting the abstract stake. The “terrestrially cosmic” scale is asserted more than tactilely felt, keeping it below the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rooftop garden is more than postcard: the jasmine’s night-bloom scent narrows attention to the seal, the meteor streaks mirror the wax-silver griffin, and the bricks’ whisper is physically accessed via the seal’s pressure. Micro-setting wins: the seal itself functions as the story’s “room,” its grooves and warmth guiding the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean—spectacles, pastry plate, meteor angles tracked. Only the indoor walls’ sudden softness drifts toward overt symbolism, preventing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Garden is handled as tactile instrument, not postcard: crystals must be spaced among midnight-blue roses whose petals literally tremble in sympathy with memory waves, constraining placement and timing. Dew, velvet petals, and pearlescent shell catch starlight to create micro-setting that charges final dawn image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stone bench to grid perimeter to center. Moisture on leaves reappears as dew on Elenas feet, tying body to ground. World rules (sound = memory interface via calcium chambers) stay consistent without expo-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble sanctuary under shifting aurora is not backdrop: the cold seeps into her knees, the acoustics swallow weeping, the pearl twilight times her final burnish. Stalactite drips serve as diegetic clock, tightening the beat. The heritage thorn functions as micro-setting—handled, bloodied, recharged at closure. Only the undercroft line drifts into generic “forgotten” shorthand; a single sensory cue there would have hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    The serpentine nexus is not postcard scenery; its stone throat literally catches starlight and conducts dissent, constraining Kaelen’s tactic—he must sing here or nowhere. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-edge-sing-stand-turn, each move tracked against canyon wind channels. The shell’s cool spiral and the Spire’s flicker serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Weather (wind) affects action continuously, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glacial shrine, diesel-salt scent, and the warped glass globe constrain action (she can’t leave without re-entering cold, can’t read ghosts without the globe). The globe’s “fractures” literalize her perceptual filter—setting doubles as perceptual apparatus. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: professional wreck-diver notices hull fracture patterns before metaphors. Final image of “starlight borrowed and returned” crystallizes environment into thematic mirror without overt symbol-mongering.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The whispering parapet, rain-slick stones, and abandoned workshop are filtered through a net-mender’s gaze—she notes warp, weft, tension. The bamboo whisk is handled twice and finally placed on the loom, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean: parapet → ivy arch → cobble lanes → workshop. No object teleporting; the city stays dark and wet until dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The radioactive orchard is rendered through selective sensory filtration—fruit hues against “perpetually hazed” sky, clean air inside the pavilion—so setting constrains choice (removing hood). Micro-setting rule qualifies: the diamond on obsidian acts as a charged object that reconfigures meaning in the last beat. Spatial anchors (gates, cabin floorboards, pedestal) track cleanly; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stormlit observatory is tactile: cobalt glass trembles under lightning, vacuum tubes glow amber, rain patterns shift. Micro-setting of the radio bench constrains the final act of retuning. Spatial choreography clean—no floating bodies. Weather directly shapes choice: clearing storm signals moment to leave. Final image reweights the cobalt glass from isolation to abandoned relic.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a character: sand-weathered boards breathe “lonesome splendor,” jars clink like wind-chimes, the loft’s low ceiling forces crouched ritual. Micro-setting (corner where he sleeps) literally births the inciting object. The dunes and train-whistle return in the final image, charging the closure with sonic echo. No spatial drift; every object—from jar to music-box—tracks physically across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drift-ice marina is never a postcard: shards hum, boots crunch, key bites palm, and the lighthouse artifact answers back. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—engineer notices vibration first, color second. The setting directly enables the climax: the ice acts as resonant medium for the sonic absolution, so environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Micro-setting (gloved hand, crypt key, coat shimmer) repeatedly intersects with macro-setting to keep the world tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain every move; tools (portable instruments, ice underfoot) function as micro-setting. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s horizon-mapping eye. The viaduct’s metallic after-rain gleam returns to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tunnel walls, rusted panel, grime-smudged glass, and swinging lantern create a micro-setting that literally constrains movement and supplies investigative tools. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: smell of oil, metallic cool, echo of father’s voice crowd out extraneous detail. Weather’s post-drought dampness is not postcard but causal—moisture enables graffiti reveal. Spatial choreography is clean: she kneels, stands, steps forward; lantern swing tracked continuously. The lantern itself fulfills the micro-setting clause: its charged final image could not occur without its prior physical handling.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    The antique shop is rendered through selective, POV-filtered sense shards: creaky boards, metal-shavings sweetness, dust motes in a shaft of light. These micro-details constrain attention—Elias notices only what might hide a trigger—so setting doubles as investigative tool. The slit in crystal and the photosensitive trigger are anchored in tangible optics, grounding the climax. While the broader city or season is absent, the music-box repair bench functions as the entire world, and its “vibrant hush” sonic layer reappears in the repaired box’s tick, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Brass-inlaid floorboards,” “sapphire eyes,” and “acid sea lapping” render the floating workshop in tight, sense-specific strokes. The kaleidoscope doubles as micro-setting that physically constrains the viewing act and thereby the plot. Spatial choreography stays clean as Zephyr pivots, extends, detaches. Environment does not yet force a tactical sacrifice, so 9-band gate remains unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Archive’s low thrumming and the “echo of forgotten songs” give a tactile acoustic set; the micro-setting inside a defunct music algorithm is a fresh, choice-limiting arena. Spatial clarity wobbles once—“across the echo of forgotten songs” is lyrical but blurs physical locale.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lighthouse orchard, spiral crystal trees, and groaning ice floes are rendered through Shael’s selective perception; the recurring crystal fragment and vintage mirrors constrain every tactical move and charge the final reconfiguration. Sensory economy favors haptic/reflective detail over visual catalog, sustaining momentum while rooting the fantastical in lived tactility.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drift-ice marina is filtered through Arthur’s alienated senses—salt, diesel, slush under boots—guiding his attention toward micro-surrenders. The heirloom parasol operates as micro-setting, its ivory tip constraining his thumb and reframing scale from collective wreck to singular endurance. Weather and buckled harbor affect salvage choices; spatial choreography clean. Final image reuses the warmed object to reweight meaning, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amber glass, russet vines, and the drifting letter provide tactile anchors that mirror emotional temperature. Pavilion and vineyard constrain proximity, forcing the couple into shared physical space. Sensory selection stays tight to POV-filtered attention; no static postcarding. Environment does not yet constrain a final tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pavilion, silk floors, grinding gears, crystalline ground—each sensory layer is filtered through the walker’s peripheral awareness and narrows to immediacies under pressure. The micro-setting of the half-mask itself becomes a tactile constraint, cracked surface catching final light. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects never ghost. One notch from 9 only because the dunes’ exterior geography stays vague, but that vagueness does not impede choice or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lavender/metal mingled scent, the scavenged lightbox, and the dove-gray case are re-used, handled, and finally abandoned, so every key object constrains or charges the closure. Spatial choreography is crisp: case at feet, projection on wall, field leaning in. Factory ruins stay offstage but function as screen and metaphor, satisfying the micro-setting gate. No orientation debt; all anchors land within 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal operates as micro-setting; its cool facets and internal luminescence constrain his final choice to cradle rather than dissect. Library’s “heights lost in suspended hush” mirrors interior state, charging the final image. Dawn light evolves from “first light finger the spines” to “deepening dawn,” tracking time without exposition. Spatial choreography clean: palm on glass → table → podium → clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog sculpture garden is not backdrop; the moisture threatens the chalk’s survival, turning the medium itself into a clock. Driftwood splinters—chair legs, picture frames—carry mnemonic residue that guides the prophet’s trembling hand; the monolith of fused hoods delivers the palpable vibration that becomes the story’s objective correlative. One notch below 9.0 only because spatial choreography between the pipe and bike-wheel sculpture is briefly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The clock mechanism and biodome leaf serve as micro-settings that directly constrain choice; the silver dome and cloud-wreathed moon supply tactile, POV-filtered detail that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under tremor pressure: sound of leaf > visual of Earth brightening. Spatial choreography tracks Kael’s sprint to biodome and return without drift. Reaches 9+ gate: tool (clock) and environment (observatory orbit) jointly shape tactics and final stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hospice hovering “above the clouds” functions as micro-setting whose altitude isolates, making the shard-handling feel sacred; panoramic windows and cotton peaks stay tactile without tourist excess. The vinyl’s grooves, the clean medicinal scent, and morning-pink clouds each filter through Elijah’s musician/perceiver bias, guiding attention toward sound and aroma. Spatial choreography is exact: guitar case against palm, nurse stepping out, Elijah kneeling—no impossible positions. The environment does not merely backdrop but focuses choices, meeting the 9+ gate of constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal observatory functions as micro-setting: brass-edged lens, concentric floor rings, and automaton key constrain every move; she can’t act without interfacing with these objects. Eternal twilight and floating-isle altitude remain atmospheric backdrop, but spatial choreography inside the dome is exact—she kneels, slams console, key glows—so body-tool-environment triad is coherent. Sensory filtering is biased toward tactile metal and glowing amber, matching scholar POV. The final image—motes sinking into isle soil—recharges the setting by revealing the isle itself as prison, giving the locale conceptual cost. Meets 9+ gate: observatory/tools constrain tactics and color final image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tooth functions as micro-setting: its warmth and iridescence constrain Eleanor’s skepticism and charge the final surrender. Garden impossibilities (crystallizing leaves, starlight branches) are filtered through her forensic gaze, guiding the choice to yield. Spatial choreography under the willow is clean; sensory hierarchy reflects medical training. Environment directly shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grotto’s slick curves and jasmine scent constrain her ritual movements; the sea-glass itself functions as micro-setting whose transformation is tracked beat-by-beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys her watcher bias: visual touch, tactile polish, olfactory salt. Spatial choreography holds—kneel, lift, place—no floating props. Weather/moisture directly enable the mist-glow finale. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The moss-draped server racks constrain movement and metaphor—only narrow aisles allow approach, forcing the women into proximity. The amber pendant micro-setting acts as portable altar, its warmth contrasting the cold drips, charging the hand-off beat. Spatial choreography is clean: Elara traces racks → stops at console → turns to voice; Maya enters from behind, no impossible positions. Environment evolves—icicles actively thaw, droplets re-pattern the floor between glances, mirroring the “new code” closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The feral nexus remains a poetic constant, but its mist, dry-river logic, and cameo physics are taught early and rule-consistent. Shell functions as micro-setting: warmth, geometry, vibration constrain every collection beat. Sensory triage is biased to poet-sight (watercolor, pulsing orbs) yet stays purposeful. Spatial choreography is lightly tracked—no impossible placements—so environment serves symbolic pressure without logistical confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    The arbor is more than postcard: moon-lit leaf-thread, metallic cricket, and unfurling vine serve as micro-setting that literally channels song into bloom. Spatial choreography is faultless—Elias places the cricket where “moon’s light pooled,” and the vine responds at the same locus. Sensory economy favors glow, rust, and hush over broad visual catalog. Setting does not constrain tactical choice (no locked gate, no resource depletion) so it stops short of 9-band charge.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is a micro-laboratory: skeletal apple tree, cobalt glass shards, subarctic wind—all selected, never catalogued. Each object functions as tool or constraint: glass angles tune starlight; resin from the dying tree seals the map, making environment an active co-author. Spatial choreography is pristine; wind, cold, and twilight are not backdrop but collaborators that threaten the pour. This specificity charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marble acoustics are not backdrop but instrument: the north passage sings at noon, the western wall gathers children’s laughter, every surface calibrated to Elian’s peripheral ear. Light angles, crystal facets, and velvet box form a micro-setting chain that directly enables the harvest and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—sound first, light second—integrating setting into action without tourist catalog. One hairline slip: “frozen ripples in a timeless pond” edges toward postcard, but the cavern’s acoustic life quickly reclaims specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bronze grotto is tactilely alive: “metallic veins pulse like sleeping circuits,” the kerosene flame makes them “breathe,” and the starlight strikes a named vein. Spatial choreography is flawless—lamp placed at converging angles, body aligned to refracted starlight—and the micro-setting (lamp burner) literally charges the final image when it dims at the moment of transformation. Environment constrains every move; no postcard shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting: droplet-lens imagery returns at closure to refract the carved Tomas, charging the final poise. Loft’s rust-hued peace is filtered through Elara’s deliberate curation of grief, not décor tourism. Tool ash blank’s pale grain is tactile, smelled, shaved—constraints every cut. Spatial choreography clean: kettle, bench, window form a triangle she orbits once. Weather affects timing (rain slows, kettle cools) but never becomes pathetic fallacy. Meets 9+ gate: the skylight’s shifting light literally charges the final image, constraining how she sees/reads the carving.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kinetic lagoon is not backdrop but physics: tilting planes force Elias to crouch, sink, recalibrate balance. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting—its brittle teeth gauge his own wear, its final crumble cues the exit. Sensory hierarchy obeys scavenger bias: mirrored water first read as salvageable surface, then as threat when reflection shows “older, tired.” Spatial choreography is clean—boots sink, mist thins, horizon parts—no floating anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-setting lives in the brass sextant arc and the pipe’s etched veins—both constrain her blueprint and charge the final shimmer. Spatial choreography is flawless: concourse → hydroponics bay → central axis alignment → pocketed relic. Sensory economy favors rust, dust, and the metallic smell of memory; visual flicker of phantom departures sustains the ghost-theater tone. Environment evolves as water clears dust, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that literally channels sound; its post-rain vibration becomes the tool that forces his sonic transgression. Sensory economy is tight—only drip, hush, and glassy resonance are needed. Spatial choreography is clean: he “moves excruciatingly gently” to center pillar, hand to surface, vibration up arm. Weather evolution (rain→sunrise) mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Canal, skiff, pylons, silt, bruised-purple sky—all tactile, all filtering through Elias’s professional gaze. The sundial and waterlogged chest function as micro-setting objects that literally constrain tactics: no sun = no reading, chest size dictates single-man lift. Sensory hierarchy (cold, lapping, brass warmth) mirrors internal cooling then dawning clarity. Final image of “lessons” in the water relies on earned metaphorical shorthand; retains 8.7 because the water’s physical drag is still felt in the wrist.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Golden dock, snow, fog, and creaking planks compose a micro-setting that literally conducts the fulgurite’s flare and the weaver’s emergence—environment charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tilted toward tactile cold and hushed sound, mirroring Elias’s attenuated patience. Spatial choreography stays clean: kneel-stand-offer axis tracks without drift. Dock’s “sacred ground” rule is learned through action, not dump, and constrains exit.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden is not backdrop but syntax: every path, plaque, and skeletal apple tree constrains Elias’s attention and finally his decision to stay. Micro-setting works—blue carpet thread functions as portable palace, a literal weft that mirrors the textual weaving of lives. Autumn chill, dusk light, and star glint are selectively filtered through Elias’s artist-eye, never tourist-catalogue. 9+ gate met: thread-in-starlight charges the final image and reweights all prior absences into a single glistening map.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The suspended palace is not postcard backdrop; its vibrating crystal floor and groaning anchors physically constrain Kael’s every move and finally kill him. Micro-setting works—the egg’s obsidian surface mirrors the cavern darkness he has never escaped, charging the final burst of light. Sensory selection stays tight to POV: grease, dust, gear-hum, never tourist-catalog. Environment shapes tactics and final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and kelp-drift peace are tactile, sensual, and filtered through firefighter perception; environment mirrors her inner duality without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (coin, burlap root wrap) constrains the planting act and charges closure. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule breaks. Weather/cloud migration functions as clock and mood engine. Setting never overwhelms action; every grain of sand is handled or sifted. Meets 9- gate: recurring black-surface motif reweights final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    The city is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered fragments—dribbling cherub mouth, dry stone fish-scales, soil-filled basin—each of which constrains the next discovery. Micro-setting (the box itself, the sapling’s root-wrapped key) literally enables the climax. Spatial choreography is flawless; objects track from hand to ground without drift. Final image of the box “vibrant” at Kael’s feet recharges the opening descriptor, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Nebular petals, photon strands, and obsidian gear teeth are rendered in precise sensory hierarchy; the setting itself is the crucible—its color-shift under quantized light directly forces the sentimentalist’s final stance. Spatial choreography cleanly tracks the transit from edge to ancient blossom; environment evolves with gear meshing stem, constraining the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse glass, damp earth, and monarch grease on panes are filtered through a stone-carver’s eye—tools and wings matter more than botanical labels. The bench, ribbon, and granite slab serve as micro-settings that physically constrain how Elias can stand, coil, or carve. Final image of “shimmer of ghostly wings” recharges the setting rather than abandons it. Only nit: no scent of granite dust itself, a missed tactile specificity that would have crowned the workspace.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tidal obsidian ridge cradling the tower functions as micro-setting that constrains access and provides the literal seam for Elias’s secret insertion. Salty wind and storm-grey sky filter through his technician’s eye, mirroring internal turbulence. Tool-as-setting (rake handle) reappears with altered meaning, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt silo, sovereign case, and star-cropped aperture are not postcard backdrops; their curved walls echo the tapestry’s spiral and the case’s worn silver literalizes centuries of touch. Micro-setting works when Elias’s tweezers skid on the lens that reveals “temporal gradients,” a tactile detail that makes metaphysics feel machine-shop real. Spatial choreography stays clean: gate unlocked → spiral descent → circular chamber → pedestal. Only the cemetery above is sketched in generics (“shadows lengthening”), but that thinness never touches the beats that matter.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain movement (spiral ascent, reflective surface) and return in the final thawed mirror, charging the closure image under the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective—glassy shards, liquid starlight glow—always filtered through the cartographer’s instrument-minded eye rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: he climbs, pauses, writes, descends; no impossible positions. Weather shift from frozen to cracked to thawing evolves causally with the writing act.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember alcove’s mist, dial-glow, and hollowed-out book function as micro-setting that literally houses the crystal; these tactile objects constrain the discovery beat and charge the final image when their glow fades to “whisper.” Spatial choreography stays clean; orchestra pit, archives, and alcove orbit logically around Elias’s traverse.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Gallery is sketched with economy—sloping floor, white mist, pedestal—yet every prop obliges Elias’s posture and gaze. The rocking chair’s dying rhythm doubles as clock and heartbeat, constraining tempo. Ash dust becomes atmosphere, literally coating the air and mask. Spatial logic holds across kneel, reach, dropped shard; no clutter, no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sewer tunnels, rusted pipes, and waterproof boxes are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Sebastian’s scavenger-philosopher bias. The cog reappears twice with reweighted meaning—first as obsession, finally as talisman against erasure—so object-as-setting charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Saltwater fauna vs freshwater myth is a sharp specificity that directly undermines state narrative, qualifying as setting constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its “traveled stillness” and autumn leaves pressing the windows mirror the encroaching loss and supply acoustic hush that enables the final chord to hang. The rosette is handled in three beats—desk, sunlight, final placement—charging the closure. Sensory selection is biased to Eleanor’s musician ear (dust motes in sunlight, chord hanging like amber). Spatial choreography stays clean: students file in, sit shoulder-to-shoulder, leave; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted greenhouse is rendered through tactile corrosion, hanging pans, scattered tools—details that constrain Elara’s movement and resource set. The glass ceiling sings under cosmic energy, turning setting into an active instrument that channels planetary alignment; spatial choreography stays consistent as Elara kneels, plants, prunes within the single room. Micro-setting of her callused palm and thumbnail-sized seed function as embodied tools that charge the final harvest. Sensory hierarchy is chef-driven: taste, scent, and color dominate; visual detail is selective, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lightning tower, lacquer box, and drone wing each constrain choice or charge the final image; the tower’s gaunt silence and the box’s cool surface are returned to in tactile ways that steer action. Selective sensory filtering (“honeyed glow,” “whisper of the wind”) mirrors Elias’s narrowed emotional bandwidth. Spatial choreography remains clean across the spiral ascent and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orris shard itself functions as micro-setting in the attic climax—its “violet fingerprint scent” and “compressed magnitude of quiet” physically constrain Elias’s stance and trigger the house’s groan, satisfying 9+ gate. Bay-spring macro-setting is filtered through Elias’s bias: salt air, starlit sky, “streetlights blinked on… casting elongated shadows that seemed to bow,” sensory choices that mirror his awestruck narrowing of attention. Spatial choreography is clean—objects migrate room-to-room under his tracking gaze; no floating props. Weather (spring breeze) is causally linked to blossoms opening, reinforcing the breath metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden’s bronze flora, stainless trellises, and crystalline chime are not backdrop but tactical resource: the chime’s “strongest remaining point” becomes the conduit for Kael’s reply. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—stone fingers register warmth, pressure, vibration; visual data are filtered through centuries of stillness. Spatial choreography is immaculate: pedestal → ampoule → crack → chime, all tracked without drift. Environment directly constrains the final act, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The staircase is simultaneously macro-setting and micro-tool: its angles are measured, its steps chalked, and its final crumbling is the decisive terrain. Sensory economy is tight—echoing groan, slipping sand—yet always filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias (mathematical exactitude). Spatial choreography is flawless; we never lose track of where Elias stands vis-à-vis the dissolving flight. The healed die on solid ground recharges every prior step, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: its living vines and jasmine scent constrain her to quiet action and filter the city’s smog, literally enabling cleaner air for memory work. The moon-tipped brush is a handled tool that charges the final image; its crescent ivory and moth-wing bristles are re-seen in the silver crescents she paints. Spatial choreography is clean—stairs, table, windowsill track her ritual without drift. Environment mirrors internal state through saffron quiet without overt symbolism; the city’s orange glow remains a consistent backdrop that heightens the rooftop’s isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto’s slick floor and yeast-heavy air constrain movement and breathing; the emerald lens is handled twice, returning as a failed preservative, charging the final turn to edible memory. Sensory detail is selective—rosewater dread, limestone sweat—rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: from overlook to ovens to communal circle. Environment shapes tactics: damp dictates bread as archive.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    The hunger stone/yoyo dyad functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice—he must lift the yoyo to trigger the stone. Lighthouse, tide, and muck are sensually filtered through POV priority (goggles, wind, cord grooves). Spatial choreography is flawless: rock-flat placement → cord lift → sky-tear → tide reclaim. Final image of “quiet spaces between seconds” recharges the stone’s extinguished light, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather and tide are not backdrop but causal timer that forces the initiation before waves return.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Funhouse mirrors and the silver clasp act as micro-setting that literally constrain path and choice; the shifting hallway of deaths is tactile, lived-in, and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the mirror-surface is the necessary canvas for the conceptual turn, so narrowing is purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions—while the carnival’s disrepair stays offstage, keeping focus on the mirror-maze that alters tactics.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake—control over the photographically cursed afterlife—is signaled early and tightens once: choosing the death-mirror path forecloses escape and reweights the curse as medium. Pressure accumulates through mirrored iterations rather than causal reversals; the cost (eternal dying image accepted) is legible on the page, yet escalation is more atmospheric than tactical, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating salt-orchard is vividly particular: hollow fruit bells, hook wind-chimes, driftwood deck that vibrates underfoot.  These micro-settings double as instruments, constraining every sound the prophet can draw, and the final image of the spinning circle charging the night sky is inseparable from the music’s meaning—setting literally charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Shell-city curvature guides every physical and social move; streets follow turtle grooves, workshop sits inside living shell walls, dome climb is tactile. Weathered rust and salt residue supply scent and grit; sunset “orange and violet” hues heighten but never prettify dread. The whistle and spyglass recur as handled, state-changing tools that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless from workshop crack to dome summit.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station is never a postcard: ivy limits reach, rusted track constrains exit routes, the single flickering bulb stages the fight. Micro-setting—the brass box and the letter’s gilt edge—literally charges the final image. Sensory selection shrinks under crisis (only the groaning door, skidding letter). The rosebush’s final absence is felt, not declared, meeting the 9- constraint test; yet the environment does not quite force a tactical change, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Body (trembling hands), tool (inkwell), and micro-setting (hollow under staircase) actively constrain where Elias can kneel and write, charging the final image. Sensory triage—glass shards reflecting sunset on his face—mirrors internal bruise without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography immaculate; drawbridge mechanics accurate, river level change causal, not decorative. Idiom era-appropriate; proper-noun economy tight; weather literally alters timetable—classic 9+ gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Watery dome, dappled shadows, brass stamp whose octopus matches city motif—every detail is filtered through indexer’s cataloguing gaze, so setting is tool and evidence at once. Spatial choreography is clean: lamp, candle, manuscript piles, vault maps track without drift. Final image of morning sun through water dancing across corrected index cards is micro-setting that recharges the inversion, letting light itself ratify the new truth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating isle, glass basilica, tea garden, lapidary bench—each surface is sensuously exploited: the isle’s rock supplies raw quartz, the basilica’s rainbows calibrate polish angles, the dew-slick table steadies the fracture tool; environment actively limits and enables every micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating thermosphere lab is sketched via lived function—flicker of generators, relay hearts, blue rinse of rebooting light—rather than tourist catalogue. Geode doubles as micro-setting, its hexagonal lattice mirroring console maps to constrain metaphysics; environment literally channels choice. Bodies track cleanly around circular console; no impossible props. Specificity anchors premise and gives tactile launch point for final descent. One notch below elite only because exterior vacuum remains generic backdrop, not yet pressing on physiology or time.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ancient observatory at dusk is filtered through Kai’s aerial-recon gaze: stone arches “crumbling yet glittering,” telescope pulsing awake under drone approach—details constrain movement (Kai must launch from the parapet, navigate star maps against physical ruin). The type-matrix chip doubles as micro-setting, its metallic surface drinking light, guiding calibration; its holographic projection charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and vibration, appropriate to a pilot; spatial choreography tracks drone, chip, telescope in coherent triangle. No factual drift; weather and epoch remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cobalt terrace at dusk is never backdrop: color leaches into violet/blood, mirroring guilt’s temperature; the railing becomes the literal fulcrum where the gear—and truth—are placed. The “forgotten shore” acts as micro-setting whose etched driftwood carvings serve as confessional booth; their tactile use in the final invitation makes the environment constrain choice. Spatial choreography is flawless: Mara’s measured steps across the terrace stones echo minefield metaphor. One hairline slip: “cobalt” is over-repeated (three times), barely grazing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet and claustrophobic mist act as micro-setting: wind threatens documents, visibility governs approach speed, and salt spray forces squinting that mirrors internal squinting at moral lines. The brass pull functions as portable setting—its contours ground Julian’s attention whenever abstraction threatens. Spatial choreography is flawless; groups converge, trade, retreat without teleporting or impossible sight-lines. Sensory selection favors motion (wind, shifting clouds) over static catalog, keeping atmosphere in service of tension rather than postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sea-gravel crunch, rust-bleeding pole, brass-cold compass—tactile specifics recur and finally charge the image when the compass points back at her. Spatial choreography across the bay is tracked without slip. Micro-setting (the kayak hull, jacket pocket) constrains action and is re-weighted at closure. Weather is present but passive; could have tightened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Bioluminescent lake, dripping ceiling, water-worn tunnels are not backdrop but tactical: the glowing organisms literally part to reveal passage, the cold becomes the price of empathy. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneel → wade → submerge; ball tracked hand-to-depth. Sensory selection narrows to temperature, faint hum, and pulsing light, mirroring mental narrowing under memory assault. Final image of light “swallowing him whole” recharges earlier “soft promise” motif, meeting 9+ gate: environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit orchard functions as micro-setting: reflected-light blossoms couple with Elara’s fingertip test, translating to her later skin-change that needs moonlight. Spice scents act as tools she weighs, handles, and burns—objects, not backdrop. Phrases like “moon-rolled nutmeg” compress world-rule and sensory specificity in one stroke. Spatial choreography holds as she kneels, lights, and reaches; no floating altar.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Midnight glade, cracked saucer, and onyx-ink patterns constrain her choices and charge the final image; micro-setting qualifies. Sensory selection narrows to taste/texture under duress. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The memory chamber’s cold, the crystalline tear residue, and the metallic groan as dimensions thin supply concrete, POV-filtered details that constrain method and mood. Micro-setting principle met: the archived photographs act as tactile terrain that must be scanned, floated-over, and mined. Spatial choreography stays clean throughout the single-scene window. While broader astropolitics are wisely elided, the ship never fully feels lived-in beyond the archive—no scent of recycled air, no flicker of failing lights—keeping it short of 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Black-sand beach, fissure glow, bug-light micro-cosmos—each detail is filtered through Elias’s destitute philanthropist eye and used: sand grips his boots, heat frames risk, the box’s glint triggers the final beat. Spatial choreography is flawless; no exposition dump. Environment does not just decorate but supplies the relic constraint that reweights his collection, meeting the 9+ gate, yet the description never quite loops back to punish or scar him, so it stalls just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Luminous fort, half-painted sundial, and pulsing cradle stones supply tactile specificity; environment directly shapes tactics—angles guide Elena to hidden panel. Light/darkness imagery is woven through action rather than backdrop. Spatial choreography stays coherent across courtyard, wall panel, and circular chamber. Micro-setting rule met: bronze quill + sundial angles together constrain the decisive discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and dust-charged stones form a lived micro-setting that directly constrains placement and timing; spatial choreography is clean. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the humming dust and slipping eels provide tactile counterpoint. The environment evolves—glow, resonance, levitation—causally with each placement, charging the final image. World rules stay consistent; the absence of friction is learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observatory, storm, and envelope function as micro-setting objects that constrain the final act; the glass dome’s cold against palms is tactically used just before the stance shift. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of timer, chill of glass) mirrors interior narrowing. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate but lacks fresh environmental twist, capping at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Glass atrium and half-painted sundial function as micro-setting that actively constrain stance: transparency forces public visibility, painted angles force codified speech. The Danish needle card is tactile and tracked, but the brook remains acoustically atmospheric rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is perfect; only the brook’s descriptive presence feels ornamental rather than choice-forcing, preventing 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is sharply textured: rusted scrap-metal shelves, peeling paint under starlight, coffee tin’s hidden compartment—objects acquire history and tactical weight. Sensory economy favors touch (“fingers tracing peeling paint”) and sight balanced with sound of hushed voices in night air; smell/taste deferred, appropriate to cautious secrecy. Spatial choreography stays coherent across box-sorting, seed-planting, later relocation; no floating bodies or impossible props. Environment constrains choice throughout—abandoned outdoor lot dictates stealth gardening, scrap shelves’ instability forces creative stacking; final threatened dismantling reweights library as fragile prize rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tidal arbor is vividly sensed—salt air, bioluminescent lanterns, tide-lift—yet its physics stay impressionistic; a sharper constraint (trees sway = tide pulse) could have shaped tactics. The broken clock is handled twice, its gears and pendulum re-imaged under projector light; this micro-setting charges the final beat. Environmental specificity is the story’s chief pleasure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ridge is not backdrop but pressure engine: blossoms as physical stories, colors keyed to heroes, scents to lullabies—details constrain Elias’s ritual choices.
    Micro-setting (seed in palm) evolves from inert weight to pulsing light, charging the final image.
    Weather front tracked sentence-by-sentence, tightening the clock.
    Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Salt-laced air, wet-earth scent, and tide-slap give instant tactile anchor; islet size is never detailed but implied through bonsai scale. Weather remains an active pressure—breeze swings compass needle, tide audible as metronome. Spatial tracking clean: no impossible prop positions. Micro-setting rule met: antique lace and compass function as handled “rooms” that constrain ritual steps.

The environment charges the closure: melting ash into glass ties place, trauma, and craft into one resonant act. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting that actively enables the protagonist’s method: glass panes fog with breath, orchids bloom under controlled warmth, and stems conduct vibrations. These details constrain and charge the experiment—without this specific environment, her thermal translation wouldn’t work. The recurring image of “unshaken marvels” deepens from backdrop to witness, culminating in petals “dancing to a rhythm unseen.” Only slight over-reliance on visual description (frost, hues, glass) without more tactile or olfactory grounding prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse lens functions as micro-setting: its fractures constrain Marcus’s choices, its restoration demands impossible physics, and its final rotation atop the tower charges the closing image. The underwater library is vividly specific (“gelatinous cases,” “fish darted like librarians”) and supplies the only method for revival—directly altering tactics. Coastal atmosphere permeates perception (“dissolving seafoam,” “moonlight transparency”), grounding supernatural stakes in sensory reality. No white-room syndrome; every location pressures decision.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terra-cotta arbor and silver bell function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices—the arbor becomes operational hub, the bell dictates timing and tone.

The tree of light at the center directly charges closure, making the environment indispensable to the story’s logic and emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned carnival prize center isn’t backdrop—it supplies the piano bench, constrains movement (chained to beam), and its decay mirrors societal collapse. Sensory details (stale popcorn, groaning floorboards) are filtered through Kael’s urgency, narrowing to tactile immediacies (warm metal, dust on tongue). The piano bench functions as micro-setting, directly enabling the climax. Final image of glowing seeds bathed in soft light reweights ruin into hope.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the ashen forge, shipwrecks, and unripened blossoms aren’t backdrop but active constraints. The greenhouse’s glass amplifies auroral light to make thought “tangible,” directly enabling Elias’s imprint. The forge’s residual heat allows sound absorption, and shipwrecks echo thematic regret. Every detail serves the central action or closure—the golden glow of the forge in the final image reweights all prior ash.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The emerald station isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its dreamlike glow clouds guards’ minds, enabling access, while its shifting light (golden → night) pressures the thief’s timeline. The jar of moonbeams functions as tool-setting—constraining his method and charging the climax when its glow spills onto canvas. Final image hinges on environment: flickering lights bid farewell as emerald deepens, embodying earned stasis. Every sensory detail (honey-shadow footsteps, liquid starlight) serves theme and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned control room functions as potent micro-setting: rusted consoles, mute dials, and scorpions of rust constrain Finn’s workspace and echo thematic decay. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the melting icicles outside directly inspire the teardrop form, linking external thaw to internal transformation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Finn notices steam “with a dramatic hiss,” leather “soft against fingertips”). However, occupational verisimilitude in glassblowing lacks granular constraint—tools are named but don’t limit tactics beyond generic torch use.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted library functions effectively as micro-setting: its skeletal stacks, groaning shelves, and creaking floorboards mirror the protagonist’s fragility and pressure his choices. The stars serve as consistent atmospheric anchors, evolving from indifferent witnesses to celebratory beacons. However, the setting rarely *constrains* action—doors open silently when needed, space permits kneeling and standing without spatial consequence. Sensory detail (ozone, decay, rust) is vivid but occasionally decorative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the storm-tossed ridge fort, pebble shore, and observation chamber constrain Kaelen’s isolation and focus. Sensory detail (“ambered hush,” “creaking timbers,” “bruised violet sky”) is selective, POV-filtered, and tonally cohesive. The flaking gold leaf booklet and pebbles act as charged objects that evolve in meaning. However, the environment doesn’t actively alter tactics—Kaelen ignores the storm—so it supports but doesn’t pressure choice, capping 9+ eligibility per gate rule.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen courtyard isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains choice: frost dictates sweeping motion, twilight limits perception, and thawing signals resolution. The ice violin functions as tool-object, its melting directly altering tactics (energy drain, timeline convergence). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“metallic bristles scraping,” “sizzling like tiny stars”), avoiding tourist cataloguing. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: dawn replaces eternal twilight only after the courtyard’s ice fully dissolves, making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystal whispering stones function as micro-setting: they constrain perception (sound replaces speech), charge the final image (“shimmering as his shoes touched them”), and evolve causally—from background hum to “applause.” The shattered desk, rain-kissed stones, and single streetlamp are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered. Weather affects mood and symbolism without cliché. The projector lens doubles as tool and setting object, anchoring the world’s rules (clarity once had to be “forced”).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The garden maze functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its decay mirrors Elias’s status, while spatial choreography (hut → center) guides his journey. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—low-luck zoning isolates him—and charges the final image when vines weave his marbles into a map only he can read. Sensory detail is selective (dew, crushed morning glory seeds, pulsing green light) and filtered through Elias’s professional attention. The recurring object-as-setting (marbles) evolves from private token to communal testament, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)

Salt, ink, waves, and cookie tins are tactile anchors that filter perception through Elias’s spy-writer duality. The recurring beam constrains action (timing signals to its sweep) and charges the final image: even extinguished, its “echoes” carry his message, proving environment shapes both tactics and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    The micro-setting—the loop pedal, artist’s palette, dimensional anchor—functions as environment, tool, and constraint. The violet pigment’s behavior (dissolving, clinging, glowing) directly responds to the priest’s rhetorical tactics and the entity’s resistance, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: sound absorbed “like breath in a vacuum,” light “pulsing,” silence “thick.” Crucially, the palette and pedal constrain choice—they are the only means of combat—and their reprise in the exit (“palette tucked into his robe”) reweights the entire struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass spire and frozen lake aren’t backdrop—they’re active instruments. The spire’s hum responds to Ai’s voice; the mirrored horizon reflects and amplifies his creation. The nautilus shell, icicles, window flaws—all function as micro-settings that constrain his method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (cold through slippers, pearly light in shell chambers) and filtered through Ai’s obsessive focus, never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is not just backdrop—it actively pressures Kael’s choices (gravity defiance, path selection) and charges the final image (its memory erased by rain). Sensory detail is selective and urgent: neon veins, pulsing runes, warping rails—all filtered through Kael’s disoriented perception. The setting evolves causally (glow intensifies, then darkens, then shatters) and constrains action (jumping onto new paths). This qualifies as micro-setting that directly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drum maker’s cavern isn’t backdrop—it’s a co-conspirator. Wooden shells lean like “sleeping giants,” their slack skins mirroring Elara’s numbness, while the stone floor transmits bass frequencies into her feet. The phonograph, wood shavings, and backward discs are tactile anchors that shape her method. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: only here, among resonant failures, can she attempt this ritual. The final image—surrounded by dormant drums yet feeling her own heartbeat—charges the space with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courtyard, quarantine haze, and brass tube are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s observational bias.

    The alchemist’s market is vividly specific (“glowing ropes,” “bottled starlight”) and functions as micro-setting: it supplies the canvas that catalyzes revelation. Crucially, the lighthouse lens fragment—a recurring object—constrains choice (she must interpret paintings through it) and charges the final image (fading into ordinary glass after purpose is fulfilled). Sensory detail is selective and urgent, filtered through the translator’s professional bias. Only minor deduction: the market vanishes without spatial transition, briefly risking white-room effect.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned circus ticket office functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the ceiling hides the object, the ladder is rickety, the light conditions shift perception. Sensory detail (dust like a shroud, phantom calliope) is filtered through the technician’s professional attention. The environment directly charges the final image—the cracks now “solved,” the barrel pocketed. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves pressure or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass orchard library is not backdrop but active constraint: its fragility mirrors Elias’s psyche, its floating state isolates him, and its glass trees refract reality into unstable rainbows. Every sensory detail serves theme or pressure—the cold metal lever, the silvery vapor, the unmelting frost. The setting charges the final image: smooth glass replaces coded frost, signaling liberation from patterned control. This environment directly enables and constrains choice, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The baroque asteroid functions as both setting and micro-setting: its hollowed corridors, time-drifting light, and veiled maintenance suite directly constrain Kaelen’s actions. The crystal shard and frozen-time spotlight are not decorative but catalytic—they enable the climactic vision. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “light pooled, wept”), avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment charges the final image: darkness and drifting time coalesce around the shard to reveal hidden truth.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    The resonance chamber functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice—its bells reveal invisible fissures, enabling Elara’s method. Tools (starlight filaments, oil-stained fingers) and recurring objects (the chip, the box) are tactile and consequential. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered: sound dominates, but touch (oil, metal) and sight (amber light) support urgency. The final image—dawn breaking as song spreads—charges the entire setting with earned renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The subterranean lagoon isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and payoff. Its phosphorescent water reframes the compass’s purpose, and its stillness embodies the “resonant hush” Elias seeks. Sensory hierarchy is masterful: early focus on scent (petrichor) shifts underground to sound (“dripping water coalesced into a rhythm”) and finally touch (“immersion… into memory itself”). The compass, body, and lagoon jointly charge the final image: leaving the compass behind is legible only because the setting demands surrender, not collection.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-tossed archway functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice (refuge vs. emergence) and charges the final image (calming storm = completed alliances). Sensory detail is selective—salt-calloused hands, turbine-hum reverie—and filtered through Lyra’s sculptor POV. The recurring driftwood sculptures anchor geography without tourist cataloging. Deducted 0.1 because the setting doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice; Lyra could theoretically ignore the slide regardless of location.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the studio, postcards, and especially the amber pavilion’s etched glass directly constrain and enable Lena’s breakthrough. Sensory detail is selective—snow trickling, petals catching moonlight—and filtered through Lena’s botanical bias. The pavilion’s stained glass charges the climax by revealing hidden diagrams only visible at dawn, making environment causal to revelation. This qualifies for 9-band, but slight vagueness in the pavilion’s real-world plausibility (a “chapel” with botanical glass?) prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice—Elias descends because of it, arranges debris on its shore, and is retrocognitively trapped by its pull. Sensory detail (bruised violet sky, brine-stained vault, rusted manacle) is filtered through Elias’s archival urgency. The floating library’s creaking gondola evolves from refuge to vessel of recovered truth. Final image—the lagoon winking shut—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Paper-Lantern Cove functions as micro-setting: its lanterns dim with indecision and brighten with choice, directly constraining Elian’s tactics. Sensory detail is selective—powdered-glass sand, warm amber bottle—and filtered through his alchemical perception. The environment charges the final image: lanterns glow brighter as the town thrives, embodying earned hope. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard garden—a gravity-defying micro-setting—constrains and enables key actions: it hides the wax cylinder, responds to Elias’s immersion (leaves rustling in unison), and charges the final image as both sanctuary and crucible. Sensory detail (engineered soil tasting of “earth and sky,” amber wax) is selective and POV-filtered. The greenhouse dome’s altered light signals narrative shift. This isn’t backdrop—it’s active architecture that shapes the prophecy’s reception.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound atrium functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges every action: cold enough to crack stone yet yielding under order, its frozen floor accepts the acorn cap only through precise ancestral design. Sensory detail is selective (silver breath, luminescent ice, soil scent) and filtered through the protagonist’s urgent perception. The setting evolves causally—from brittle stasis to pliant threshold—and directly enables the climax. The oak cap and ice crystals serve as environmental extensions that reconfigure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    The windblown sanctuary above clouds isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains sound transmission, forcing Elian’s hybrid methodology. Tools (anemometer, bell rope) and micro-setting (eastern window, control panel) shape choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his professional focus: wind shifts noticed before visual cues, thin air altering acoustics. Aurora-lit cloud tops in closure reweight the setting’s mythic and practical roles.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shooting star tracking station functions as a potent micro-setting: obsolete instruments, silent monitors, and the observation dome directly enable Elara’s ritual and frame her isolation. The yellow lantern glass—treated as a tool-environment hybrid—constrains and charges the final image, glowing brighter as her understanding deepens. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (chime of debris, hum of instruments), filtered through Elara’s professional and spiritual priorities. However, the setting never actively pressures a tactical choice—it facilitates rather than compels, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables. Its “strange geometry” repels heat, bees mediate covenant renewal, and spatial choreography (boundary vs. center hive) shapes ritual logic. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “blood and ash” dusk, “amber” hives, thrumming glass—all filtered through Elisha’s perceptive bias. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: new ghosts arrive because equilibrium radiates from this specific place, proving environment directly shapes outcome and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald silo functions effectively as micro-setting: its lower levels grow colder, echoing “untold stories,” directly shaping Elias’s descent and discovery. Sensory detail is selective—dulling metallic sheen, thickened air—and filtered through Elias’s timekeeper sensibility. The urn fragment and journal serve as object-as-setting, constraining choices (decoding, descending). However, the silo doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond atmosphere; it enables rather than compels, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its damp sand clings during the lunge, its ripples smooth in sympathy, and its tide ultimately claims the sculpture—constraining the poet’s choice to leave it. Sensory hierarchy (petrichor, salt, plinks) reflects calm focus, shifting subtly with gust and kite fall. Every detail serves tone or action; no white-room syndrome. The feather’s iridescence and string’s scarlet are filtered through poetic perception, not cataloged.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The temple orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: oak-pillar alignment dictates branch selection, copper placement responds to carvings, and stone warmth validates hypotheses. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Kaelen notices leaf orientation, wire pulse, pillar lean—not tourist cataloging. Final image charges closure: breeze moves through both stone and wood, carrying interspecies respect. Environment is indispensable to stakes and final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rainwashed tower functions as both macro- and micro-setting, its moss-streaked stones and crumbling roof directly shaping Aris’s ascent and final act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—bronze quiet, spring-soaked earth, metallic newness—avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting constrains choice (the path, the pedestal) and charges the closure (amber absorbed into “ancient machinery”). Minor deduction: the sculpture path’s statues feel ornamental rather than pressurizing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image—its salt-worn planks receive seeds in crevices where “hope might take root,” directly enabling the garden’s emergence.

Environment actively participates: tide washes away destruction while heralding renewal, making setting causal to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    The scrapyard setting isn’t backdrop but active constraint: salvaged metal shapes tools, cracked earth dictates movement, and the bridge’s acoustics enable plot progression. The wax leaf functions as micro-setting, its cellular structure literally encoding data. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s focus—tactile ridges, visual amber veins, thermal shifts—never touristy. Final image of twin moons over jagged silhouette charges closure with both beauty and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observation deck functions as micro-setting: its temporal stretching enables the ghostly overlay and constrains perception. The gilded compass rose and parchment are tactile anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—velvet void, cool metal, charcoal scratch—filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional priorities. The frozen chrono-lab below mirrors internal stasis-turned-exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its frozen seams enable climbing, its skylight dictates entry, and its collapse signals resolution. The “sky below swirling in colors it shouldn’t have” constrains movement (gravity as suggestion) and charges the final image when reset to “blues and golds.” Sensory detail is selective (ozone scent, ivory coolness) and filtered through Kaelen’s urgency. Pocket sundial lid evolves from architectural feature to thematic vessel, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining the climax (unguarded path) and charging closure (warmth vs. measurement).

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The National Archives rotunda functions as more than backdrop—it constrains and charges every action. The whispering gallery transforms footsteps into statements; marble amplifies breath into prayer; dust becomes a writable archive. These environmental features directly shape Elara’s method and culminate in the final image. The chessboard’s missing pawns are not just observed but *felt* as absence, making setting inseparable from theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The labyrinthine mountain bookstore isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices (corridors rearrange to aid her; shelves yield relevant texts). Crucially, micro-settings—the mercury-glass mirror, the feather bookmark, the obsidian stone—constrain and enable action: the feather becomes a conduit, the mirror a portal, the stone a decoder. These objects charge the final image: her hand on the mirror surface, feather-texture “like an extension of her own nerves,” embodies the fusion of tool and self that makes seeding possible.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    The “time-frozen village” isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice (suspended moments force inward reckoning), while the platinum labyrinth’s shifting platforms literalize mental risk. Sensory details are filtered through the tutor’s chess-trained attention: cobblestones “slick with memory of rain,” tapestry threads as directional clues. The final image—rain replacing “woven hush”—charges the setting with transformational weight, proving environment shapes both tactic and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bone towers and mist-shrouded canyon aren’t backdrop—they conduct memory, amplify poetry, and physically constrain Elaran’s ascent. The pale spire’s transformation from monument to containment device charges every beat. Final image of crumbling spire reweights all prior description. Sensory detail (heartbeat amplified, mist parting) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Elaran’s artist-POV.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The acid sea, gears-and-cogs workshop, and key ring charm aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. The workshop’s tilt forces underwater narration; corrosive waves are absorbed by the charm into kintsugi light. Final image charges closure: the sanctuary hums *with* the sea, not against it. Sensory hierarchy (acrid smell, metallic thrum, pulsing warmth) reflects urgency and profession without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting operates as active micro-setting: the quay, alley, cave, and tide pool each constrain or enable choice. The phosphorescent moss and still tide pool directly charge the climax—the latter becomes the mirror for his unbroken face and the vessel for release. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt → damp earth → droplets like metronomes), never decorative. The cave’s “quiet energy” mirrors his internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting and symbolic vessel: its color (“shade of deep water and secret skies”) and obsolete lamp room shape Elias’s choice to use the balcony instead. Salt, damp stone, peeling paint, and spiral stairs are filtered through his professional familiarity and emotional state. The phantom garden scent emerges from—and is constrained by—the setting’s liminal dawn atmosphere. Most crucially, the lighthouse’s height and exposure enable the cork’s impossible flight, charging the final image with environmental specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    The censer foot functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (guides hand, pulses with moon) and charging the final image (placed at map’s center).

The moon’s silver coin metaphor ties environment to thematic closure without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The hanging orchard isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: roots pierce ravine walls, containers sway precariously, storms dictate timing. The antique glass eye functions as micro-setting, its activation requiring tactile contact and memory. Final image charges the relic with inner storm-light, transforming it from smuggled object to shared hope. Sensory detail (damp earth, rope nets, thunder) is filtered through Elara’s professional attention and dread, never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse aren’t backdrop—they’re active micro-settings that constrain and charge every beat. The mist enables memory transfer; the dock anchors both strangers’ solitude; the glass case in the lighthouse literalizes Hemlock’s role as archivist of loss. Sensory hierarchy reflects Hemlock’s profession and obsession: visual (lavender mist), tactile (weathered hands on petals), auditory (whispers of objects). The Edelweiss’s Alpine origin contrasts with the maritime setting, heightening thematic tension between land-bound promise and oceanic erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the shop, creek, and cavern constrain and charge choice. The blooming cavern isn’t backdrop—it pulses with bioluminescence that mirrors Elias’s awakening, and its hidden entrance demands physical pursuit.

    The mountain ranger cabin grounds the narrative spatially and tonally; wind howling through pines, bruised purples at dusk, and rough wooden table create tactile specificity. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting—its texture, absorbency, and ancient promise directly shape action. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain a pivotal choice (e.g., no storm preventing escape), so it charges but doesn’t force the climax. Still, sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s nostalgic, time-warped perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The workshop functions as a micro-setting that constrains and enables: tools are constellations, mist swallows edges, grime-streaked windows modulate light—all filtered through Elara’s anosmic POV. The birthing clamp screw and water clock are not props but active terrain; the screw’s inscription reweights the entire space. Fog serves as both atmosphere and metaphor, lifting only after emotional clarity arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating platform isn’t backdrop but crucible: its isolation forces inward focus, while enchanted lanterns refract through Aeris’s crystallized skin, charging the final image. The crow quill and tea bowl function as micro-settings—tools that constrain choice (only this quill can scribe soul-runes). Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress: clouds blur, but ink’s “black liquid clinging to jagged facets” sharpens. Weather actively shapes stakes—the gathering storm pressures the ritual’s timing, culminating in rain that softens but doesn’t dissolve his scar.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sheet music archive functions as micro-setting: dust trembling with dissonant whispers, towering shelves of forgotten scores, and the high shelf where only Eloise would look—all constrain access and charge atmosphere. The antique perfume bottle is tactilely specific (“iridescent and delicate,” “silver filigree”) and directly shapes the climax. However, the orchard outside remains abstract; its “hush” evokes mood but doesn’t alter Eloise’s tactics beyond thematic pressure, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ancient temple library functions as a dynamic micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its corridors contract/expands with mental state, columns spiral in response to movement, and walls dissolve to reveal cosmic webs. The softcover dictionary—a recurring object—evolves from heavy artifact to levitating oracle to blank canvas, directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective yet potent (“resounding hush,” “shadows of forgotten histories”), filtered through the witness’s metaphysical urgency. Every atmospheric element serves the accumulative drive, culminating in an environment that becomes transparent only when integration is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fjord setting functions as micro-setting: its quiet amplifies auditory cues (whistle echo), its verticality frames the horizon station, and its glassy surface mirrors the clocks’ fluid interiors. The mantle clock key and hydraulic chambers constrain choice—they are tools that must be handled—and charge the final image when Elias sees them as “boundary markers.” Sensory detail is selective (sound over sight during counting) and filtered through professional obsession. The environment directly shapes the thematic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is not backdrop but active crucible—its mist, glow, and spore-leakage directly shape perception, movement, and thematic revelation. The laser dot’s red defiance against blue-green light creates visual tension that charges the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The disused railway station isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: the rusted ladder leads to revelation; ivy’s rustle becomes part of the cure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (damp earth, dry-leaf laughter, frantic heartbeat), filtered through Orion’s distracted logistics-trained attention. The cupola functions as micro-setting that constrains the climax—only by ascending does he access the symphony of sound. This environment directly charges the final image and enables the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its vibrations guide Kael’s feet, its bark pulses under his fingers, and its silence at the end charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is exquisitely POV-filtered—sound is tactile, emotion is taste (G sharp like honey), ground is affective (“yielding like a lover’s sigh”). The platinum ring and bare feet aren’t decorative; they constrain how Kael accesses the world. Every detail serves pressure or perception, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice—it warps the skyline, pulls signals off-course, and pulses in response to edits. The dried-up pen constrains tactics (must be unbent, dipped in stellar residue) and charges the final image (gleaming, dormant but purposeful). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “faint hum through the air,” “stars blinked”). Environment directly enables the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The luminous harbor isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its silver ripples, lighthouse silhouette, and tidal rhythm directly shape perception and gesture. The camera—handled repeatedly—functions as object-as-setting, constraining action (no film = no literal capture) and charging the final image.

No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “quiet tower at dawn” functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every beat: anesthesia’s aftermath sharpens perception, dawn light animates the hourglass, isolation enables plant telepathy. Recurring objects (coffee rings, hourglass, plants) evolve from props to active agents—especially the hourglass, whose frozen sand becomes the story’s moral compass. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “meteor hush,” thirsty succulent), never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    The projection booth functions as micro-setting: its ozone-and-film scent, flickering light, and hushed thunder constrain perception and charge the final image. The film strip itself acts as object-as-setting, coiled “like a silver serpent,” later becoming a “map” to emotional archives. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with the gazer’s psychometric immersion. The environment directly enables the climax’s conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    The aurora-lit archway isn’t backdrop—it pulses, swallows darkness, casts transformative light, and recedes into stone, directly shaping Elara’s actions and emotional arc. The astrolabe and stardust function as micro-settings: tools that constrain choice (only falling stars activate them) and charge the final image (shimmering hands, cooled instrument). Sensory detail is selective (cold air, bone-deep vibrations) and filtered through Elara’s moonstruck perception. Every environmental element tightens around the dominant stake: freeing trapped creativity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glowing dune isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its luminescent crystals bloom where the archive edges shimmer, directly enabling access. The chess clock materializes *because* of the dune’s proximity, and the seedling roots *in its soil*, making environment causal to tactics. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—crystal veins, acidic soil, perpetual twilight—filtered through the guard’s occupational focus. The final image of the crystal-veined leaf unfurling ties setting to closure, charging rebirth with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mechanical rainforest is not backdrop but active crucible: brass vines, copper trunks, and species-specific metallic compositions directly shape tactics (convergence of seven tree types) and charge the closure (gear altered by forest frequencies). Sensory detail is purposeful—sound over sight—and filtered through Elian’s awakened perception. The setting constrains choice (only those with sixth sense hear the hum) and evolves causally (gear ripples in response). This micro-setting functions as both environment and tool, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The veiled ridgeway functions as micro-setting that charges the closure—the overlapping horizons and mist-laden path constrain perception and necessitate indirect movement. The star-stamped ticket and shoreline lullaby are tactile anchors woven into action. Sensory detail is selective (glow, foam, mist) and filtered through the liminal POV. However, the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options—it atmospherically supports rather than pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt fortress isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice. Cold thins the air “enough to taste,” snow hums against walls, dust swirls “like clouds,” and the piano’s locked lid demands a specific tool. These details aren’t decorative; they enable the discovery (dust reveals the bolt) and charge the ending (the bolt becomes a weapon). The setting’s sensory hierarchy reflects the bellhop’s hyper-attuned POV, and the recurring cobalt/snow motif reconfigures at closure—from prison to potential dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient temple library functions as both setting and weapon—its “graceful collapse” mirrors the usurper’s unraveling. Dust motes, tilting shelves, and starlight dome aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Kael’s method and charge the climax. The iron gall ink pellet—a micro-setting—directly enables the final act. Vivid, selective sensory detail (ceramic dish, reed brush, cold light) grounds the mythic in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sea level monitoring station isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its creaks, console flickers, and rusted frame constrain and charge every action. The atlas page, salt-fried parchment, and tidal vibrations are recurring objects that evolve in meaning and directly shape the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s professional attention—sound of creaking metal, feel of vibrations, smell of salt—and avoids visual dominance. The final image of receding station lights as “distant stars” ties environment to theme without overstatement.

The rusted fighter’s “folded hands” mirrors her prayerful posture, deepening thematic resonance without overt symbolism. Environment actively shapes her final stance—she roots herself where others left ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    The volcanic hot springs function as micro-setting: geothermal vents hide the amber, steam masks Maeva’s movements, and plant life enables telepathy—all constraining choices. Sensory detail is selective (steam, ferns, boiling water) and filtered through Maeva’s urgency. The final image of hybrid species sprouting charges closure by showing environment transformed by her act. Only minor deduction: the “twisted tree” feels slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The arboretum isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: salt spray dictates plant selection, wind shapes forms of endurance, and the cliff’s edge mirrors Maya’s psychological precipice. The lighthouse’s abandonment echoes her isolation, yet its keeper’s wisdom becomes soil for growth. Crucially, the greenhouse functions as micro-setting where the photograph’s repositioning charges the final image. Every sensory detail (salt-laced wind, churning sea) filters through Maya’s trauma-informed perception, avoiding tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)
    The forgotten library inside the lighthouse functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice: sagging shelves lean inward, books whisper, walls close then open—each detail mirrors and shapes the artist’s internal state. The lantern’s “Filterless light” and salt-damaged wood constrain perception and action, culminating in the final image where the setting itself approves (“the library sighed”). Every sensory detail serves the accumulative drive and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    The wind-carved encampment isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: sandstone shards crunch underfoot, scorched earth marks the sun’s return, and canyon walls whisper secrets only Kael now hears. The drone and ink vial function as tool-setting hybrids that constrain tactics (only the drone captures what eyes miss; only the ink reveals time’s map). Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael’s tracker POV—dust, light, silence dominate; description is woven into action (“boots crunching,” “fingers moving with precision”). The environment charges the final image: wind erases the ink just as Kael accepts disappearance as beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “echoing library under snow” provides strong atmospheric specificity and sensory cohesion, especially in early lines. However, the setting acts as backdrop rather than crucible—it doesn’t constrain Elara’s actions or alter outcomes. The snow and cold recur but don’t pressure decisions; they decorate theme instead of shaping causality.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    The desert rose farm isn’t backdrop but active constraint: the glass dome filters violence, shapes perception, and enables Elara’s work. Micro-setting functions powerfully—the sandbag scrap, the knife, the irrigation system—all tether character to place.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    The laboratory functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: antique cabinets hold instruments whose “ghosts of vibrations” pressure Orion’s work, and the grandmother’s desk supplies both letters and emotional gravity. Key objects (amber, firmware device, tattoo needle) are handled repeatedly, their states evolving (erratic static → harmony) to charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis—Orion notices “whiskey burning through wires” before visual details—and the meteor-hush weather subtly mirrors internal dissonance resolving to calm. Every detail serves the dominant stake: translating trapped sound into healing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its curved walls create whispering echoes, its damp stone receives chalk, and its silence shifts in response to Elara’s actions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—lilac unease, sparkling tile flake, vibrating sand—filtered through Elara’s artistic perception. The setting evolves causally: the emergent hush alters the grotto’s nature, which in turn shapes Elara’s method. Crucially, the grotto charges the final image, as the mandala’s glow reconfigures its very acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient plaza functions as micro-setting: its chipped mosaic constrains Elara’s actions (she must fit tesserae into voids) and charges the final image (the renamed stone vibrates with new meaning). “Shattered sky,” “skeletal walls,” and “warm coldness” are filtered through her trauma, avoiding tourist cataloging. The minaret’s glint ties spatial choreography to emotional arc. Every detail serves pressure or closure—no white-room syndrome, no static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)

Final chamber’s spiral shell pulses with iridescence that guides Elara, proving environment charges closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s profession—touch and vibration dominate over sight.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber warehouse, hourglass, and jar function as micro-settings that constrain and charge Elara’s actions—the dust, resin, slanted light, and spatial solitude all filter her perception and ritual. The setting evolves causally: walls dissolve into light after the prophecy unravels, tying environment to thematic transformation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., buttons “smooth with time,” “jagged” with imprints). However, the cliffs and warehouse don’t actively pressure choices beyond mood—they support rather than shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zephyr Bluff isn’t backdrop—it constrains action (wind erasing the snow code) and charges the ending (stone as witness to his vow). The pillbox functions as micro-setting: its cold silver and engraving trigger memory and decision. Sensory detail is selective (“mist swirled around his ankles like cold, ectoplasmic water”) and filtered through Elias’s spycraft-trained perception. Weather actively shapes tactics—the ephemeral snow cipher depends on thaw and wind.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fog-bound river crossing isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting that constrains perception, delays action, and charges the closure: the lifting fog coincides with revelation. The yarn needle (tool-as-setting) and the coachman’s body (steaming breath, sinking boots) function as environmental anchors that shape choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—drip of water, squelch of mud, tick of gutters—all serve the Accumulative lens. Final image gains power because the world shifts from gray ambiguity to “sharp” clarity, reweighting the entire vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as active crucible: scorched wasteland contrasts oasis; chimney stack hosts nexus; wildflowers and silent hives manifest temporal fracture. Lantern glass and smoke aren’t backdrop but tools that constrain Kael’s method. Final image—abandoned yet “lovely” oasis—reconfigures environment from battleground to sanctuary, proving setting charges closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects potter’s attention: touch (scratched glass), sound (thrum in teeth), sight (fractured light) all filtered through craft-trained perception.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)

The final image ties setting directly to theme: photos on stone become stars, resurfacing meaning from water.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall aren’t backdrop—they actively shape tactics (prismatic light cues timing, moss-stones dictate movement) and charge the closure (gardens pulse “like an orchestra to its conductor”). The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting: its perpetual transition mirrors Elara’s state and constrains her method (indirect flame). Sensory detail is selective (ozone + ancient sap) and POV-filtered through an alchemist’s attention.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    The nocturnal arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint: thin air sharpens focus, fog obscures options, and height necessitates the parachute. The buckle functions as micro-setting, its cold metal grounding abstraction into tactile reality. Final image charges the arbor’s patterns as “whispers,” transforming spatial solitude into thematic resonance. Sensory detail (insect wings like applause) is selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating rock dojo isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that pressures choice (edge = danger, void = consequence). The brain in the jar constrains tactics (must be vivified, not just claimed) and charges the final image (warmth against chest, silent companion). Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “stars realigning,” “synapses firing,” “air sharp and real.” The void’s evolution from chaotic to “unblemished night” mirrors Kael’s internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)

The rocking chair’s fading rhythm ties time to space, and the mask’s physicality charges the final image. Every atmospheric element tightens thematic pressure without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken city ruins function as active micro-setting: limestone walls echo lies, flooded tunnels threaten preservation, and sewer grates enable celestial alignment. Sensory detail is purposeful—acrid air, rust-traced condensation, ankle-deep water—filtered through Sebastian’s archaeological urgency. The chronometer cog and saltwater fauna aren’t just described; they constrain knowledge and tactics. Final image charges closure: moonlight on ruins contrasts state-sanctioned darkness, proving environment actively shapes meaning and resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “velvet library in autumn” functions as micro-setting: dust motes, tall windows with leaves, velveteen chairs—all constrain choice by creating a hushed sanctuary where sound must be intentional. The rosette itself acts as tool-setting, its carved patterns directly enabling transcription and tuning. Final image—lamp lit against autumn darkness—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lightning collection tower functions as a charged micro-setting: its silence after the blackout conveys systemic collapse, and its apex houses the hidden panel that enables the climax. The lacquer box and drone wing serve as intimate “settings” that constrain choice—Elias cannot lie about their meaning, and he ultimately relinquishes them. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“honeyed glow,” “whisper of the wind,” “cool surface”) and filtered through Elias’s grief and reverence. The nectar dusk evolves with emotional cadence, deepening as hope returns.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bay setting isn’t backdrop—it pressures choice: salt air thins the orris root’s scent, twilight dictates timing, streetlights mark ritual phases. The cottage’s “feverish vitality” contrasts Elm Street’s deadened house, making location essential. Objects function as micro-settings—the teacup, latch, shard—each constraining or enabling Elias’s actions. Final image (“hushed blaze”) fuses environment and theme, irreplaceable without loss of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underwater garden isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice: crushing pressure, phosphorescent algae, bronze flora, and the crystalline chime all shape tactics. The ampoule’s “structural weakness” and “foxglove stain” gain meaning through setting-specific physics (water warping glass, trapped air trembling with thought). Final image charges closure: the chime’s “pure note” animates the lifeless deep, making environment inseparable from theme. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The infinite staircase functions as a potent micro-setting that constrains choice (endless ascent) and charges the final image (its dissolution into soft-lit room). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the groan of stone, heavy air, chalk on steps—and filtered through Elias’s obsession. The dice serve as object-as-setting, their texture anchoring memory and proof. Only slight deduction: the “soft light” room lacks specificity, but this abstraction serves thematic resonance over spatial realism.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse functions as micro-setting: its clean air contrasts the smog-choked city, enabling Elara’s ritual, while the magnolia leaf and moonlight directly charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (damp earth, jasmine, saffron quiet), avoiding tourist cataloging. The brush’s ivory crescent tip and silver-dusted water constrain her method, making tools part of the environment. Only slight overreliance on visual descriptors in mid-text slightly dulls other senses.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    The grotto setting actively constrains choice: pooled aquifer water slicks floors, limestone walls absorb dread, and communal ovens become the only heat source against despair. Crucially, the emerald lens and baking tools function as micro-settings—the lens shows vanishing history, while dough becomes edible archive. Every sensory detail (verdant haze, yeast-thick air, wheat-and-ash taste) serves thematic pressure without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the hunger stone, yoyo, and lighthouse beam constrain and charge every key choice. The “bruised sky,” “glistening seaweed,” and “skeletal” lighthouse are filtered through the maker’s obsessed POV, not tourist cataloging. Crucially, the environment shapes the climax—the tide’s retreat enables access, and its return erases evidence. The stone’s transformation from marker to beacon directly fuels the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse functions as a dynamic micro-setting that actively constrains and channels choice—mirrors reconfigure paths, reflections dictate stakes. The opera cloak clasp acts as both tool and environmental anchor, its glow physically altering the space. Sensory detail is selective (chill air, burning metal, warped glass) and filtered through trauma. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the funhouse becomes a gallery only because its distortions were navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating orchard functions as both setting and micro-setting: driftwood constrains movement, saltwater roots define possibility, hollow fruit becomes instrument. Every sensory detail (indigo gradients, glistening orbs, resonant reeds) serves the thematic core and pressures the prophet’s actions. The blue hour’s liminal light tightens temporal stakes, and the sea’s emptiness charges the final image. Environment directly enables and shapes the central act—making music from impossibility.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The shell-city isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables: streets follow turtle grooves, the Great Elder’s dome is her vantage, the cracked shell yields the device. Tools (spyglass, whistle) and body (climbing, tracing) are micro-settings that shape tactics. Final image charges the setting: moonlight on shells frames her vigil. Sensory detail (bleached sun, humid air, orange-violet sunset) serves urgency and mood without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    The disused railway station isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: ivy “strangles,” decay mirrors moral rot, and spatial choreography (platform, flickering light, debris) constrains movement and mood. The rosebush’s petal drop charges the opening and reappears metaphorically at climax. Sensory detail (damp earth, groaning door, gilt edges brushing chest) is selective and POV-filtered. Final image of the silent station reweights the entire thematic arc—environment directly shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—Elias must work within tidal windows, navigate unstable foundations, and use water-resistant tools. Sensory detail is filtered through his professional gaze (concrete settlement patterns, acoustic design) and emotional history (glass shards reflecting sunset like memory fragments). The inkwell, boots, and shattered dome aren’t just described—they shape how he moves, documents, and perceives. Final image (“watery vigil”) charges the setting with thematic weight without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underwater library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: the dome, candlelight, and hydroelectric failure directly constrain action and perception. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—sunlight filtering through water onto notes in darkness mirrors the story’s core idea: light finds its way even in depth. Sensory detail (dappled shadows, sea songs beyond glass) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into cognition. The brass stamp and candle are tactile anchors that evolve with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the tea garden’s dew-slick tables, rocking isle, and glass basilica constrain and charge action. Tools (felt bench, diamond-tipped tool, beeswax) are tactile and consequential. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s obsession—lantern-light over rainbows, polish dust over tea aroma. The basilica’s “crystalline tomb” reweights the final crane-lifting moment, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating observatory functions as both setting and micro-setting: its failing systems create urgency, its isolation enables Elias’s work, and its thermospheric liminality mirrors his psychological state. The geode crystal acts as a recurring object that constrains choice—it’s not just symbolic but resonates with detected potentials, directly guiding his next move. Sensory detail is selective (humming circuits, cool blue glow, rough/amethyst contrast) and filtered through Elias’s grief-laced perception, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic futurism.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient observatory functions as micro-setting: its dormant telescope pulses in response to celestial proximity, directly enabling the climax. “Brilliant dimness” evolves from atmosphere to thematic tone, culminating in intensified liminal light at dawn. Spatial choreography remains clear—drone ascends, Kai at console, chip projects between telescope and interface. However, the desert landscape remains underutilized; setting constrains choice only partially, missing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt terrace functions as micro-setting: its color mirrors regret, its railing becomes an altar for the watch hand, and its stones shift hue with the emotional light. The forgotten shore is evoked sensorially through driftwood carvings that constrain Elias’s coping mechanism. Every detail serves thematic pressure—no tourist cataloging. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the terrace doesn’t actively foreclose options; it reflects rather than shapes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-worn parapet functions as micro-setting: wind, mist, and stone constrain movement and amplify tension (“wind intensified” during exchange). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—ocean salt, moisture on coat—not tourist catalog. The setting evolves with emotional beats and charges the closure image, though it doesn’t actively foreclose tactical options beyond atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal kayak launch functions as a charged micro-setting: gravel crunch, brine-and-decay air, and crooked utility poles directly shape Elara’s tactics and emotional state. The astronomical compass and fiberglass kayak are tactile, lived-in tools that constrain choices (e.g., avoiding the compass for weeks). Sensory detail is purposeful—salt on skin, brass coldness—and filtered through Elara’s professional bias (noticing pole alignment over tourist scenery). The lighthouse’s tidal inaccessibility adds environmental pressure that charges the final arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent lake isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: organisms part to reveal passage, light guides, water’s cold becomes the crucible for empathy. The baseball’s tactile warmth contrasts the environment, charging the final release. Every detail serves the theme: ripples mirror fractured memory, stone pedestal echoes ritual. The setting constrains tactics (wading in, following light) and directly shapes the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard isn’t backdrop but active crucible: luminous blossoms open only under reflected light, moss-stone altar holds memory, and moon-rolled spices bridge realms. These details constrain tactics (ritual requires specific flora/fauna) and charge closure—the final communion occurs amid impossible flowers that mirror their liminal bond. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: calm observation early, vibrational soil-perception during transformation. Only minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual lyricism in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The midnight glade functions as micro-setting: its “choking beauty” and temporal liquidity directly pressure the protagonist’s actions (e.g., air “sweetness” tightens her throat, flora absorbs her voice). The dolls’ saucer and onyx-inked skin act as recurring objects that constrain choices—she aligns her palm with the crack to unfasten seals. Sensory detail is vivid but purposeful, filtered through grief; however, the glade’s rules remain slightly ornamental rather than causally shaping tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its archival photos supply the tear’s trail, and its groaning systems react to dimensional thinning. Coldness, echoes, and preserved moments shape atmosphere without stalling momentum. The body (Elara’s lightness/heaviness) and Kwan Yin’s tear constrain action and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography lacks tactile specificity beyond floating and touching.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The black sand beach and active volcano aren’t backdrop but active micro-setting: the fissure guides the bug, the sand yields relics, the ocean’s indifference mirrors thematic stakes. Sensory detail is selective (crunch of sand, pulsing light, whispering hush) and filtered through Elias’s perception. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables key choices—digging, following, kneeling—and charges the final image: transformation made visible where fire meets water. This integration earns the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The luminous fort, twilight, and emergency torches create a tactile, constrained environment that pressures Elena’s movements. The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting—it constrains choice (only her lineage can use it) and charges the final image when inserted into the wall panel. Sensory detail is selective (cool metal, pulsing stones) and filtered through Elena’s sentinel priorities. However, the “half-painted sundial” isn’t spatially anchored strongly enough to fully shape tactics beyond decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal bluff isn’t backdrop—it’s an active mathematical sequence that resonates with the stones and nearly collapsed last month, directly constraining the herder’s precision. Aurora functions as both celestial clock and energy source, its rhythmic pulsing tightening urgency. Collapsed star dust hums with cosmic energy, and painted stones carry DNA-like symbols—micro-settings that charge the climax. Sensory detail (liquid silver eels, violet-emerald fire) is vivid yet filtered through the herder’s desperate focus, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its height, glass dome, and isolation directly charge the final stance (“liminal space between heaven and earth”). The darkroom timer and envelope are tactile anchors woven into action, not backdrop. Sensory detail is selective—cold stone, smudged ink, churning clouds—and filtered through the poet’s awe and rage. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a choice (e.g., no escape, limited tools), slightly missing the 9+ gate despite vivid atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its transparency amplifies tension, refracts light into “thousand tiny rainbows,” and blurs the outside world to isolate the intellectual duel. The brook’s rhythm syncs with narrative beats, quickening as conflict intensifies. Every sensory detail—the tin’s coolness, brass joints whirring—is filtered through Elias’s perception and serves thematic pressure. The sundial and needle card aren’t just described; they’re active tools that shape tactics and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “rusted library under stars” functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: scrap-metal shelves limit storage but symbolize defiance; solar lamps dictate nocturnal activity. Sensory detail is selective—peeling paint, coffee-tin mechanics, tattooed sleeves—and filtered through Elias’s scavenger POV. Final image (“banned flower blooming”) charges closure by tying environment to resistance. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent despite multiple characters.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal arbor functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its bioluminescence powers the projector, its flora reveals the map, its tidal pull manipulates time. Sensory specificity (“air smelled of salt and forgotten dreams,” “luminescent flora flickered like lanterns”) is filtered through the pianist’s urgent perception. The station below fades into atmospheric contrast, grounding the magical ascent in concrete spatial choreography. The setting directly charges the final image—the repaired clock, the settled compasses—making environment inseparable from resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ridge functions as a dynamic micro-setting: its blossoms are “physical manifestations of stories,” directly enabling the ritual. Sensory details (“sweet decay,” “hum of the ridge”) are filtered through Elias’s urgency and shape his actions. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the bowing, brighter blossoms confirm memory’s anchoring—and constrains the ritual’s location, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The breezy islet functions as micro-setting: wet earth, salt air, and tidal rhythms constrain and reflect Kenji’s emotional state. The antique lace and ghost ship’s compass are recurring objects that charge the final image—the compass needle settling toward the horizon reweights all prior longing. Sensory detail is selective (scent of wet earth, fragile-strong lace) and filtered through Kenji’s grief. The gnarled pine embodies scale and time, making the setting indispensable to closure.
