    The greenhouse as micro-setting constrains multiple choices: broken panes frame clouds "like equations," punctured roof requires plastic sheeting, silt patterns guide sweeping strokes. The butterfly-wing dust functions as both tool and recurring object, charging the final image when it resettles. Sensory detail is filtered through scientific POV (vortices, topography, angles) without catalog excess. The algae, tomatoes-to-filaments, and compost barrels layer texture that reflects urgency and decay. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The canyon as setting constrains the protagonist's method (frost on stone, silence as witness) and charges the final image with recurring motifs (cliffs answering thought, canyon listening). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sand chilling bones, wind thickening and thinning, frost filigree matching ledger edges), filtered through the glass artist's craft-based perception. The stone "whose surface gleamed like cooled crown glass" concretely ties setting to the character's idiom and enables the frost-reading action, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    The winterglass conservatory pressures choices throughout: ice-limned ferns store atmosphere, sensors map heat, mirrors herd currents, panes respond with "disciplined tides." The tuning fork case and the lattice of mirrors/heaters function as micro-setting tools that constrain the translation method. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the protagonist's priorities (frost lines, breath clouds, moth glow). The conservatory's architecture and the riverbank anchor both serve the closure image, with the conservatory becoming "an auditorium of light" where marvels are witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater library constrains every choice: thin water held by tired barriers, shelves that lean, books on tethers. The broken lens becomes a tool that shapes tactics (angling to vents, arranging mirrors), and the final image charges when the city keeps its lights as "patient registry." Spatial choreography is clean (service well descent, dome, reading desk, aisles), and sensory selection (kelp tea, candles, algae light) reflects urgency without catalog. The library's micro-setting—card catalog as address system—directly enables the closure solution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor anchors nearly every key beat (night book, bell hanging, patrol confrontation, final polishing) and its ridge position matters tactically ("tracks dissolved"). Sensory detail is selective: "frost prints," "pad-soft steps," "breath-white arbor" filter through collective attention. The bell as micro-object constrains choice (Mara holds it without ringing after the patrol) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear enough, though the larger village layout remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct's blooming vines, parapet, and arches provide concrete spatial anchors and the flowers "lean in like listeners," charging the closure image when lamps blossom and the bridge "hums like a tuning fork." The camera obscura box and Kwan Yin's tear vial function as micro-setting tools that constrain the protagonist's breathing practice. However, the river and arches remain somewhat atmospheric rather than imposing hard choices, and the foggy twilight soft-focuses physicality when sharper sensory detail could deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with purposeful, image-dense detail (roots that walk, bridges arcing "like a patient skeleton training itself," willow domes with ants stitching sun to shade) and the protagonist's embodied interaction—touching the shard, walking pages, descending underwater—charges multiple beats. The hyperbolic geometry reshapes space and distances in ways that constrain movement and create the retrocognitive trap. However, spatial choreography wobbles slightly: the pavilion "grown from willow domes" and the underwater vault of roots are evocative but their relative positions and transitions are sometimes unclear. The setting does constrain the final choice (the bridge beneath the water, the light path) and the textural specificity is consistent with the POV's design-oriented lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival prize center supplies concrete objects (piano bench, ticket conveyor, plush avalanche) that enable and constrain Mara's tactics; the setting is functional rather than ornamental. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and return. The seed vault's "rain held in jars" scent and the "dry hills...cracked like lips" create a sensory through-line that charges the ending when children will "trace maps along the fissures." Micro-setting (chain, keys, arrow) recurs and the final image links soil texture to the opening dust, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken orchard, aurora, and ashen forge create a vivid, otherworldly micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is lyric and selective ("shells cling to twigs," "aurora bled downward"), filtered through the protagonist's synesthetic perception. The forge constrains the climactic beat—imprinting the bowl requires its sediment-and-light heat—elevating the setting beyond postcard function, though spatial choreography within the greenhouse (aisles, bench, lanterns) remains impressionistic rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald station is vividly rendered through selective detail (green-bottled lake glow, moths reading bouquets, disused track through sycamore turnstile) and the jar of moonbeams functions as both micro-setting object and constraint: it guides the path, sweetens shadows, and ultimately charges the photographs. The freight door's hidden room—"cold with oil and stars"—supplies the spatial crucible for the climactic exchange. No occupational detail beyond the poetic craft itself, appropriate to this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The control room is anchored through concrete details: cracked leather bookmark, ice-laced panels, steel cabinets, green lamps. The kiln he drags in pieces and the melting ice provide sensory specificity filtered through Arlen's ceremonial attention. Critically, the setting constrains choice: he "could not turn the grid back on" but breeds heat from a fuel canister, and the room's acoustics return his voice "gentle, as if tuned by the thawing heart of the building." The final row of vessels on the console where ice had been charges the closure image with spatial transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library under stars is vividly anchored with iron stacks that "groaned like ships" and a skylight that hides the steel box. The cast with galaxy-painted constellations functions as micro-setting, constraining the decryption action and charging the final image when the child offers it "like a treaty." Spatial choreography remains clear across ladder-climbing and rooftop positioning. The seashell's tactile presence (pressed to ear, half-tucked in pocket) grounds sensory detail in goal-directed action, and the library's sibilant whispers interweave setting with character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-tossed fort constrains choice—wind forces the courier to hold the lantern away, rain bruises the gold leaf, wet stone becomes canvas. Sensory detail is filtered through the oracle's attunement to pauses: surf mistrust, gull's non-breath, wind's mending. The booklet and bleeding fingers function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (ridge, battlement, merlons, path).

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen courtyard constrains choices throughout: snow texture under treads, generator hum in F-sharp that the violin answers, plinth placement that shifts loop-to-loop. The transparent violin functions as micro-setting, charging the final image ("the transparent violin shines through me, as if thoughts were light"). Sensory hierarchy reflects the robot's professional priorities (frost patterns, surface states, acoustic resonance). The plaque listing "a storm scheduled for next week, which had already snowed yesterday" uses setting to dramatize temporal distortion without exposition. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves (steps, plinth, maintenance door, drifts).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal forecourt constrains the registrar's final choice—the bandstand and rain-screen setup are materially necessary for the projection—and the lens as micro-object charges the closure by enabling the doodles' revelation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "puddles murmuring like glass throats," "crystals listen, chiming at the edges." The post-rain setting recurs with purpose (wet screen, rain columns, bright ripples) rather than static description, and the "awnings where the last show shuttered" ties physical space to the broken projector conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The garden maze, dials, marbles, fountain, and vine function as micro-setting that constrains choices throughout: the maze grows a new corridor forcing confrontation, the dials register patience as measurable feedback, the cracked marbles anchor confession. The final image ("maze wore my age, and I wore its patience") charges the ending through accumulated spatial particulars. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"silver breath" of water, "warm ache" of night, hedges that "hiss"—filtered through the narrator's professional attention to plant behavior and ritual object-care.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station-as-harp metaphor, ravine compass behavior, vault smelling of ozone, and the lever "smeared with a century of anxious hands" create a tactile, strange micro-world. Spatial choreography is clean (plateau rim, corridors, vault, gantry rail, ravine). The lever and vault environment directly enable Jae's key choice—pulling it opens the temporal lattice—and the recurring "hush of beating wings at rest" returns in the closure beat to charge his whispered command. The mantas' physical return (shadows crossing "twice for every once") makes the abstract concrete. Gate met: environment constrains the middle choice (he must lean into the vault, risk surge) and charges the final image (vault singing faintly, delayed selves gliding past).

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    The flooded opera house is rendered with vivid, selective detail (swollen boards, lanterns hung like tired moons, sandbags puffed like lungs) and the environment constrains choice: the musician must step on reflections only, and the portrait's mouth opens only when light/water/print align. The recurring interplay of water, lantern light, and reflection charges the final image (the house rests as the water settles). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and micro-setting (the program, the beads, the portrait) functions as setting that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The weather station's galvanized rooms, barometer, anemometer, and lee platform constrain multiple choices: the oracle's timing ("prefers quiet when the wind tilts"), the outdoor ritual with the gentian, and the stance-widening exercise. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, handled across three beats and charged at closure. Snow and auroral coloring are filtered through the protagonist's grief-laden perception. Minor cap: the station's hum and specific tools could exert slightly more tactical pressure in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel's cold, dripping arch, and the valve wheel as micro-setting constrain the protagonist's actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's engineer bias: "beads of condensation ringed it like a rosary," "droplets quivered like verdicts." The radio and metronome of dripping water anchor the narrator's focus and modulate with pressure. The valve wheel itself becomes the setting's fulcrum, and opening it is both spatial act and thematic resolution. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the tunnel's acoustic properties (echoes, hush) intensify the atmosphere and reflect the protagonist's internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is vivid, purposeful, and charged: moss-veined aisles, dripping stone, the obsidian refuge, and the origami swan all function as micro-settings that constrain movement and choice. The swan's folds guide navigation ("counted seven pleats, and the wall sighed"), and the obsidian room provides shelter with regenerative properties that enable the keeper's survival. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the keeper's priorities (ink fermentation, stalactite ticks, gravel cadence). The catacombs' physicality shapes the keeper's tactics during the flood, and the final image of the swan "softened by oil from countless consultations" charges closure. Environment actively participates in pressure and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The eclipse functions as both setting and constraint: thinning light forces the shift beneath the tree, totality creates the hush that charges Ada's gesture, and the return of incremental sunlight paces the denouement. The locket as micro-setting (metal ticking against wedding band, humming on guitar strings) constrains and enables the narrator's therapeutic link. Sage, dust, and the tree's "dreaming roots" are filtered through the narrator's patient attention and anchor every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reclaimed silo library is vividly anchored through selective, purposeful detail: ladder rungs, binding twine, corrugated skin, welded rings. Micro-setting elements (the brass disk, the flue, the tapestry fragment) constrain the historian's choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent with the POV's professional priorities—listening to brick tone, feeling for leaves the fire spared—and the displaced axis reweights spatial logic throughout, contributing directly to the ending's pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting details are filtered through the fortune-writer's voice ("neon fizzed out like a tired constellation," "causeway while the tide thought things over"). The lighthouse constrains the climactic choice: its lens becomes the tool for projecting fortunes. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from harbor to causeway to lighthouse interior. The body and immediate objects (envelope sweating against ribs, sticky hands with sugar and salt) charge the final image. Minor: the town's layout beyond harbor/causeway/lighthouse remains impressionistic, acceptable at this length under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The chapel as "dimensional anchor" constrains the entire premise: if Ilario fails, "the neighborhood would tilt forever." The loop pedal is handled across multiple beats (recording absence, catching breath, stacking it into "a visible ladder"), and the ultramarine palette becomes a tactical mirror that traps the whisper. Spatial choreography is clear (altar, front pew, shoulder touch), and the setting's metaphysical rules remain consistent. The street "straightening a fraction" at the end charges the closure image with environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Glass spire, frozen lake, frost-pane, and nautilus shell constrain the conductor's method: notches on frost become the score's staff, the shell marks crescendos by fog. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "whale-slow groans beneath the mirrored horizon," "dust turned sunbeams into measured bars." The body and shell function as micro-setting that charges the final image when "the shell cools, sated." Spatial choreography remains coherent across the room, sill, and window.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct after rain anchors spatially and sensorially ("neon guttering," "wet stone," "cooled wires") and the puddles function as micro-setting: they rearrange to prescribe sequence, constrain the glide, and release "back to chance" at closure. The rain-tablet interaction (water chasing grooves, sanding smooth) is tactile and purposeful. However, the piece leans heavily on atmospheric abstraction ("darkening brightness," "caustic starlight") that creates mood without concrete constraint, and the middle arch moment feels more symbolic postcard than lived spatial pressure. The body and tablet together charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but pervasive lyric vagueness prevents full command.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cavern constrains action: basalt that "swallowed sound into velvet" creates the necessary acoustic environment for the backward-song experiment. The broken phonograph needle, drum, and hides function as micro-setting that shapes the ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's tactile focus: she reads palms, feels prickles, closes eyes to feel rather than hear. The cavern "bowed back with a breath she felt" charges the final departure image with reciprocal acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard at dusk functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the fig and arch enable the lateral escape, the fountain's metronome rhythm charges the atmosphere, and the bench becomes the stage for the decoy exchange. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("barometric tremors braided with rumor," "dusk pooled"). The storm recorder's professional lens (isobars, pressure geometry) colors perception throughout, and the final window and lamp ground the closure image with tactile presence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto—terra-cotta walls, breathing pulse, dust floor as palimpsest, stalagmite anchor—constrains the poet's choices: looping the rope, kneeling, patterning footprints. Starlight replaces the lantern, charging perception. The grotto's "centuries of water and fingertips" recurs when the being shows canyon-river layers, tying setting to theme. Micro-setting (rope around waist, dust under footsteps) directly shapes the unveiling action and primes the mirror moment, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks functions as micro-setting that constrains the gathering and charges the final image: tide "drifts the greenhouse doors ajar," the orchard breathes "a patient bellows in the ribs of glass," and receding water leaves footprints on the steps. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("roots drinking brackish light," "barnacles hold their breath"), filtered through the violinist's acoustic perception. The wrecks "keep watch" and their "keel timbers...loosen" under the music, converting setting into active presence rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("honeyed hush pressed between stones," "fossils like almonds in glass") and constrains the encounter through its static-charged atmosphere. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final beat when Rhea presses it to her wrist. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor gap: the grotto's properties feel more atmospheric than tactically essential—the static could occur elsewhere with minor adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "breezy library under stars" with "lamps sway and gulls gossip" offers vivid sensory texture, but spatial choreography remains vague—colonnaded roof, circulation desk, display cart, and roof rehearsals never cohere into a navigable layout. The locket photo and ledger function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate in principle. Sensory hierarchy is uneven: wind and gulls recur as ambient detail without filtering through Mara's professional or emotional priorities. Occupational detail (manifests, pier logs, demurrage) appears but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian shards, and crater function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the arbor's former location, the shards integrated into the new frame, the posture toward crater and orchard. Sensory detail is selective and charged ("void-sun," "stardust sugar," "dusk-blue panes"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (orchard lip, fruit-pillar, ring of bodies). The recurring crater hum and orchard chime signal permission and charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop canal system constrains movement and supplies the medium for echoes. Spatial choreography is precise: "spine-ladders," "sluice," "rail," "gutter to gutter." The pendant-against-water interaction and the "thin oval" shape emerging in the canal charge the closure image. The giant's breath cycle functions as micro-setting, pressuring the timing of borrowing. Sensory detail is POV-filtered: "hush, rush, hush, rush, a metronome of rain and stone."

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cavern orchard—mineral blossoms, dripping stalactites, fruit like cooled tears—is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting. The stalactites provide the rope-anchor point and the drip-count for time, directly enabling the ritual. The stepping stone placed "on a flat root" and the eyes catching moonlight through a fissure are specific environmental constraints that shape the conjuring. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, reflecting the conjurer's grief-charged attention without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library setting is vividly particular: crawl space, vent lattice, pipe chases, atlas case hollow, grate behind velvet chair. These micro-settings constrain the dweller's movement and enable his cache-based solution. The outage functions as both atmospheric intensifier ("sapphire hush") and tactical enabler (lowers interference for the tape fragment). Sensory detail is purposeful—cedar, dustlavender, iron—and filtered through the protagonist's tactile focus. The northeast pipe chase and boiler riser anchor the tape's activation, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mossy trellis and storm-season setting constrain choices (vines untie after thunder, plants drift in the weather) and charge the final image when Mara presses the linden leaf to the post. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional attention (runoff smell, drip metronomes, roughness blessing her palm). Spatial choreography remains clear across the nursery, hall, and return. The setting directly enables the protagonist's shift from arranging to witnessing, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island constrains every choice: evacuation debris, peat seams, tide schedules, foxfire-lit convergence zones. Micro-setting excels—amber lodged in peat, puddles filming with sky, church bones as spatial anchor. The brooch pressed "exactly where a crack waited like a mouth" charges the closure image with textural specificity. Sensory hierarchy filters through painter's attention (gleam, color as treaty) and keeper's barnacle apologies, maintaining POV discipline throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cave actively constrains choice: crystal ribs ring when they breathe, the pearl trembles at the scent of flour, the highest stalactite receives the offering. Micro-setting (the chamber, the bell of silence, overlapping shadows as pathway) charges multiple beats and the final image. Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through the clairvoyant's perceptual bias ("bright darkness, the color of listening"). Spatial choreography remains clean despite lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ivory harbor, kelp-and-iron catalog drawers, fogged window, and valve constrain micro-choices (tapping rhythm, tracing parade route, valve ports opening/closing). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("beads with the last slow drops," "boots squeaking"). The window functions as micro-setting, enabling the tapping collaboration. Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8.0: the harbor itself remains more lyric backdrop than active constraint on a pivotal choice, though the window and valve do press.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Setting elements (cobblestones, mist, depot, train, fortress) are vivid and purposeful. The phantom train ticket punch functions as a recurring object that the protagonist uses at two key beats (raising it at the depot, pressing it into air, laying it at the fortress mouth). Spatial choreography across multiple locations (square, depot, train, platform, fortress corridor) remains mostly clear. However, the "starlit vault in mist" functions more as atmosphere than as a constraint that shapes a tactical choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tower is vivid ("stone rib cage facing constellations"), micro-setting details (parapet, transit scope, roof's horizon) constrain choices (laying the tile under the scope, aligning corners to the whale road). Whale migration functions as temporal and atmospheric pressure; the breaching pod at midnight aligns with the magic square columns, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is selective (spume, starlight, tiny salts). The "room" that opens is abstract but purposeful, serving as metaphorical setting that enables the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prismatic escondite, obsidian mirrors, and auroral storm provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through the narrator's dimensionally aware perspective. The storm and magnetic fields enable the ritual, and the prisms "tasted his breath" and "flickered approval," constraining the attempt. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (shelf, trapezoid of mirrors, corridor). However, the escondite functions more as atmospheric stage dressing than as a feature that directly alters a choice at closure; the corridor itself does the constraining work, and the final image pivots on relational stance rather than environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prep room is vivid and functional: "citrus, ethanol, and deathly vitality," steel table, pumps, vents, service elevator, and the bolt the director leaves hanging all constrain and enable the escape. The vintage ink pot and cabinet anchor micro-setting, and the dolly-roll through the hallway while the floor polisher drones creates spatial choreography that shapes the breach. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's mortuary professional lens (rinsing instruments, gel on skin, towels and tubing as theater). The ink pot's "rings like the timeline of a small moon" charges the final image when it returns to the cabinet after signing witness, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, stone basin, and glass shard all constrain the stationer's ritual and charge the final image. The lamp's hum becomes the measure and memory ("pinned to my pages like moth wings"); the bonsai "answer with very small winds" when pressed, making environment an active participant. Micro-setting (notepad's cardboard back bearing impressions) serves as archive. Spatial choreography is clean across summit, shed, and basin. The frozen basin scene reweights light-as-medium with tactile cost ("gilding its edge with cold").

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth is lived-in and purposeful: red/blue corridors guide the search, refrigerated-unit vents deliver the overheard clue, the label's storage under a foreman's magnet matters, and the final crate staging of the label charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "oily constellations," "corrugated walls," "bitter" taste on fingertips. The port's tidal rhythm recurs as both temporal anchor and thematic heartbeat. Micro-setting (the label, the crate, the vent) constrains choices and the ending image depends on the container stack where narrator and widow meet.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's dome, cliff, and interior (glass vials, tripod, lighthouse ribs) constrain the myth buster's ritual and charge the final image—he bows to the dome, which "keeps humming" after he leaves. The shell and cello function as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats (tuning, shell against wood, bow drawn, shell cooling) and altering tactics (the compass "spins without moving" only when he thinks of failure). Sensory selection is purposeful (wind tasting the string, room smelling like rain, lacquered stars biting his palm) and filtered through the protagonist's metaphorical idiom. The cliff and gulls recur to frame and close, reinforcing spatial coherence. A slight density in figurative language risks ornamentation, but the objects remain tactile and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The raft city's carnival environment constrains multiple choices: VIP fences redirect foot traffic, the ballast-hold console reads the chip's "bite," murals whisper corrections "you could only hear with your feet," and the drum barge provides the confrontation setting. Sensory selection is purpose-driven (cobalt streaks, copper dots, salt and oil grime on the chip) and filtered through Nessa's professional lens as culture shock absorber. The carnival's physical properties—tents breathing like lungs, rafts realigning like ribs—ground the final act and charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit crater functions as more than backdrop: the seam of ancient snow constrains the moth's survival, the rim's fresh strikes record "a ledger of urgency," and the stillest air in the bowl shapes where the chemical plume drifts. The timed vials (blue for ten minutes, ochre for five, white for hush) operate as micro-setting objects that gate the moth's appearance. Sensory detail is filtered through professional priorities (focus checks, camera placement) and modulates with urgency—description tightens as dawn approaches. The final image charges the crater as "cathedral," repurposing earlier spatial anchors with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-coated depot, water bowls, and the rail environment constrain every choice: fog scrambles landmarks, bowls translate feedback, droplets under the eave provide new coordinates. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the artisan's acoustic and tactile priorities (chain vowels, wheel-chatter, rain's drumhead). The hummingbird's arcs, the coupling cars' alignment, and the spatial choreography of porters/crew remain coherent across moves. The final image charges the setting: "the depot returns the smile in the language of settled wheels."

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The outpost, lake, and culvert constrain every choice: cracking ice forces the editor under the hill; the valves "like hard hearts" require the prayer and turn that trigger convergence. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered—"girders hummed like teeth pressed tight," "reeds that clacked their teeth in slow panic"—and the recurring condensation-on-glass motif charges the final image when "the pattern on the window thinned, the prophet content once the sermon concluded." The body (breath, palm, fogged glass) functions as micro-setting. Spatial choreography from outpost to shore to culvert to locker is clear and causally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway, cobblestones, and square are used to constrain the tuner's method and charge the ending image ("beneath the archway...the town answered with feet"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"wild hush," "dust," "thyme"—and integrates action without catalog. The cistern's "breath that was almost a chord" and the crack in the bronze bell supply tactile constraint. Spatial choreography is clean across the square, church, and farm road.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater temple constrains the protagonist's choices—narrow corridors scrape the tank, silt swallows the lamp—and the acoustics ("gathered hush") charge the final image by enabling the signal. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "anemones that blink like patient eyes," "bruise of brown," pressure as "a hand." Micro-setting (the frieze, the column, the vial as floating object) functions as purposeful constraint. The temple's spatial choreography remains coherent across the swim, and the final fadeout ("temple fading behind me like a star at noon") anchors closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse prison is richly particular: "copperlight repose," "metal stairs warm as coins," "salt turned the locks green," "porthole shaped like a keyhole." The setting constrains movement (narrow door, spiraling stairs, lantern room) and the lattice interacts with architecture (speaking tube, lantern room, drain) to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear from pier to corridors to cell to roof to drain, and the reef's "teeth ready" signals threat without cluttering the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse—glass arterial with vines, shrouded in endless night—constrains the keeper's entire practice: chimes, grafts, night harvest. The carved stone bead "chimed without moving, summoning silence," a micro-object that acts as setting anchor and charges the closure when hung in the doorway. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wet linen and unrung bells," "steam wrote names on the panes"), and the winter-cracked fields frame the night-orchard's refusal of dawn. The setting presses every choice and the final image—"the orchard learned to warm its own dark"—is inseparable from the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The labyrinth setting is vivid and layered—"rust and thyme," "flood lines tattooed on its teeth," mirror-water basins—and the plate acts as a micro-setting element that charges the final altar moment. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (tether, mooring spire, altar), though the canyon's internal geography occasionally floats. The setting does constrain choice: the chalk map guides moves, the socket accepts the plate, and the sluices open in response to Sera's ritual. The final image (plate at the altar, tether strung on the pier) ties setting to closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored (tree roots braiding skulls, quince trees, trench shadows) and recurs across beats with escalating sensory detail (dew on sundial base, wind that smells of leaves and turned pages). Micro-setting constrains action: the sundial base provides a literal anchor for rebuilding, and root-bone tangles guide the re-placement of objects. Spatial choreography remains clear (trench, stele, orchard perimeter). The orchard functions as both literal dig site and charged symbolic field, with the final orbit around stele/sundial crystallizing the narrator's new relationship to place.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The golden arcade at dawn is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail ("vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes," "mosaic gold," "vans cough themselves awake") and the setting constrains action: the chalk codes exist "because nobody patches camera filters for rainbows close to the ground," and the ebony clipboard serves as a portable work surface against stone. The micro-setting of the bench underside and the busker's machine violin both enable discovery and shape the final choice of the pseudonym "Auricle." Spatial choreography remains clear across the arcade's arches and the protagonist's movements.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is grounded early (cobalt, domes, brass rails, eternal candle, telescopes, unused charts) and sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's craft bias (dust constellations, cloth trembling, candle bending). The eternal candle constrains a mid-beat choice (cupping with glass glove, contracting flame when blood is added) and charges the final image (set near window to watch). Spatial choreography is clean. Minor gap: the coup and falsified star charts remain conceptual backdrop rather than pressing the narrator's immediate movements; the setting enriches atmosphere more than it narrows tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mangrove setting, blackwater mirror, lantern fog, and condensation messages are vivid and POV-filtered, creating atmosphere. The shard functions as a recurring object that charges the final image ("let the shard's edge lie quiet upon my skin"). However, the environment does not constrain a present choice—navigation is symbolic, not spatial. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, but the micro-setting (body, tool) needed to reach 9+ is present without forcing a tactical trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mist-clad atrium grounds action throughout; the coral fragment functions as micro-setting, recurring in hand and later placed at bedside. The cast itself becomes setting-as-archive, constraining the translator's method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "rain ticking like type," "kestrels coil into sleep like commas." The hospital palms and monitors provide spatial coherence. The coral's grooves guide the translator's pauses and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog, orchard remnants, and wells function as micro-setting that constrains the projection work and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "fog hung from branchless trees like old theater curtains," "citrus ghosts and the slick rot of barrels." The fresco fragment and film reel are handled tactilely across beats, grounding the abstract "painting with light" in physical action. Spatial choreography is clear; the tripod, stump, and wells anchor movement without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound-wave garden's parabolic dishes are not merely backdrop—they structure every beat via echo mechanics that shape the restoration technique. The hobo nickel functions as micro-setting (bell, oracle, straightedge) and charges the final image ("tiny star to ring," "mapping the air"). Sensory detail is purposeful: "sun warmed," "cricketing rhythm," temperature shift, texture on sleeves. The curved wall itself is both canvas and interlocutor, constraining method and enabling nested discoveries. The setting is indispensable to closure: without the acoustics, the questioning-reply structure and the mural's awakening collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (bees, hornworms, moths, lacewings, fig trellis, heat) and constrains tactics: Kline lends it after hours, the glass and benches become the stage for the final confrontation, and the insects serve as both cover and punctuation. The gardens function as micro-setting, their plant patterns (calendula, beans, trellis angles) encoding the messages that drive the plot. The city's audit towers and allotments are mapped but remain more conceptual than grounded; spatial choreography in the climax (side doors, threshold, crate) is clear. The environment charges the final image (bees carrying the refrain, officers stepping over the bean-line) and supplies the resources (insects, plants, permits) that shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting, constraining the poet's movements and framing the encounter with the Gardener. Sensory detail is vivid but heavily metaphorical ("walls holding echoes of ink and salt," "nacre," "drip and creak"), filtered through lyric voice rather than urgent perception. The shell's chambers and gardens evolve causally, and the final image of tides rocking the shell home charges the ending. However, spatial choreography is abstract; we never track exact positions or distances, and the shell's scale fluctuates without clear anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful: "corridors curve like ribs of a sleeping whale," "tethered balloons stitched from cloudskin," "kit hangs from my belt: needles of moonbone, sap-gold thread." The physical tools (lantern, kit, feather broom) recur and constrain action across beats, and the balcony where the chime is rung shapes the closure image. The library's floating architecture and the anchors checked at the end charge spatial coherence with subtle pressure. Minor: some description (skylights, desks numbered by echo) remains atmospheric rather than action-constraining, but the core micro-setting (kit, chime pillow, balcony) integrates tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive functions as more than backdrop: shelves "sigh," the room "has a throat," and spatial details (lamp, high windows, shadow behind stairs) are woven into the action. The glass ink well and Breviary pages become tactile instruments that the protagonist handles across beats. However, the "salt ravine" excavation site remains abstract, and occupational verisimilitude (what makes a linguist "arcane," how one "pitches the room as an instrument") is gestured at rather than grounded in specific method. The final threshold image—"dawn uncoupled from the night"—charges the closure moment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amphitheater's breathing rhythm recurs purposefully and shapes the closure image ("as the building breathes, I breathe with it"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "powder that frets the air like pale pollen," "sugar bitterness," "grit that smelled of both markets and ash beds." The antique surveyor's chain constrains the solution—its "measured sag traced the true compromise line the mountain would accept"—charging the final tuning with spatial and mechanical specificity. Spatial choreography (terraces, stage slit, pit, pipes) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The attic is vividly anchored (foxed atlases, buckled ledgers, single skylight, beam) and functions as micro-setting: the skylight's broken latch creates the peak physical challenge, the dust motes become a navigational tool, and the mars chip "stops against a knot, as if the house held it." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dust "sweet," light "blooming withering," the violinist's bow "rasps truth"). The setting constrains choices (clearing of the attic forces urgency) and charges the final image (standing under the skylight mapping dust). Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its facets translate sunlight into unstable color, the bench grain becomes a legible map, and the seam in the floor opens as threshold rather than door. The terrace's tilt and the way it "sighed downward" to reveal the orchard of shadows directly enable the narrator's climactic choice to remain rather than descend. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's surveyor-like attention—sap knots, cracks, sugar-glass wind—and the environment evolves causally (seam opens after codes align with grain). Spatial choreography is clear across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater city is vividly specific (seaweed hatch, glass fronds, corroded port, cracked observatory dome) and micro-setting details (burnt feather as conductor, kelp-wrapped copper) constrain the method of entry. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. The setting charges the final image: "the city felt almost native" and the protagonist's maps "breathe with me," directly tying environment to closure stance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The iridescent cave, crater glass, pool, and migrating bird create vivid, distinct anchors. Sensory detail is selective and poetic—"Light moves like patient fish," "seeds settle into a map"—and filtered through the recollectionist's idiom. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (kneeling, stepping deeper, pausing at the pool, scattering seeds). The setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a stage for contemplation rather than pressure, capping the score below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt, copper, wet shadows, moon-painted chessboards on water) and remains spatially coherent throughout. The setting actively constrains and enables: the puddle becomes a chessboard, the tide steals coins, the arcade ribs "breathe with moonwater." The bishop on the music case, the chalk lines, and the coin circles function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Occupational detail (street performer's tools, accordion, music case) integrates naturally without exposition. This qualifies for the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image), but minor ornamental descriptions (e.g., "harbor janitor collects cups with the sympathy of old maps") occasionally drift toward metaphor-for-metaphor's-sake, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden is anchored early with sensory specificity ("lantern gnats," "round basin," "leaf and star") and the basin's reflected moon becomes a charged recurring object. The moonstone dust speck functions as micro-setting, constraining the tattooing method and charging the final image when tucked away with "soft gravity." The garden's rules—"scent and shadow keep no registries"—directly enable the clandestine act and pressure the protagonist's choice to remain and operate covertly. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pearl Bay at dawn anchors with sensory specificity: salt, gull cries, tar-and-yeast boat shed, round pond behind the bait shack. The pond functions as micro-setting, constraining the method (stone-throw divination) and charging the closure image (the circles widening, the boy's grin). Spatial choreography is coherent across harbor windows, pond, and boat shed meeting. The noctilucent clouds and mist are filtered through the glazier's occupational lens (debts to wonder, breath becomes window), and the old ferry ramp is both memory and material that will reappear as benches. Environment subtly mirrors the theme: fog bent into colors, ordinary mornings already luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit ridge is consistently present and constrains the meeting (neutral ground "where the wind always arrives honest"). The porcelain box functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the closure when it becomes empty yet "heavier than air." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "breath making small fogs," "ash-scented breath" of paper. The town's dark below with "houses blinked like eyes that would not open" grounds spatial stakes without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with tide, stone, torchlight, and sea glass, anchoring who/where/when by the opening lines. The gauge constrains choice: its needle positions dictate when to set patterns and release balloons. The final image of scattered tin on the village path charges the ending with environmental proof of change. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-mottled brass, obsidian water). Minor note: the pines-to-sand alternate shore is a single visual without tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is specific and purposeful: ivy-veiled passage, half-burned fireplace, seaweed-braided towers. The hopscotch grid in dust and the negative held to the doorway are micro-setting uses that constrain the protagonist's method (play the room to know it). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("soot," "coals," "lime"), and the drowned district's post-climate particulars shape the cartographer's vocation. The final image of the house on "stilts of memory" charges the setting with thematic weight, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and water-hung studio are vivid and purposefully layered; the droplets function as lantern-guidance, and the mirror becomes a charged object when it shows futures rather than hospital pallor. The body's borrowed heartbeat and tremor anchor micro-setting throughout. However, the studio's hanging water-strands and reflected gardens remain postcard-textured—they enrich atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, keeping the score below the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Terrace stones, fennel, thyme, coastal wind, and shell casings ground the setting early. The bowl of casings functions as micro-setting/object-as-setting: it charges the closure when both sides hold it jointly and vow annual return. Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, table, sea view); sensory detail is selective (lemon-tinted water as caution, lanterns as small moons). The terrace's cracked stones—"flawed beauty"—recur and constrain the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate (environment charges the final image). No occupational jargon intrudes; the ritual objects (clipboard, casings, olive branches) are purposefully filtered through the negotiator's priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The salt flat constrains movement ("cut his boots," "sting" of pressed palm) and the oculus chamber shapes the ritual's mechanics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "glittered with hard crystals," "throb," "powder drifted like frost." The cracks-as-map and suspended egg create a micro-setting that charges the final image when rain begins. Spatial choreography remains clean across all moves, and the environment directly enables the protagonist's choices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and underground looms are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("lanterns bled tiny suns," "starless tunnels remembered rivers"). The bowl of snow functions as micro-setting, gathering echoes and enabling the underground maneuver. Spatial choreography (courtyard center → grate → tunnels → return) remains coherent. The prism and bowl constrain the ritual's mechanics and charge the final image when the bowl is cupped then set upon the prism, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The decommissioned radar dome constrains the action: its amplifying hush and curved shell shape the promise and the participatory performance structure. Sensory details—"meteor hush," "ribs of the scaffolding," vellum "like a puddle of moon"—are vivid but occasionally drift into metaphor that obscures spatial choreography (e.g., "strings crisscrossed the dome like constellations" is atmosphere, not blocking). The dome's architecture directly enables the final design where "the audience became the cast by degrees," charging the closure image. Micro-setting (vellum, coil of rope, campfire stick) integrates well.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is anchored early and vividly (verdant, cave-mouth water, moss, green light). Micro-setting elements—resin bead, pebbles, fern stems—are handled across beats and constrain the narrator's method of honoring. The recurring moth wing and its placement "where the wind would not tear it free" charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's attentive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The braided rope, furnace, skylight, and aurora function as integrated micro-setting, constraining each action (braid positions control shutters and light). Sensory detail is purposeful and vivid ("smell like pennies and pine sap," "breath made brief roses"). The bells' asymmetric shapes and the triangle configuration charge the final image. The icebound locale and auroral fire provide concrete environmental pressure without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bunker setting is vivid and functional: "alphabetized by roots and the gossip of rain," "old concrete hums with patience," the wafer seal's brittleness, and the archive's physicality ("rustles like a creature learning to breathe") all constrain choices. The storm's approach tightens the timeframe, the drone's riddle about a door that eats shoes seeds the final door, and the forest's "spongey loam" and lightning anchor the climactic corridor walk. The setting charges the final image when the bunker "exhales again, satisfied to be a lung without a captive," reconfiguring the space from prison to partner.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The palace functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: cracked drains yield the tile, bronze pins anchor wires, alcove plaster buckles, and Saturn's clearing becomes a tactical clock for wire alignment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air hummed against my teeth," "coolness that smelled of reeds"—and the final wire-singing recurs with changed meaning. The setting charges the closure image (wires as the covenant's embodiment) and tools (wires, cistern water, bitumen thread) are handled across multiple beats. No occupation-depth penalty applies; the astronomical framing is germane and plausible without exhaustive system detail.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary is vividly realized through selective sensory detail: walls soften, floor ripples, hush strokes, moonless light pools. The music box—a small recurring object—constrains the climactic beat when Rell touches it and the world stops pretending stability, charging the final image when the narrator presses it into his hands. Spatial choreography is clean (center, threshold, door/wall shifts) and the setting's rule (shifting grace adjusts until the body says yes) directly pressures Rell's transformation. Micro-setting (the box, the lid, the cylinder pin) functions as purposeful constraint and charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard (skeletal apples, rotting rows, rime-sunk boots) provides spatial scaffolding and micro-setting pressure: mirrors align "with winters of bark," the chipped lens fractures twilight "into a constellation of silent bees," and the corridor itself is built between two apple rows. Sensory anchors are vivid and purposeful (frost like quiet ash, fog climbing trunks like memory of breath) without catalog excess. The sextant's crooked arc and the mirrors constrain the ritual's geometry, and the final image—fog keeping "a seam bright as glass mountains at dawn"—charges the closure by fusing setting tone with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography remains legible across beats (Ilen unfurls mirrors in a ragged corridor, Noor sets the arc, they face each other). The orchard's thaw (rows loosening like shoulders after labor) evolves causally with the dream's settling. Minor: some elevated diction ("hazard of glory when sunlight is all blade") risks ornament, but remains anchored in Ilen's carpenter-mystic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard-in-rafters setting constrains the repair work (climbing, spatial choreography of limbs and bell) and charges the closure image (the ribbon tied to the bell rope, grafted to a branch). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("peaches and pears," "air tasted like the first bite after fasting") without postcarding. The quartz eye's refraction into ceiling rainbows and the choir-floor geography are consistent. The micro-setting (bag contents, pruning hook, bell rope) functions as tool-as-setting, shaping tactics. Meets the 9+ gate criterion (environment constrains choice and charges final image), but minor breadth in mid-story descriptors ("lush," "heavy with") prevents full 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The astral orchard supplies vivid particulars—star-plums with whispers, roots hiding silver pods, the grove that inhales "like tide in a seashell"—and the bathroom pod functions as micro-setting where philosophical breakthroughs occur, priming his final inquiry. The cameo pressed to bark charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard, pod, and forbidden grove, and sensory detail (tap water smell, ticking cameo, rustling leaves) is filtered through the curator's peculiar attention.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (peppermint bark, distant thunder, dust and unread melodies) and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves. The botanical diary functions as micro-setting, constraining navigation choices and charging the closure when leaves unpress and sprout questions. Environment shapes tactics (following missing atlases, warming pages, reading gaps) and supplies the final image's setting (lectern of petrified moss). The mountain's temperamental rearrangement applies situational pressure throughout, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival ship supplies rich atmospheric anchors: barnacled ticket booth, salt-furred prizes, paint-stripped carousel horses. Spatial choreography remains coherent across decks, hatch, prize room, and bow. The emerald swatch card functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the protagonist's path (held to bulbs, horses point toward hatch, held against horizon to reveal garden), satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; fog, cold soil, and "bruise-colored circle of hush" add texture, but taste and kinesthetic sensation are underused during physical moves (climbing, pouring).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The clock tower mechanism room is anchored with vivid, purposeful detail (brass, rope braids, bell wheel) that shapes the protagonist's actions. The rope—worn, dark with centuries—functions as micro-setting, constraining his method and charging the closure when he "tightens the rope carefully, laying each loop as if tucking in a sleeping child." Sensory selection is filtered through the archivist's professional priorities (catalog numbers, vellum scent). The piece does not require deeper occupational systems at this length, and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harmonic caves constrain choice throughout: archways become bells, corridors hold or amplify sound, ice fractures encode pressure. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, scored and glowing, handled in multiple beats and shaping the planting action. The "corridor that sang low enough to hold a human heartbeat" enables the protagonist's core action, and the calcite rib provides the anchor for the stone's placement. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities—sound pressure, resonance mapping, crack patterns—without touristic catalog. The final beat ("outside, the sky rang thinner") uses environmental shift to charge the closure without symbolic overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass humming pavilion is vivid and functional: its ribs, fused silica, and acoustic properties constrain the custodian's work and enable the beacon's rekindling. The shard of hush, the broken prism, mirrors, and star-path etchings all pressure the solution. Micro-setting (the shard trimmed with heated wire, phosphor poured into the lantern cup) charges key beats. The dunes, saltlands, and post-collapse atmosphere anchor tone and time. The pavilion's "diary" and retrocognitive memory provide a lyric frame that recurs at closure ("the pavilion was writing us back into its diary"), meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and charged reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit observatory, fog-solid parapets, and crystal whispering forecourt are vividly particular and recur with purpose. The forecourt constrains the narrator's final choice: stepping into it and speaking personal memory is the pivot that charges closure. Shadow-measuring and monoliths provide tactile micro-setting that shapes both method and mood. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("summer-quill," "blue knives," "sugar dripped from the sentence"), avoiding catalog mode. The environment acts as crucible, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting elements actively constrain choices: the mosaic note provides the performance sequence, wind-pooling guides mortar placement, and the ivy-parted tower and cistern shape the choreography. The blooming fortress functions as both atmosphere and tactical terrain. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through craft perception ("jasmine poured down like a gentle waterfall," "ash and retell this note in mosaic"). The micro-setting (cubby of tools, parapet, courtyard echoes) charges the final image when the blooms "drink ash and retell this note." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto is vividly anchored (barnacles, slick stone, sea glass light, dripping metronome) and charges the final image ("grotto kept our resolution"). Sensory detail is filtered through the chronicler's observational bias (reefs, tide schedules, foam textures). The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, constraining the choice by embodying transition metaphor. Body and attention (holding breath, tilting the cicada) ground reflection without catalog drift. Spatial choreography is coherent (lantern, palm, ankles touched by ripple). The grotto approves "with a soft breath"—a touch of pathetic fallacy that anthropomorphizes setting but remains voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The xenial trellis is vividly particular—"rooms with no corners," "seating that adjusts to your fears," cloudgrass teacups—and constrains the protagonist's collection method (she must limit exposure or lose desire for doors). The monthly gravity inversion provides spatial logic for the climb, and the bells, ribbons of air, and widening landing guide descent choreography. The doll functions as micro-setting/tool, storing breath samples and serving as a porcelain vessel that matters at closure when opened "like a locket." The father's workshop anchors the ending with blueprints on plywood, grounding the conceptual shift in tactile redrawing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly anchored through sensory specifics (cities "glint like pinned insects," facets throwing "pale geometry," iron-scented seams, velvet-lined pylons). The storm glass vial and the physical gondola setup constrain and enable the operator's work, shaping the final moment when the vial "turns clear as winter morning" as a signal tied to the closure image. Micro-setting (the glass, the baffles, the windows) matters to both atmosphere and the operator's sense-making. The piece maintains a consistent lyric-observational filter throughout. Spatial choreography remains legible across the transit arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard and waterfall constrain choices materially: the ruby flake "split the broadcast into lines, and a corridor appeared between sheets of wet light"; the pump-house wall and its paint layers must be warmed and lifted to reveal the path; the hatch and dial are "covered in grime." Spatial choreography is clean (tramlines → waterfall → orchard → wall → hatch → stair → chamber → throne), and sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("pears glowing with unsent messages," "orchard cold," "apples... pinged softly like metronomes"). The body's interaction with setting is purposeful: "I lifted corners with a palette knife," "Quin warmed the wall with a salvaged dryer," and the ruby flake is held "before my eye" to align the bridge. The kaleidoscopic waterfall charges the final image when it "cooled to a pastel hush" as the duet is accepted, anchoring the ending in environmental response.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary's spatial elements—bare feet, the hush, the door without a house, the doorknocker ring—are filtered through the narrator's perceptual idiom ("cool as moonwater"). The scars function as micro-setting, constraining the teaching method ("Linking through scars was the only way the sanctuary spoke"). The final image of the girl crossing unescorted charges the space with the cost of letting go. The ashen bridges and the big sky recur with shifted weight, grounding the closure in tactile particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bolt returns across beats with evolving function: talisman in pocket → recognition of its "ritual of pressure" → installation that "shakes as if remembering depth" → witnessed by the engineer at dawn as evidence of method. The mushroom farm supplies immediate micro-setting constraint (slick floor, pulsing caps that "lift as if to pray," gauge tree) and charges the closure image when diamonds bloom "laced like frost, facets embedded in edible geometry." Sensory selection reflects urgency (the scent of "unbroken vows and damp paper and salt" arrives at peak pressure). Minor gap: spatial choreography of the chamber's ninety-degree rotation and hose routing could be slightly clearer under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sepia reading room constrains choice through its ritual objects (gramophone, ash tray, ledgers) and charges the final image when the house "exhales its long-planned mercy." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "lacquer, dust, and quiet promises," "breathing brass," "golden shadows pooled like tea." Spatial choreography remains clear across movements (console table, window, desk, hill descent). The crank handle and ash function as micro-setting elements that enable the revelation and thus constrain the protagonist's interpretive path.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse setting is richly specific: glass roof with rooted constellations, crucibles as lantern fruit, phosphorescent lichen, mercury sap. The orchard's alchemical logic constrains the knight's approach (he follows stage directions, climbs the bee-written ladder) and charges the closure (the kernel within the hand-shaped fruit). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting operates as both laboratory and garden, a micro-world that shapes every choice and embodies the story's thematic tension between measurement and mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room is rendered through dust patterns, stippled textures, shelf labels, and the "cardboard coffin" box—micro-setting detail that becomes a diagnostic tool. The button itself (brass, eagle, sunburst scratches, blue-black thread) functions as object-as-setting, constraining the archivist's interpretation and charging the final envelope gesture. Spatial choreography is clear (Shelf E, boxes, window). The dust explicitly shapes the archivist's choices: reading it teaches method, the crescents identify two handlers, and the room's "hush" becomes measurable corridor rather than cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    The auric lagoon, maintenance box, and puddle-map provide vivid sensory anchors ("smelled of penny metal and rain on paper," "furred with grass and old wire") and the setting constrains Mara's route and actions across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (tram yard → slope → lagoon), though the museum's physical relation to the lagoon remains abstract. The phone booth key and "singing hinge" box function as micro-setting elements that charge the final sequence, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism atrium constrains every choice—letters pearl on cold panes, facets scatter dawn, and sound climbs glass—anchoring the task spatially and atmospherically. The fog and dewdrops function as micro-setting, enabling and limiting the protagonist's method (fog holds notes, condensation writes the code). The grotto and ridge listeners supply pressure. One recurring constraint charges the closure: the protagonist sees the teacher's reflection in a facet mid-action, and the final brightening grotto makes "the absence" visible. Sensory hierarchy is strong (cold, brightness, taste of iron), though spatial choreography could be sharper in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: roots braided into cloud, bark ash-gray, lichens that sip thunder. The arbor constrains choices (leaf placement on trays, monument building) and charges the final image when it "seems to smile" and loans the narrator "a rung of height." Sensory selection is consistent and filtered through the narrator's ritual focus. The setting reads as micro-setting that shapes tactics and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean waterfall functions as micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's final choice: its rhythm becomes the teaching mechanism ("kept time with a kindness brutal enough") and the literal model for the water clock. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"spray glittered on limestone arches and gears," "room carved by persistence, cavern walls polished like watch faces"—filtering through the tinkerer's lens. The greenhouse, compass, and waterfall anchor spatial progression with coherent choreography. The environment charges the closure: "each droplet struck a spoon, each spoon nudged a gear" demonstrates that setting mechanics shaped the final artifact and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The foundry environment constrains every choice: scales, furnace, assay cup, rainwater supply the tactile toolkit. The zodiac coin functions as recurring anchor and counterweight across four distinct beats, reweighted at closure when it's pressed into the melt. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (rain hiss, golden seam brightening, frogs' grammar). The micro-setting of bench, furnace door, and cup charges the final image with concrete spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Echo gorge functions as more than backdrop: the limestone cleft strings the harp, voices "spill from the rock," and the stone wall accepts the crocodile's tooth, all constraining the protagonist's method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("spectral confessions, trembling like light on oil," "coins of heat"), filtered through the narrator's philosophical lens. The harp-as-spider-web and the river waking under the rock charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion that environment shapes the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (canyon lip, nearest wall, threshold).

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and purposeful, with cobalt fire, fluorescent letters, and equations that respond to breath and posture. The setting constrains the protagonist's movements (stepping deeper paints shins, equations pluck fractions from body angles) and charges the final image (pewter strap knotted as boundary marker, trees dimming to green). Proprioception functions as micro-setting, grounding spatial choreography throughout. The caretaker's clearing and the path that "brightens like bone under a skin of night" supply concrete anchors that guide closure without postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The suspended market—rope bridges, glass/copper stalls, "weather held in linen"—is vividly micro-set and constrains the translator's ritual (the lens catches "the last saffron of evening" to activate the painting). Sensory hierarchy filters through professional bias: pigments "mixed with river ash and berry salts" anchor craft rather than tourism. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as recurring object-setting, charged at open and close, shaping the final name-recovery choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the span; the painter's stall and the market wind interweave with the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ceiling grid, dust accumulation, and mainspring barrel constrain discovery and charge the final image; removing the setting would collapse the logic. Sensory selection reflects professional bias (dust as text, sag as clue, mouse paths as roads) and the ticket-office particulars (coins, roses, newsprint-and-gun-oil whisper) anchor POV filter. Spatial choreography is coherent (counter → tile → joist → barrel) and the environment evolves causally (fluorescent dies, dust lifts and resettles). Minor: "peeled knuckle" and "painted smiles" verge on stock decay imagery without fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass orchard library is not postcard décor: the frost writes clauses, the panes sigh and rupture seams, the cloud sea "laps at the roots...like patient teeth," testing buoyancy after each printed decision. The press itself—platen, forms, type—structures every tactical choice. The bottled whisper as micro-object also constrains: its release enables the critical print run and its post-closure "seashell patience" charges the final stance. Spatial choreography remains clear (beneath boughs, behind the press, aisle of atlases).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The baroque asteroid setting constrains excavation method and supplies the storm-mechanic that enables the shard's song. Visible time and covered mirrors function as micro-setting elements that charge the council scene and final image. Sensory detail—"gilt dust," "rubric-lit colonnades," "minutes rained"—is filtered through the poetic revolutionary's lens and integrated into action. The shard as recurring object alters tactics across three beats and participates in closure, satisfying the 9+ gate's constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The resonance chamber's brass ribs, floor glyphs, and rafters constrain the ritual choreography; the tuning box functions as tool-as-setting, its bellows and chip directly enabling the covenant. Spatial anchors (door, floor, rafters, ceiling slats, streetlamps outside) track clearly. The philosopher's stone chip charges the final image when it glows "like a cherry ember" in the nightly returns. Minor gap: the city's "copper veins" and gantries are named but remain abstract; more tactile grounding of the urban surround would lift specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean lagoon constrains navigation and supplies the scent-lock mechanism that opens the ledge: "I unstopper a jar and release the memory of rain striking parched brick...a lock clicks far away." Spatial choreography (limestone track, fissure descent, boardwalk edge, water surface) remains coherent. The compass arrow pointing at soles and the water politely returning boots are concrete micro-setting beats that alter tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the collector's priorities—"air keeps a resonant hush," "black with inquiry"—and the cave's response to scent releases directly enables the closure discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed archway, driftwood, and lantern slide are vivid and purposeful. The archway's "rib cage of stone" and "ferric" air create a charged space. The slide's light "pools in my palms" and guides construction, directly constraining the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"turbine-hum," "threaded needles"—and filtered through the sculptor's craft priorities. Spatial choreography stays clear throughout the beach-to-arch sequence, and the gate's construction anchors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Etched glass, cathedral nave, amber pavilion, and the garden's trumpet flowers anchor spatially and constrain the narrator's attention across seasons. The pavilion's honey glass and resin-apple air charge the final beat when moths read the panels. Micro-setting (the cool pane, the scaffold) enables discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects the artist's priorities: scent and light dominate; touch and visual texture support. Objects (postcards, pigments, candles) recur with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it "drinks starlight," mirrors the mosaic, and triggers the retrocognitive trap, directly shaping the archivist's tactics (arranging debris, signaling witnesses). The floating library and beach debris are handled across multiple beats, with kelp, shells, and punches serving as tools that alter later options. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("salt-stiff crate," "smoke damp," "moonlight prints us"), filtered through the archivist's archival lens. The final image of the lagoon as "obsidian vow" charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across zeppelin, shore, and reverie layers.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cove is vivid and specific—abandoned lanterns, beached skiff, warped timbers, pilings—and setting details anchor most beats (kelp ground into ink, shells slipped into tide). The amber bottle, bell, and physical tools (maps, notebooks) constrain Iria's tactics and charge the final image. Minor slip: "paper-lantern cove" is named but the lanterns themselves bob "abandoned," creating slight disconnect; the cove's lantern-identity is decorative rather than a live constraint. Spatial choreography is clean; the quay, skiff, and square remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop orchard is vivid and purposeful: "gnarled branches holding the city at a respectful, dreaming distance," quinces "small and green as bruises" that the scribe watches and that "keep their grip" when unarchiving succeeds. The cracked basin, rainwater, wax shaving, and quinces all constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the scribe's professional lens (dust as phonograph residue, water that "remembers the roofs it crossed"). The orchard itself shifts from passive frame to active pressure when it threatens to "drop its fruit" and "crack the rooftop," then sighs relief at closure, making the setting a co-agent in the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: "breath hangs like frost-laced bells," "windows veined with ice that maps the sky in silver." Sensory selection reflects the ritual's urgency and the protagonist's attunement to the orchard (moss dreams, citrus blossom). The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice—it becomes the wheel hub that steadies Return and is then planted, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: egg on marble, cap on shoulder, cap placed on vortex, cap planted in loam. The environment recedes causally as winter withdraws, supporting the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanctuary setting constrains multiple choices: the cathedral bell rope (splice test, glue drying) gates the protagonist's decision, the ductwork carries the river's voice as diagnostic data, and the glass floor positions the crew above the clouds to read microclimate signs. Sensory hierarchy reflects occupational priority—anemometer flutter, dewpoint rise, isobar creep—filtered through the narrator's weather-reading lens. The rope's tactile state ("warm from the day, cold at the core") charges the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain a choice or charge the final image. Spatial choreography (console, shutters, displays) tracks cleanly across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shooting star tracking station is vividly particular: "yellow lantern glass," "copper and old tea" smell, "dishes turned like ears to hear the rain," console lights as "pulse points." The lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (held "like a small sun" when the roof opens). Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's priorities—spiritual and maintenance-focused attention to machines and sky. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (floor, panels, observation window, roof). The setting constrains choice: the power failure forces reliance on the lantern, and the roof's mechanical limit ("as far as it would move") bounds the protagonist's gesture of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The wasteland setting (burnt hives, wind-chiseled troughs, smoke-bruised horizon) pressures every choice—scarcity of bees makes each return delirious and sacred, the hut's noon-shade position governs the ritual's timing. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting: its warmth ("a softened memory of flame"), hidden panel, and light-spilling properties constrain the final act when he must decide whether it can hold heat. Spatial choreography is clean: lectern with skeletal comb frame, paths mapped by colored light on dust, ghosts queuing along those paths. The narrow stripe of blue the queen leaves behind becomes a road "for anyone who needed to approach without words," charging the final image with environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The emerald silo is established early with vivid, selective detail ("emerald glass that glowed like bottled pasture," "wheat ghosts") and constrains action: the floor's texture enables the footprint-letter reading, and the capsule's physical seal and hinge guide the patience-based opening. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency appropriately—smell, touch, shadow-braiding replace clocks—and spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The urn fragment's physical trembling and heat-whistle charge the final collaborative work, making environment indispensable to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is anchored early and recurs with evolving charge: initial hush, the boy's grief breaking the surface "like a pebble skimming once too far," the raft floating toward the vanished kite, and the lagoon darkening "to cobalt again as clouds reknit" at closure. The feather and raft function as micro-setting—physical tools that constrain the poet's ritual and the boy's participation. Sensory selection reflects urgency: the kite's "crimson diamond leaping beyond reach" sharpens loss, while "puddled sand" and "shore stones" ground the writing act. Spatial choreography remains clear across the poet's movements (rising, kneeling, floating the raft), satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The living stone pillars, copper wire, and volcanic pores supply concrete constraints that shape action: the protagonist listens for warmth, sets wires where oaks sigh, grafts branches to feed mineral leaves. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the caretaker's botanical expertise (almond pollen, kelp braiding, mushrooms writing "white alphabet"). The orchard functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (otter ramps, rules against nets) and charging the final image when the pillars answer "with a slow chord." Spatial choreography remains clear across rows, shallows, and terraces. The piece leans heavily on setting as character without excessive catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rainwashed tower, rotunda pools, ivy-veiled statues, and skylight all recur and constrain movement (upward spiral, basin carried to window). The amber—a micro-setting object—charges the final image by catching rainwater and releasing light, directly enabling the conceptual turn. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("bronze quiet," "chalky guidance," "scent of orange and rust"), reflecting the narrator's scientific lens. The dust-on-stone and the window's "widening intention" function as more than postcard; they supply the material for the ritual's causal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and particular: salt-slick boards, shell holes filled with rain, rusting cannon wheels, morning glory braiding planks. The jetty and battlefield constrain the coachman's work—he must fertilize cracks, navigate remnants of war, train vines on bayonet lattices—and the blooming jetty charges the final image directly. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful, filtered through his craft (kelp ash, bone dust, pulverized shells). Micro-setting (the cart, the pods, the lattice) functions as active constraint and participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    The waxed leaf constrains multiple choices: it becomes compass, signal device, and light filter that activates the relay. The scarecrow relay (rebar, twine, copper crow) charges the final image when the beak throws voice north. Sensory hierarchy is purposeful: rust, solder smell, honey-and-smoke glow all filter through the narrator's descriptive lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across market, home, and wasteland walk. The micro-setting (phonograph, crate, wax-heated leaf) drives tactics in the dusk sequence and shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observation deck as micro-setting constrains perception (time-peeled constellations, glacial ink-drying) and charges the final image where dawn arrives "from several directions at once." The compass rose applique and sketchbook physically anchor choices (spreading the book, adjusting the circle, dating with the blackout number). Sensory detail is filtered through lyric attention—"cars as beetles dragging time," "dust hesitated between falling and floating"—without postcard excess. Spatial choreography of ledge, glass, corridor remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The icebound spire, heart notch, spiral corridor, and chessboard of ice and ash provide vivid, selective detail filtered through the protagonist's cautious wonder. The pocket sundial lid constrains the method of entry and charges the final image by catching the queen's light. Spatial choreography is coherent across the ascent, corridor, board, and window. However, the spire's interior is more atmospheric than tactile—lamps "lean," squares "whisper," but the protagonist's physical interaction with the environment (cold, footing, sound) remains thin in the middle third, reducing the setting's pressure on choice. Capped at 7.0 due to orientation debt applied in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering gallery is vivid and functional: "the marble rim carried voices like a patient river" establishes acoustic properties that enable the word-spelling method, and the lantern's movement creates the "nomadic penumbra" that structures the piece. Micro-setting elements—the chessboard's "squares scuffed by hands," the widow's button pressed onto cracked lacquer—charge the final image. Spatial choreography (participants crossing in strokes and loops, the staircase where newcomers pause) remains legible throughout. The setting constrains the method (echoes as contraband memory) and shapes the closure image (corridor full of legible silence), satisfying the 9+ test with environment directly charging the final frame.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vivid and purposeful: "Footpaths narrowed into aisles, aisles curled into cul-de-sacs of dictionaries," and the floor's exhalation creates lived-in spatial texture. The lost language stone constrains the protagonist's choice—touch it to unlock memory—and charges the final image when the courtyard materializes. The mountain's "hidden thunder" modulates pressure throughout. Minor slip: the "shame-encyclopedias" and corridor "shaped like a question mark" veer toward symbolic convenience, introduced late without prior anchoring, but do not obscure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The platinum labyrinth fountain appears in three beats (observation, knight placement, overflow at closure) and constrains the protagonist's understanding of trapped time; water "trembled inside its threads of light but did not fall" teaches the problem's mechanics. Spatial choreography (village square, hall, tapestry wall, back to square) remains coherent. The tapestry's frayed border functions as micro-setting, a tool whose threads the tutor must decode to restore motion. The final image—platinum labyrinth overflowing as thunder moves on—charges closure by releasing the constraint that shaped all prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire constrain the ritual terms and charge the final giving scene. The bottle-shard necklace refracts light into "shifting flags," a micro-setting object that later enables the child's dividing chant. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (margin of mist, spire center, cloth spread). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "vibration climb the palm like a warning," echoes as "water over flute holes." The spire's color-shift at closure directly results from the giving and visibly reconfigures the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The workshop environment constrains choice: pontoons groan, fumes sting, the cooling cistern becomes a tactical necessity ("each plunge steals a little fear"). The acid sea, gears, glass bells, and pockmarked statue are not merely vivid but functional—the statue's craters encode the ribs' choreography, directly shaping the protagonist's method. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: salt, solder, fog on glass. The final image ("pontoons rising as if the acid forgot its hunger") charges the ending by reversing the opening threat. Micro-setting (calipers, seams, bells) drives the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network constrains movement and choice: tide timing governs entry, forking pathways force navigation by "brine and old smoke," the wrong turn reveals the oasis, and the pool's "liquid seams" open the corridor. Micro-setting details—slick alphabet on stones, mineral syllables, wet limestone and quince—anchor the painter's body and senses throughout. The painted shell functions as setting-scale tool, its lacquer catching light and later wetting the brush. The mirror wall that "gives" when touched with wet fingers directly enables the climactic turn, and the star/sound/closure sequence charges the final image with undeniable environmental presence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse gallery (rails, lantern glass, dew) and the vial cork as micro-setting anchor sensory detail throughout. The cork's warmth, the scent walking into wind, and the freighter's proximity create spatial choreography that constrains the narrator's beckoning method. The "seam of calm" pointing like a finger charges the final image by making the whisper's effect visible. Salt, iron, gulls, and petals steeped in rainwater filter through the narrator's sensory priorities without catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The starlit signal station functions as both macro-setting and constraint: its hydraulic failure initiates the narrative, its pulse "fluctuates with moon phases" to govern the journey's timing, and its beacon "points, a single bone finger" to direct the protagonist inland. The censer foot and needle form a micro-setting that charges the final image—placed "in the center," they create a compass that "does not lead me to Mara; it leads me with her." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "salt pans that mirror every star that forgot to burn out," "feral gardens swallow porches." The environment constrains the closure choice: the station's dimming pulse and the mapped seam will hold, committing the navigator to return and repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ravine and hanging orchard constrain action throughout: storms threaten the footbridge, inspectors refuse to cross the swaying planks, and the narrator hides the eye in a knot-hole behind thyme. The glass eye functions as micro-setting—its physical placement and concealment drive tactics during the patrol beat. The final image of the orchard "steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured" charges closure by folding environment into emotional resolution. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven (moss, peat, clay, ropes of rain, blossoms beaten to paste). Minor slip: "smuggled...inside a sack of truffles packed in peat" arrives as exposition rather than shown choice, slightly reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal dock's notch in the third piling functions as micro-setting that constrains the keeper's search and charges the closure: he sweeps it to hide the shrine, and the act of concealment becomes the witness gesture. Nautical twilight, mist, and the gulls' silence all modulate pressure. The dried Edelweiss stems fit "like a key fitting a tired lock," anchoring the pivot turn. One small gap: the iron steps to the lighthouse are mentioned only in passing and do not constrain a choice as tightly as the notch does.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting qualifies: the matrix chip constrains the seam interaction, and the rising creek functions as live environmental pressure that narrows the window for choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("blooming cavern breathed cold air," "petals glimmer where quartz veins surfaced"). The creek's rising water physically tests the protagonist's legs and drags grit, altering the walk-out. The cavern's geometry and the chip's notch directly enable and charge the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: "mountains whose ribs cut the dusk," "ember grotto," "pool thick with starlight," and the cobalt grotto create sensory progression. The crescent drawn on her brow functions as a key, a concrete constraint that matters. Spatial choreography wavers—"the first waystation," "the second ledge," "past midnight they reached"—distances and transitions blur without stable anchors. The final grotto's roof "showed night unapologized, every star an opening instead of a pin" charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ test for setting, but the earlier drift and lack of clear geography cap the score.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus supplies vivid sensory detail ("ash-petaled," "sparks knitting constellations") and the nautilus curl anchors the ritual physically. The forge-trees and drifting cinders create coherent atmosphere. The curl constrains the pocket-sun's behavior ("a bead of day rolling inward with small decisive clicks"), shaping the experiment's mechanics and charging the final image when it releases the proof.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain ranger cabin constrains multiple choices: the stove's ticking and need for feeding anchor the waking/sleeping boundary, the map drawer houses the scroll, the kettle marks elapsed dream time. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when packed "with the first aid kit, because language can bleed." Sensory selection reflects POV priorities (spruce tea, wet wool, snow rasping windows). Minor penalty for the ridge and grave remaining slightly abstract in spatial detail—distances and terrain features could be more tactile during the soaring sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The water clock repair shop pressures the encounter: basins, siphon clocks, droplets all function as micro-setting that teaches the father how to read time as breath rather than ruler. The screw's fit into the regulator pin is a tactile constraint that alters the outcome. Fog as occluding medium anchors tone and filters perception throughout. The kettle, thermos, and lamp in the Rey entrance add lived-in specificity without clutter. Setting details (condensed breath on windows, ripples in basins) are filtered through the narrator's substituted sensory apparatus and directly shape the method of emotional cartography.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating platform constrains choice (the rite must occur here, between storms) and charges the final image through stormlight reflecting in crystallized ink. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: steam, basalt, storm grumble, ink facets. The crow quill, ink pot, and cup function as micro-setting that enables the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting is not merely postcard; it pressures the narrator's breath-hold and the urgency of the rite.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive's dust, piano, metronome, and perfume bottle function as micro-setting that constrains the séance ritual and charges the closure. The orchard's pending destruction creates temporal pressure and supplies the peach/Chopin memory that motivates the foreman call. Sensory detail (jasmine, iron filings, beeping truck) filters through the narrator's urgency and guilt. The baby grand's wire loop and the stylus on staff paper are tactile, lived-in uses that anchor the supernatural method in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    The temple library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (resounding hush, index wind, meteor-stone lectern, leather straps "marked with dates from before dates") that reflects the narrator's philosophical priorities. The dictionary functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats (held against heart, opened at "Listen," placed on lectern, warmed, inscribed twice) and constrains the final action by grounding abstraction in tactile ritual. The spiral mosaic directly shapes the walking meditation that drives the closure, and the hush modulates from stifling to revealing to guiding, charging the final image of the world inhaling.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fjord station is rendered through task-specific detail: siphons, calibrated basins, drip pressure, gauge needles with razor edges. The mantle clock key and Basin Three function as micro-setting that constrains choice (the key turns valve stems, the basin's lag forces counting backward). Sensory selection reflects urgency—bright gull-bone needles, slate water, bass hush—and the razor edge literally constrains action by nicking the finger, charging the final recorder-window moment. Spatial choreography (catwalk, basins, far beacon) remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rainwashed library constrains and enables: the midsummer emptiness grants "freedom to pursue a puzzle," the alcove named Martingale houses the lantern, and the mica pane becomes the lens for seeing "each drop a discrete coin." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("clover melancholy," "commas against the glass"). The body and recurring object (lantern) charge the final image. Minor deduction: spatial choreography of the archive traversal and the windowsill placement reads slightly abstract rather than sharply blocked.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subway utility tunnel is vivid and constrains choice: the welded booth, flickering bulbs, cable junction, and third-rail arc all pressure Mara's actions during the emergency. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, humming with train vibrations and guiding her routing decisions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (copper wires "like rain through a colander," fog on the disc surface). The tunnel's spatial coherence—side door for the maintenance crew, stairs for endings to leave—remains clear and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The jetty setting is vivid and purposeful: sea thrift, glasswort, warm boards, barnacle alphabets, and the exact rail from the locket photo all constrain the archivist's method and charge the woman's recognition. Sensory detail (tide hum, walnut ink steep, gull in white parenthesis) is filtered through the archivist's perceptual idiom. The setting directly enables the tactical choice to walk the boards and supplies the contextual trigger (matching rail) that shifts the photo's meaning, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    The disused railway station supplies concrete resources (ticket window, platform, skylight, gutters) that the logistician repurposes under pressure. The ivy, chalkboard, signal lantern, and crate-by-the-clock anchor the action and constrain improvisation when the power blinks citywide. The station's physical architecture (leaked skylight, circle under it) stages the pivotal moon-rock exchange and the trolley's arrival "under the ivy as if the vines themselves had flagged it down," charging the final image with setting-specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful: leaves "speak above hearing," lichens leak vowels, the platinum ring cools or warms to pitch "like braille for ears." Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's blindness and her skin-absorption ability. The clearing that opens "weaponed with silence" and the ring's sudden cooling constrain the dowsing action and charge the discovery beat. Micro-setting (ring, fern, grass) functions as tactile anchors that guide choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Quiet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: gravity "pooled and thinned in tides, warping clocks, tea, and sometimes conversations," and the station's precession mirrors the protagonist's avoidance. The dried-up pen becomes a recurring object that charges the closure—its exotic nib and jellied reservoir shape the ritual that produces the terraced timeline. Sensory detail is purposeful ("hiss," "rain on canvas and parchment," scrap tugging against the pen) and filtered through the protagonist's agricultural lens ("furrows," "terraces," "oat awns"). The spatial choreography of the station console and the scrap remains clear. Minor gap: the gravitational anomaly's mechanics are evocative but never constrain a middle choice beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The harbor setting supplies vivid sensory anchors (tide hum, rope murmurs, barnacle glitter, pylon shivers) and recurs throughout, but does not meaningfully constrain Arin's choices or supply friction. The camera, bell, and boards are handled on the page, yet their material properties do not alter tactics. Micro-setting is present but decorative rather than pressuring the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is vivid and purposeful: dunes, stone halls, feather-choked stairwells, and salt-shivering murals create a coherent ruin. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from collapsed reading room to vault to atrium. The oculus and the seeds' sprouting filaments constrain the final act—the protagonist must plant where "wind poured through"—which charges the closure image and meets the 9+ gate test for environment shaping a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden functions as setting-as-instrument, constraining choices ("leafed speakers answered with trembling chords," "the garden heard intentions the way a seashell hears the ocean") and charging the final image where the lagoon threads breath through wires and code. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's perception (gold dust, auroral sorrow, the crack in silence). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from railing to lagoon to ward. The body as micro-setting (knuckles chiming, soles tapping, fingertips pressed to the crack) actively constrains and enables ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The towering shipping-container labyrinth is vivid and functional: corrugated walls sing under the brass key, steel canyons swallow voices, frozen cranes turn paths into hypotheses, and a drainage slot accepts the key to persuade the gate open. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (metallic weather, citrus-crate air, zodiac coin vibration at the hinge). The micro-setting of corrugations, seams, and resonance panels constrains Ivo's method and charges the final gate-opening image. Environment directly enables the whisper tactic and the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, constraining the guardian's method and charging the final image when the narrator keeps it "cupped, a small star." The cobalt dock's rain-slick surface, bollard, pilings, and carved rings supply tactile anchors that shape the rope-weaving lesson. Sensory selection reflects urgency: the guardian "smelling faintly of tar and nettle," shutters "chattering and hushing," and the canal's "small lift" are filtered through grief-weighted perception. The drowned arches in the final third provide spatial specificity that the light must navigate, and the closing alleys "bent toward other harbors" extends the world without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors that recur and charge the final image. The grotto's iron veins (compasses fail) directly enable the climactic stalemate exercise, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint. Sensory detail is filtered through the coach's perception ("mist curled like quiet music"), and the basalt plinths ground the endgame physically. Minor deduction: the town's spatial layout remains vague between shop-window beats, and some descriptions ("breath like paper drinks light") tilt ornamental without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sublittoral fringe, dock hardware (bollard, cleat, mooring lines), and the whale's offshore presence all constrain the crossing action and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: dock → skiff → island → tide mark. The scrimshaw as object-as-setting carries tactile, centuries-old "thumb oil" and functions as a talisman that enables the protagonist's crossing, meeting the micro-setting criterion. However, sensory selection leans heavily visual and metaphoric; under stress, perception does not narrow as expected—figurative language remains lush throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The turbines, farmhouse, and surveillance infrastructure constrain choices throughout: the feed, inspectors, microphones shape every performance beat. The dried bouquet is handled across multiple scenes and charges the final teaching moment. Micro-setting (sink, sponge, window sill) anchors the narration performances. Spatial choreography remains coherent. The turbines' "giant applause" and persistent whine create atmospheric pressure that the protagonist navigates tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade supply vivid spatial anchors and sensory detail (blue light, mineral/ink/snow air, ice cracking). The atrium's architecture constrains the gathering and the colonnade's vibration responds to the poet's touch, shaping one beat. Micro-setting (glass fogging/clearing, ivy-sipping planter) adds texture but does not constrain a choice at closure. The frozen lake charges the final image when the poet steps onto "first safe ice," elevating the setting's role in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard functions as micro-setting with purposeful constraints: the furnaces, cooling shelves, plant arrangements on sills, and the phoenix-slag gate recur and shape action. The courtyard's physicality pressures Ivo's choices (where to place plants, where to paint) and charges the closure (thyme and basil together, iris blessing). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "smoke by flavor," "cobbles by temperature," "rain on nailheads and evening bread." The environment evolves causally (phoenix rises again in the kiln, bell of broken goblet hangs). The piece meets the 9+ test—environment constrains choices and charges the final image—but spatial choreography occasionally blurs (the booth with awakenings, the central case, the cooling shelf are not clearly mapped in relation to each other).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory's sensory signature—golden shadows, vacuum-tube dust, citrus-chewed fear, carbide-lamp moonlight—is vivid and sustained. The lamp lens and bells function as micro-setting elements that constrain the pilgrimage's structure and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across stations remains clear, though the ending's shift to "school gym, then hospice, then square" dilutes the immediate environment's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory's physical details (cracked telescope cradle, planetarium mechanism, projector window) constrain and enable ritual work on the page. The lily projection charges multiple beats (tattoo stencil pressed, mother's daughter outline, fingerprints warming glass). Micro-setting through beads, wire, and vellum tools shapes the protagonist's craft choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no teleporting props. Sensory selection is purposeful ("curtains of intention...light found dust like a river finds silt") and filtered through the protagonist's jeweler-mourner lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, measuring tape stretched across floors and into streets, and the mural under peeled paint create tactile spatial choreography that constrains movement and charges discovery. Sensory detail (wet cardboard and basil, coins washing in a sink) is selective and voice-filtered. The tape's physical hiss along floorboards and its street extension force the historians' bodies through the city, making setting a co-agent in the ending's discovery and the final client's metaphorical ribbon festival.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive environment actively shapes movement: tiles hum, shelves morph into pagoda, stairs climb sideways, mirrors translate rather than reflect, tablets pulse. The compass returned by the child functions as micro-setting that "turns pulse into direction" and warms at key beats, constraining choice and charging the final descent. Spatial choreography remains coherent across transformations. The "lake remembering fire" ceiling participates in the climax, releasing visions that reweight the narrator's understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming library above clouds is vivid and consistent, with vines, orchards of mist, and stairways unfurling like petals. The river stone constrains Mira's choice (she uses it to anchor the shadow) and charges the ending when she returns it to Ilen. Sensory selection is purposeful—dew on pages, river light braiding through iron—filtered through Mira's trained "dusk noticer" perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across balcony, aisles, and shelves; the environment subtly guides action (library "jealous," vines tighten) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The misty workshop under stars recurs in opening, mid-turn ("panels darkened and then clarified"), and closure ("stillness shimmer"), charging the final image. Micro-setting elements—forceps, terrarium, atomizer, tray—constrain on-page action: warming forceps, removing plastic waterfall, and stitching all pressure choices. The chameleon's relearning balance mirrors the handler's, making body-as-setting functional. Sensory selection remains purposeful: mist as counsel, lantern painting bottles "from the inside," stars "trembling" while enduring.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quiet tower at dawn anchors early and recurs to frame closure. The tunnel chamber, frost on the hourglass, ivy on the sill, and the fossil coffee ring all constrain choice: the protagonist must physically descend, the cold steadies her tremor, the plants guide her feet. The body under anesthesia recovery and the numbed palms function as micro-setting that alters perception ("each pin is a star"). The frosted hourglass charges the final image when cracked and poured into the ring.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges action: the projector's "modest growl," the spattered table, the metal gate all become tactile anchors for the psychometry ritual. Sensory detail is purposefully filtered through the protagonist's spatial-imaginative POV (fog-rising shelves, doors ajar like vowels, rain on velvet). The booth's physical elements—film strip threaded through the projector, letters pressed to skin—directly enable the method and the final moment when "the booth glowed with faded faces." The recurring thunder motif modulates from "softened" to "spoke aloud" in the final line, tracking emotional progression through environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument supply vivid sensory anchors (brass, frost, vellum that smells like rain). The archway constrains movement through repeated circuits and opens "a door inside the arch...without brick," directly shaping the sculptor's liberation. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats. Late orientation (sky, river, archway relationships unclear until midpoint) caps the score despite strong micro-setting work with the instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glowing dune constrains action (opens the archive when it sings, plants quiet in the guard's boots) and charges the closure ("the dunes forget our hymns but keep their color"). Sensory specificity is exceptional: "glassy throats," "pale blue," "cold fire." The chess clock and crate function as micro-setting that structures the central negotiation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (rail, cars, couplers, axles, sand).

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly particular: leaves tick, vines breathe steam, bark carries serials and prayer notches, aluminum palms clink. The small gear functions as micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's search and charging the final shelter discovery. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (canopy → mercury river → ironwood grove → axle-tree → ravine → shelter). The wind and the tree's missing second constrain the protagonist's choice to repair, directly affecting the outcome: without the repair, no corridor opens, no shelter appears. Sensory detail is filtered through the philosopher's lens (mechanical parts named with precision, wind "threaded," Mercury beads "chattering").

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway functions as more than backdrop: it "hums with stories," sand "clicks like a clock," and the terrain ("eddies of silence," "pools remember the sky") constrains the walk and shapes the protagonist's realization. The star-stamp on the palm recurs with shifting meaning, charging the final image when courage "fits where the star was pressed." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the vigil's contemplative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt fortress and its elements—radiators clicking like teeth, bricked windows, the piano bench bolt—constrain choices and charge the final image. The nerve-regeneration wrist and the training room with the naked piano ground the protagonist's actions in tactile, lived-in detail. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (pain sharpens attention, warmth and frost mark key beats) and spatial choreography is clear throughout the spiral staircase descent and lobby-to-training-room sequence. The bolt's physical presence and the window's fogged treble clef serve as micro-setting that alters tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient temple library is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: "dust motes spiraled as if stars rehearsing," the rune of drift "pale as a healed scar," shelves that slide slightly in time. The setting constrains Serane's path—she must follow the bookmarks, the library rearranges context—and the skylight fracture at her confession charges the closure. The reliquary, ink pellet, and vellum leaves function as micro-setting that drives the plot. Minor spatial vagueness (where exactly does Serane stand relative to Lyr when the pellet rolls?) and the retinue's unexplained withdrawal without orders slightly soften the choreography, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The monitoring station as a workplace is vividly realized: pylons, console, brushed steel key, metal bench, and the humming interaction between keeper and instruments. The "breathing corridor" of sand constrained by lunar peaks and spawning-night slicks directly shapes the final choice to mark timing rather than place. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's diver training (tap-count swells, night surveys, plankton-lit shallows). Minor gap: the village and mangrove geography remain slightly abstract, though the western flats gain specificity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spaceport repair bay constrains and charges the closure: gutted shuttle, cargo door with orbital equations, stone circle at the spine, projectors that paint coordinates. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"hummed the way grief hums," "heat climbed through her arms, prickling," floor lines flaring into a star map. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, transforming perception twice (stones into stars, then chronology). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves from dented hulls to the stone ring to the hangar mouth. The margin-of-daylight frame and the stones' mineral memory anchor tone and constrain her choice to broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The volcanic hot springs function as more than postcard: the "hottest pool" vault, mirrored steam, and porous rock all enable the unsealing ritual and root the seedling, constraining Lida's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Lida's plant-attuned perception ("sulfur wind," "gray water cradled bubbles like secrets"). The bathhouse reconstruction, aqueduct, irrigation ditch, and basalt path create coherent spatial choreography. The springs charge the final image when the seedling roots "by her knee" and the "spring flared a brighter white," making the setting an active participant in closure. Minor: the broader valley and occupier-era details remain lightly sketched, but at this length the tight focus on the springs suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arboretum environment constrains multiple choices: fog scrubbing for citrus, seed selection for "hotter years," glass tightening before storms. The cliff path supplies the gull encounter that triggers the key freeze moment. The photograph (micro-setting as object) charges the final image when its handling shifts from wound to scar. Spatial choreography remains clean across the greenhouse wings, cliff path, and caretaker's room. Sensory detail is purposeful—"salt and sap," "diesel and kelp"—and filtered through Rafi's priorities (watering, grafts, trellises).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse library supplies concrete constraints: rusted gears, perished wick, salt-sweating stones, and the trap to lower chambers all shape Mara's choices and tactics. The keeper's ledger, tarot box, and thread materials are handled across multiple beats, evolving from discovery to tool. The spatial choreography—reading table, gearhouse spiral, lightroom above—remains coherent and charges the final image when light "climbed, and the walls did not close in." Micro-setting detail (oil, linen, brine) filters through Mara's artist's eye and survival need.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wind-carved encampment is rendered with vivid specificity—"auric ribs," "tents smoothed to fossils, alleys hollowed like flutes"—and the disappearing ink's flow is anchored in tactile action: "I seed the ground with a fresh vial." The hummingbird as a sensory tool (tasting ink, recording rock clicks) and the metronome chamber constrain the protagonist's choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (lip of encampment, central trough, hut interior, chamber), and the setting's ephemeral nature (wind, vanishing ink) mirrors the thematic concern with time slowing and edges being bought.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen library constrains every choice: frost-furred pipes, glass cases, the storm pressing panes create tactile urgency. The return duct for old microfiche becomes the release mechanism, earning its specificity. The body under visor, breath fogging glass, sitting with shelves that "knew already" my heartbeat—micro-setting charges the final image when "frost bloomed across the glass like a curtain call." The plaza's blind switch and dormant conduits map infrastructure as lived setting rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass dome, vestibule sand, and irrigation lines constrain visitor behavior and anchor the narrator's ritual. The airship ballast scrap and rose trellis charge the final image when the narrator ties letter and scrap together, making the ending materially specific. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dust scrawls outside," "engraved quiet," "roses drink." Micro-setting (the dome's acoustic and thermal effects) alters tactics—visitors soften because "the heat has already scorched their edges smooth."

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound-wave garden is rendered with vivid, synesthetic specificity: "braided music, ripples of bass and hush, hills of whisper and troughs of drum." The rail spike functions as a charged object that opens "like a throat" and remembers tracks, constraining the fisher's method and enabling the final release. Spatial choreography is clean—jetty to aisles to dune—and the environment subtly guides choice: the spike must be planted in the dune for the garden to shudder. Minor quibble: "tremblegrass" and "tidepools shaped like ears" read slightly ornamental, not load-bearing for the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's echoing dome, spiral stairs, and lens-as-eyelid constrain movement and charge the closure (lens reopening = "warm inquiry"). The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting: its cedar scent anchors memory, its reflection delivers the father's mercy insight, and its resting position bookends the wager. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (smell, visual echo, wind "like snow and old photographs") and filtered through the heiress's observant lens. Spatial choreography (stairs, console, lever, printer downstairs) remains clear and the environment pressures choice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory setting is vivid and functional: salvaged floorboards "ringing with narratives," a cabinet with hidden letters, the recorder with "haunted firmware," and amber at the workstation. These elements constrain action (the letters dictate the tattoo glyph, the recorder translates cries, the amber charges the ink) and the "meteor hush" recurs to modulate atmosphere at closure. Micro-setting (amber, recorder, table) effectively substitutes for broader spatial detail at this length. One deduction: spatial choreography during the woman's visit is compressed—her presence "outside my booth" then immediately inside with the cabinet is minimally anchored, risking a brief float.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's mist, limestone ribs, and acoustic properties constrain the ritual and charge the ending ("grotto's ribs seemed to breathe"). The tile flake functions as micro-setting, angling sound and shaping the group's confession dynamic. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's perceptive lens ("lilac unease," "mist licked limestone"), though some descriptions ("delicate but sure, like dusk deciding") edge toward ornament. Spatial choreography remains clear across the sand mandala and the circle of participants.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The plaza is concretely rendered (ash halos, broken columns, mosaic tessera, stepping stone) and the tessera directly enables the renaming mechanic—it "speaks" patterns twice, shaping both the boy's and the men's outcomes. The "shattered sky" and retrocognitive fog create consistent atmosphere. However, spatial choreography during the crowd scene (boy, narrator, men, onlookers) remains vague; we don't know distances or how the crowd physically relates to the ritual. The micro-setting (tessera + bottle caps on stepping stone) charges the closure when the narrator "places the tessera back on the ground" and feels release.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The converted playhouse, hedge maze, mystic orchard, and amphitheater are vividly anchored through synesthetic detail ("green cymbals," "lantern fruit"). The orchard functions as more than backdrop: it "answers with its own remembered footnotes," opens "a door of leaves," and leans closer when the ritual succeeds, constraining and enabling the ghost-work. Spatial choreography is clear (theater → maze → hollow → stage). The coin and orchard charge the final image when the narrator walks "the long aisle of rustling leaves" with "pockets the color of brass," linking tactile setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The studio, geode sliver, and fiber wand function as active constraints: the sliver seeds the camera exposure, the wand shapes the light paths, and the rig's static shock forces recalibration. Sensory detail is specific and filtered through the narrator's attentive perception ("minnows against glass," "mica flashed like layered pages"). Spatial choreography remains coherent, though the piece leans heavily on metaphorical texture ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise veins") that sometimes threatens to float free of concrete referents. The geode's final placement on the sill charges the closure image, elevating the category into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cave network constrains the protagonist's choices throughout: "I slip through the dripping strands," "wedge myself into the throat tunnel," "place the leaf in a deeper niche." Micro-setting (the black pool, mineral hair curtain, ledge, niche) directly alters tactics during the storm surge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "Drops ring the pool with tiny collisions," "wall warms under the fossil and releases a flow of faint vapor." The cave's "emotional temperature" functions as both atmosphere and active constraint, charging the final image when "the heat map remains warm."

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    The amber warehouse with glass ribs, hourglasses, and cliff proximity is vivid and consistent. The jar, buttons, and ledger table function as micro-setting that enables the cataloging method. The warehouse's opening at the east doors and the villagers' descent down switchbacks provide spatial choreography. However, no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows a choice or charges the final image—setting frames rather than pressures the action, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bluff, mist, frost-pocked grass, and sea anchor space and mood concretely. Snow as medium for coded messages constrains the method and charges the encounter. The pillbox, cane, and ring function as micro-setting objects that shape choices (pillbox hinge click, cane for tracing, ring's fit). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ansel's scars and discipline. Minor gap: the bluff's physical layout (edges, distances, patrol sightlines) remains somewhat abstract during the rendezvous, slightly reducing spatial constraint on the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog-bound crossing supplies persistent constraint: wet bark muffles hooves, current tries to turn the ferry, and fog "pressed like muslin" filters perception. The yarn needle and map function as micro-setting that charges the final image—the map-sail "trembling with...spindrift serenity" crystallizes the achieved state. Sensory selection reads purposeful (spindrift, creaking hook, water slapping "like a dog too tired to fetch"), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across trap, ferry, and far bank. Setting actively enables the stitching beat and the ferryman's relief, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oasis—cracked troughs, empty hives, scorched ground—pressures every choice by denying resources (water scarcity, no shelter). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting tool, constraining the potter's sight to three braided timelines and charging the final image when she gathers breath-condensed water to fill cups. Sensory detail is purpose-driven: heat trembling, smoke flattening, thrumming air. The body and glass shape tactics throughout and anchor the closure, meeting the 9+ gate easily.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vivid and selective: the fire escape pots, the skiff's mended seams, the salt-bitten padlock, and the brittle wick all constrain choices and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the brass tooth, the lantern glass) functions as setting by pressuring the unlock and the rekindling. Spatial choreography is clean across three locations (escape, skiff, lighthouse). The moonlit harbor modulates from "sleeping lung" to "frank relief," supporting the tonal arc without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal library, stone circle hum, brass sundial, and aviary baskets function as a coherent micro-ecology that constrains and enables the narrator's actions. The sundial's "atomically reflective" face is used twice—first to find unshelved moments, then angled toward lightning to locate the resonance knot—directly shaping tactics. The atlas of drowned stars provides the coordinate drops that cue the herd song. Sensory detail is specific and purposeful ("cloudlight pools," "bookplates into fog"), and spatial choreography remains clear across the tilting library.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lotus temple and lily pond provide vivid, recurring anchors—"raindrops beading along lotus petals, each droplet a tiny window briefly holding the world"—and the physical installation (threads, willow poles, paper leaves) constrains visitor movement and thus the lovers' paths. Spatial choreography is clear: we track the narrator adjusting ribbons, the crowd writing on leaves, the lovers following converging threads to the bowl. The thrush's nest at the center and the bowl itself function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's whimsical yet deliberate attention.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The radio station is rendered through concrete, functional detail: mixer lights, generator hum, duct-taped warnings, throat-singing cables. Sensory selection reflects urgency and professional bias—static with "tempers," hiss as breath, subsonic frequencies as bone-pressure. The booster at the theater roof and the campus grid mapped onto astronomical charts constrain the protagonist's tactics and enable the final interference. The quadrangle at dawn, kettles hissing, posters unpeeling in rain all charge the closure beat. Minor limitation: the broader city and community divides remain gestural; we see rallies and chants but little micro-geography beyond the station and theater.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed nexus, fountain, church organ, and Observatory are spatially coherent and each location constrains a choice: the nexus requires the sonic intervention, the fountain yields the key, the Observatory holds the lock. The compass point functions as micro-setting, its steel tip used twice (pricking the triangle, glinting "like a witness") to anchor the protagonist's spatial negotiation. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("Cold bit until I felt metal," "air narrowed twice"). The final image—telescope pointed "down the city's throat"—charges the closure by converting the setting into an instrument of listening, directly supporting the thematic turn. The lyric density occasionally obscures exact spatial choreography (e.g., the sexton's position, the precise layout of five alleys), but purposeful compression is taught early and the effect remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quarry setting constrains method (lancing silt, walking the lip) and charges the final image—mist as the medium of both concealment and the ribbon-bridge metaphor. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's methodical attention: "glitter bruised to a dull bruise," perfume vial, kink in the ribbon. The body and tools (rebar spear, notebook) are handled across beats and pressure choices. Spatial choreography remains clear; the setting evolves from physical site to painted absence, mirroring the case itself.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The weather station setting is vivid and specific: "corridors bleed humidity, insulation sagging like kelp, instruments whispering forecasts that smell of mold" and "room of dripping anemometers." Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's mapmaker lens and the post-shift climate crisis. The copper nail functions as micro-setting, constraining the climactic choice (keyhole "sized not for a key, but for a nail") and charging the final image. However, spatial choreography of the confrontation with the director and the march to the control deck compresses without clear blocking, and the "boundary mists" remain more atmospheric than tactically navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting elements—pullout, scaffold wrap, bridge understructure, river light—are vivid and participate actively: arrows of paint guide the search, river mist "beads...every drop a votive," and pixelated light through latticework charges the reunion. The scaffold wrap functions as both map and metaphor, constraining the search path. Spatial choreography is clean across the pullout descent to the bridge. The final image under the trusses is concrete and purposeful, reweighting prior particulars without postcard ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned circus train setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful—faded Belarus letters, ringmaster's quarters, tiger car. The train functions as micro-setting that constrains the startup's identity and charges the final image (the tire rut that "entered and exited through the same gate"). Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's lyric lens ("kettle steam and careful silences"). The setting earns its keep by shaping both the venture's texture and the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is anchored early with sensory specificity ("red lamps," "domes clicked as gears corrected drift"). The sextant, charts, and variable stars function as micro-setting that enables the decoding method. The daylily-pressed telegram serves as recurring object that constrains choice (weeks unopened, finally broken seal charges the turn). The spatial choreography of Mara laying copies beside charts is coherent and the final rewinding of the dome charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    The swirling orchard vortex is vividly rendered—"trees grow from anchored boats and apples orbit like moons"—and actively constrains the protagonist's search through expanding circles. The kelp lines, bone whistles, and raft choreography are tactile and specific. The lake's well of dropped objects (coin, photograph, key) functions as micro-setting that encodes social pressure. The final image of "apples settle into ordinary halos" charges the closure by marking the curse's release. Spatial coherence holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt glade, grafted ankles, maze topiary clipping, and hedge corridors supply vivid micro-setting that charges several beats. The clipping's transformation on the pool and the hedge-doors that "demanded answers" constrain the protagonists' path, and the final sundial that "agreed to tell time again, sometimes" charges the closure image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's heightened, visionary register. However, spatial choreography occasionally blurs—how the woman and narrator physically move from tree to pool to floating maze is more lyric than legible, and the "figures in ceremonial pruning aprons" appear without prior spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The catacomb orchard constrains choice: the bone-hand pit holds the boy, the ash map on the card guides action, roots serve as anchor for the final planting. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("brass light pooled like thin honey," "bones chimed whenever a breeze lost its way"). The burned tarot card functions as micro-setting object, warming and hissing to enable the trammel promise. Spatial choreography remains clear across market/orchard/pit.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry office functions as micro-setting: "file boxes, rock dust frosting my boots," the locker "laid open on a desk dinged by boots and quartz." The scrap itself becomes setting-as-object, its houndstooth weave and cigarette singe grounding memory in tactile detail. Sensory selection reflects urgency and professional habit (ruler, glue odor "sick sweetness like old soda syrup"). The setting charges the final image: "the pit glittered with puddles and mica, an echo valley longing made visible." The physical space (quarry) and its acoustic memory ("hold sound like a lung holds breath") constrain the narrator's stance, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic arbor functions as micro-setting and constraint: filings swim to lines, rails hum when voice cups curvature, nodes knot into "tired eddies." These material properties shape the protagonist's tactics (tablet-to-bark pressure, vocal tuning). The seed cradle of filings and felt charges the final image when the helix drinks the tuned field. Spatial choreography (trunk by trunk, center cradle) remains clear. Brief cap at 8.3 under BRR rule does not apply since reflection stays under 20% and anchors present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (glass ribs, salt-flecked panes, foam-bright drawers) filtered through the librarian's occupational lens. Sensory data—smell of iron and sea moss, the hush of low tide, the slick floor at closure—modulates with emotional pressure and constrains the setting's ritual logic (tide cycles, moon phases, bell alcoves). The fisherman's bamboo creel functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats (gathering words, pouring them onto bells, rinsing in brine), it supplies the tactile resources that shape the woman's resolution. The final image charges the setting: "the atrium floor slickens, and the bells cool to a hush like frost taking breath," grounding the closure in physical consequence. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the metallurgy alcove, stacks, and reference desk track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal cave setting is vivid and voice-filtered ("quartz rose like frozen rain," "scalloped like a throat"), and the spire becomes the locus of the climactic choice, grounding the ending in spatial particularity. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting the narrator's dual roles as inspector and listener. The cave's "resonant hush" modulates with the narrator's attention, and the pearl-crowned spire charges the final image. Minor gap: the bunker door's physical transformation ("hinges singing the names") lacks concrete detail that would show how the setting mechanically constrains or enables the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The disused station, ivy-draped and moss-marked, constrains the journey—graffiti tiles as transect, embankment slit by foxes, sluice gate scarred by rust, culvert mouth—and the shallow itself is the micro-setting that charges the final image. The accordion bellows function as body-proximate setting: "pressed the patched bellows open and closed to hear the river breathe." Sensory selection is purposeful: "ivy shimmered like soundproofing," "low reedy wheeze," moss and rust texture the turning points. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the platform, embankment, and culvert.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing library in mist supplies vivid images (windows like "listening breaths," shelves "curved away like galaxies"), and the watch functions as a micro-setting object across multiple beats (listened to, opened, used to time breath). However, spatial choreography inside the library is unclear—aisles, desk, and corridor appear without transitions, and the protagonist's movement among them lacks concrete grounding. The watch constrains one choice (breathing to match its rhythm opens the door), lifting the score above ornamental, but the library itself never pressures a decision; it passively admits and provides rather than complicating access.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The velvet observatory and midsummer heat pressure Ilya's choice: the dome amplifies sound, heat threatens the ice violin, and noon marks the museum's arrival. Micro-setting details (chipped cup, coffee stains, ferns by stairs) are lived-in and purposeful; the coffee-stain "archipelagos" and "perforations" prime the "perforated destiny" motif that charges the ending when the violin's neck dissolves into "lacework of choices collapsing into one." Sensory hierarchy reflects Ilya's professional lens (tracing provenance, listening to plants) and the urgency narrows perception appropriately at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("aurora draped its living veils," "drips; the aurora murmured like cloth rubbed on crystal"). The setting actively constrains the ritual: the grotto floats, the aurora's light powers the emerald chip, and the environment shapes the protagonist's perceptual field. The kit, chip, and balm function as micro-setting elements that drive action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the final image of the grotto carrying them "back through cloud like a boat at harbor" charges closure with concrete atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto functions as more than setting: the narrow slit constrains the hairpin's use, the vines demand specific care, the juniper provides a literal and metaphorical vantage for decision. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("stone grapes," "iron grapes and rain," "wet with dew that rose from below"). The umbral grotto above clouds charges the final image of terraces below, anchoring the cyclical work. Micro-setting (cistern, stool, pools) alters tactics and earns the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse gallery is grounded with selective sensory detail (wind fills the shawl, chimes wake from "different metal scavenged from wrecks"). The chimes function as micro-setting—their sound constrains the decision method and their arrangement (striker, brake) shapes the consultation ritual. The cloak and mirror shard operate as tactile objects within the ceremonial frame. Spatial choreography is coherent (climb, gallery rail, town below). The setting charges the final image when Lark steps to the rail with the town waking below, converting the lighthouse into a stage for public accountability.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto hum, and pond-between-candles constrain the ritual and charge the final image: "we watched a new stone rise from the pond...as if remembering up from down." The grotto's pull becomes a metaphor for time's tug, and the platform's drift mirrors the narrator's shift in stance. Sensory detail is selective—"lake smoke and copper," "sycamore hush," "moth songs"—and filtered through a contemplative POV. The stone's coolness, the pond's "slow forgetfulness," and the candles that "followed like obedient stars" integrate action and perception without postcard layering.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The towers of bone, shale pools, and weathered bench function as micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's stillness and listening method, and the black mirror seep anchors the arrowhead's climactic fall. Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's craft idiom ("ribs leaning," "wind had carved a bench for patience"), and the canyon's spatial logic remains coherent across moves. The arrowhead and cord charge the final image by constraining the choice to cast rather than skip. The setting surpasses vivid description by enabling the closure tactic (casting into the mirror to strike "the exact rib"), meeting the 9+ test for environment shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, the fog-braided risers, and the notch in masonry constrain choices: mist walking skips broken steps, the keystone clicks into absence, the platform flexes "like a sail." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cold as bell-tone, colors as condolences, moths from exhaled doubts. The street kiosk contrast charges the ending return. Body and tool (boots, keystone) anchor micro-setting. Missing occupational depth (mage training systems) is appropriate at this length; the spire's physics and the city's automation remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken ship library, kelp curtains, and hull slats create a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "nacre," "pearly vibration tarnished at the edges with rust," "ash descending like patient snow." The hotel skeleton key tag—a recurring small object—anchors choice (pressing it against the ledger to leave the vow) and charges closure. Spatial choreography (pier→water→hold→stacks→surface) tracks cleanly. No occupation-level demands at this length; the lamplighter role is legible and used.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ambered observatory deck, honeyed dome, and viewport with fossilized-sap gas clouds create vivid setting that constrains choice: reversing gyros to "face a silence with the posture of listening" directly shapes the middle beat. The coins function as micro-setting—"compact planets," "rainbows from worlds no longer in any astronomical address"—and their handling charges multiple moments. Sensory details (copper still, static softening, deck ripening into amber) are selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract cosmology.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory's cracked stone stair, great lens, wax cylinders, and dome constrain the ritual and charge the final image (dome holding "distant intimacy between star and city"). The atlas page with sea monsters is handled across multiple beats (taped to lens rim, monsters aligning with sorrow, serving as choirbook, traced at threshold). Sensory details—dust drifting, brine ticking below, grit and whisper filling air—are filtered through the reaper's focus and support the accumulative pressure. The body (hand shaking, breathing slowly, scythe as focus line) functions as micro-setting that enables the crystallization action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The viaduct at dawn supplies concrete tactical constraint: Efan must finish "before the sun cleared the distant chimneys" or "the day would stamp a clumsy rhythm." The broken bell is handled across multiple beats (hung from a salt scar, threaded with seaweed, set across stones, kissed by the fisherman) and its crack becomes a functional hinge for the drip ceremony. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Efan's observational lens: "sea made a sound like breathing through damp cloth, patient and irritated." The setting charges the final image when "the harbor" returns "a silver ripple" that validates the viaduct work. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight ridgeway, drowned foundations, and resurfaced street signs ground the piece in vivid, selective detail filtered through the warden's professional and memorial priorities. The sapphire label and photographs function as micro-setting that constrains the trail and charges the final gathering. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ridge, the drowned blocks, and the grove. However, sensory hierarchy leans heavily visual; touch, sound (frogs, loons), and the mirrored hush are present but underutilized in peak beats, and the "temporary gate" wind chime at the end arrives without prior spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The waterfall and orchard are vividly rendered—"bark like maps, their branches sketching equations and lullabies"—and the reliquary constrains Iri's final choice: she must place it where "the flame could not reach" to preserve both frost and blossom. The setting charges the closure image through the waterfall's "copper grace" echoing her hair and vow. Minor slip: the starlings' spatial choreography ("pressed into a helix," "frozen midflight") is described but their position relative to Iri and the orchard remains unclear during the peak beat, preventing a seamless 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal arbor above clouds is vivid and particular: braided-light stitching, rope veins, lanterns kept low "to keep the stars from feeling shy," platforms swaying like a breathing cathedral. The parachute buckle, guide ring, and rope constrain the watcher's physical choices. The vortex's heat-lens behavior and the colder ribbon route directly shape the revised approach. Spatial choreography is clear (rail, cradle, starboard wing). The micro-setting (buckle, lanterns, tapping rail) charges the final image when the ship kisses the cradle and the pilot climbs out.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    The floating rock dojo, clouds passing beneath, and umber tiles supply vivid spatial anchors and charge the final image when "the dojo drifted on, the clouds paused." The brain-in-jar altar and the sparring floor constrain the custody test choreography, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"little gusts of static to our teeth," "taste of river stones"—and filtered through the narrator's meditative stance. Minor gap: the petitioners' physical movements during the fire/water trade are described but spatial positions and distances remain slightly vague, preventing full choreographic clarity in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vivid and purposeful: it "inhales the night," returns whispers "as a heavier twin," and "translates" rain into cymbals, actively shaping the conductor's method. Sensory detail is dense and filtered through the conductor's professional lens (leaf blowers as violin section, engines "grateful cough"). Spatial choreography is coherent within the tunnel; the household three blocks away is anchored but never entered, which suits the design. The tunnel constrains the conductor's ritual and charges the final image when "the wind at his back" carries him home, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment must constrain a choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen garden, mist, and sundial constrain multiple choices: the sundial's "frozen mid-confession" shadow is placed on the protagonist's palm and interiorized, the mist "writes a syllabus on my coat sleeve," and the pendant's bead refuses to cross "where the mist begins," establishing spatial and metaphysical boundaries. Sensory selection is purposeful—"light pools like breath on glass," "smells of vellum and salt"—and filtered through the protagonist's dimensional displacement. The garden evolves from arrival ("late") to teaching (frostbite reading) to departure (interiorization), and spatial choreography (center sundial, guardian's approach, pendant radius) remains coherent. The environment charges the final image when "the world outside fits inside," fulfilling the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember nexus is vivid and functional: warm pennies, breathing furnaces, ashbed, grate, and oldest coals all constrain the ritual and supply the charged environment that enables the opening. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("embers brightened like small decisive eyes," "ashes sighed"), and the final spatial move—stepping into the opening with embers at ankles, air clearing to glassy blue—charges the closure image. The body and the crozier as micro-setting elements (palm pressed into heat, staff on ashbed) shape tactics throughout, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    The suspended radio tower city over a gorge is vividly rendered—rings like ribs, ladders broken, dishes yawning, cables knitting shadows—and directly shapes choice: the mast becomes the stylus, the gorge the record, the scar and bullet hole the site where the hush is pressed. The lunar perigee pulls on cables, blood, and tape, making the environment an active participant in the closure image. Sensory details (the smell of rain "just before it knows itself," winds braiding advertisements into prayers) are filtered through the protagonist's cosmic-practical lens and accumulate to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spectral grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the ceiling drips letters, the mirrored stars enable the lattice-alignment method, and the cold seam triggers the hourglass flip. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("water lay still as varnish," "frost in the shape of timetables"), filtered through the deckhand's peculiar perception. The grotto directly charges the closure by housing the threshold choice. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gallery is vivid and purposeful: "arches that did not agree with their shadows," tiles that brighten and darken with footsteps, walls that inhale and exhale. The sinew thread functions as micro-setting, anchoring choices (the architect nails and circles it, the visitor holds one end) and charging the closure when they step beneath the faint arch. Spatial choreography is clean across three distinct chambers. The recurring thread and the dust "like considerate snow" tie environment directly to the architect's method and the final triangle, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The benthic setting supplies concrete constraint: domes with kelp shadows, thermal layers, continental shelf scarps, lamps that erase edges. The chain link functions as micro-setting—pitted with salt, heavy, riding in the instructor's pocket during night crawls—grounding abstraction in tactile reality. The city council's lamp installation versus the instructor's night mapping creates a spatial pressure (light erasing what must be mapped) that drives the volunteer crawls. The final basalt ridge and plume edge anchor the alien encounter in geography rather than void.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium, the hearing aid as warm tactile object ("like a pocketed sparrow"), and the gallery of unclaimed photographs create a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: fog sliding in "as if the city has decided to lie down and sleep," the guard's mouth "open like an exit." The hearing aid's thrumming and the street's smell of oranges anchor spatial and sensory progression. The setting's layers—atrium, street, gallery, man's room—remain clear and the final convergence in "that reeling hush" ties space to emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting constrains every choice: the tidal window creates urgency, the entrance squeeze embodies claustrophobia, the door's phase-transition lock requires the fleck's heat-and-cold mechanics, and the terminal's location in the "intake room" with "brine-wet racks tilted like pews" charges the ritual tone. Body-as-setting is vivid: "pressed my face to granite and measured the air seam with my lips." The ice-knitting seal at exit provides a final spatial constraint that mirrors the opening breath-hold, and sensory selection reflects the narrator's priorities (cold pull of ocean, magnetic itch of buried wire).

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The opal dome, frost-webbed eyepiece, spilled ink saucer, and porcelain shard function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the protagonist scrapes frost to see, reads ink patterns to translate machine data, uses the shard as both wound-reminder and working tool. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"snow settling like fine ash," "ink crawls toward the heat"—and reflects the protagonist's technical and reflective priorities. The observatory's isolation and the array's blindness shape the stakes throughout, and the final image of the gleaming opaline dome charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon's "notch where sound did not disperse but turned" and the bone towers function as micro-setting that constrains method—only the echo-tunnel can read the stone's braille, and the updrafts enable kite-listeners. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "rasp like bark scraped by winter," "fuzz at the edge of every echo," "cold seams" at evening. The flawed diamond's "feathered fracture" and its warming pulse anchor tactile perception filtered through the narrator's task. Spatial choreography remains clear across cliff, ridge, tunnel, and updraft zones. The setting charges the final image by folding around the diamond and becoming a school; environment pressure and resource provision are sustained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground garden functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (doors jam, drain opens) and charges the final image (bulbs as "gravitationally playful attendants," the staircase of vertebrae). Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through the POV's cryptid-researcher attention: "roots climbed the masonry like fingers learning Braille, whispering of old weather and older mouths." The arrowhead, phone, and seedlings recur with specificity that narrows options at key beats. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting elements—bridge, orchard, statues, copper-leaf halos—constrain the protagonist's tactical choices (playing "resonantly soft" to avoid triggering patrol) and charge the final image when statues root "not in command but in choice." Sensory detail is vivid and selective: fog, sap, scent (peach, thunder, soil), and the orchard's "hush of wingless flight" all filter through urgency. The locust shell functions as micro-setting object, handled twice (railing, then cradled by statue) with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography remains clear across the bridge, orchard below, and gathering crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade, checkpoint fence, creek with spent batteries, and Mina's coal-lit doorway provide vivid spatial anchors. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "water tastes faintly of pennies," "room darkens like a pupil closing." The jar (micro-setting object) constrains the narrator's caution and charges the final image when its rain contrasts the smuggling drones. Spatial choreography across alleys, market, creek, and arcade remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train provides persistent spatial constraint: the menagerie car, generator car, hidden oasis, and carousel platform are distinct zones that guide the carpenter's search and discovery. The halo fragment (warm despite cold morning, orbits on a bubble, beams when activated) functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—it becomes the crown that allows the train to "take a long, relieving breath." The wind bells modulate action and perception throughout, creating temporal and sensory anchors. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the carpenter's tactile, auditory bias (sanding radii, coaxing spindles, listening to vibration). The oasis—roots breaching a tank, rain shepherded by bells—alters tactics by revealing the train's need for voice rather than power. Spatial choreography is clean; no teleporting props or impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scientific poetry library supplies recurring constraints—shelving by negative curvature, margins annotated with equations, the saddle-space between titles—that charge the final image when "shelves growing from seabeds, heavy with wet paper and salt" materialize and the narrator wrings the scarf to produce snow-letters. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: ozone and printer's ink, "air sharpens," "saltier," snow becomes letters. The scarf functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor whose frayed coastline-edge seeds the final wring-and-transform beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the lyric drift.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archipelago, library, and palette function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the sea's question forces stance, the palette wells fill "like held breaths," and the library shelves "leaned in as if listening is a structure." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt footprints in the stacks," "foam" stitching islands). The palette reappears at closure to "drain…light…a slow transfusion," charging the final image. Spatial choreography across causeways and the east door remains coherent. The watercolor palette and glass plates function as tools that enable the core action and recur with reweighted meaning at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard of broken mirrors angled toward stars is a micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's action: the mirrors show hidden rooms, align into a cathedral of swallowed whispers, and the first star's appearance triggers the path formation. The ribbon and lock of hair function as tactile objects handled across beats (bowed to, laid down, loosened, lifted). Spatial choreography is clear in the courtyard sequence. The "shadowed nexus" and starlight charge the closure image when the sky hums in answer. Slight deduction for the earlier domestic setting being named but not physically grounded—no sense of the original door's room or threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse constrains every choice: mirrors catch ring-sheen, broken ceiling panes become navigational maps, the hatch leads to the ledger. Micro-setting (slate, mask, mirrors) repeatedly alters tactics. The apple drifting toward the protagonist and bitten "like a pilgrim kissing a relic" charges the closure image with sensory specificity (salt, then sweetness) and causal pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear across underwater moves.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library's stacks, floorboards, courtyard window, and cracked mirrors constrain the archivist's backwards pacing and frame the council's arrival. The bottled shadow spills onto the floor to form a corridor—micro-setting charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective: "steam rising like faint script," "chipped porcelain that have learned to hold." Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Does not quite reach 8+ because environment enables rather than decisively narrows options at closure; the trial could occur without the shadow corridor's literal presence if argument alone sufficed.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    The parapet, waterfall mist, and orchard function as micro-setting that constrains Miren's gestures: she clips branches, taps the jar to the seed, plants in the seam "where the waterfall's mist left bright beads." Sensory detail is dense and purposeful ("scent like bread learning to rise"), filtered through Miren's professional and mythic priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear across her movement from limb to limb and the child's ascent. The crack between flagstones serves as the closure site, charging the final image with place-specific logic.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary, needle, net, and masks function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the restorer's professional lens ("whalebone polished smooth," "brittle as scripture"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (iron stair, net hung high, masks in a ring). The needle and net directly enable the ending's repair action, satisfying the constraint test for 9+ eligibility, though the setting itself does not force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rain-scoured vault, henge, and whispered chapel constrain multiple beats: cold air at the seam, architectural hush from the slit, names pricked in lime. The map tear and fresco detail charge the closure image by framing history's wound as seam. Sensory hierarchy filters through framer's eye: bevel, crease, embroidery metaphor. Spatial choreography tracks descent, wall trace, door lift, and shop return cleanly. Minor: the henge bookends feel more atmospheric than constraining—sheep threading needles is vivid but ornamental to choice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library setting constrains every move: silted chairs, swelled logbooks, algae-green globes, fish-chewed latitude lines. The snow globe functions as micro-setting, physically handled twice and charging the final image with its promise of "a second chance at weather." Spatial choreography (lamp along stacks, drift through doorway trailing rope, ascent along line) remains legible. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's professional lens, and the environment's decay mirrors the thematic question without shouting.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard "above clouds" with old broadcast wires and storm-charged air creates a vivid, high-altitude pressure chamber. The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: bolted to an antenna post, it becomes "a little harp for static, a tuned rain catcher," directly enabling the encoding that shapes the ghost dialogue and drives the ending's caretaking map. Setting elements constrain choice: service ladders, parapets, vent pipes, steam valves, bakery stove, standpipe—all manipulated on the page in the resolution. The misty, electrical atmosphere modulates with storm approach and charges the final image. Minor gap: spatial choreography of where exactly the balladeer works (wall proximity, antenna post location) remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, frost flowers, and scattered light through goggles constrain the decryption method across multiple beats. The elevator as "throat" recurs with purpose, and the final chamber of shelves provides the spatial anchor for closure. Sensory detail (whale oil smell, mica slivers, gust-seeded snow) is filtered through the narrator's affectionate focus. The micro-setting of goggles and light coins functions as environment that enables tactics, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sky gondola setting constrains action throughout: the drifting state narrows options, the instruments sway and affect readings, and the spatial isolation intensifies the emotional stakes. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("dusty starlight," "breath in the cold wake," the telescope's "seam of starlight"). The brass telescope and spare line coils function as charged objects that recur with evolving significance. The salt flats below and the squall line from the west provide concrete navigational pressure. Micro-setting (the gondola's interior, the chart table) shapes the protagonist's work and final documentation choice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tree trunk library is vividly realized through grain, rings, carved grooves, and bark-as-canvas, and it constrains key choices: the coin clicks into a notch, the rings guide painting rhythm, the hollow protects during collapse. The body is present in slowed heartbeat, careful breath, and charcoal-dusted fingers. Spatial choreography is clear (center, nook, shelves, high seam). The coin and vials function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Minor gap: the foreman and workers outside remain abstract presences rather than spatially grounded figures.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The airship gondola, rigging, and controls (altimeter, kettle, compass, sextant) are tactile and recur across beats; the dusty hopscotch board on the floor constrains the final choice by supplying the decode key. Sensory detail is filtered through the apprentice's professional attention: "halos gathered on the rigging, a pearly static that hummed against my teeth." The micro-setting (chalk lines, porthole grid) charges the closure by echoing the phrasebook doodle and enabling the figure-eight solution. Spatial choreography is clean; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen library, frost librarians, hall of mirrors, and tide-like reading room are vividly rendered with sensory specificity—"rime," "cedar warmth," "kelp-like ribbons of vellum." The setting actively shapes the locksmith's path: prophecies hidden in checkout cards guide navigation, mirrors respond to the uncapped bottle, clocks steady when he applies remembered shoreline cadence. The body and tools (gloves softened by breath, gear wheel filed to a notch) function as micro-setting elements that constrain action. The final image of the library creaking "like old boats rubbing hulls" charges closure with tactile resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating arches, moss-path sidewalks, and butterfly garden anchor setting with vivid particularity. The fractured arch during rescue supplies spatial constraint and urgency. However, much description (orchard shadows, hammock settlements, nebula color) remains postcard-vivid without altering a choice or shaping the closure image. The bell and rope become tactile at the rescue but do not charge the final launch beat beyond symbolic presence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse interior is sensory and specific: hush pane, nested gears, bevel tooth, the puppet on the sill. The body (thin gloves, scars used to listen, pulse filed gentler) and recurring object (puppet head) both constrain on-page choices—the protagonist consults the puppet before winding the springs—meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image when the beam turns and the world "pressed its cheek to the glass."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and orchard geometry constrain every choice: "we must be out before the night frost forms" creates spatial and temporal pressure, the lichen map guides navigation, and the split trunk serves as a clock. The boy's nut interacts causally with the wall crack, and the narrator's non-touching movement is a learned constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("apples study gravity and peaches rehearse seduction"). The final image of the cliffs holding their breath charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The braided ravine directly constrains her insight: "the channel braided into silver threads, breaking and rejoining" teaches the design principle for reversible polymer rings. Micro-setting elements (chrysalis, foam on wet stones, cobbles) are handled and charge the final image ("empty chrysalis lay between pages... I vowed to carry it into every meeting"). Sensory detail is filtered through her professional lens ("polymers recast as orchestration, chain lengths a choir") and the ravine's physical structure (islands of sand and willow, alder shade) supplies the metaphor that becomes the solution. The setting is indispensable to the discovery and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library and its micro-details (glass trunks, vellum door, plinth) constrain movement and choice throughout. The bottled moonlight functions as both tool and atmospheric anchor, used twice on-page to reveal the map and then open the hinge. The final image—"after the first sentence, which now lay sleeping in my hands"—recharges the opening placard and the comma-seed, anchoring closure in tactile specificity. The sea of clouds remains atmospheric rather than pressing choice, but the glass apple and chamber constrain the vendor's ritual actions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is dense and purposeful: wet stone, singed cumin, coral slick with ice, peppers hissing "like dunes in moon wind." The pavilion itself—coral frozen mid-bloom—constrains the chef's choice (must cut prisms, wrap in wet cloth, cook slowly). The fortress and its post-rain pools function as micro-setting that anchors the opening and recurs at closure ("puddles began to vanish… leaving only salt rings"). Spatial choreography is coherent across courtyard, dunes, pavilion, and kitchen.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    The astronomical clock tower, silos, and grain elevator are vividly sketched with functional specificity (gears, catwalks, conveyor belts), and the cuckoo clock weight physically constrains the first bridge span. However, the environment primarily serves as backdrop; it does not pressure a choice or charge the final image—Mara's plan unfolds without spatial friction. Micro-setting allowance is partially satisfied by the weight's counterbalance role, lifting the score into the 6-band, but no single setting element reweights options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit canyon is not postcard but instrument: mica walls scatter recollection, limestone shelves become workbenches, quakes answer pulses, and the canyon's "breath" and "seam" directly enable the protagonist's passage through memory strata. The broken mirror functions as both tool and recurring object, its fractures serving as notch filters and its final split charging the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (chirr of shocked crickets, cold air threading like memory). The micro-setting of canyon-as-amplifier constrains the protagonist's method and charges the final choice to leave with shards rather than trophies.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (luminous pollen, ridged stones, stalactites as crowns) and the inverted-gravity hour creates spatial pressure. The iron band with the astonished eye functions as micro-setting: it refracts the narrator's sight into "panes, each pane an itinerary of locks," directly enabling the safe-opening sequence and charging the final warm consensus. Spatial choreography remains clear (threshold effects, chamber unwrapping, upside-down reentry) and the environment constrains the visit to the tilt-hour window.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The siskin alder grove functions as micro-setting throughout: bark texture guides the protagonist's listening, the old sculpture's fractures teach tuning, and the porcelain insulator anchored in grooves becomes the instrument. Sensory hierarchy is strong—touch and auditory detail dominate, filtered through the protagonist's craft ("rings beneath bark," "whisper register"). The hedgehog's uncurling and reclosing bookend the piece, grounding the emotional arc in the grove's response. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling at stump, threading roots, tying to branch), and the environment constrains every choice: the grove's memory of drought and shelter informs what the protagonist coaxes from the trees.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic nexus constrains on-page choices: compass trembling, hum modulating with moves, the hollow's centuries-worn gloss. The basalt stone (micro-object-as-setting) charges the final image when it settles and the field quiets. Sensory detail is selective and stakes-driven—"orange hush," "chords like rain on slate." Spatial choreography is coherent (monoliths, flat slab, central stone). The setting supplies resources (riverbed stones as pieces) and pressures (tourist drones breaking stillness) that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed workshop, copper bowl, reed, mothwing microphone, and the diary itself function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the protagonist cannot pry, must tune frequencies, must wait for resonance. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("rubbed graphite," "antiseptic oranges," "silence is dough"), filtered through the pacifist/archivist lens. The fireworks timeframe and the town holding breath create spatial and temporal pressure. The recurring tools (bowl, reed, microphone) charge the final image when the protagonist writes their own entry. Minor point: the workshop's physical layout is less developed than the objects within it, but this does not harm momentum at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The treetop village is vividly particular—boards sway "like breathing," six ropes converge, pots "sing nervous hymns"—and the setting constrains choice (planting at the bridge's heart, the trembling ropes unsettling sleep). Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the protagonist's olfactory bias ("taste the world through currents of scent"). The corpse flower's smell is rendered with specificity ("rank yet promising revelation," "feral and cavernous") and the bridge-as-body recurs to charge the final steadying. Micro-setting (the cradle of woven air roots) and spatial choreography remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating arches, inverted gravity, and water-flow navigation create a vividly specific environment that constrains movement and choice throughout. Micro-setting detail—the resin spindle, the algae-veiled underbellies, the boulder-riding grove—charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the pilot's professional lens. The orchard planet functions as both stage and crucible, shaping tactics and the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The container labyrinth and boulevard funnel constrain the investigator's survey method and directly charge the final image: the patch "barely stirs" in the new corridor, proving the offset worked. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: salt, rust, mothball sweetness, then tactical details (glass pattern, eddy-snatched tarps, tape-streamer breath). The forklift "within a ripple of broken glass" and dust devil "trained by walls and steel boxes" convert setting into active antagonist. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical moves (fire stair climb, helipad sightline). The concrete "twenty meters north and three seconds late" anchors abstract wind into navigable constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ice cavern supplies vivid sensory anchors (frost-flowers, stalactites singing harmonic glass, aurora as metronome) and the column of blue ice directly enables the bell placement. Spatial choreography is clean and the aurora's changing colors pace the ritual. The setting participates in the ending ("the hush remained unfettered") but does not constrain a final choice or charge the closure image with immediate consequence, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Thunder-echo range supplies concrete sensory texture—"canyon hush pressed like velvet," "chalky dirt," "air cooled in a straight, unnatural line"—and the environment constrains tactics: driftwood markers guide because "its grain later told which winds had lied." The flute warming "as if remembering fingers that were not mine" charges the closure image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the ridgeline descent and gully approach. Deduction: the "vacant market" and "colored awnings" read slightly generic; more sensory specificity or a single odd detail (a broken stall, a particular color pattern) would sharpen the stakes of loss and make the place irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The topaz workshop functions as micro-setting throughout: grit is swept from the tympan, the halo fragment warms in its drawer, the press shudders. The observatory across the alley provides spatial counterpoint and supplies the star maps that become commissions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("oil, citrus, and topaz dust"), and the vanishing star at the end becomes a tactile anchor ("the absence washes my hands cleaner than solvent") that charges the closure image. The setting constrains the protagonist's process and supplies the metaphoric vocabulary (points, picas, ligatures) that structures thought.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridgeway hums, lightens, and sings—its green note enables the germination and pressures the final beat. The pendant vibrates sympathetically, choosing pitch and constraining the ritual. Snow, aurora, and the rock where the yew is planted all charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the courier's professional lens (tuning fork, sugar thread, thaw). Micro-setting (cupped hands, bone tube warmth) drives the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quartz arbor "grew from the hill like frozen rain, each pillar veined with minerals that drank the morning" is vivid and non-generic, and it returns at closure ("the arbor grew luminous") to charge the final reconfiguration. The car window's hoarfrost becomes a functional tool—its patterns reveal stored grief—thus micro-setting (body + object) constrains the communion ritual and charges the ending. Spatial choreography (trailhead → arbor → car → arbor again) remains clear across transitions. The mist and loam anchor sensory perception without catalog excess, and the prism's warmth against the narrator's hand ties physical sensation to the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest anchor the setting early with vivid, selective detail: "pruned by neglect," "raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry." The loom itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Kio's choices (threading puzzle edges, clicking the amber shuttle). Sensory selection is purposeful—cicadas, bamboo breath, moonlight—and filtered through Kio's patient, wistful attention. The spatial choreography remains coherent across the weaving process, the fabric's drift through the rows, and the final return to the seated spinner. The environment charges the final image: the orchard breathes, the loom empties, morning waits.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard planet with floating arches is established vividly ("patient whales," azure sky, grit and blue fire) and recurs at key beats. The magician's silk functions as micro-setting, constraining Iven's bargain through its truth-tightening property and reappearing at closure when he "lifted the silk and it snapped bright." The mine shafts supply tactical infrastructure (arteries for pushing from beneath), and the final image of bells ringing "in a key of azure defiance" charges the tone-setting with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    The repair bay is vivid and constraining: "ozone and rain," "hanging chains," "tools arranged...like a prayer wheel." The shard functions as both object and micro-setting, focusing photologs and charging the final image with "green as planetfall." Spatial choreography across parallel universes is legible, and the terminal becomes a tactile anchor that shapes the discovery beat. The prose filters setting through the POV's occupational bias (sensory mapping) without slipping into catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The haunted lantern room, the pedestal, the crook of the stairs, and the sill all constrain action: the narrator lights a candle when the lamp dies, finds sea glass by the pedestal, places letters in the stair crook, and sets the glass on the sill where "the candle brightened as if gratified." The stacked stones and the physical acts of folding letters "small as shells" and tucking them into stone cairns create tactile, lived-in space. The body and small objects (candle, sea glass, stones) function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Scope fits: the single-location pressure and the objects' recurrence across beats elevate this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    The emerald glass foundation, fused silica wick, and storm-mouth imagery supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: beam steering through prisms, sleeping on the stair, and the lamp room glass all constrain action and charge atmosphere. Sensory selection reflects urgency (kelp in hair, phosphor and wind) and the green glass returns at closure to reweight the vow. Spatial choreography remains coherent across vertical tower moves.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating tea house constrains action throughout—the house "bobbed as if curtsying to their burdens" when customers arrive, ropes sing, the floorboards wobble. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, its "iridescent caution" teaching the narrator how to position herself and others in the light. Sun trails tracked across the room create spatial choreography that directly shapes the narrator's technique of adjusting who receives stories. The final image anchors in the wing above the window and the sun's conspiracy, making setting essential to closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the dye master's professional attention to light, color, and gradation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stormlit tower, labyrinth corridors, and recurring objects (sextant, root, tags) all constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent: parapet → upper stair → lower ring → sliver room behind wall. The sextant pressed against the root to reveal the hidden archive is a micro-setting move that alters tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful (chains like silvered vines, milk blue breath of lightning) and filtered through the maintenance worker's lens. No cap trigger; environment shapes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mica window functions as micro-setting and loom, constraining the weaving process ("each flaw a hook, each stripe of mica a shuttle") and charging the final image when it "becomes a covenant, framing us all." The greenhouse's roots, trunks, pollen, and the pomegranate trees' hoarded lullabies ground choices in tactile detail. Sensory selection is purposeful: "taste of iron on memory," "wet with patient stars," "warm tea" light spilling. The mirror world's thinning light and the realm's embarrassment at its own dimming are filtered through the protagonist's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is coherent across the orchard, nursery, and window-loom without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The secret library's spatial choreography (toppled shelf, corridor, paired books) is clear and purposeful. The stationery shop anchor (unsent letters sold) charges the protagonist's arrival and primes the ending by linking past shame to present action. The tea, slate, and paired volumes function as micro-setting tools that constrain the conversation's tone and pace. The fluorescent-to-warm lamp transition reflects the protagonist's shift in perception and supports the "enlarged tranquility" motif, though the effect remains more atmospheric than choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The overgrown courtyard constrains access (thorn, nettle test patience) and the tea house breathes with moss and peeling lacquer, all filtered through the narrator's archival attention. The bread placed "in the middle table" and crumbs tucked "where the cracked sill meets the earth" function as micro-setting that charges the communion beat. The final image of "seeds crowding the seams and a table waiting" reconfigures the space from forgotten to re-inhabited. Spatial choreography remains clear (path, balusters, sundial, low structure, doorway, rafters, table, sill, garden seams).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective detail (frost on ledgers, icicles spelling alphabets, quartz hush) that creates strong atmosphere. The magic lantern operates as micro-setting and tool, constraining the measuring process and driving key beats. The final image—lantern beam grazing the storm, villages flickering in sympathetic cadence—charges the closure moment and ties environment to the conceptual stakes. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, study carrel, window) and the cold physically shapes the protagonist's actions (mittened hands, breath frosting the lens).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rotting pier, lantern-braided planks, and truce of hush create a tactile, constraining environment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "limes rolled bright as moons," "one split with a wet gasp," salt/rot/lullaby under bare feet. The setting directly enables Lark's plan (the hush forbids speech, forcing gesture and implication) and the toppled crate becomes a catalyst. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves, and the dawn seam opening above the river charges the final image, placing this firmly in the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lavender bluff under aurora provides concrete spatial grounding and charges the final image ("we walked back over the lavender bluff"). The tin compass ring's taste-navigation creates micro-setting specificity (pennies, unripe pear, honey, ash) that constrains choices at the meadow fork. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's professional priorities (sensors, taste-based navigation) and shifts under pressure (taste changes from direction to pronoun). The forest elections function as both atmosphere and constraint, shaping the timeframe and the weatherbearers' convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave constrains the climactic choice—charcoal drawn on crystal aligns imaginary tumblers with steel, a micro-setting move that charges the closure. Sensory detail (mineral air, violet/green glow, damp stalagmites) is selective and filtered through the artist's mnemonic POV. The recurring charcoal—from boardwalk to cave to final frame—acts as both tool and thematic object, present in the final image. Minor: the carnival stalls above receive less tactile grounding than the cave, but spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse city pressures all choices: toxic sky mandates enclosure, humid environment enables leaf-post, condensate becomes the vault's mechanism. The zinc postal plate fragment functions as both tool and key, constraining the route and charging the final opening. Sensory detail is purposeful—"condensate beaded along rails like punctuation," "air turned sharp with a confession." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through fern hospital, hatch, vault chamber, and return. The micro-setting (bench, gutters, jars) supplies the logic for where truth collects and how it might be released, charging the closure image when "jars breathe."

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff, clouds, and iceberg fragment constrain Iri's method and charge the closure: the shard's angle catches sun, triggering the harmonies that persuade the Keepers. Micro-setting (sculptures, bells, the fragment cradled in ropes) is tactile and purpose-driven. Sensory hierarchy reflects Iri's priorities (graphite chalk, mallet, ledger marks). Spatial choreography is coherent: Keepers step among frames, Iri nudges the shard, light pours through. The environment forecloses the option of portability—this truth-telling cannot be archived—qualifying the setting for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dome environment constrains multiple choices: nutrient fog behavior, pump polarity, sensor chirps guide recalibration. The tin as micro-setting object charges the closure (rows six and seven, "open beside me"). Sensory hierarchy reflects android POV: technical readouts ("magnetic north shifts... hard click"), tactile detail ("rubberized fingers"), visual metaphor filtered through code logic ("radio of empty frequencies"). The roses function as both setting and stake, their mineral-organic hybridity mirroring the protagonist. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The body-as-setting (chest plating, rib of code) participates in the final loosening image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard supplies proximate resources (hibiscus shadows, the bolted mailbox, bougainvillea) that frame every beat and the locked box physically constrains choice throughout. The hairpin from the locket becomes a micro-setting tool that charges the climax. Sensory selection is purposeful: "sandstorm calm, a hush gritty and tender around our ankles" filters environment through the narrator's curatorial lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across the circle formation and the news crew's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly particular ("rust sighed in the beams," "glass tablets etched by corrosion," "blue warning through the corridors") and constrains the protagonists' methods: they must use dance and coded journals because speech would trip alarms, and the floor is "the only page left to write on." The Warden Current functions as spatial pressure, narrowing their tactics. The hangman's dice and glass tablets are handled across multiple beats, charging the final image when the rigging hums. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through urgency. Minor deduction for occasional drift into abstraction ("barometric weight of the drowned names").

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting constrains multiple choices: the salt chamber provides the chemist's archive method, the whale's ribcage creates the spatial pressure for exhumation, and the piers house the gravity pockets that drive the final corridor discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (lantern posts, rope slackness, light behavior). The micro-setting of the tin of wildflowers functions as tactile anchor that charges the closure when scent returns. Spatial choreography remains clear across four locations (pier, chamber, whale, memory pocket) without floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nocturnal brook setting is vivid and consistently filtered through the summoner's attentive perception ("sleeping stars," "moonmilk," "velvet riverbed"). The origami wing and water function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual's method. However, the environment does not pressure a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it serves as stage and symbol rather than active constraint. The final image ("the wing drifted back, unharmed") charges atmosphere but does not hinge the closure decision.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stairwell's "syntax of weight and habit," rooftop garden with rosemary planters, and meteor shower create a coherent micro-world. Spatial choreography is clean: door knock → hallway tea → rooftop ascent. The antique desk seal pressed to coping stone constrains the closure choice—its impression in wax becomes the medium through which the building speaks, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "heat from his kettle made the hallway gentler," "planters of rosemary lifted their small green prayers," "wax…warmed like a small obedient star." The building as animate setting (breathing, remembering rain) is consistent and voice-filtered. One minor slip: the transition from weekly indoor sessions to the rooftop lacks a temporal cue, though the meteor shower anchors the night.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet garden, fountain, and twilight-to-dawn frame anchor the single scene and modulate with emotional pressure (shadows "shelving themselves" at closure). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("tragically radiant sky, a bruise of cobalt"), but the garden itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The shell functions as micro-setting more than the garden proper, yet its physical handling is sparse (pressed to ear, placed against fountain, held to stone) without showing how proximity or material properties shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The marble sanctuary under aurora supplies concrete sensory anchors—stalactites dripping, green veils, columns like seashells—that are filtered through the calligrapher's professional lens (letters, margins, breath between strokes). The rose thorn, key, and scroll case function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices: the key "opens" silence, the thorn "kisses" thumb to yield ink. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (approach, case opening, planting thorn, exit), and the aurora's rhythm tempos the final strokes, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The serpentine nexus, reeds, water, and whispering seashell half create a vivid, tactile micro-environment. The shell functions as a constraint and tool: Lio "aims its broken mouth toward the water, unsure which side drinks and which side tells," making it active in the investigation. Sensory details are filtered through Lio's auditory bias ("wind combs the reeds with reed-blown melancholy"), and the water's physical responses (crown of silt, reeds brushing) anchor abstract answers in concrete imagery. The setting charges the final promise to the water, making environment integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice shrine, portholes, ferry wreck, and melted snow globe anchor setting with purpose: the globe's base and crank constrain the reveal, the ferry's "ribs" and "cabins gape like pulled teeth" guide the dive, and borrowed starlight frames tone. Spatial choreography across dive/shrine/town is legible. The piece does not reach 9+ because while environment supplies resources (globe, scarf, seat position), no single setting element demonstrably narrows a choice at a pressure point—setting stages rather than forces.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering parapet supplies the stage and constraint: wet stones guide the demonstration's choreography, runoff and lichen become teaching tools, and the parapet's breathing/humming response charges the ending. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting (tool-as-constraint), enabling the tea-foam galaxy that makes hidden effort visible. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the philosopher's attention: "laundry wounds bandaged to creaking lines," "fireflies lift and settle, a scintillatingly somber choir with lantern throats." Spatial choreography remains coherent as the crowd rearranges and individuals squat to trace moss. The recurring moon-path motif anchors movement across the district without catalog excess. Minor issue: "demure audacity" as descriptor leans slightly toward label rather than fully embodied contradiction, though actions (sitting presuming the night will listen, offering silence as spectacle) dramatize it adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard under radioactive dust storms functions as both macro-setting and constraint: "cone of calm around the packing shed" becomes the investigative target, and the protagonist's final act of marking "spots where the calm failed" and charting "new nodes for the next storm" shows setting guiding tactics. The shredded letters "still smelled faintly of disinfectant and pear blossoms" roots sensory detail in POV priorities. The diamond as field-resonator object charges the closure when the protagonist refuses it, saying "the orchard needed its own heart"—micro-setting (packing shed, locked office, irrigation pits) all constrain choices and the final image of walking out is anchored in rows and sacks and songs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt glass portico, storm, antennae, and radio constrain choices throughout: the narrator waits inside thunder, tunes frequencies, and the portico "creaks, then opened" at the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (mountain, rise, town below). Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's priorities (radio static, tea, brass rail rhythm). The observatory-as-setting charges the final image when "wind wrote on our cheeks" and seeds scatter into lightning. Gritty whimsy operates via "crooked spoons," "suitcase of seeds," and "work boots" grounding prophetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft's "saltwood and rope" construction and sill-mounted jars constrain the poet's method and charge the final image (box resting on sill, windows open). Sensory selection is sharp—"iron and tea," "sea sugar"—and filtered through the poet's material poverty and sound-trade idiom. The music box's physical state (barnacled, rusted) alters tactics: he must wind it and wait for dawn wind to coax sound. Spatial choreography remains clear across loft-to-beach transition. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the dunes themselves apply minimal tactical pressure beyond framing; the body and recurring objects (jars, box) do most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    The drift-ice marina, lighthouse stair, and lens room are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ice floes nudge "like shy animals," landings smell of "salt and lamp oil"). The crypt keeper's key constrains access and charges the final partnership. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the ice and weather remain largely atmospheric; they do not actively narrow a tactical choice or alter the confrontation's outcome, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct form a coherent micro-setting that constrains choices: the narrator waits at the viaduct "after rain" when the magnets "pull our soles to steadiness," the sanctuary's retained heat signals shelter, and the ice's "private music" marks seasonal pressure. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("wind combed the reeds," "swallows rode its currents as if ordained"). Spatial choreography is clear across all moves (lake → viaduct → sanctuary → return). The viaduct's铁stone hum and the sanctuary's warm basalt charge the final image when the village gathers "beside the coals" and "our patient revolution stood," making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel functions as constraint and resource: salt-crusted grates trap water (enabling the drowning), the dead third rail and shallow water frame the investigation spatially, and the lantern's niche and air shaft bookend the closure. Sensory detail is filtered through professional observation (ripples, salt bloom, vapor drawn by the wick) and modulates with urgency. The city's "exhaled breath" and "habits lingering in machinery" anchor the drought's aftermath as both atmospheric frame and causal agent. The micro-setting (grates, rails, air shaft) charges the final image when the investigator "offered it back to the night." Idiom is consistent and locale-specific without postcard tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair shop is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (brass filings, bench lamp, nest of screwdrivers). The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (bent thorn) and charging the final image (ticking as map). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The visiting-room windows and storm-cloud light are signaled early and return to guide Jonah's stance, elevating the ending. Occupational detail (tweezers, oils, escapement) reads plausible and pressures the chaplain's understanding without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The acid sea, floating workshop, and cart glider are vivid and purposeful: "wheels that spun above boiling brine," "vapor," "steam." The kaleidoscope tube is handled twice (porthole, then recalibration) and constrains Ilex's method. Spatial choreography is clear (rafters, rim, rails, porthole). The final image—cart idling, acid wind tearing cloud—charges the ending. The "gears-and-cogs workshop" label and "acid sea" recur but remain slightly generic; more tactile micro-setting detail under pressure would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive hum, the cold vault air "smelling like old servers," and the Sink's lyric-challenge door create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the narrator's path and charges the final act of posting to the memorial group. Spatial choreography across the "archive labyrinth" is coherent, and the digital environment is filtered through the narrator's attentive idiom. Occupational verisimilitude (metadata, node IDs, content graph) reads plausible and purpose-driven, grounding the conceptual stakes in a lived workspace.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage store supply vivid, purposeful constraint: the groaning ice underscores urgency, the mirrors enable reconstitution, and the lantern pears charge the climactic gathering. Sensory selection is excellent ("floes bit at each other like tired wolves," "ice groaning below like a thing trying to sleep"). The shard's silk wrap and the mirrors' "quiet choir" recur with shifted meaning at closure. The environment pressures choices (beacon saplings, watch shifts paired to the tides) and the final image of a splitting floe signals ongoing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly anchored (boats knocking like knuckles, pontoons groaning, eels and frost after the storm) and constrains choices: ice weakness must be sounded, the child falls through a hollow, the storm forces clearing of plankways. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting/tool, charging the final salute. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's listening obsession. Minor limit: occupational detail (disaster relief volunteering, harbor clinic) is named but not textured with procedural specificity that would push this into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pavilion, vines, lantern, and gravel road are established early and sensory details (amber glow, creaking trellis, moths at glass) are filtered through the sentinel's occupational focus. The pavilion bench becomes the site of the traveler's map-rewrite, a micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Pruning knife and twine function as tools that enable the closure act. Minor slip: some metaphoric flourishes ("leaf glow," "halos") drift toward decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and drift soot create a vivid micro-setting that constrains ritual action throughout. The parapet "heaves to meet" the wind and must be steadied by recitation; the pavilion's "glass ribs" and "hushed consonants" guide the timing of moves. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the keeper's craft-focused POV. The sand's underbody and the valley's memory-skittishness anchor world rules that directly shape the central task. The final image of tracks filling and the parapet "curling to sleep" charges closure with environmental embodiment, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraint on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lavender field and factory ruins form a charged micro-setting that guides the ritual's spatial choreography: bees, diesel ghosts, and factory ribs anchor the tactile world. The dove gray map case with its mirror bottom functions as a recurring object that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is selective and filtered through the archivist's professional lens ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight"). One constraint check: the corridor placement along field rows alters the town's collective walk, so the setting constrains choice and charges the final image, qualifying for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library at dawn is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("dust becomes constellations," "morning air hums"). The crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining the scholar's method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (table, shelves, glass) remains clear. The "shadowed library" and "suspended hush" actively shape the scholar's listening posture and final testimony, qualifying as essential setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fog sculpture garden constrains choices throughout: statues provide mouths to chalk-circle and press ears against, driftwood offers material for directional markers, tide schedules the prophet's movements and rearranges his compass, and the toppled barnacled head becomes the final kneeling site. Sensory hierarchy is strong—salt tremor felt in wrists, gull cries braided into static, chalk dust turning to milk on metal—and filtered through the prophet's priorities (sound over sight, resonance over color). The garden's physical elements (anchors, whale ribs, rusted torsos) are not postcard ornament; they supply the infrastructure for his ritual. The videotapes and museum loading dock add ambient detail but remain atmospheric rather than tactically urgent, preventing the setting from fully charging the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory setting constrains every choice: cracks from the landslide, the misaligned pier, cooling lines, mounting collars. Tools (diaphragms, capacitors, arbor) are handled across multiple beats and the misalignment directly alters tactics ("I loosened the mounting collar, a quarter turn"). The recurring leaf-sound anchors the POV's perceptual filter and charges the final memory callback. Micro-setting (sensor housings, monitor, cloud sea below) saturates the action without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hospice room is vividly particularized: clouds crossing "like slow animals," sunlight pooling "like water he could swim," the shard wrapped in gauze on the bedside tray. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (clementine scent, radiator clang, sneaker squeak) and filtered through the therapist's professional lens. The recurring objects (shard, clementine peel, blanket with pooled light) constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (cart, door, bedside, window), and the micro-setting (the room itself) functions as the crucible for reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating isle, nocturnal observatory, mirrors, and clockwork key are richly specific and constraining: mirrors must be arranged "like a throat," the shutters opened to a "thin seam," the key turned nine times to complete "the forgotten motion of a noon bell." The environment directly shapes the protagonist's tactics and charges the closure image (shutters opening "a fraction," noon arriving without a sun). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. No orientation debt penalty applied; the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The secret garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: "mint and iron," the fountain's "dialect of abandoned plans," and the lattice where the tooth is found all pressure the investigation and charge the final leaving of the tooth "under the fountain stone." Spatial choreography is coherent (maze→bench→Ari's emergence→wrapping his shoulder). The hedge as shifting constellation-map and the "deep blue hour" anchor the closing stance without postcard drift. Sensory detail is filtered through the bone-setter's professional eye (dentin rings, joint mechanics) and selective without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto constrains the work spatially (damp light, mist, pebbles) and the sea glass itself functions as micro-setting, polished against slate, leather, coat—each surface choice mattering. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "petal-cool softness," "salt brightness," "kelp fiber." The garland's interaction with grotto breath at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (grotto→cliff stairs→village lane). The body and tools (tongue, slate, cuff) constrain action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moss garden constrains the meeting choreography and charges the final burial act; the drip-pattern constellation functions as micro-setting that shapes their path and mutual gesture. Sensory detail is purposeful: "honeyed hush," "pale dots," "loam that tasted silicon once and tastes rain now" anchor transformation through concrete texture. Spatial choreography is clean (gate, towers, fern bowl, kneeling positions). The exposed chain in soil becomes the closure image, making setting indispensable to the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The feral nexus is anchored with vivid, selective detail: rust reeds, bloomless thistle, freight hymns, mist that "thickened like ink." Sensory selection reflects the reflective, watchful stance (visual and auditory emphasis). The river's "contrary thread" and the act of wading constrain the protagonist's ritual choice, charging the final image when they step out and "the nexus rearranged itself." The shell fragment functions as micro-setting, throbbing "like a pocketed star" and aligning with "the secret spine of water," meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor slip: spatial choreography is sometimes vague (where characters "drift from fog" without clear positions).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The arbor, frame, and tendril function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual's mechanics and charges the final image when "the frame hummed" and "the tendril glowed gold-green." Sensory details—"dew trembled into tone," "needles at the edge of hearing"—are vivid and filtered through a collective, reverent POV. However, spatial choreography of the village gathering is vague, and the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Q3 cap at 7.0 applied per Orientation Test penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard (branches like ribs, frost-traced trunks, closed-eye bark scar) and the glassed-ash lake constrain the alchemist's navigation and listening method. Sensory detail is dense and POV-filtered: "sap frozen mid-throb," "steam trapped under ice like breath under a sleeping child's quilt," "fissure breathing faint warm air." Spatial choreography tracks clearly from orchard interior → tree with scar → orchard lip → lake center. The closed-eye bark and the breathing fissure both serve as micro-settings that charge the final act: he must find the warmth source to unseal the world's breath. The ampoule and plate function as portable anchors; the bottle-glass crumbs mark a navigable trail, fulfilling the stake's demand for a route others can follow.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble cavern constrains his method throughout: reflection angles, echo returns, stalactites, and the hollow behind the veined column all shape his tactical choices. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (chalk lines on "white ribs," water drip as metronome, bats skirting ceiling) and advances action rather than cataloging. The timer mechanism functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the four-day sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bronze grotto constrains the scene spatially (ribs, pooled echoes, flat rock for the lamp) and the kerosene burner functions as a micro-setting anchor, its halo buying "a path of glow" that enables the weighing work. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("drips, starlight, and my expectant breath"), filtered through the narrator's task-oriented focus. The recurring night-cave environment charges the final transition to "thawing streets" and "shingled hush became song," reweighting interiority against exteriority at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight and workbench function as micro-setting that constrains every choice: the kettle as metronome, droplets as "little lenses" that freeze the world, ropes and tins as witnesses. Sensory hierarchy filters through the carver's priorities—ash texture checked like a pulse, shavings curling like whiskers, rust-hued peace from tea laying weight on wrists. The loft's spatial choreography is precise (bench, shelf, sill, window) and the carving's placement on the sill beside kettle and tin charges the final image. The recurring rain teaches containment and release, directly shaping the climactic window-opening.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kinetic lagoon, carousel skeleton, and turbine raft provide charged micro-setting that constrains the negotiation spatially. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("muffled clinks," "turbine sighs measure minutes"). The camera wheel and salvaged bolts function as tactile anchors that ground the lyric mode. However, the lagoon's physics (swells, churns, lifts waves) remain atmospheric rather than mechanically legible, and the "above the clouds" frame lacks sufficient spatial grounding to prevent occasional white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terminal functions as active setting: duct vanes, valve handles, breakers, and skylights constrain the intern's choices at each junction. Sensory detail is filtered through engineering POV—"flows were wrong," "circuits murmured"—and the sextant piece as micro-setting charges the final image when set on the counter "catching the starless light." Spatial choreography remains coherent across concourse, medbay, archives, and ballroom. The abandoned spaceport's layered history (evacuation routes under carnival chalk) provides texture without tourist-catalog exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The soundless sanctuary and crystal forecourt are rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail—"coolness write careful letters on his soles," "micro echoes traveled through them like news carried by ants." Spatial choreography is clean across all moves. The forecourt functions as micro-setting: the protagonist's barefoot contact and the finch's arrival on the balustrade charge the final reconfiguration. Environment constrains the protagonist's listening practice and shapes the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The canal setting is vivid and purposeful: brick arches, lockmaster steps, and warehouse quays guide movement and constrain choices. The sundial functions as micro-setting, warming in the protagonist's palm and offering a "polite witness" that charges the final mood. Sensory detail is selective—"slime-green seal," "breath you could see"—and filtered through the protagonist's professional lens. The box's emergence from the water and the quay meeting both use spatial choreography to pressure decisions, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden dock under snow, fog, and harbor create a vivid, specific micro-setting that charges the atmosphere. Sensory details—fulgurite glass warming in the mitten, the dock "ticking like a clock," rope's "slow grammar"—are selective and tied to POV priorities. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a rich backdrop rather than a force that shapes the protagonist's decisions. The spatial choreography is clear, and the setting primes the final image, but without causal pressure on action, the setting cannot reach the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed garden in autumn and the cracked fountain anchor the scene vividly. Quince trees bruise themselves fragrant, leaves spend shine, and the garden "recognizes" the narrator—all purposeful and filtered through the narrator's lyric lens. The thread as micro-object constrains the ritual (knotted, laid along names, looped on wrist) and charges the closure when it becomes the woman's pilgrim trail. Spatial choreography (stone lip, ivy door) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, iron forests, and aerie balcony provide vivid spatial anchors. The cradle assembly (silk cables, bone pegs, broken harp) and the egg's placement beneath a rose window constrain the prince's choices and charge the final image when the creature leaps to that window. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the prince's reverence for lost beauty. The setting subtly guides action—he scavenges from the palace, engineers lend screws, librarians trace feathers—grounding the lyric register in tactile moves. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian lagoon and volcanic textures (kelp-drift, cooled lava, black sand) are vivid and selective, filtering through the protagonist's firefighter attention. The coin and sand function as micro-setting tools that constrain her ritual choices and charge the grafting beat. Spatial choreography is clear (she kneels, the boy stands behind, the seedling is grafted into a stump), and the sea-lettuce fringe and gull-runes anchor the locale without catalog excess. The lagoon's obsidian skin as "a throat clearing before speech" ties setting to theme without heavy symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The city's dry fountains, cracked lips, lime-streaked statues, and fish-tiled plaza create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting: it constrains Ilias's method (angling toward sun, fitting light to stone) and charges the closure moment when he lifts it as promise. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dust, vapor on tile, pigeon wings). Spatial choreography remains coherent across plazas and arcades, and the environment subtly mirrors the thematic drought without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The nebula garden is vivid and specific: petals as quivering lanterns charged by sonar, orchard of nebulas where each cloud remembers shaping hands. The setting constrains the central teaching (no flame, only resonance) and supplies the sonar medium that enables the transit. The calculating-machine gear functions as micro-setting, warm brass that once turned futures, and it charges the child's palm in the pivotal beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the otherworldly sentimentalist's lens without catalog excess. Environment and recurring object together meet the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: condensation planets, cracked roof admitting butterflies, lettuce beds steadying the father, broken vents delivering spectral drafts. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (dirt path "glowed faintly, as if the floor remembered sunlight the way skin remembers touch"). The potting bench serves as recurring anchor across beats. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the weeks-long span. The butterflies' feet as "commas trembling with the authority of mercy" teeters toward overwriting but stays within the established lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and pendulum bob are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the closure. The ridge "breathes with the moon," surfaces "drowned monograms," and its "slow knell" answers the tower's bells in the final beat. The bob's "brass scarred by salt" and its arc embody communal time; stopping it "at the turning point" is the story's hinge. The rake handle's inscriptions guide which screw to loosen, which neighbor to visit—tool-as-constraint. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, tower mechanism, descent, ridge meeting. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the winder's guilt and repair: "metal taste on the air feels like a promised truce," "sea has spat up mirror shards of night." Minor gap: dawn light and tidal state are gestured at but not tracked as they would shape a real harbor worker's timing.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt silo, tapestry, and asters anchor the scene with tactile specificity. The needle "fed under the ground like a fishing line" and the burlap sack discovery use setting elements to constrain action. The final poppy-circle integrates place and closure, charging the empty patch. Spatial choreography (ladder climb, kneeling, moving to the poplar) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spire, frozen lake, and prism lamp anchor spatial and atmospheric specificity; the kingfisher's dive through the one unfrozen oval offers a vivid micro-setting detail that charges the narrator's insight ("reading fractures"). Sensory selection reflects professional focus (tiles, threads, beads, quill nib) and the environment subtly constrains choice—cold, isolation, the hum of trapped heat. The final image's reference to "ice" and "page waits like ice" ties setting to closure image, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate. Minor deduction: occupational detail (predictive modeling mechanics) remains abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ember alcove functions as micro-setting that constrains action: the shortwave radio's glow must be cloaked to preserve darkness for listening, and the burned-brick surroundings provide the ash/dust raw material for the protagonist's work. Sensory hierarchy reflects the copyist's trained attention: "barlines as narrow as spider threads," "needle-snow fell from the rafters," temperature as narrative information. The setting charges the final image—mist leaning against brick, ember light for sleeping—and the floor itself becomes an active surface where stories curl from burns into letters. Spatial choreography (sill, shelf, floor, walls) remains stable and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rocking chair constrains the final choice—Mother's decision to send it charges the gallery ending—and the skylight positions it for the climactic slowing. Ash-mixing mechanics (envelopes ground to pigment, scattered by breath/finger/brush) supply tactile process that defines the narrator's method. The gallery's "cathedral of lines" and the mask's fault-lines integrate spatial detail with theme. All key objects return with reweighted function at closure, and the somber exhale feels environmental rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sewer-and-library setting constrains choice throughout: the chalk marks guide tactics, the sluice gates supply the emergency, and the cog-in-ratchet solution depends on the built environment. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"algae," "silt humps," "salt writes its own index"—and filtered through the narrator's archaeological gaze. Spatial choreography is clear (tunnel → library layers → old dock → emergency wheel), and the final beat uses setting to charge the image (water kissing shins, pressure sighing outward). The micro-setting (the drowned library, the emergency wheel) does the work of larger world-building at this length, satisfying the 9+ test without sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library is anchored early and recurs with purpose ("the library exhaled dust and memory"), and micro-setting details (music stand, curtains, shelves) ground the action. The rosette functions as a recurring object that charges the final image and constrains one choice (Rafi catches and passes it). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Mara's pedagogical lens, though the elevated diction occasionally drifts from the POV's plausible lexicon during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse environment is vivid and particular—bent door, cracked panes, terracotta and glass-studded soil—and constrains the protagonist's actions (clearing bed, using the alignment light). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (tongue pricking, synaptic-plasticity metaphor), and the alignment functions as both timer and atmospheric pressure. The greenhouse's layered history (factory, garden, ruin, echo) charges the final image of rebuilding. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lightning tower functions as both macro-setting and constraint: the crown platform with capacitors and rods is the site where the queen tone can be reactivated, and the stair key controls access. The lacquer box (micro-setting object) charges the final third by enabling the restoration. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("stormfruit," "steel smelled faintly of bloom"), and the tower's verticality (desk below, crown above) structures the spatial climb that mirrors thematic ascent. The tower directly enables the closure action and appears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining method and charging all three encounters (placed between spoon/cup, on threshold, pressed to banister). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "damp rope and dill," "salt lane," tide slurring pebbles. The bay's golden hour and the body's tactile engagement (pressing, wrapping in gauze) shape each investigative choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through discrete house interiors, and the recurring shard evolves from tool to relationship-maker, directly enabling the closure insight.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater setting constrains multiple choices: eelgrass for threading, barnacles loosening, plankton storm risk, coral as tool. Micro-setting (the ampoule, the breach, benches for argument) charges the final image and shapes Oris's tactics throughout. Sensory detail is filtered through Oris's stone-body perception—silt as breath, anemones writing astonishment in bubbles—and remains purposeful rather than catalog-like. The setting's structural weakness (the cracked dome) becomes both method and metaphor, integrated into action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The staircase constrains every tactic: no landings force perpetual climbing, risers accept chalked lemmas, gaps between steps ("Opportunities") open and close politely. The chipped die and chalk function as micro-setting tools that enable the mathematical proof method and embody bias. The rupture—a silver crack dialing the corridor open—charges the final image; the narrator rubs chalk into the rail "until the grain sings like paper under charcoal," a tactile anchor that merges setting and ritual. Spatial choreography is clean (rail, risers, slots, crack), and the environment evolves causally (the staircase shudders when a lemma finds the hidden gear).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory specifics—saffron quiet, peppery tomato vines, smog-choked city—and recurs across beats (lemon trees, wilted basil, camping stove). The brush and its moon-tipped properties constrain Lina's method, and the greenhouse functions as both workspace and shrine, shaping the atmosphere of the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; the box, canvas, and stove are handled on the page. Minor: some description tilts toward catalog ("fern and netted cucumber") without immediate pressure use, but the setting charges the final image when "the greenhouse became a small republic."

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto setting pressures choices throughout: damp air threatens artifacts, the waterfall's "cold lace" tests endurance during the vow ceremony, and broken cisterns become ovens. The emerald lens functions as a micro-setting constraint, determining which objects survive. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("Moist air carried a scent of beeswax, damp limestone, and something like rosewater dread"), filtered through the curator's professional and emotional priorities. The final image of the waterfall bowing and "galleries breathe honeyed mist and memory" charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse and hunger stone constrain the protagonist's choices—descent to the chamber, interaction with the carved script, and the final decision are all spatially rooted. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "wind spoke under the steps like old lovers hiding under beds," "the chamber opened like a throat." The yoyo as micro-setting object charges the final image when its climbing motion seals the closure. Minor cap: while vivid, some metaphors ("glass eye cracked") lean decorative rather than constraining action in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vividly realized through selective, charged detail: "ferris skeleton," "plywood lips with rusted hinges," "lingering luminance of dead fluorescents." Sensory selection reflects the surreal, decay-soaked atmosphere and directly shapes action—the clasp unlocks the mouth, mirrors multiply the curse, the pedestal holds the dictionary. The final "slit of daylight disguised as a crack in painted night" charges the escape image. Environment and recurring objects (clasp, mirrors, dictionary) constrain multiple choices and the setting's oppressive glow thread through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating orchard constrains every choice—drift angle, wind resistance, hull integrity. Micro-setting elements (mallet, crates, rigging) are handled tactilely and shape tactics (tower of perforated crates redirects the gale). The blue hour and approaching storm create atmospheric urgency. Spatial choreography is clear: bow, stern, starboard, deck positions tracked. The orchard's circle and salvaged driftwood charge the final image of survival earned through improvisation within severe constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtle-shell city is concretely realized and constrains movement throughout: ridged spirals, barnacle constellations, the crack under the heel that yields the copper tag, the gulley of shell where the ledger is found. The reed whistle functions as micro-setting, shaping tactical choices (three notes chart wind truth, risk, and readiness). The watchers' spacing (five-six-five rhythm) acts as environmental pressure that forces interpretation. The final corridor of glare is a spatial constraint that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The railway station is vividly rendered—"long throat of shadow," ivy "whispering memory across brick," lockers "coughing soot"—and the micro-objects (ledger, charred slips, photograph, compass) anchor each beat. Sensory selection stays purposeful: the gilded L "bright as if some monk stepped out of time," the ivy seeds tapping "like shy reporters." The station constrains discovery (lockers, ticket hall, coal scar) and charges the closure when the narrator steps back into the street, where the clock "stops blinking, as if time were relieved." Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    The submerged pavilion is rendered with vivid, selective detail—"lace of arches veiled by green water," "glass cabinet asleep in silt"—and the setting constrains access (service door sealed for twenty years, water depth marked for tomorrow). The antique inkwell and tripod are handled on the page and the waterline itself is a recurring spatial anchor. The final image—"drawbridge sleep like a huge eyelid, and the city breathe through its missing teeth"—charges the setting with thematic weight. Slight deduction for some decorative catalog ("arrows, dates, a crown of rust") that does not alter a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The submerged library is rendered through selective, pressure-driven detail: barnacled arches, crabs in ducts, salt-weeping books, swollen map drawer. The setting constrains choice (blackout silences generators, enabling proof to emerge; drawer "bone-dry from neglect despite its swollen lips" supplies the stamp). The stamp's materiality (pearwood cracks, violet ghost ink, "soft bruise" weight) charges the final act of concealment. Spatial choreography is clean (stacks, ducts, drawer, margins, hiding place). The body and tool (stamp, wick, pressure of light through sailcloth) function as micro-setting that alters tactics at each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating isle, basilica ribs, spiral stairs, and tea shrubs supply vivid anchors; the paradox "descends while ascending" and "air becomes…cellars" filter setting through the protagonist's dislocation. Sensory detail is selective and voice-driven (sun rings tuned by clouds, kettles hiss, rainbows seed lungs with color). Spatial choreography stays coherent across moves. The lanterns and glass workspace constrain his method (lens must drink steam, cranes need vapor not paper), meeting the 9+ gate test: environment shapes the final choice and charges the closure image. Minor weakness: the broader tea-garden geography remains impressionistic, but at this length micro-setting suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating observatory, geode crystal, and circuit breakers constrain choices and charge the closure: the narrator presses shoulder to glass, tilts the observatory, and feels the basin's unused potential "lift us." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (moth-colored light, warm copper taste), and the spatial choreography is clean. The geode functions as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning at the end, which satisfies the 9+ gate; minor slip is that the valley below remains slightly abstract despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory supplies concrete resources (brass gears, slit of sky, carved constellations underfoot, targeting stones) that the pilot and pilgrim handle across multiple beats. Dusk as "brilliant dimness" charges the opening and closing images, modulating through "thinner" and "soft electricity." The matrix chip cradle soldered from a broken sextant demonstrates tool-use specificity, and the dome's rotation enables the climactic drone spiral. Spatial choreography remains legible: drones move through the slit, beams brush floor carvings, the spiral traces script across the opening night.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt terrace and Parliament of Wood shore are filtered through the narrator's guilt-soaked perception (sea "breathing like a tired archivist," tide leaves "minutes...curled into driftwood like letters addressed to no one"). The driftwood carvings constrain the search and the watch hand's placement charges the final revelation. Sensory detail is purposeful but not overwhelming. Minor gap: the transition between terrace and shore elides travel and intermediate spatial markers, creating a brief floating sensation mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The storm-worn parapet constrains every choice: slick stones force careful steps, narrow space creates proximity that defuses anger, mist limits visibility and creates acoustic intimacy. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, handled three times and charging the final image when it cools. Sensory detail is purposeful—"furrowed hush," "wet flags," "teeth of stone"—and filtered through a negotiator's attention to threat and footing. The environment's metaphoric work (neutral territory as "spine of stone") never becomes overt symbolism; it remains tactile and pressuring throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The coastal setting is specific and purposeful: fog, pilings, utility poles, eelgrass, and the boy's ruined pier all constrain navigation choices and charge the final image. The poles function as micro-setting, guiding tactics ("I followed the utility poles where they came closest to the dunes") and appearing in the closure beat ("The utility poles kept time"). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through nautical POV—"salt and old rope," "gulls sang like somebody practicing forgiveness off-key"—and the kayak deck with "small galaxies of mud" grounds the boy's presence. The environment's hum and the shallows' depth constrain the rescue attempt, elevating setting beyond postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid, specific, and charges the closure: "the lake would stain me kindly, in rings of useful ache." Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, dock, skiff, pillar of machines) and the glowing water constrains the journey. The setting moves from passive backdrop to active participant when "the lake brightened to a healed bruise color" after the confession. Micro-setting (the baseball, the skiff carved from street signs) also shapes the protagonist's tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight is vividly particular—"apples shining like moons within the moon"—and the conjuring via mortar, spices, and scent creates a micro-setting that constrains the ritual's method. The beasts with "velvet feet" and "throats like bowls" witness and participate, their spatial presence coherent across beats. The fortune slip "between two roots" becomes bark, anchoring the final promise in the physical world and charging the ending image with tactile permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glade constrains and charges: frost-petaled grasses, lantern insects marking seconds, cloudstair descent to the chamber—all pressure the ritual and enable the confession sequence. The saucer crack as micro-setting object recurs with reweighted function (prophecy → map → ritual instrument). Sensory selection is urgent and particular: "wind stacked the clouds into staircases," "tick-motes suspended like dust within a bell jar." The final image—clouds "dazzling like scales on a sleeping leviathan"—charges closure by reconfiguring the sky into a living witness.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The recycled spaceship, photograph albums, greenhouse, and the stone constrain multiple choices: navigation via tear-shimmer, the weight-sensitive lock mechanism, and the final decision to tend rather than conquer. Spatial choreography is clean (portholes, bulkhead scale, rail catch). The body-as-micro-setting (gravitational weight shifts) directly charges the closure when joy "loosens my boots from the floor" and the narrator must catch the rail. Minor gap: the comet anchorage and chamber interior receive less tactile grounding than earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    The black sand, basalt shelf, and volcano constrain Mara's placement choices and charge the final image (freed fireflies as "revised stars"). Sensory selection is purposeful: "gritty shore," "wet shone," "tremor beneath the speechless surf." The beach functions as micro-setting, with spatial choreography (skiff, lava path, ridge) remaining clear across the mosaic beats. Time and celestial movement (moon, Mars) modulate atmosphere and guide the evacuation's rhythm without overwhelming the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort, bronze quill holder, and workshop coals supply vivid anchor images. The quill holder constrains a middle choice (unlocking) and charges the ending ("rests warm in my palm"). Sensory selection is purposeful: "iron and rain," "soot and lullaby." Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from post to alcove to workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless season create a vivid, purposeful frame. The painted rocks and star dust function as micro-setting elements that constrain the rescue method. Spatial choreography during the ritual (rocks at cliff's lip, spiral of eels, door aperture) remains mostly clear. The setting charges the final image when rocks "still gleamed, holding the shore to a course it could believe." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the metaphysical lens, though some descriptions ("velvet gravity," "cold silver") trend decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory dome, darkroom timer, and storm are vividly rendered and sensory detail is selective. The timer and chart constrain one mid-scene action (pressing the button, tracing the constellation), satisfying the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography of the two characters within the dome remains vague—no clear positioning or movement tracking—and the storm functions primarily as backdrop rather than altering tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass atrium and brook are anchored early and used purposefully: light through panes enables the needle-card compass trick, and the sundial's primer-and-shadow work depends on the noon slice. The floor's geometry directly constrains the climactic choice, charging the final image when "the floor untied itself like a careful knot." Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the philosopher's perceptual priorities, though the setting occasionally serves as backdrop rather than active resistance in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted library is vividly anchored through selective, purposeful detail: "stacks are ribs," "books breathe like sleeping beasts," door rebuilt "from a refrigerator panel and a belt." These particulars constrain choice—tarps and outlaw glue, twine and clothespins—and the final image ("morning lifts a blue lid") charges the space with conceptual weight. Micro-setting (coffee tin, pennies, battery-powered lantern) all shape tactics and the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across the night's work; no tourist-catalog padding.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal arbor is richly particular—branches braided with foam, buoys, leaves as sails, roots dipping into mist—and the flickering compasses constrain the pianist's movements ("moving when the needles hummed, waiting when they twitched"). The station concourse anchors the opening and return, and the film projector serves as threshold. The arbor's tide and wind function as responsive environment, and the folded keyboard from "postcard ivory and umbrella ribs" charges the final performance. Spatial choreography across station/stairs/arbor/return remains coherent, and the arbor setting directly enables the encore that alters the train schedule.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridge as both archive and listener constrains the planting choice: "the right soil appears only through interpreted dreams" and "the ground shifts with stories." The hollow "shaped like a sleeping ear" and the hibiscus "behaving like archivists" charge the final image when "the tree lifted a paper-thin leaf like a listening hand." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—pollen on fingers, wet pages, soaked hair—and the setting evolves causally (stones "flexing like old knuckles"). Minor slips: "bruise of approaching rain" leans generic, and spatial transitions between ridge saddle and hollow could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The islet's salt grass, casuarina needles, black rock, and shallow cove supply concrete anchors and constrain the ritual walk. The compass on the flat black rock and lace drinking the cove's reflections charge the closure image directly. Sensory detail is filtered through the tutor's professional bias: driftwood "nested like unkempt bonsai," wire bruising. The breezy, rain-rinsed setting enables the final vow to "open the garden gates" and let sea instruction diffuse through miniatures, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly realized and continuously active: broken panes, dripping glass ribs, algae-slick tiles, and compost barrels all shape what she can do and how she thinks. Setting and tools (broom, plastic sheet, hand lens) constrain choices and directly charge the final images. The environment’s physical state mirrors and informs her intellectual stance without feeling like mere allegory. A minor further tightening could be to let one environmental constraint force a specific hard choice rather than only framing her contemplative method.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, kiln, frost, quarry, sand, and stars are all tightly woven into action and meaning, not just backdrop (“the canyon listens,” “Not a courtroom, but a kiln of listening”). Environmental specifics directly enable tactics (reading frost as text, using the canyon’s acoustics as testimony) and charge the final image. Professional perception shapes what’s noticed—the narrator reads stone like cooled crown glass—and weather (frost, dawn) materially affects choices. The piece just stops short of 9-band only because spatial choreography of the quarry sequence remains mostly conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The winterglass conservatory and its city are gorgeously particular and tightly integrated: frost as staves, glass ribs, heat-sensing panes, snow “as a metronome that never ticks.” The setting is not wallpaper; the impossibility of sound, the cold, and the glass infrastructure all constrain methods and make the light-notation system necessary. Environmental details evolve with action (first wrong heat pooling at the door, then corrected “choir of light”). The final image—carrying the tuning fork case through the glowing, quiet city—feels fully charged by the world that’s been built.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and constantly functional: the mortuary, harbor, service well, glass-domed city, and the “forgotten underwater city library” all inflect choices and tactics (service well descent, using vents and plankton light, shelves as addresses). Environmental details are strongly filtered through the undertaker’s sensibility (shelves as “old divers,” water “thin as breath”), tying atmosphere to character. The recurring objects and spaces—the broken lens, domes, vents, catalog—directly shape the ritual and final image. World rules are fantastical but internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The hill village, frost, and terra-cotta arbor are vividly rendered and consistently shape tactics (night runs, hidden tracks, the patrol’s search along the ridge). The arbor and bell function as a micro-setting that constrains choice and focuses risk, especially when the patrol stops directly beneath them. Environmental details like frost prints, carrot tops under snow, and “bruised clocks of infants and elders” feel both lived-in and purposeful. The final image—the polished bell catching their wobbled faces and the wind ringing thanks—beautifully recharges the object and place.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct, river, and flowering vines are rendered with highly specific, sensuous detail that’s always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“white blooms mapping the curve like shy comets”). The setting doesn’t just decorate; it behaves like a participant—the viaduct “hums,” flowers “lean in,” lamps “blossom,” and the river reads her “letters,” all of which charge the emotional stakes. Environmental evolution from twilight to lamplit night tracks her internal opening and shapes the final image of the bridge “breathing easier.” It’s slightly more atmospheric than constraining, but the integration is strong enough for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The living bridge garden is vivid, strange, and functionally integral: bridges literally grow in response to desire and carry the narrator into deeper confrontations, and later one becomes a submerged passage that forces the descent. Environmental details—root vaults, willow domes, ants “stitching sun to shade”—are filtered tightly through his designer’s eye and echo the thematic concern with structure and interweaving. World rules (bridges responding to footprints and hyperbolic geometry) remain consistent enough to be trusted while staying dreamlike. The final image of every bridge humming as the garden “blooms into quaking reverie” uses setting to charge closure rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned prize redemption center, the wall, and the dry outskirts are all concretely rendered and constantly used to shape action—piano bench as puzzle device, conveyor gears as weapon, plush as barricade, wall noise as cover. Environmental specificity never feels like a tour; it’s filtered through Mara’s mission and the story’s seed/famine stakes. The recurring objects (keys, chain, arrow, tickets) double as setting and tool, and they charge the final image of her walking out “pockets rusted with keys.” World rules around the wall’s fall and hidden vault remain consistent and legible without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: “sunken orchard greenhouse,” “shipwrecks,” and “ashen forge under aurora” are not postcard scenery but functional tools, calibration sources, and emotional mirrors. Environmental details consistently filter through the narrator’s sensibility (shells as memory, aurora as “bruised flags”), and the rules of this submerged world remain internally consistent. Crucially, the orchard, shipwrecks, and forge all recur at the end to charge the final image of “forging futures from what was missing,” so the environment directly underwrites closure. Nothing feels generic or swappable without breaking tone and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The emerald station, green tiles, moths, and disused track are rendered with high sensory specificity and consistent mood, and details are filtered through an eye trained on light and thresholds (“heart tuning itself,” “turnstile of sycamores”). Setting isn’t just decorative: the disused track, freight door, and old engineer’s room literally shape access and choice, while the light conditions (sunset to moonlight) govern the magic’s operation. The environment also charges the final image, with moths “stitching” their way and the altered bouquet left behind as a changed message. It’s richly atmospheric without losing spatial coherence, though one or two metaphors verge on ornamental rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned control room, melting ice, and improvised kiln are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Arlen’s perceptions and choices. Environmental facts—no grid power, dripping ice, dusty consoles—shape what he can do and how (fuel-based kiln, vessels left on the console, lamps as gathering space). Recurring objects like the bookmark and the ice patterns charge the atmosphere and connect directly to the ending image. The setting pressures him mostly on a symbolic and logistical level rather than forcing a sharp tactical constraint, which is the only thing holding this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “rusted library under stars” is vivid and integrated: groaning iron stacks, skylight, and roof physically shape the beats (cipher-reading, hidden box, rooftop meeting). The whispering shell and the cast function as micro-settings/tools that constrain choices and charge the final image. Atmosphere is consistent and purposeful, with the decayed, almost sacred space mirroring identity’s corrosion and re-forging. A tiny limit is that the external world beyond this enclave is only gestured toward, keeping the setting’s impact very focused rather than fully panoramic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ridge fort, storm, black sea, and single star are richly realized and constantly in play, not just backdrop: wind threatens the lantern, salt stings her hands, soaked stone receives the map, and the breaking path shapes his departure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (the “ambered hush,” “tired moons” of flaking gold, the sea as a “single muscle”) and always filtered through the oracle’s obsession with silence and intervals. Environmental constraints—storm, height, wet stone, the fragile star—charge both tactics and the final images. The setting’s evolution from storm-tossed to “calm weather” in her hand deeply underwrites the emotional and thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen courtyard, plinth, and ice violin are vividly rendered and purpose-driven—weather, temperature, and surfaces all interact with the robot’s work and the violin’s behavior. Environmental detail is tightly filtered through the janitor’s occupational and robotic perspective (broom bristles, mop cords, dustpan), which enriches both mood and theme. The courtyard constrains and shapes choices (routes, what can be cleaned, how the violin behaves, what happens when the generator fails) and decisively charges the final image. A slight further evolution of the physical environment at each loop could push this into even rarer territory.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is vivid and specific, with sensory texture that stays consistent and purposeful throughout. Rain, puddles, crystals, and tarps are not mere backdrop; they actively charge the final image (water promised on-screen echoing ripples across shoes, crystals “tuning” the city). World rules (silent agreements written in reflections, apologies condensing on benches) feel coherent within the piece’s logic. This environment meaningfully shapes tone and the nonverbal modes of communication that drive the story’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The garden maze, fountain, dials, bell, and marbles are not decorative; they continually constrain choice and charge meaning (e.g., the hedge-grown corridor forcing him to the accusing fountain). Environmental logic is consistent and highly selective, with each detail doing thematic and structural work. The final image (“the maze wore my age, and I wore its patience… the night entered gently”) is inseparable from the setting’s evolution. This is world-as-pressure and world-as-character at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: “a xenobiology research station arranged like a harp for the wind,” frost smoking off solar arrays, the ravine where compasses “ticked like trapped insects,” and the lever vault all feel concrete and lived-in. Environmental details consistently filter through Jae’s professional gaze (gantries, coils, probes) and shape what he can do, especially the magnetic nexus and the harsh cold. The station and ravine meaningfully constrain choices (the need for the lever, the twilight nexus window) and charge the final image of mantas leaving “on time again.” The world’s rules around magnetism, twilight, and sideways time remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The flooded opera house and lantern-lit darkness are not mere backdrop—they actively shape possibility: reflections become pathways, swollen doors resist, sandbags “puffed like lungs” signal a body-like architecture. The portrait, curtain fringe, and lantern all function as tools in the ghost’s system, not static props. Environmental rules stay consistent, and the final image of water settling and “in between spaces” becoming “more bridge” ties setting directly into the closure. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, always filtered through the musician’s trained, acoustically attuned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain weather station is richly specific and fully integrated: anemometer, antenna wires, barometer, storm, and ice-core scale all function as tools and pressure, not backdrop. Environmental forces shape action and meaning—stepping onto the edge platform in wind, holding paper in the lee, the station shivering during the storm—so the setting unmistakably constrains behavior. Micro-objects (the gentian under glass, soot line becoming a “continent”) charge the final image as a map/compass. A single concrete orienting detail about broader world/time (season/year/era) could further ground the otherwise luminous, slightly timeless atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned train tunnel and industrial remnants are vividly rendered—cold drip, iron taste, shy metronome—and always filtered through his practical, mechanical mind. The valve wheel and pipe function as a micro-setting that physically constrains and enables his test, then charge the final image when he reopens the line. Acoustics and darkness shape his options (listening instead of seeing, following hums and drops), and the environment’s oppressive hush directly supports the thematic frame of silence and swallowed truths. Setting is inseparable from both action and meaning here.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The overgrown library, river, catacombs, and obsidian cellar are lushly rendered and constantly in play, not mere backdrop—flooding, dripping stone, roots, mushrooms, and mildew all impose real conditions and affordances. Environment directly shapes tactics (burrowing behind astronomy, retreating to the obsidian refuge, traveling by origami pathways). Recurring objects-as-setting (the swan, the shelves, the silence as a textured “room”) charge the final image of fragile repair. The density of sensory detail borders on maximalist but remains purposeful, aligned with a caretaker whose attention is trained on slow, granular decay and regeneration.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: sage, stone, ravens, the valley shimmer, and especially the tree roots “like knuckles” and the hillside “chord” all echo the themes of listening and buried tension. Environmental changes (cooling air, silvered light, crickets starting, ravens going quiet) track the eclipse and directly shape mood and cadence. The courtyard and ridge are not generic backdrops; the final image of “hearing” the hillside chord and teaching Ada a lullaby closer to the ground depends on this particular place. The recurring use of sage ridge and the tree roots charges the final moments with grounded, sensory meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The reclaimed silo library and salt-erased prairie are vividly, economically realized, and almost every image is filtered through that environment’s materiality (“grain spine,” “corrugated skin,” “fallen compass needle”). Setting directly informs meaning: the displaced axis, the sideways map, and the silo’s physical lean all charge his decision to rearrange the shelves along the new pull and whisper to the axis. The environment constrains and shapes his acts (probing the flue, listening to bolts and mortar, the prairie “listening back”), and the final image—weather shifting in the heart of the silo, “almost a pulse”—is inseparable from this specific place. World rules (axis unseated, dreams ended) stay internally consistent and are conveyed through concrete spatial metaphors rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor and lighthouse are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—the lens, the tide, and the nocturnal docks all actively shape what’s possible. The lighthouse is not backdrop but mechanism: its beam and lens literally enact the plan, and the town’s geography (porches, kitchen walls) dictates how the revelation lands. Details like “the lens grumbles in its sleep” and “light scattered over the town in thin squares” feel both sensory and thematically charged. Setting consistently mirrors and enables the story’s concerns about visibility, distance, and shared knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chapel-as-dimensional-anchor is not just decorative; it frames the entire risk and reappears in the final image as the neighborhood steadies, making setting inseparable from stakes. Objects like the loop pedal and ultramarine palette operate as micro-settings/tools that channel and trap the whisper, and they spatially organize the ritual (altar, pews, palette-lake). Atmospheric details—“muffled clarity,” “drift” of looped absence, street straightening—maintain a coherent, numinous tone that feels architected rather than random. World rules (how the anchor and rhetoric work) are implied through action and stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and city sirens form a vivid, unified environment that shapes the piece’s logic of sound and restraint (e.g., wind “careful not to wake the lake,” ice answering with “whale-slow groans”). Setting isn’t postcard; it actively participates in the orchestral metaphor and charges the final seam-opening image and pane “blushing with thaw.” The nautilus shell functions as a micro-setting/tool anchoring time and sound, further binding environment to the character’s method and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is richly realized and integral: puddles as “altars,” neon guttering, cooled wires and wet stone all feel specific and lived-in. Environment constrains options via the puddle-path, arches, and middle span, and it actively shapes the climax (“middle arch, where the city fell away on both sides”). The recurring rain and puddles charge the final acts of smoothing the tablet and walking off. Setting is not backdrop but an active field for choice and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern, its basalt “swallowing sound into velvet,” and the hanging hides, smoke, salt, and “old rain” are richly specific and consistently filtered through a listening-focused POV. Setting is not decorative: the cave’s acoustics and hush literally shape what’s possible and charge the final bow and the road-as-vinyl image. The recurrent small object/setting fusion—the needle and drum within this chamber—carries forward into the world and inflects the last lines. A hair less ornament in some metaphors could tighten the atmosphere without losing its power.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtyard, dusk light, fountain, fig/sycamore, and quarantined riverfront form a vivid, coherently navigated space that the narrator tactically uses (bench for decoys, arch and fig for lateral escape). Details are strongly filtered through a weather-obsessed consciousness, which sharpens the atmosphere and avoids generic scene-setting. Environment and recurring objects (stones, fountain, bench) meaningfully constrain options and charge the final image of quiet, lamp-lit recording. World rules around the rogue quarantine are sketched with just enough specificity to support the pressure without bogging down.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse, its extinct plants, and the tools within (especially the UV lantern) are vividly rendered and integral to both action and theme. Environmental specifics—moisture on glass, named plants like amberhorn and dusk sage, rain outside—do emotional and structural work rather than sitting as décor. The setting constrains and enables choices: controlled air, locked cases, last surviving variant, and the archive of tears all shape how the scene unfolds. The final images (drizzle, lanterns in puddles, lingering greenhouse scent) powerfully charge the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto and road are vividly realized and tightly tied to the theme (terra-cotta layers, centuries of water and fingertips, floor as palimpsest, road as “old colleague”). Setting is filtered through the poet’s sensibility, with sensory specificity beyond the visual (air trembling with “violet arithmetic,” rope smelling of “rust and rain”). Environment and objects constrain choices: the grotto’s layered geology teaches his method of “uncovering layers,” and the rope anchored to stalagmite and mirror literally and symbolically shapes his movement and closure. World rules around the energy beings are consistent and evocative without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwreck ring are strikingly specific and suffuse every beat, from “rusted flanks like hedges keeping the wind polite” to the final footprints on the greenhouse steps. Environment and objects (greenhouse, wrecks, bowl, tide) are not mere backdrop; they contour meaning and charge the closing images of the hush loosening and the group walking away with “pockets full of beginnings.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, especially in the acoustic attention. This is publication-ready atmospheric work with setting actively shaping tone and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is vivid, multisensory, and integral to tone—“resin breath,” fossils, and static all filter through the narrator’s tradecraft and bias. Setting details are functional, not touristic: the static actively mediates their emotional “reading,” and the amber enclosure underpins the sense of suspended, honeyed time. The final return to fossils and amber as she departs recharges the themes of preservation versus motion. It does not strongly constrain physical choices, but it meaningfully charges the emotional and conceptual stakes.

    The harbor and “breezy library under stars” are vividly rendered and recur as functional spaces—open roof for children’s rehearsals, harbor as community funnel after the symphony, lamps and gulls mirroring attention and gossip. Environmental motifs (tide, music, lamps, pilings) are not mere décor; they echo the ledger’s purpose of rhythmic, returning care and listening. The space shapes who appears and when—dockworkers, ushers, stevedores drifting in during late hours—and charges the final promise that “kindness circles back like returning tide.” Setting is lush but still purposeful, with very little white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are not postcard backdrops; they constantly shape perception, ritual, and action, from the panes catching “void-sun” to the mineral sigh of the crater and the obsidian seam that hides the tag. The final image—people leaning under the reed-and-obsidian arbor as the orchard goes dusk-blue and the crater sings—depends entirely on this specific environment to carry its charge. World rules feel consistent in their dream-logic, and details are filtered through the sculptor’s tactile, craft-centered eye. Setting constrains and enables choices (shards to salvage, fruit-pillars to climb, panes to chalk), satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop canal system and the breathing giant are not mere backdrop; they are the mechanism by which echoes are gestated and located, and the cadence of water literally governs where and how the protagonist can act. Specifics like “spine-ladders,” “walkway shivered with wind,” and rails, gutters, and lichens create a coherent spatial logic that the pendant’s use depends on. The environment constrains choices (she must find a specific disruption in the hush/rush pattern) and charges the final image of the inked rail and clouds as a mapped habitat for future “returners.” World rules (tides with each breath, storm-arrow routes) are consistent and discovered through goal-directed movement.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and distinctive—“mineral blossoms,” “fruit glistening like cooled tears,” dripping stalactites ticking time—and consistently filtered through his grief-and-math lens. Setting is not mere backdrop: stalactites serve as both temporal metronome and anchor for the eye-rope, and the orchard’s hush and sweetness mirror and pressure his internal arithmetic. The final image of him stepping out while the stalactites tick and the eyes keep watch shows the environment charging the closure. It stops just short of 9+ because physical constraints don’t significantly limit his options; they mainly shape mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The library, vents, pipe chases, boiler riser, and Rare Folios Room are sensuously rendered and always filtered through his lived familiarity. Setting actively constrains tactics—he moves through ducts, caches under atlas cases, and uses old pipes as mnemonic and spiritual conduits. The outage and dawn light (“sapphire hush”) evolve the environment in step with the emotional arc, not as static backdrop. The final image—arrow by the grate, panel closing—depends on this deeply inhabited micro-architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is rich and purposeful: storm season, runoff, tin roofs, the mossy trellis, and the nursery aisles all interact with her choices and metaphors. Weather is not decorative; it prunes the town’s “certainties,” ruins arrangements, drives worried customers, and shapes plant behavior. The mossy trellis and linden leaf return at closure to charge the final vow image, making environment and object inseparable from theme. A touch more concrete spatial choreography inside the nursery during customer scenes could take this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal island, tides, rain trails, church bones, lighthouse, and post–water-war infrastructure form a coherent, sensorially rich environment that actively shapes choices (they time actions with the tide, follow rain trails as paths, descend to the seam). The island’s quasi-sentience and the “unearthed convergence” are seamlessly embedded in setting details like foxfire-lit strata and puddles mirroring faces. Weather and terrain are not postcard backdrops; they constrain movement and enable the pact and apparition. The final images of rain trails carrying the pact and meaning “threshed” from experience are deeply charged by the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The musical crystal cave is richly and specifically rendered—stalactites carrying ancient notes, “crystal ribs” ringing with breath, a “bell made of silence”—and these details are tightly integrated with action and stakes. The environment actively shapes what is possible (music determining paths, unseen forces moving the pearl, bright darkness enabling listening as navigation). The cave and pearl together constrain choice and charge the final image of the cloak-like dusk. A slight density of metaphor edges toward luxuriant, but clarity and utility of setting remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor setting is vivid and lived-in—quay stones, wet glass, gulls, mist, masts as staff lines—and it actively shapes choices (the window as instrument, passersby responding to an invisible band, the weathered harbor as patient/student). Environmental details are always filtered through the archivist’s profession and task, never feeling like neutral postcard description. The recurring “ivory harbor after rain” image bookends the piece and decisively charges the final line, where the harbor itself becomes a ledger. It narrowly misses a higher score only because the physical environment constrains tactics more atmospherically than through hard, on-page obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vivid, integrated, and pressure-bearing: mist, cobblestones, arrows in cracked pavement, the scarred depot, and the breathing fortress all shape what the protagonist can perceive and choose. Recurring elements like stars, water, and mist evolve from atmosphere into active participants in the closure image (stars bending lower, fortress sealed, lantern-words). The environment reliably mirrors and channels the internal arc without feeling like blunt allegory. Object-as-setting (maps, punch) is woven seamlessly into the physical spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, sea, and migrating whales are vividly rendered and threaded through action rather than as backdrop, from the “stone rib cage” opening to the whales turning north at dawn. The magic square tile and Lio’s shell operate as micro-settings/objects that constrain behavior and ritual (placing, aligning, listening), and the “room” that opens feels like an architectural crystallization of the story’s aim. Environmental details—cold front, gulls like torn letters, tower chiming with salt—echo internal stakes without feeling purely decorative. The setting is both memorable and functionally tied to the final image of an open tower tending an “unheard symphony.”

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—auroral shelf, magnetized sky, prismatic escondite, coils and obsidian mirrors all feel lived-in and coherent. Environment is not just backdrop: the solar storm’s properties, the prisms, and the escondite’s architecture literally enable and shape the experiment and corridor. World rules, though surreal, stay internally consistent and are revealed through action rather than exposition. The final image of aurora and hushed thunder clearly charged by prior environmental detail gives the piece strong atmospheric closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The funeral home prep room is intensely particular—“citrus, ethanol, and deathly vitality,” pumps and vents as a “calendar without numbers”—and every environmental detail serves tactic or mood. The setting directly shapes the plan (steel table, cart, service elevator, reset alarm, security camera) rather than feeling decorative. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting object whose properties (age, scars, blue ink) charge the final image and the narrator’s ethical calculations. Spatial and procedural choreography remain clear despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the bonsai labyrinth, the basin, the fluorescent lamp, and the frozen halo all shape what he can do and how he does it. Environmental changes (fog pressing wires, basin freezing, spring weakening the lamp) tangibly alter his tactics and charge the images. The mountaintop archive versus the silent town below provides a spatial metaphor that never slips into flat allegory. The final image of lamps answering one another is inseparable from the specific, patiently built setting.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The port and container labyrinth are exquisitely integrated into perception, metaphor, and action: his ability to move unseen, sleep in stacks, and treat them as a “memory palace” all arise from setting. Recurring details (oily constellations, cranes, clipboards, refrigerated vents) feel lived-in and not touristic. Crucially, the final act—placing the label on the crate in the same stacked world that erased and hides histories—charges the closing image with environmental logic and constraint. The sense of physical and bureaucratic geography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, cliff, dome, gulls, tide, and waves are richly particular and consistently filtered through the myth buster’s sensibility (“gulls flurried up like unfinished thoughts,” “dome becomes a book spine”). The setting actively inflects events—the dome’s acoustics, the cliff and sea as a ticking tide, the lighthouse ribs metaphor for how vibrations travel. Recurring objects (shell, cello) function as micro-setting and strongly charge the final images (the shell blushing, observatory humming). The environment doesn’t quite coerce a specific tactical choice at the climax, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    The raft-city carnival is extraordinarily textured—“tents breathed like lungs,” fences as “diplomatic gray,” gulls arguing with kites—yet all in service of how movement and commerce work. Environment actively constrains choices: floating rafts can be realigned, graffiti routes bodies around fences, and the VIP zone’s forced collision with the fish market is the key strategic move. The foundation stone chip and ballast console charge the final steering image, making setting inseparable from plot and theme. This is worldbuilding doing maximum work with minimal waste.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting work is exceptional: the “silver bowl” crater, radio dishes below, and seam of “ancient snow” hosting glacier moths all feel specific, lived-in, and crucial to what’s possible. World rules (solar wind killing electronics, satellite confetti, impact scars) are learned through action and image rather than dump, and the summit’s isolation necessitates the chemical timing method. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image—crater as cathedral, dawn as hush—meeting the 9+ gate. Details are always filtered through the inspector’s professional and personal gaze, keeping atmosphere inseparable from character.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally rich and integrated: mist, harbor, depot, shop, rails, and water bowls are all active constraints or tools, not backdrop. Fog and wet metal directly necessitate the hummingbird and bowl system, and environmental details evolve with the action (thickening fog, rain off the eave). The depot and ship are personified without feeling precious, and the final image of the depot “smiling” through settled wheels is thematically charged. There’s almost a surfeit of atmospheric description, but it remains purposeful rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the rusted outpost, frozen lake, culvert, and under-hill valves all shape what is possible and how the narrator proceeds. Weather and material conditions (frost, ice that “was already cracking me back,” humming girders) actively constrain action and lend stakes. Recurring objects-as-setting (stove, window glass, lamp) evolve and charge the final images (return to warmth, thinning condensation, lake resuming its “pretending”). The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the physical danger of the environment is felt more atmospherically than as a sharp, consequential threat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exquisitely rendered and purpose-driven: the archway, cobblestones, cistern, church bell, and shuttered shops aren’t postcard details but acoustic partners in the tuning. Environmental specifics (stone memory, rusted cistern breath, hairline crack in the bronze) actively shape method and meaning. The archway’s shift from “gate to absence” to “a throat clearing,” and the final image of the sparrow and the town answering with feet, clearly charge the closing beat. The world feels coherent and physically/tactilely lived in despite its lyric stylization.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    The underwater environment is vividly specific and constantly functional: pressure, darkness, silt, the trench-fissure geometry, and the temple’s acoustics all shape what is possible. The temple is not mere backdrop; its “gathered hush” focuses sound, the narrow corridor and scraping stone teeth create physical jeopardy, and the nave’s acoustic properties directly enable the rescue tactic. Details are filtered through a diver’s sensibility (“cathedral of pressure and blue,” gauges, line drag), and the setting evolves as she moves deeper, then departs. The recurring micro-setting of the vial on her body and chest charges the final image, binding environment, tool, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse prison and reef are vividly drawn and deeply integrated: warm copper stairs, greened locks, keyhole porthole, speaking tubes, and the under-stair drain all shape movement, perception, and options. Environmental features meaningfully constrain choices—he must enter via the worn narrow door, ascend to the lantern for hush, and descend to the drain where the “answers” lie—making the setting inseparable from plot. Sensory detail (light, warmth, brine, sound) is precise and filtered through his obsession with hush, keeping description purposeful rather than touristic. The world’s slightly uncanny rules (iron tilting compasses, lighthouse “sustaining impossibilities”) remain consistent enough to support the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinary in specificity and integration: the “alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night,” frost-breath, glass panes, graft scars, and sap all do real emotional and conceptual work. The environment directly shapes the story’s logic—the refusal of dawn defines the predicament, and the bead in the doorway plus the orchard “warming its own dark” charge the final image with cost and consolation. Details are consistently filtered through the keeper’s vocational lens (grafts, pruning strokes, night harvest), which keeps the strangeness grounded. Any more elaboration on external world rules might dilute the tight symbolic power this confined setting already has.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exquisitely specific and always functional: harbor “thinned to ribs,” red canyon walls that “breathe rust and thyme,” nets “like gray rain” and flood lines tattooed on the labyrinth’s teeth. Environmental constraints matter—the tide pools’ timing, the labyrinth’s carved path, the tether on the mooring spire—and the canyon is navigated tactically via chalk maps and basins of “mirror water.” Recurring objects (plate, tether, nets) act as micro-settings that shape choices and charge the final images (plate left at altar, tether strung along the pier). The atmosphere of salt, rust, and old vows is consistent and supports both the ritual and the thematic movement from ruin to reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard, sundial, stele, and storm-opened tomb are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, never feeling like tourist catalog details. Environment constrains and enables choices—the excavation trench and roots dictate discovery, the missing gnomon creates the central problem, and the rebuilt sundial and orchard directly charge the final image. Small physical specifics (rib of pomegranate wood, dew on the sundial base) are precise and thematically loaded without overplaying symbolism. The piece balances atmosphere and function so well that almost every setting element is doing double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “golden arcade at dawn,” the chalked floor, vans, pigeons, and machine violin are all sharply rendered and firmly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environment repeatedly shapes tactics and meaning: chalk is chosen because cameras ignore the ground; the violin’s vibration through the ebony clipboard triggers the key name; the mail slot, arches, and mosaic light charge the final image. The setting feels both concrete and slightly futuristic without exposition, and the arcade’s remembered chalk trail reframes the place as a palimpsest of identities. This environment is inseparable from how the story’s central acts occur and conclude.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory is richly and specifically rendered—“domes sighed,” “brass rails knew our palms,” dust mapping constellations—and the eternal candle, glass glove, and maple leaves are all integrated into action, not just backdrop. Setting details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility as an embroiderer of rumors and charts, giving the world a distinctive texture. The environment subtly shapes the magic (telescopes as cages for “trapped birds,” dust rehearsing the coup) and charges the final image with the candle watching at the window. It seldom constrains physical choices, but as an atmospheric and conceptual setting, it is unusually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mangrove labyrinth, blackwater, cathedral shard, and condensation-letters are not backdrop; they’re the operative machinery of the story’s magic and reflection. The shard’s edge wounding and healing, the water lifting a “slick page,” and the lantern glass fogging all directly condition what the narrator can learn and how. The final sense that “the path feels like a listening” recharges the entire environment as an embodied metaphor for the new stance. Atmosphere and specificity are lush yet purposeful, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: hospital atrium, mist, vents “breathing like distant surf,” and rain on the ceiling all mirror and modulate the emotional weather. The brain coral functions as a micro-setting object, physically handled whenever speech falters and returning in the final image beside the boy, charging the closure. Environmental details (kestrels as commas, fog like a treaty) are not mere decoration; they inflect theme and mood without breaking plausibility. A slight bias toward lyric flourish over concrete spatial constraint is the only thing keeping this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard district and its fog are extraordinarily vivid and integrated: fog as “old theater curtains,” citrus ghosts, bricked wells, and stump-that-remembered-shade all shape how she works with light and film. The environment constrains tactics (fog becomes screen; wells act as audience and nodes in the knowledge network) and charges the final image of “a ribbon in the fog.” This is elite-level setting work, just shy of perfect because the physical constraints never pinch her options quite as hard as they might.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden is richly and precisely rendered (parabolic walls, “listening shells,” echoes wearing “someone else’s coat”) and never feels like wallpaper. Its acoustic geometry directly enables her restoration tactics and the mural’s voice, so the environment genuinely constrains and empowers choice. The hobo nickel functions as a micro-setting tool, charging the final image when she listens for “the tiny star to ring.” The only limit is that non-acoustic environmental pressures (weather, physical constraints) stay largely aesthetic rather than further tightening choices.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The world and greenhouse are rendered with specific, imaginative details (audit towers that “taste cognition,” bees muddling antennae, hornworms like a “green river”), and the entomological setting directly enables tactics (insects as carriers, Kline’s permits, the greenhouse as venue). Environment consistently constrains and empowers action, not just mood. The recurring micro-objects (gourd seed, beans, marigolds) culminate in the threshold “ENTER” and citywide gardens, strongly charging the final image. A hair more spatial choreography at the climax (exact crowd/drone positions) could sharpen physical stakes, but atmosphere and functional specificity are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gargantuan shell, reefs, nacre, and tidal interior are vivid, sensorially textured, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s psyche. Environment isn’t backdrop: the shell speaks, opens on the fifth cycle, glows with “photosynthesis…of sorrows,” extrudes gardens, and literally rocks them, so space shapes what is possible. Recurring objects (shell, postcard, reefs) charge the final images and carry thematic weight without feeling like simple allegory. The world’s dream-logic remains internally stable and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The opal library above the clouds, balloon tethers, lightning-glass cliff, and galleries of weathered acoustics are not just decorative; they shape what can happen (e.g., balcony offerings drifting down to the world, objects rescued from “storms of forgetting”). Setting is filtered through the caretaker’s sensibility, maintaining a unified, slightly melancholy wonder. Environmental details recur and evolve (balloon anchors checked; balcony revisited) and charge the final image of her whispering her own name into that vertiginous space. The fantastical rules feel internally consistent and specific rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.1)
    The extinct language archive is vivid, specific, and constantly active (“Every shelf has a throat; you learn to pitch the room as an instrument”). Environmental details are filtered through the linguist’s sensibility, so dust, shelves, Breviary, and stele all read as linguistic tools rather than generic props. The setting constrains tactics (she must use the archive’s acoustics and listening spots to deliver the apology) and directly participates in the turn when the room answers Lio’s reading. The final outside/dawn image is charged by contrast with the archive’s earlier hush, giving the environment clear influence on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The amphitheater in a breathing dormant volcano is vividly realized and integral: its “breath,” terraces, pumice, and internal aquifers all shape possibility and mood. Setting actively constrains the solution—“the true compromise line the mountain would accept” arises from the mountain’s geometry and temperament—and charges the final image of tuning oneself to its breathing. Tools and environment (chain, valves, hidden sluice) are fully embedded rather than postcarded. This is a major strength, narrowly shy of perfect only because the physical danger of the volcano’s power remains mostly tonal rather than structurally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The vintage bookshop attic is vivid and functionally crucial: its dust, skylight, beams, boxes, and smell of “glue and cedar” all actively shape tactics and risk. Environmental details evolve with events (boxes swallowing spines, skylight unlatching, gusts) and force concrete actions like climbing the beam to set the latch and reading dust corridors for flight paths. The meteorite chip and scale operate as micro-setting elements that constrain decisions at closure. The final image returns to “mapping the dust” under the single skylight, charging the setting with thematic weight as both workplace and site of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drifting prism terrace, floodplain, shadow-orchard, and corn mazes are richly particular and always filtered through the narrator’s purpose. Setting is not decorative: the bench grain, glass seam, and terrace’s height literally determine what can be seen and whether reunion is possible. The environment charges the final image—walking the terrace, not the field—so the world’s rules and geography directly shape the resolution. The surreal physics (terrace sailing, shadows as mazes) are consistent within the story’s own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater research city is rendered with vivid, idiosyncratic detail (“data garden, where glass fronds swayed like thought”; “shadowseam wonder”), and filtered through the astrologer’s topography-obsessed gaze. Environmental elements (pressure, currents, vaults, tanks, fish, glass) are not just postcards; they participate in the logic of access, memory, and breathing. The burnt feather and dome space recur as charged micro-settings that affect how the characters interact with the city’s systems and with each other at closure. A slight reason it doesn’t break higher is that the physical danger of the environment stays mostly atmospheric, not fully constraining tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    The iridescent geode-cave is vivid, specific, and constantly active in the narration: light, crater glass, breathing cave, pool, and humming faults all shape the investigation. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain choices (listening through glass, reading seeds in wind, consulting the pool) and heavily charge the final images (geode humming, crater glass keeping the lesson). Sensory detail is rich yet filtered through the protagonist’s occupational mindset, avoiding mere postcard description. The setting’s logic remains consistent and integral to both discovery and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tidal arcade, moonlight, puddles, and ribbed arches are not just decorative; they actively structure the tricks (coin circles, reflections, bishop balancing on water) and charge the imagery of grief and luck. The environment constrains choices and possibilities—the act only “works” because of tide, puddles, and the arcade’s architecture. The recurring water and star field culminate in the final image of “arranging what they leave,” directly tying setting to closure. Sensory detail is rich, selective, and firmly filtered through the performer’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight garden, basin, shore, and celestial imagery are vivid and tightly integrated with the narrator’s tidal consciousness. The setting isn’t just backdrop: the garden’s lack of registries and its “listening” functionally frame this as a clandestine, sacred act; the basin’s moon and sea references charge the stakes of memory and payment. Sensory detail is rich and selective, though almost wholly in visual/abstract registers. The environment meaningfully reappears at the end (“keep the garden listening”), charging the final image rather than feeling postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, pond, bait shack, cranes, and dawn mist are all sharply rendered and tightly filtered through a working local’s eye; details like “sunlight smells like tar and yeast” root atmosphere in tactility. Environment actively shapes choices: the pond enables his “consultation,” the ferry ramp’s memory steers design, and the bay’s mist and light dynamics dictate the atrium’s concept. The final promised image of the atrium receiving morning only works because the setting has been so charged. A touch less catalogic lyricism in places could further sharpen how physical constraints (weather, rust, logistics) press tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    The moonlit ridge, town below, wind, and stone seat are all specific and lived-in, and the environment continually interacts with action (the ridge as meeting point, stone as their shared “table,” warm stone used to set the paper’s bend). The recurring micro-setting of the box and his burned hands functions as object-as-setting that constraints what can be done and how. Atmosphere (ash, pine, meteors, lights that “would not open again”) deepens the emotional stakes rather than decorating them. The final image of him calibrating his steps to the heavens is charged by all this environmental groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tide-polished grotto is vivid, tactile, and deeply integrated: the sea’s “cathedral calm,” the skylit clefts, and the tide’s finger-width climbs all participate in the ritual. Environment and tool-as-setting (the altitude gauge) actively constrain and communicate—the tide “reading” patterns, the gauge registering neighboring worlds’ pressure. The final image of stepping out into a changed-feeling village path and cradling the gauge is charged by all the prior environmental work. Setting never feels postcard; it is the apparatus and conduit of the story’s magic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drowned district, ivy-veiled passage, tidal cycles, and the house’s physical tilt create an immersive, coherent world filtered through the cartographer’s acoustic priorities. Setting is not backdrop: ivy “weather reports,” water as “landlord,” and the house lifting on “stilts of memory” all constrain the possible lives here and charge the final image. Objects like the negative, baseboard, and coals are tactile tools the narrator uses in scene, not mere symbols. The environment’s rules (climate-shifted ruins, recurrent tides) stay consistent and meaningfully shape both method and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the “echoing terrace in spring,” prism parapet, and water-strand atelier are not just atmospheric but echo and shape the magic’s logic (refraction, dripping as tempo, mirrors as thresholds). Environmental details like the hush before bells and “hanging strands of water” are filtered tightly through the narrator’s sensibility. The terrace and rain recur at the end with reweighted meaning (“like a reef remembering sunlight”), charging the final image and mirroring the narrator’s new stance. The environment constantly interacts with action—breath syncing to drips, colors as guides—so it feels indispensable rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace, cracked stones, herbs, banners, coastal wind, and the bowl of casings create a vivid, coherent space that feels ritualistically charged and lived-in. Setting is not decorative: the terrace’s history, visibility to children, and open exposure to sky and sea all shape the tone and the kind of negotiations possible (public, patient, rooted in memory rather than secrecy). The recurring terrace and bowl images strongly charge the final promise of annual return and portable memory. Weather/season (“midsummer,” celestial dance) is more atmospheric than constraining but consistently supports the themes of patience and slow orbital change.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The salt flat, cracks, and subterranean chamber are exquisitely specific and fully integrated—the environment is not backdrop but instrument (map, resonance medium, wound). World rules of the “manufactured drought” and emptied chamber stay consistent and are learned through his use of tools (tuning fork, speakers, fishing-line map) rather than exposition. Setting details like salt preserving fingerprints and the sting in his palm at the end directly charge the final image and his complicity. Sensory texture is rich yet purposeful, with little waste.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: silver courtyard, snow, prism chapel, and underground looms all feel tactile and specific, with images like “ears carved into columns” doing double duty as atmosphere and surveillance. Environment meaningfully shapes options—the snow-muted, watchful courtyard and the time-bound window, the starless tunnels and their memory of rivers. The recurring courtyard/prism under snow charges the final image, where the city’s altered breath is spatially and sensorially grounded. A small limitation is that weather and architecture pressure mood more than concrete tactics, but what’s here is elite-level atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The decommissioned radar dome, cables, moths, “meteor hush,” and ribs of scaffolding are vivid and integrated into action and theme. The acoustics and curvature justify the emphasis on listening and silence, and the ribs metaphorically echo the ethical “body” being measured for healing. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it clearly charges the final image of a quiet, open performance. Details feel chosen rather than touristic, with the dome’s strangeness aligning with the experimental, reflective work being attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto above the clouds is vividly rendered and integral: water’s “interrupted cadence” sets the central metaphor, moss and stone host the signals, and the cave-mouth environment reads the gestures. The setting constrains choices (quiet, remoteness, natural materials) and explicitly “answers” with gifts (water on lip, cooled gust, rested knees, clarity). The final image—lying on moss, green light overhead, waiting for history’s answer—relies on this environment both visually and thematically. It falls just shy of the very top band because the physical constraints never sharply force a difficult trade-off; they support more than they pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, furnace, and rope are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action—the auroral light must be aimed, the rope operates shutters and mechanisms, the cold and heat define the working conditions. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful (“my breath made brief roses across the face of the furnace”). Environment directly constrains tactics: controlling braids to modulate light and sound is the story’s core method. The setting also charges the final image of snow outside and bells inside, giving strong atmosphere that supports theme without feeling like mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and approaching storm are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“the bunker becomes a lung again, inhaling me, exhaling maps”). Environment is not postcard; it constrains behavior (retreat to bunker, opening the seal when the barometer drops, moving under the forest along a corridor). Recurring objects (bunker as lung, archive, wafer seal, storm) actively charge the final image of stepping into the weather. World rules feel stable within the poetic frame, with the setting integral to both premise and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as an observatory” is richly realized: bronze pins, wires marking risings, cisterns, bitumen, magic squares in stone. Setting is consistently filtered through a working astronomer’s priorities, and environmental constraints (waiting for Saturn, using the cistern, fixed pins and wires) directly shape tactics. The observatory-palace and its devices charge the final image of wires “singing sometimes when a planet rounded the south corner,” tying world to closure. A few lush descriptive moves are more atmospheric than pressured, but they rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The soundless, reality-shifting sanctuary and the mute music box are vivid and tightly integrated; the inability to speak (writing on a slate) and the hushed atmosphere materially shape tactics at the end. Spatial and metaphysical rules (“Shifting grace is the rule here”) remain consistent as corridors become childhood halls and factories without disorienting the reader. The environment clearly mirrors and channels internal states without slipping into blunt allegory. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that directly supports the story’s conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard, frost, and fog are richly drawn and strongly functional: rows of skeletal apples become the corridor walls; fog is the medium for both dream and breathing; frostlight is a necessary condition for the work. The environment shapes tactics (needing frostlight, using the rows, dealing with the dream shredding fences) rather than serving as decorative backdrop. Objects-as-setting—the mirrors and broken sextant—are fully integrated into the spatial logic of the scene. Minor risk of over-lushness is outweighed by how thoroughly setting constrains and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral-orchard is vividly and economically rendered—branches as ribs, fruit burdened by unspent vows—and its physical logic shapes action (climbing rafters, bell rope, pruning). Setting and tools directly constrain tactics and imagery at the climax: the bell, rafters, and ribbon fusion is inseparable from how the ritual works and how the final image feels. Environmental changes (leaves loosening, pews remembering themselves) track the story’s emotional turn. The worldbuilding around deciduous vows and institutional neglect is suggestive without bogging down in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard and lonely asteroid are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the curator’s sensibility (“bathrooms…like astronauts do with orbiting epiphanies”). Setting is not postcard-decorative; the map, forbidden grove, heartbeat fruits, and root-tucked pods all constrain and channel his options, and the tree’s rule plus the cameo-on-bark moment are inseparable from this environment. The final image of him walking back toward the silver pod while the grove closes “like covers” tightly binds space, vocation, and theme. A bit more tactile or sensory menace from the environment at the moment of potential rewriting could heighten the embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain-spanning bookstore is richly particular and fully integrated: its shafts of daylight, spiraling floors, and rearranging shelves shape navigation, tactics, and mood. The environment is never a postcard; it actively cooperates and resists (rearranging after the traveler arrives, needing to “renegotiate with the geometry,” suspending an apprentice between indexes). The final image with seeds rooting into the floorboards bridges world and theme beautifully, charging the setting with ongoing consequence. At times the density of imagery approaches lushness-for-its-own-sake, but it still mostly tracks cleanly with the narrator’s priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned carnival ship in fog is not decorative; its rides and booths actively route the protagonist (carousel horses pointing to the hatch, the shifting museum of prizes) and the bay’s undockable hush frames the story’s central trap. Environmental and object details evolve in response to choices, like the ferris wheel as a compass and the foggy bay opening into the bruise-colored circle. The final image—ship swinging in fog, garden unreachable, card over the heart—depends entirely on this specific setting logic. The world’s surreal rules remain internally consistent and charged with mood and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room, rope, bells, and the smell of vellum create a vivid, functionally integrated micro-setting. Environment directly shapes tactics: the ceremonial rope is the tool for accessing and regulating the impossible door, and the mechanism room’s liminal machinery mirrors and enables the temporal/ontological play. Details are selective and POV-shaped, with institutional history embedded in objects rather than exposition. A touch more sensory grounding beyond the visual and tactile could push this toward absolute top-tier, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harmonic caves, ice, and corridors are superbly particular and fully filtered through the narrator’s professional and sensory bias; every environmental detail feels in use rather than decorative. The echo chamber stone functions as a tool-as-setting that constrains action and directly shapes the final image. World rules (sound as weather, energy beings as resonance) stay consistent and are learned through action. The only limiter is that external physical constraints never corner the character as harshly as they might, so the environment’s pressure, while elegant, remains mostly atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is unusually vivid and integrated: the glass humming pavilion, fused silica ribs, shard of hush, and ruined saltlands all feel tactile and idiosyncratic, filtered through the custodian’s technical reverence. Environmental features constrain and enable choices—the acoustics, star etchings, broken prism, and the pavilion’s “diary” function are all essential to tactics and closure. The world rules (retrocognition, sound-mineral, post-collapse skyways) are learned through use rather than exposition, keeping immersion high. I’m holding just under 9 because while the environment strongly shapes options, we rarely see practical constraints (e.g., weather, structural danger, scarcity) pinch tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: the stormlit observatory, hardened fog, crystal forecourt, and monolith shadows are not just decorative but provide the mechanisms of memory-work and the protagonist’s crisis. The environment directly shapes options (memories must be translated via weathered plinths, crystal, and shadow) and decisively charges the final image (shadow covering her shoes, the observatory’s hum dimming). Sensory specificity is high and always filtered through the archivist’s professional and emotional lens. Minor risk of over-lushness is outweighed by how consistently the world constrains and reflects the central choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blooming fortress, vines, mosaic, cistern, ivy, and ash-drinking flowers create an unusually rich, coherent environment that is always doing work. Setting directly shapes tactics—wind pools and funnels, ivy parting the wind, cubby hidden behind vine, ash nourishing blooms—and heavily charges the final image. Detail is selective and strongly POV-filtered through a fireworks designer’s sensibility. The only restraint on a higher score is that environmental constraint, while present, does not force a painful trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto, tidepools, and sea-glass lantern light are not mere backdrop; they are the thinking apparatus of the narrator and charge the final image (“the grotto kept our resolution”). Environmental and object details (drips as metronome, ankle-level ripple, starfall in tidepools) are consistently filtered through her marine attention and directly shape how she frames the choice. The jade cicada functions as a micro-setting/tool, constraining the decision by embodying molting and seam-tracing. Setting and object together are indispensable to the story’s logic and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exquisite and functional: gravity inversion, streets growing roofs, and the xenial trellis all feel coherent and are repeatedly used in action, not just as backdrop. Environmental rules (inversion’s one-hour window, trellis’s fear-responsive seating, widening landing) constrain tactics and texture the emotional journey. The bunker shop and blueprints concretely mirror and then transform alongside the father’s inner architecture. The gilded hush, doll, trellis, and bunkers all recur as charged micro-settings/tools that shape choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly original and fully integrated: the drifting prism terrace, pinned-insect cities, velvet-lined pylons, and baffles are not postcard flourishes but the literal infrastructure of his work. Environmental features consistently shape options (routes, speed, sound zones), and the storm glass functions as a tool that mediates between world and psyche. The final image—storm glass clear as winter morning, terrace learning “a new angle for its light”—shows the environment itself reweighted by the emotional shift. Sensory detail is dense but purposeful, staying tied to perception and pressure rather than digressing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and constantly in play: the broadcast waterfall, wired orchard, murals, and inverted stair all both embody the world and drive the characters’ options. Environment and objects (the waterfall grid, painted wall, hatch, throne room) consistently constrain or enable choices, not just decorate them. The orchard and its apples in particular charge the final image and thematically anchor the idea of stored, deferred futures. World rules feel coherent and are revealed through interaction rather than exposition, achieving a deeply atmospheric yet functional backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight,” door without a house, and sky “like a bowl turned upside down” provide a vivid, coherent environment that feels uniquely tuned to this narrator. The door, doorknocker ring, ash, stars, and scars all function as micro-setting elements that constrain action and channel choice (the only way to act is through this ritualized space and its rules). Setting details evolve with events—the threshold brightening/steadying, the hush refilling—as pressure rises and resolves. This world feels fully committed and self-consistent without over-explaining its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, tactile, and integrated with action: pulsing caps, dew-slick floors, and gauge trees all shape movement and choice. The submarine bolt functions as a micro-setting object whose history with pressure directly constrains and enables the fix. Environmental responses (“every cap in the nearest bed lifts as if to pray”) mirror and deepen the internal stakes. World rules feel consistent within their surreal logic, with just enough specificity to feel inhabited rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sepia reading room, gramophone, ash tray, and “golden shadows” form a richly coherent micro-setting that does real narrative work, constraining action to listening, deciphering, and vow-making rather than spectacle. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and always tethered to meaning (“Golden shadows pooled like tea” sets both tone and class of space). The room and its tools directly charge the closure image: the horn “kept watch,” the house “exhaled its long-planned mercy,” and the city’s change is framed in relation to that sanctum. There is no white-room drift; the setting is both stage and pressure system for the protagonist’s choice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and specific—the alchemical greenhouse, crucibles as fruit, equations in bark, stitched constellations—and consistently filtered through his knightly sensibility and ritual purpose. Environment constrains and guides choice: the stage-like braiding branches, fossilized pollen slab, crooked ladder, and the fruit-kernel physically structure the beats and enable the final act. The rooted constellations and endless night charge the final image of reality shifting as he ingests possibility. Description is dense but purposeful, with world rules (scientific/alchemical + cosmic) remaining internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    The foster care file room is rendered with vivid, selective detail—fluorescent hum, “cardboard coffin,” dust patterns—that all feel filtered through an archivist’s eye. Setting is not decorative: shelves, boxes, and dust directly shape what she can notice and do, and the micro-setting of the shelf and button charges the final image. The environment’s hospital-like sterility and weight of stored histories subtly mirror her emotional state without heavy-handed symbolism. The recurring dust and box imagery evolves toward the corridor metaphor at the end, satisfying the object-as-setting gate for high scores.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    The settings are vivid, specific, and absolutely integral: flooded tram yard puddles literally map Mara’s route, while the auric lagoon with its cables and “singing hinge” is the functional and thematic engine of the story. Sensory detail is chosen with purpose—“penny metal and rain on paper,” moths spelling a grammar of refusal—and is consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The environment constrains and enables choices (she must go to this lagoon, use this box and key, under cover of dusk/starlight), and it charges the final image of her as a “hinge” in the dark. World rules (old circuits, water as memory) are taught through action rather than exposition and hold together.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting work is exceptional: the radiant grotto, prism atrium, mist, and condensation are sensorially rich and consistently filtered through the narrator’s craft and duty. Environment and tool actively constrain choice—the fog must be present to hold notes, the glass and condensation are the medium of the prophecy, and light through facets frames where and how the protagonist acts. The micro-setting evolves (first forming letters, then colder lines, then the final ring of absence) in step with the conflict. The closing image of the ring where the sentence almost closed is a charged, setting-dependent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, slate valley, lichens that “sip thunder,” and tiny monuments create an unusually vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and rule-consistent. Setting isn’t postcard-decorative: the hush, the tree’s altitude, the roots in cloud, and the monuments all shape what the narrator can do and how prophecy functions. The final images (descending with mossy knees under the ashen sky, valley windows unaware) are strongly charged by the environment. It’s superbly handled; the only minor limit is that the setting constrains mood and ritual more than it forces hard tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is rich and purposeful: the ruined workshop, greenhouse, spiral stairs, and subterranean waterfall all feel tactile and distinct while filtered through the tinkerer’s craft-obsessed eye. Environment repeatedly constrains choice—the waterfall demands timed passage, the underground room offers specific resources, and the compass points through spaces that matter. Recurring objects and places (compass, greenhouse, waterfall) charge the final images of the “harbor” workshop and ongoing wandering. Line-level density of imagery is very high but still in service to atmosphere rather than mere ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rain-washed foundry, slag river, furnace, and assay tools are vividly and economically rendered, always filtered through the alchemist’s professional and emotional lens. Environment and objects actively constrain and enable tactics: rainwater as medium, the cracked assay cup as necessary vessel, the furnace as crucible for the climactic act. The mystical-industrial setting’s rules (names and matter having weight) feel internally consistent and are learned through action, not exposition. The final image of the glowing foundry and easing rain is charged by all that has been done in that space.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gorge, harp, and buried river are vivid and specific, not generic: the harp “strung across a cleft in the limestone,” the river speaking in “a tongue of bubbles and soft collisions.” Setting is inseparable from mechanics and stakes: the gorge holds voices, the wind tunes the harp, the hidden river’s memory catalyzes the thematic turn toward mercy. Environmental features actively shape options—the narrator must work through this landscape and its tools; the woman’s passage literally climbs the harp “toward a clearing [he] could not enter.” The final image of leaving a single string for the wind and walking toward another valley makes the environment and recurring objects charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: its behavior (equations on leaves, flaring with remorse, forming a path) both mirrors and shapes the protagonist’s process. Environmental rules stay consistent and directly constrain choices, especially in how the forest “accepts” the proposed limit and opens a way forward. The pewter strap and the body itself function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Description is sensorially dense without losing spatial or conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and specific—“alchemist’s market strung high above city rooftops,” “rope bridges sighed like flutes,” and “cups shaped like gulls” all feel lived and singular rather than decorative. Crucially, environment and objects constrain and charge the action: the suspended market mirrors the narrator’s “between-worlds” role; the lighthouse lens and the painting are not mere props but the ritual apparatus through which meaning is changed. The final “eternal instant” over the roofs makes the setting inseparable from the emotional and thematic payoff. A hairline quibble: a single concrete spatial beat tying the child’s hidden shore more explicitly back to the vertiginous market might further heighten the sense of place-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and fully integrated, from the “peeled knuckle” ticket office to the smell of “coins, mouse nests, and roses too old to remember their color.” Environmental details are filtered through the protagonist’s biases—gravity, ceilings, dust—and directly constrain action: sagging tiles, mouse paths, and dust layers dictate where he looks and what he uncovers. The circus context (ticket window, ringmaster, watch crowns) is inseparable from the time-theft premise. The final image of the cracked-paint smile no longer flaking is charged by everything we’ve learned about the place’s history and released burden.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The glass-orchard-on-cloud-sea setting is vividly realized and never decorative; buoyancy vs. sinking concretely encodes the story’s stakes. Details like frost-as-script, fruit-books, and roots meeting the cloud sea are consistently filtered through the operator’s occupational lens. Environment constrains choice—perfection literally risks making the library sink—and charges the final image as clouds “approve with a humble, revolving hush.” World rules (negotiable reality, agreements binding vapor to shape) stay internally consistent and unfold through action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The baroque asteroid and visible-time storms are vividly particular and integral, not backdrop: veils of years, ruptured salons, and time-squalls create both mood and mechanism. Environmental features directly constrain tactics (storms as the moments when the shard sings; mirrors that must be covered to let the song emerge) and shape the climax in the council hall. The shard, linens, and stormlight operate as charged objects in a lived-in ritual space rather than as static symbols. Description is lush yet controlled and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The resonance chamber and its rusted rafters are vividly particular (“ribs of brass catching lunar flecks”) and integral to the rules: it demands honesty, houses the covenant, and literally receives the shadow. Environmental features strongly constrain tactics—the protagonist must stand where echoes are thickest, obey the chamber’s demand for offering, and accept the rafters as the site of ongoing cost. The final image of the shadow laboring in the beams while he tunes below recharges the setting as a living mechanism rather than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the “subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs,” the boardwalk, hinges, jars, and industrial ruins all shape mood and options rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental logic (factory pumping the aquifer, the hush returning, hinges and panels responding to scent) is consistent within the story’s slightly uncanny frame. The lagoon and its mechanisms constrain action—boardwalk spans, falling man, returned boots/compass—and charge the closing images of factory ruins as “an apology.” Richness never quite tips into disorienting excess, though another notch of restraint in figurative density would better suit a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid—storm, archway, tideline, driftwood, and sea all feel tactile and lived-in, and the sensory palette goes beyond the visual (ferric taste, turbine-hum, satin-worn wood). The environment materially shapes the action: the storm drives her under the arch; driftwood and shells supply the gate’s materials; the archway becomes a literal and symbolic threshold. The final image of the driftwood-lit gate under the stone arch charges the whole piece. A minor restraint on a higher score is that, while rich, the detail density flirts with ornamental in a few spots rather than always constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is outstanding: the cathedral nave, etched glass, garden scents, and amber pavilion are sensory-rich and tightly filtered through the artist’s eye. Environmental details (drafts through glass layers, incense and tobacco scent, amber-filtered light) are not decorative; they’re the very medium by which she tests her question and discovers her method. The final image—standing in the pavilion with moths, postcards, and transformed cathedral scenes—relies entirely on this built world to carry its charge. At times the density of atmospheric detail edges toward luxuriant, but it never confuses spatial or temporal orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The settings—the zeppelin library, the boardwalk shore, and especially the obsidian lagoon—are vivid, specific, and thematically integral. The lagoon and debris literally structure the ritual and choices, and the floating library’s mobility charges the final image of truth in transit. Environmental details are always filtered through the archivist’s sensibility (records, affidavits, minutes), avoiding tourist cataloging. The world’s rules (lagoon as “keeper of unsurrendered echoes”) stay consistent and grow more charged as the story proceeds.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integrated—paper lanterns, beached skiff, ruined market, tide-carried shells—and always filtered through Iria’s practical attention. Environment and objects (cove geography, cistern plans, firebreak gardens, square for danced disputes) directly shape the tactics of revival. The amber bottle and bell function as micro-settings/charged tools in the final tableau, constraining what “revival” can mean without wishes. World rules around wishes and the exhausted sky are consistent and economically delivered, sustaining atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard-on-a-skyscraper setting is richly specific and thematically aligned, and its rules remain consistent. Environmental details—foghorn, rainwater “remembering roofs,” fruit that might drop, roots that could crack the rooftop—directly shape stakes and options. The final image of the orchard relaxing and the fruit “keeping their grip” clearly charges the ending. A hair more tactile interaction with the city below could deepen the physical sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid, sensorial, and omnipresent, with frost, glass, and cold actively shaping the mood and the magic. Environmental details evolve in step with the story’s stakes—the atrium warming, frost patterns shifting, and snow on the glass all mirror and materialize the vortex’s work. The acorn cap as micro-setting object is beautifully folded into the final image. Setting is not mere backdrop; it charges and constrains the entire ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The windblown sanctuary, glass floor over clouds, ductwork river, and cathedral bell rope are both vivid and functional; they constrain what can be heard, signpost institutional vs ancestral warning systems, and directly channel the climax. Weather and architecture (“above the clouds,” “solstice hush,” “microclimate corridor”) are inextricable from the decision to ring the bell and not throw the switch. The rope as a “woven vein” and the sanctuary’s “old beams gossiping about new wires” charge the final image with an environment-mediation theme. Detail density is high but purposeful, rarely feeling like tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station is vividly embodied through sensory detail—the copper-and-tea floor, the big observation window, the fans’ breath, the ice-salted wind—and all of it is filtered through the janitor’s maintenance mindset. Environment and object-as-setting constrain choices: power failure necessitates the lantern; the roof and cold wind frame his final act; the meteors’ angle around an old boundary literally shapes the charged final image. The recurring window and lantern are not just decor but tools that change how he can attend to the sky. This is a fully lived-in, thematically resonant setting.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    The beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland are vividly and economically realized, with images like “burnt hives and wind-chiseled troughs” and “smoke colored the horizon a permanent bruise” doing heavy atmospheric and thematic lifting. Setting is not decorative: the absent bees, charred comb, and noon light all constrain what is possible and directly charge the final image of the glowing frame and archive. The stained glass box and comb function as micro-setting tools that shape his rituals and choices. World rules around ghosts, wind, and light remain consistent and legible without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “emerald silo” and its world of clocks coughing colors, calendars that bark, and wheat ghosts are rendered with striking, sensorial specificity that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting is fully POV-filtered; details like “charting pulses by smell, touch, and the way shadows braided grain” both worldbuild and dramatize the protagonist’s work. The environment constrains choices—this glowing silo as the locus for capsules, gatherings, and the new calendar—and decisively charges the final image of the humming structure and the follow-the-thunder boot. A couple of especially baroque images flirt with excess, but they don’t impede clarity or spatial orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lagoon after rain is fully inhabited and active: reeds, puddles, bottlecaps, kite, and raft all shape perception and action rather than decorating the scene. Weather and water directly enable the poet’s tactics—the damp sand for writing, the lagoon to carry their script, puddles refusing “to mirror the whole sky” encoding the piece’s premise. The final darkening to cobalt “as clouds reknit” and the hush that has “learned their names” explicitly charge the closure image. The setting functions almost as a third character whose state tracks the emotional movement.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated: the temple orchard, living stone pillars, mineral leaves, volcanic pores, tides, kelp, and otter ramps all shape what can happen and how choices are made. Environmental constraints and affordances are constant—pillars hum and shift shade, storms test the copper, ramps change fishing rules, mushrooms “write” after damage, and the final chord from pillars plus otters’ “blessing” directly charges the ending. Detail is selective and POV-filtered through a caretaker’s sensibility, never museum-like. The world’s rules (slow stone life, copper-guided sap, spatial negotiation) remain internally consistent and central to meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the rainwashed tower, ivy-swallowed statues, rotunda, and observatory ribs all filter through the narrator’s scientific/spiritual lens. The environment doesn’t just decorate; the tower’s architecture funnels them upward, the rainwater into a basin orbit, and the window functions as an instrument that maps “origins.” The amber and window together form a micro-setting constraint that directly charges the final image. Weather and physical space subtly shape pacing and tone without ever slipping into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptional: harbor, dead reef, jetty, battlefield, and Gloom Hill interlock with tactile, sensuous precision, always filtered through the coachman’s craft and lexicon. Environmental constraints (salt, wind, narrow boards, rusted weapons, reef-grave) directly shape what can grow, where he can walk, and what he can repurpose, culminating in the jetty as “narrow as mercy.” The recurring objects-as-setting—pods, bayonets, lattice, morning glory—charge the final images with layered history. The only restraint is that the atmosphere is uniformly lush, with little modulation of descriptive intensity to mirror local shifts in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Sluice and wasteland are vividly, economically drawn—“homes welded from the rib cages of buses and the skins of refrigerators” gives an immediate, lived-in geography. Setting and objects (scrap, phonograph, copper crow, relay tower) actively constrain choices and enable the only plausible communication method. The autumn leaf as recurring object both charges the final image and functions as a literal tool to operate the relay, satisfying the object-as-setting gate. Environmental tone (hush, dust, cracked land) meshes with theme and never feels like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The time dilation observation deck and city below are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“each car a beetle dragging time across its shell”). Setting is not postcardish; it materially enables the temporal layering, the glimpse of last year, and the plan to stack future skies. The compass applique functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image when it cools in the narrator’s palm. Environmental and temporal rules stay consistent and directly shape the story’s central tactic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, chessboard of seasons, and wrong sky are richly imagined and consistently leveraged to shape action—the protagonist must engage this specific environment and its rules to fix the world. Objects-as-setting (spire, chessboard, pocket sundial) constrain choices and charge the final images (e.g., the mountains returning, the silent sundial). Sensory detail is focused and purposeful, especially the cold that “forgot how to bite” and lamps leaning toward the board. A hair more tactile interaction with the spire’s physical risk could deepen the embodied stakes, but as is, the atmosphere is outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering gallery, marble rim, and swinging lantern are exquisitely integrated into action: echoes literally carry the words, the outlawed recordings make the acoustics a subversive tool, and the lantern’s moving light shapes where letters “camp.” Setting continually mirrors and constrains choices—this archive can only exist in a space that hears and repeats footsteps. Recurring objects (chessboard, lantern, marble) charge the final image of “a corridor full of legible silence” and the narrator’s departure. Any small ding is only for the highly metaphorized description that occasionally edges toward atmosphere over concrete spatial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain-bookstore is magnificently realized and inseparable from the story’s meaning: shelves as paths, storms “shelved,” and the labyrinth physically embody the inner search. Environmental features consistently interact with choice—the narrowing aisles, sloping floors, shifting shelves, and final question-mark corridor all direct or constrain action. Recurring objects (lamps, mirrors, feather, stone) are integrated into the setting rather than floating symbols, and the mountain’s “answering” rumble and final response to the hello explicitly charge the last image. The specificity is high and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is vivid and thematically fused: the time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth fountain, storm, and clocktower pigeons all act as charged constraints rather than backdrop. The environment dictates both the problem (suspended time) and the solution (woven tapestry threads mapping to villagers’ moments). The final image of the overflowing labyrinth and still-frozen pigeons demonstrates the world shaping and reflecting the narrator’s choices. Sensory detail is precise and filtered through the tutor’s analytic yet haunted gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon of bone, endless echoes, and pale spire is vivid, specific, and consistently woven into action (echoes as participants, bone towers as instruments, the spire as the price’s receptacle). Setting is not mere backdrop: the echoing environment literally refracts voices and defines the terms of forgiveness, and the final breeze that “did not echo” charges the last movement. Details feel purposeful rather than touristic, with recurring objects (bottle shards, jar at spire’s base) reweighted at the end. The world-rule of echo-responsive ritual stays internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is dense, vivid, and consistently functional: the fumes necessitate the cistern, the sea has claimed Mira, and its hunger contrasts with the workshop’s late “steadying.” Objects-as-setting (statue, bells, charm) are tightly woven into action and choice rather than feeling ornamental. The final image of the pontoons rising as if “the acid forgot its hunger” is thematically and atmospherically charged by everything established. World rules (acid sea, drowned monasteries, memory engine) are fantastical yet internally consistent and learned through use, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, cave network, and hidden oasis are rendered with vivid, multisensory specificity (“slick alphabet,” “wet limestone and quince”). Setting is not decorative: tide timing, forking pathways, the mirror-like wall, and the crack of light all constrain what the narrator can do and when. The recurring micro-settings—the studio, the harbor, the shell as portable harbor—directly charge the final image of painting the breathing sea. Environment and recurrent objects shape choice and meaning rather than forming a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse, sea, dawn air, and post-heat-wave atmosphere are richly and selectively rendered, always filtered through the keeper’s sensibility (“rails smell of salt, iron, and the old quarrels of gulls”). The setting is not postcard; the lighthouse’s function and the sea’s temperament directly shape options (horn vs whisper, scent carried on wind, seam of calm). Recurring micro-objects (lantern, vial, rail) charge the final images and reinforce the world’s rules. Environment and weather clearly constrain how the protagonist can act to reach the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and integrated: the starlit signal station, salt flats, feral gardens, and drowned chapel all feel lived-in and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environmental elements constrain choices and charge the ending—the station’s beacon and pulse define direction; the flats and tide set the path; the old shelter and buried driftwood notes enable the ritual. Objects-as-setting (the censer foot, the map “bleached by years of brine”) are central to how the world works and how closure images resonate. The atmosphere remains coherently tidal and salt-bruised throughout, supporting both mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hanging orchard in a storm-gouged ravine is vividly rendered and constantly active: roots groan, ropes bounce, blossoms are beaten to paste, footbridge sway deters the patrol. Setting repeatedly constrains choices—the need to hang between cliffs, the knot-hole and creeping thyme as hiding spots, the patrol’s refusal to cross in the storm. Weather and terrain directly influence the survival of the ritual and the contraband eye, not just the mood. The final sense of the orchard “steadying a little” after shared confession tightly marries environment and emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vividly particular—“opal dock in mist,” gull behavior, harbor bar, ice-chiming winters—filtered through the keeper’s sensibility rather than as neutral description. Environment actively shapes choice: the notch between planks is the puzzle’s lock, the dock “keeping” pain explains the borrowed memory, and nautical twilight enables the coded lighthouse reply and the answering low light to be seen at all. The recurring micro-setting of dock/lantern/mist charges the final image of him holding “the flower and the light” as a kind of portable version of that liminal space. Weather and sea atmosphere are not decorative; they underpin the whole logic of communication and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vivid and meaning-bearing from the map shop to the creek, ants, willows, and blooming cavern, with strong sensory and textural control (“elevation lines curl like sleeping cats,” “smelled like rain without clouds”). Environment actively constrains choices: the rising creek forces temporal pressure, the cavern and seam dictate how the door is accessed, and the ants literally become the bridge for the protagonist’s crossing. The matrix chip and creek also charge the final image, functioning as micro-setting objects that orient the new stance. Detail selection feels motivated by the protagonist’s map- and metal-attuned perception rather than decorative cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated: “spine of stone,” “ember grotto,” and the cobalt cave above clouds all mirror and pressure the internal journey rather than read as postcard fantasy. The pool of bleeding starlight in particular evolves from omen to active threshold to calmed eye at the end, charging the final image. Weather and terrain shape tactics (climb before dawn, narrow ridge, waystations that segment the ascent). Description is lush but nearly always filtered through the queen’s stakes and mood, not generic landscape cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ember nexus, forge trees, and nautilus curl create a rich, tactile magical environment that is inseparable from the action. The curl and pocket sun function as tools/setting that literally structure the ritual and charge the final image of a “thimble of light that does not blind.” Environmental details evolve with the process (embers calming into “measured glow,” sparks knitting restless constellations), reinforcing the stakes of presence versus hurry. A slight tendency toward decorative flourish in a few lines keeps this just shy of 9+, but the integration is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain cabin, ridge, grave, stove, snow, ravens, and kettle are all vivid and tightly filtered through the ranger’s sensibility. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: the stove needing feeding, snow at the window, and the ridge watching all constrain his options and charge the final decision to patrol. The birch bark scroll operates as a charged object-as-setting, turning the sky into a map that then collapses back to the table. Atmosphere is sustained and tonally aligned with the themes of isolation, duty, and temporal drift.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The shop and its water clocks are not backdrop; they are the operating logic of the story. Fog, basins, siphon clocks, clepsydra, and even condensed breath all filter through the narrator’s profession and loss of smell, shaping what they can do. The environment constrains perception (fog swallowing sound, occluded glass) and directly affects action (no bell ring, the place where the clepsydra is set, Rey arriving through thinning fog). The final audio of water and laughter functions as a charged echo of the shop’s atmosphere, making setting indispensable to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock tea platform, storms, and tethering runes are vividly realized and filtered through her sensibility; details like wind skimming the rim and “acres of cloud” are specific and atmospheric. The environment and tools (platform anchors, kettle, cup, ink, quill) do shape options somewhat—she truly is suspended between storm fronts and bound to that ritual space. However, the storm and altitude function more as charged backdrop and metaphor than as concrete constraints on action. The micro-setting of the tea kit and body under pressure does strong work charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The archive and orchard are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with character and stakes: dust “singing,” catalogs arranged by smiles, the held-breath hush before felling trees. The setting is not backdrop; it directly shapes tactics (the piano, metronome, and archive tech enable the summoning) and charges the final image (playing in a room that smells of “peaches and iron filings, summer and storm”). The perfume bottle and metronome function as micro-setting tools that bind memory, music, and haunting into one environment. The orchard clock (cutters at dawn) adds contextual pressure without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient temple library, spiral floor, meteor-stone lectern, and leather straps are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully shapes options—the spiral as arbitration mechanism, the sealed catalogs, exits that “led through the center”—and the lectern constrains how the protagonist engages the task. The setting also charges the final image: leaving “the doors that opened through the center” concretizes the internal shift. A touch more sensory range beyond visual/aural (e.g., texture, temperature, smell) in one or two key moments could deepen embodiment, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fjord, the horizon measurement station, and the hydraulic machinery are rendered with precise, lived-in specificity (“teal machines,” “gauge needles…bright as gull bones”), and nearly every environmental detail is doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Setting genuinely constrains action: the clocks literally “drink from the fjord,” the beacon and recorder dictate how the narrator tests drift, and the catwalk/fjord reflection shape the closing image. The mantle key as tool-object also becomes a micro-setting, charged through blood and inheritance, that anchors the final reflection. This is exceptionally strong scene-building; the only hairline limiter is that environmental constraint remains contemplative rather than forcing a hard external choice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and functionally integrated: light as “distant towns,” humid domes, cables, ruptured seals, and pipes all shape her tactics and perception. Environment repeatedly constrains or enables choices (the sagging cable and unlocked gate, the warm patch for the cat, the sunken strut), and the rig’s thread of red literally maps onto mist, fusing tool and atmosphere. The final image—rig off, pointer in her palm, birdsong pending—charges setting as a breathing organism that has learned. I’m just under the highest band because while setting is excellent, the constraints it imposes on her options could be pushed one notch tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rainwashed library, mica-paned lantern, and bus seats are vivid and sensorially specific; rain, clover, and glass recur in ways that mirror and deepen the emotional arc. Setting elements meaningfully charge the final images (library windows receding “like numbered squares,” clover steaming “made grief smell green”). The environment feels lived-in and filtered through her probabilistic, academic mind rather than like a postcard. It slightly favors lyric resonance over hard constraint, but the world is doing real thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway utility tunnel, cables, flickering bulbs, and the glass harmonica disc create a distinctive, tactile micro-world whose rules stay consistent and shape action (the disc humming with trains, the tunnel’s side door enabling the rescue route). The environment isn’t mere backdrop; it constrains who can reach Mara, how quickly help can arrive, and charges the final quiet with meaning. Detail is economical yet specific, with weather and city machinery subtly affecting the night’s events.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The jetty, tide, sea thrift, and barnacled boards are not mere backdrop; they tightly inflect the ritual (walking the planks, locating the original photograph’s context, the sea as a “ledger of foam”) and charge the ending. Environmental specifics constrain action (the linear walk along the jetty, the tide as temporal pressure) and are thematically fused to memory and covenant. Minor reason for not going higher is that the setting shapes mood and symbolism more than overt tactical choices under pressure, even though it’s exquisitely rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The disused ivy-choked station is vividly rendered and constantly in play: chalkboard rules, skylight leak, gutters singing, signal lantern tea, and ivy that “flags down” the trolley. Environment shapes tactics during the outage (candles, blankets, spatial gathering) and the station’s obsolete infrastructure becomes a vessel for new logistics. The recurring moon rock functions as a micro-setting object that structures speech and then charges the final transfer to the child. This is near exemplary; only a slightly tighter sense of spatial constraint under stress could intensify its role further.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultrasonic forest, tactile languages, and cosmic “pause of shifting constellations” are richly specific and deeply filtered through a blind mapmaker’s non-visual attention, avoiding tourist-catalog description. Environment and tool (forest + ring) actively shape options and tactics, not just mood: the character must feel bark, lichens, notes, and ring temperature to proceed. World rules about sound/ultrasound and language-through-skin are internally consistent and never need expository dumping. The only thing holding this just shy of the very top band is that physical spatial choreography is soft-focus, though that suits the piece’s sensory priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Quiet is vividly particular—“where space itself forgets its manners,” with gravity tides that warp clocks and tea—and these conditions directly enable the history-editing mechanic. The station’s physical responses (groaning, shifting gravity, the scrap tugging) are woven into the action, not ornamental description, making environment and anomaly feel like active participants. The pen and scrap function as micro-setting tools, charged objects whose behavior tracks the world’s rules. Atmosphere stays consistent, a hushed, distorted stillness that underwrites both the cosmic and the personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor setting is richly tactile (ropes, crabs, barnacles, bell, pilings) and always filtered through Arin’s project, never mere postcard texture. Environment constrains choice: the bell, tide, and boards are the actual instruments for the “mapping silence” method and for the pivotal disruption. The final images—harbor carried as a “memory’s pocket,” bowing to the sea, the camera as a “bell of unstruck light”—are charged directly by this setting. World rules are consistently lyrical yet legible, grounding the metaphor in a coherent place.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The buried archive, dunes, murals, oculus, and strange objects are vivid and tightly integrated with action—she navigates, decodes, and plants directly through these environmental specifics. The setting’s rules (wind through oculus, ash, salt, feathers) consistently shape what she can do and how the final image reads. The city’s physical ruin being refigured as a “vow kept” gives the place a strong, charged presence beyond mere backdrop. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding under peak beats could deepen embodiment, but the current atmosphere is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are richly specific and integral: they dictate tactics (drumming, bridges of tone, the crack in silence) rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental rules—intention tuning stone, leafed speakers responding, monitors listening—stay consistent and culminate in the ending image of the garden/monitors “listening” to their rhythm. Spatial logic (rails, resonance beds, lagoon center) is coherent and tactically used. A hairline sense of lyric abstraction around the tech/physics keeps this just shy of absolutely top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The port labyrinth is superbly realized: cranes frozen mid-swing, “steel canyons,” citrus air, and acoustic behavior all feel integrated and character-filtered. Environment genuinely constrains and enables tactics—the geometry, corrugation, and resonance are how Ivo wins, not mere backdrop. The zodiac coin and “key with no apparent lock” function almost as micro-settings/tools that shape choice, especially at the jammed gate. There’s little to fault; the only reason this doesn’t tip into 9+ is that the setting, while excellent, doesn’t quite reconfigure the final image beyond underlining the already clear theme.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.2)
    The canal, dock, rain, narrow houses, shutters, and barges are exquisitely rendered and never feel like postcard detail—they are tools the guardian uses and mediums through which empathy is transmitted. Weather, water, and architecture all constrain what’s possible (light reflection, shutter signals, rope work) and shape the story’s logic. The recurring objects (dock, mirror, rope, shutters) charge the final images, especially the canal “keeping the lesson” and the alleys bending toward “other harbors.” The environment is inseparable from both action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is exceptional: the cobalt library, mist, magnetic grotto, and town windows are sensorially rich and always thematically charged, not decorative. The magnetic stone garden literally disrupts compasses and metaphorically reframes guidance, directly feeding the story’s conceptual end. Environmental details evolve (“library…became a lantern itself”) and meaningfully charge the final images of mist, grotto, and leaves. This is fully publishable as-is at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coast, docks, sublittoral fringe, and island are vividly realized through tactile, profession-informed detail (“sub littoral fringe,” “eelgrass combed the water for lost names”) and they meaningfully shape what is possible. The scrimshaw and the docks function as micro-settings constraining choice and charging the final images. World rules about the post-violence era are woven into the environment rather than dumped. A slight reason this isn’t higher is that the physical navigation of the crowd’s boats and the rebuilt pier is more gestural than concretely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integrated: turbines, barley, farmhouse, and the surveillance apparatus all inform what’s possible and how it feels (“turbines kept time for a calendar nobody trusted”). The turbines in particular evolve from visual backdrop to oppressive presence (their “giant applause” for the inspector, their timing of the hush), charging the final contrast between outside wind and inside hush. The bouquet and carved objects serve as micro-settings/props that embody grief and resistance. A marginally clearer sense of the broader geography or neighboring lives under the mandate could deepen stakes but isn’t strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is extraordinary and integral: the cobalt atrium, humming quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are not just pretty backdrops but embodiments of the boundary at stake. The environment constrains and shapes choice—the inlaid line, the glass between atrium and lake, and the “first safe ice” literally stage the final crossing. Sensory specificity (mineral air, ink, “snow pressed into pages”) is high and always filtered through the communal consciousness. The final image of moving from floor to lake with the colonnade’s hum on their backs shows the setting actively charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    The courtyard, furnaces, glass, and plant-laden sills are richly specific and always filtered through Ivo’s altered senses (smoke by flavor, cobbles by temperature). Setting is not postcard; it constrains and generates action: the market of awakenings, the reed in the glassworker’s case, the bell from a broken goblet, and the phoenix-like kiln cycles all shape what choices are possible. Environmental objects recur with charged meaning—the slag phoenix’s shadow during the trade, the bell at night, the cooling glass Ivo paints. The final images are inseparable from this place’s textures and rules.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptionally rich: “laboratory of lost sounds,” jars of vanished bells, the ferry bell, courthouse roof, factory mothers, and blackout kitchens all accumulate into a textured world filtered through this specialist ear. The miner’s carbide lamp lens, the bells, and the power grid context do more than decorate; they shape how connection can be sought and literally bend sound into spectra that matter to the pilgrimage’s logic. The final image of the city “tuning itself to hope” charges all prior setting choices. A slight tendency toward continuous lyric description without hard constraints on choice keeps this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    The observatory and its mechanism are exquisitely integrated: keys in the cradle, the console, the planetarium’s “genuinely artificial dawn,” and the curtains of intention all shape what rituals are possible. The space isn’t postcard description; it literally provides the loom for intention and the canvas for the lily and aurora projections. The setting constrains and enables actions (projecting stencils, tracing petals, waiting in the dome’s dark) and charges the final image of the lingering lily-glow. The recurring small objects (tin of jet beads, vellum, wire, ring) function as micro-settings that bridge rock/metal/body, tightening the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and always filtered through purpose: the “rain-beaded skylight loft,” wet alley, peeled paint, and hidden blues all directly shape actions like measuring, walking routes, and uncovering the mural. Tools double as micro-setting—the tape, compass, and cards constrain how problems are approached and literally move the characters through space. Weather and city texture (“coins washing in a sink,” wet cardboard and basil) deepen mood without stalling momentum. The environment also charges the final image (tape → ribbon festival), satisfying the object-as-setting criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The archive is vivid, specific, and rule-bound: it rearranges itself, twilight is a verb, the pagoda opens like a seedpod, the ceiling is a lake remembering fire. Environmental logic constrains tactics (avoiding patterns to escape its “directional bias,” climbing shifting landings) and charges the final image (the city and plaza transformed by what happened inside). Details are filtered through the narrator-historian’s sensibility, giving the setting both mythic and procedural texture. The archive’s physical/magical behavior is consistent and integral to the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    The “blooming library above clouds” is richly imagined and constantly active—vines, blossoms, reels, orchards, and balconies all participate in the action rather than sitting as backdrop. Environmental rules exert genuine pressure: the library’s jealousy and tightening vines physically endanger the reels, forcing Mira’s bargain, and the balcony/cloud threshold enables the stone-shadow anchoring. The river stone functions as a micro-setting object, holding thematic and tactical weight when placed in the shadow and then passed back to Ilen. World details (bottled slumber, orchards of ideas, clouded corridors) are economical yet specific, and they evolve coherently with each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The misty, star-roofed workshop, terrarium, and instruments are exceptionally vivid and consistently filtered through the handler’s professional eye; details like the atomized mist and warmed forceps feel tactile and lived-in. Environment and objects meaningfully charge choices and the ending: the workshop as sanctuary under financial siege, the mist as “counsel,” and the stars as indifferent witnesses all reappear in the closing cadence as the mist thins. The micro-setting of the bench, terrarium, tail tip, and brochure functions as a small cosmos where ethical decisions are staged and memorialized. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical environment rarely constrains tactics as much as it mirrors and frames them.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings (quiet tower, city, fenced worksite, collapsed chamber) are vividly rendered and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, with plants and objects functioning as micro-setting. The environment meaningfully shapes choice: the tower’s isolation, the fenced scar, and the debris-filled tunnel all constrain movement and charge the ritual. Recurring objects-as-setting—the hourglass, coffee rings, plant life—concretely charge the final image. A slight check is that weather and physical constraints of the tunnel stay more atmospheric than tactically limiting.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The projection booth and storm are more than backdrop; the projector, reels, tin, and table are all used as tools in her method and recur in the charged final image (“the projector exhaled… thunder outside finally spoke aloud”). Specific sensory details—iron ladder, cooled drum, spattered table—are filtered through her sensibility and support the lyrical, haunted tone. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain options in a physical sense, but the film booth’s logic (hidden box behind the screen, reels as cradle for farewells) is thematically indispensable. Atmosphere is thick and coherent without slipping into generic “old theater” description.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    The aurora-lit archway, river, city windows, and brass instrument are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; they create a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The arch and instrument are not mere backdrop—they function as hinge and key that literally open rooms and shape what the narrator can do, satisfying the “environment as constraint/tool” gate. Recurring details (aurora, river, windows) evolve in meaning, culminating in the city “remembering its stardust” and the night learning to speak. Sensory specificity is high without feeling like a tourist catalog, and the world’s rules remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: the “glowing dune in bloom,” rails “like a vein,” glass-throated dunes and lantern spores all create a coherent, sensorially rich post-ecological world. Environment directly shapes action—the archive opens when the dunes sing, the blooming sand bathes the freight in a “brittle lull,” and the spores colonize rails and rust, turning the train into “a greenhouse moving north.” The final images—quiet planted in his boots, spores traveling along the rails—are inseparable from this landscape and charge the closure with both fragility and momentum. Detail feels precise, character-filtered, and never like tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s mechanical-philosophical attention: “river of mercury beads,” “tree stitched from axles,” bark with “serials and prayer notches.” Setting doesn’t just decorate; it dictates methods (reading wind through different trees), provides the key object (gear in a root-socket), and literally opens the corridor to the shelter. World rules—organic/machine hybrid, wind as language—stay stable and are learned through action. The final image of the repaired second ticking in the branches is strongly charged by the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bay, fog, ridgeway, and tide are vivid, sensorially specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s emotional state. Setting isn’t decorative: the vigil on the shoreline, the veiled ridgeway, and the thin silver water all structure what is possible, including the indirect routes and the final descent toward town lights. Recurring environmental motifs (tide as lullaby, sea as hand on the back) directly charge the final image. This is rich, integrated atmosphere; only the uniformly lyrical register keeps it from feeling even more sharply constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the cobalt fortress, snow, radiators, bricked-in cobalt window, and training room all shape what is possible and how resistance must be smuggled. Environmental rules (safety confiscates music; harmony must move through pipes, breath, and condensation) directly constrain tactics and charge the final images (touching the window, the fortress “exhal[ing] a warmer kind of rule”). The piano bench bolt, radiators, and cobalt glass form a coherent micro-setting network tied to choice. Minor reason for not going higher is that we never see the external system enforcing “safety” on the page—its presence is strongly implied but off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The temple library is vivid and specific—breathing like bellows, shelves sliding in time, skylight and dust acting almost as characters—and the world rules around the rune and drifting aisles are coherently implied. Setting isn’t mere backdrop; it shapes tactics (Lyr waits for the constellations’ pause, uses the rune, relies on the library’s forgotten doorway and selective patronage). Sensory detail is dominated by visual and conceptual textures, but they’re so particular and filtered through the story’s mythic register that atmosphere is immersive. The environment charges the final image (doorway remembered, news diffusing from this timeless pocket), even if it rarely forces moment-by-moment physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sea level station, reef, flats, and breathing corridor are vividly rendered and inseparable from the premise; professional detail (tide logs, current meter, satellite drift) feels lived-in rather than expository. Environment actively constrains choice: the corridor exists only at certain beats, lanterns “tumble and reset,” and storms periodically erase the flats. The final image of vertebrae-lanterns “gatehinged to the sea” is directly charged by the recurring setting logic of moored-yet-drifting structures. Minor room remains in that weather and physical peril are more conceptual than viscerally felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is richly realized and integrated—gantries, deckplates, cargo doors, and projectors all matter to how she discovers and then disseminates the map. The ancient stone circle as an embedded “calibration altar” is a striking, specific fusion of setting and technology that directly shapes the story’s mechanics and ending image. Spatial logic (from shuttle to door to chamber to hangar mouth) is clear and supports the unfolding action. The recurring contrast between industrial ruin and almost-sacred apparatus charges the atmosphere throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    The volcanic hot springs, bathhouse reconstruction, vault, and porous rock form an integrated, constraint-rich setting: the hottest pool is required for the ritual and the reconstruction context charges the final image of a new living scaffold. Details are vivid but never postcard-like; sulfur wind, mirrored steam, basalt paths, and “bubbles like secrets” all feel filtered through Lida’s sensibility. Environment actively shapes action (the vault under the hottest pool, the edge of the spring as ritual locus). The final image of tree-walkways under steam is powerfully charged by everything that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The arboretum on a seaside cliff, with its glass roofs, storm season, and automated lighthouse, is vivid and integral to action and theme. Setting continuously shapes choices—plant selection for hotter years, glass tightening in storms, the gull rescue on the cliff path—and charges the final caretaker’s-room image. Environmental details are filtered through Rafi’s professional and personal attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. The automation of the lighthouse and the storm-battered coast subtly mirror his own attempt to build fragile, maintained refuges.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lighthouse library and gearhouse are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“stones sweating brine,” “rust ticked like a clock that no longer knew time”), and setting is always filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Environment meaningfully constrains and shapes choices: the forgotten ledger, the layout of stairs, the perished wick, and the threaded cards all emerge from and depend on this place. Weather and architecture apply pressure (“the weather thickened the windows… the hour when the walls close in”) and then are reconfigured by the relit beam and the sea’s “breath unclench[ing].” The final image—“column of brightness that stitched her to the weather”—is inseparable from this specific micro-world.

    The wind-carved encampment, auric ribs, fossilized tents, and ink-slicked troughs create a striking, specific atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through the tracker’s sensibility. Setting is not just decorative—the wind, dunes, and gravity directly shape how the ink moves and what can be read, and the hut’s interior (contracts, storm-bone metronome) anchors the abstract premise. The final return to wind and a counting-less metronome gives the environment a role in the closure image. It stops short of 9-band only because physical constraints from setting don’t quite force tactics in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: snow, pipes, frost, ducts, and dormant conduits are not just atmosphere but the literal means and constraints of action. The library under snow, the storm, and the midnight grid rehearsal all shape tactics and tone, and the final image (“echoing library under snow held its breath with me”) is charged by those established specifics. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered, with occupational attention to stacks, seals, and infrastructure. Any further elevation would require the physical environment to push back more concretely against the protagonist’s choice, not just enable it.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is deeply integrated: dust, heat, dome, roses, and irrigation are all in continuous interplay with character choices and thematic stakes. The setting constrains behavior (visitors soften, knives are sheathed, derision dries into thirst) and charges the ending image of the farm as a hinge. Recurring objects (sandbag, trellis, clear stones) operate as micro-settings that reshape options and meaning. The environmental logic—duststorm world, airships, a fragile enclave of quiet—feels internally consistent and never lapses into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly specific and lived-in: “sea…not water but braided music,” “hedges of sound,” “tremblegrass,” and “dune of hush” all feel coherent within an aural-physical world. The rail spike and the sound wave garden aren’t postcard backdrops; they dictate tactics (listening via iron, walking aisles of sound) and charge the final act of spilling the map back into the tide. World-rules (iron as tuning fork, constellations walking) stay internally consistent and are learned through action. The only brake on a higher score is that atmosphere slightly outweighs concrete spatial stakes, keeping the piece more visionary than situationally constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory above the clouds, the dome, and the consoles that “blink like constellations of small conscience” create a precise, tonally aligned environment. Setting constrains and enables: isolation from storms/ethics is thematized, and the physical lens and lever are the locus of the key turn. The recurring micro-setting of the rosewood nib on the console charges the closure image, tying tool, legacy, and choice. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered, avoiding touristic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” salvage-floorboards, cabinet, speakers, recorder, and amber all create a dense, specific environment filtered through the narrator’s obsessions. Setting isn’t decorative: the lab’s listening floor, haunted hardware, and the amber directly mediate choices and the way cries are translated, culminating in the final image of amber pressed to the fresh tattoo. World rules (e.g., haunted firmware, time-folding) feel internally consistent and are learned through action. The space and its tools constrain what she can do—she answers in “skin and quiet” because that is what the lab enables.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The whispering grotto, mist, limestone, sand, and tile are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action (“mist licked the limestone,” “grotto’s ribs seemed to breathe”). Setting is not mere backdrop: acoustics and mist justify the focus on hush, the tile-as-tooth extends the cave’s body, and the environment inflects the ritual’s stakes. While the grotto doesn’t strictly constrain physical options, it does constrain the social experiment—this kind of listening only makes sense here—and it charges the final image of the hush “riding home in breathing.” The specificity and consistency of the world rules make the atmosphere feel lived-in rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    The plaza and shattered sky are vividly realized and function as more than backdrop; the plaza “tightens,” whispers questions, and provides the physical medium (stepping stone, tessera, bottle caps) that enables the renaming ritual. Environmental detail is selective and charged—ash halos, broken columns, the well—mirroring and constraining choices. The final act of placing the minaret tessera back onto the plaza floor directly ties setting to closure, literally loosening the past. This integration of micro-setting and object-as-setting meets the 9+ gate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the converted playhouse, hedge maze, mystic orchard, and mossy amphitheater all feel tactile, strange, and lived-in, filtered through the narrator’s synesthetic senses (“green cymbals,” “apples bright as cues”). The environment actively shapes action—the maze rearranges, the orchard “answers” and opens doors, and the coins’ behavior depends on being held to the orchard—so this is not postcard description. The recurring spaces (storefront vs. stage/orchard) charge the final image of walking back toward neon and morning. A slight check is that time/era remains almost timelessly vague, which keeps the world a touch abstract, though not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and continuously integrated: rain veining the windows, trembling bulbs, the floor rig, camera, and wand all feel tactile and lived-in. The studio materially shapes choices—the rig’s static shock changes their behavior, the wand and camera define the method, and the final act of leaving the geode on the sill charges the last image. The “light painting studio” is not a backdrop but the enabling technology of their attempt to make memory visible. Atmosphere (hushed, electric, rain-bound) aligns strongly with the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal cave network is exquisitely realized and fully integrated with action: tide cycles, throat tunnels, “mineral hair,” and black pools all constrain movement and options. Environmental details almost always carry functional weight (storm surge, slack tide, shelves, alcove), not just mood. The recurring fossil functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and choice. Atmosphere is consistently immersive without drifting into decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, jars, and buttons are vivid and central, functioning as more than décor—they store time and echoes, tremble with cliff shifts, and ultimately become porous when the doors are opened. Setting actively charges the final images (hourglasses dimming, cliffs “loosening sentences,” buttons as planets), and the environment shapes what’s possible (collective gathering, shared listening, reconfigured ritual). This is nearly exemplary; the only small gap is that physical constraints (risk from cliffs, logistics of villagers’ descent) stay atmospheric rather than tactically pressing any single choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exquisitely integrated: the zephyr bluff, mist, frost-pocked grass, and “silver hush” are not just mood but infrastructure—snow receives codes and the sea receives secrets. Environmental details are filtered through Ansel’s sensibility, with weather and season (the tilt toward spring) echoing his internal thaw without feeling schematic. The bluff’s openness, patrol risk, and proximity to the water all constrain tactics and enable the microfilm disposal. The final image of walking home through the same silver hush recharged by his transformation shows the environment actively charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog-bound river, ferry, ticking gutters, and hills are vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated with mood and action. The setting materially shapes options (they must ferry across; the current challenges them; the fog thickens and then parts), and objects like the sailcloth and lanterned trap carry thematic weight. Weather and environment mirror and modulate the internal stakes without feeling on-the-nose. The final image of the road and breathing hills feels charged by all the environmental work laid earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: cracked troughs, empty hives, flattened chimney smoke, and heat shimmer are all filtered through the potter’s sensory and craft-informed gaze. Environment and objects consistently shape choices—water scarcity makes her offerings costly, the troughs provide clay for cups, the apiary wall supplies bricks for a makeshift kiln, and the lantern glass governs how she can perceive and act across timelines. World rules (magical timelines, phototropism to kindness) are internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. The recurring physical world (smoke line, hives, glass, cups) powerfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lushly particular—fire escape, alleys, skiff, fish plant, pilings—filtered through the narrator’s gardener/locksmith sensibility, and the harbor feels fully lived-in rather than postcard. Environmental elements constrain action in concrete ways: the salted padlock, the brittle wick, the patched skiff, and the moonlit water all shape what can happen and how. The final image of cutting the lighthouse beam into slips and “rooting” it at home depends entirely on the spatial and physical logic established earlier. The only reason not to go higher is that, while beautifully integrated, the environment pressures more softly than it could under true extremity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal library above clouds, vapor tides, stone circle, and aviary stacks are richly specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting is not decorative: tides drown/expose aisles, the floor threatens to turn liquid, the stone circle’s hum and the sundial’s beam constrain tactics, and all of this charges the final image of a tuned, breathing library-shelter. World rules (resonance lifting shelves, cloudlight, fossil voices in baskets) stay internally coherent and evolve with the action. The density of imagery is high but controlled and always in service of mood and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“a patient lantern set upon green glass,” droplets as “tiny window[s]”). The environment isn’t just decorative: the threads, willow poles, paper leaves, lilies, and bell all shape movement, choices, and the communal ritual. Weather and water (“after the cloud bursts,” wind arranging petals, sound crossing lilies) modulate atmosphere and action. The final image of the lovers rejoining the city in this setting recharges the opening’s “prismatic quiet” with emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.0)
    The university radio station, campus, and theater roof are vividly particular and tightly filtered through a sound-obsessed professional: mixer lights as constellations, cables as throat singing, kettles hissing at dawn. Environment materially constrains options—her access to antenna arrays, subsonic frequencies, and the campus grid is what makes resistance possible. The charts-as-object function as micro-setting in the end, literally bearing the reweighted rule (“teach people their breath”) and charging the final image. Atmosphere (election-season hum, peeling posters, rain-softened posters) supports the themes of manipulation vs. unscripted community without feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The city’s shifting alleys, the nexus, the fountain, the church, and the Observatory are all sharply drawn and consistently rule-bound; space truly acts as an unstable antagonist. Setting details are not decorative: organ acoustics alter stone, the nexus geometry constrains where the ritual can work, and the telescope pointing down at the city’s “throat” charges the final image. The compass, alleys, and plaza directly shape tactics and the reconfiguration at the end. Rich description is always filtered through the explorer’s priorities and fears, maintaining clarity despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    The quarry and its mist are exquisitely realized and integral: the bowl-like geometry, silt, rust ladder, and shallows directly govern how the narrator searches and what can be found. Objects-as-setting (rebar, ribbon, phone case, perfume vial) are tactile, specific, and recur conceptually in the studio painting. Weather and terrain mirror and constrain the investigation without sliding into blunt symbolism. The final painted quarry and floating ribbon are charged by all that accumulated physical detail, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    The experimental weather station is brilliantly realized through damp, oppressive specifics (“corridors bleed humidity,” “instruments whispering forecasts that smell of mold”), and the environment continually interacts with choice (the boundary mists, the anemometer room, the rusted panel). The copper nail and the fog function as micro-setting elements that constrain tactics and charge the final image. World rules around “reversible exile” and the mists stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. Setting and atmosphere are not decorative; they’re inextricable from plot, mood, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain pullout, guardrail, scaffold-wrapped overlook, and under-bridge latticework are specific, sensorial, and always filtered through the fiddler’s sensibility. Environment meaningfully constrains action: the construction shroud and scaffold wrap literally map the path, and the under-bridge geometry and river light shape where and how the reunion occurs. Recurring objects (fiddle, glass flake) act as micro-settings that charge the closure (“river mist beads on my fiddle, every drop a votive”). A touch more tactile constraint (physical risk at the construction site) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned circus train and valley are not backdrop but active shapers of meaning: office, shrine, and graveyard in one. Details like “Bright lions peeled from car sides,” the ringmaster’s drawer, and the tiger car directly charge choices and the final image. The environment’s decay mirrors the startup’s arc without feeling didactic, and the train’s physical layout structures the narrator’s walk toward closure. Setting, tone, and theme are tightly fused.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory is vividly and economically rendered—“slow light,” red lamps, domes clicking, variable stars as working tools rather than backdrop. Setting details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s vocation, so instruments and sky become grammar rather than pure scenery. Environment constrains and enables choices: they must wait for specific stellar pulses, set the arrays, and Mara physically rewinds the dome at the end. The recurring objects (sextant, daylily, domes) also charge the final images without feeling over-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard vortex, boat-grown trees, and orbiting apples are memorably strange yet coherent, and the environment actively shapes tactics (expanding circles touching trees, apples slowing to “listen”). The lake’s habit of storing lost objects and frozen words directly structures the retrieval and charges the closure as the orchard unspools and apples settle. Details are consistently filtered through the druid’s professional eye (cataloging by ache, taking a coin as receipt), giving the world a lived-in logic rather than a mere postcard. A hair more sensory variation beyond the visual/kinetic might have pushed this into truly immersive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and continuously active: cobalt glade, grafting to the mapletree, hedges that grow words and become doors, the mirrored pool, and the sundial that tells tides all shape what is possible. Environment constrains and enables choice: being root-bound, needing bark contact, doors demanding answers, the maze as literal footing, and cambium as contract-medium. These details are filtered through the visionary’s sensibility, avoiding tourist cataloging and maintaining tonal unity. The final return to “the cobalt glade at dusk” charges the ending image as a liminal, still-uncertain border rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the half-lit corridors, catacomb orchard, bone-hand pit, and lanterns all inform what is possible and where the ritual must occur. The ash-map physically funnels the protagonist to a specific place, and the final planting in that exact soil charges the last image. A slight surplus of atmosphere over tactical constraint keeps this just beneath the absolute top band, but the specificity and coherence are outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The quarry and office trailer are vividly, economically realized—“rock dust frosting my boots like evaporated applause” both situates and thematically charges the scene. The environment is not just backdrop: the quarry’s history as an outlaw venue and the site of Leon’s death directly shapes why this job matters and how it hurts. The recurring “quarry remembers / echo” motif culminates in the final image of the glittering pit and wind carrying breath back, clearly charging closure. Details are consistently filtered through this narrator’s sensibility rather than feeling touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is richly specific and filtered through the translator’s professional and emotional gaze, with details like “breathing rails,” “filings and felt,” and lightning that “argues” all doing double thematic and physical duty. The environment constrains and enables action: magnetism shapes the rituals, the filings’ movement, and the way the seed roots, and storms and altitude inflect tone and choices. Spatial and rule consistency are strong for such a surreal setting. A hair more tactile risk or impediment from the environment itself could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal atrium, salt-flecked glass, metallurgy alcove, creel, and bells all function as more than décor; they constrain what can happen and how, from siphoning syllables to smelting broken minutes. Environmental logic—tide as cataloger, moon as editor, atrium as breathing body—remains consistent and is learned through action, not exposition. The final image of gears, bells, and tides integrates prior setting elements into a charged closing tableau that reweights the entire piece. Sensory detail is rich but purposeful, with smell, temperature, and texture woven through rather than listed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    The crystal cave is vivid, specific, and constantly active in the narrative: “walls of quartz rose like frozen rain,” the spire like “a finger held to lips,” veins carrying inhaled light. The environment’s properties constrain and enable choices (the spire as the “chosen point” to crown, the quartz veins as conduits for latent radiance). Tone and atmosphere—“resonant hush,” “patient lace of ghost rivers”—are inseparable from setting, and the final charged image of the cave underscores the thematic shift. This is a textbook case of setting as both stage and engine.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The station, ivy, restroom, culvert, sluice gate, and shallow are vividly rendered and tightly bound to action and theme (e.g., “green chapel,” “ledger,” “rail-bed grief”). Setting consistently constrains and channels choices: the graffiti in the restroom launches the quest, the sluice gate embodies the professional shortcut, and the shallow forces bodily entry into the site of trauma. Environmental and object details (ivy, bellows, rust, mossed milestone) recur with shifted meanings at the end. The world feels both textural and deeply functional without extraneous detail.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “glowing library in mist” and the watch function as lived-in micro-settings whose rules constrain choice (the door opens only to someone who can wait; the books require unsounded breath to write). Sensory and spatial details like shelves “curved away like galaxies” and mist forming “legible curls” are vivid yet purposeful, always tied to how the narrator must act. The environment continues to matter through the final image, where the library travels with her “hidden in intervals and patience.” It’s richly imagined without devolving into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, plants, and city all operate as more than backdrop: heat and noon light literally endanger the ice violin, velvet shapes how the music is held and released, and the plant-root network becomes the transmission medium for memory. Environmental details are specific and purposeful (“sun like a thousand brass coins poured through the slit of noon”), and they evolve with the action toward the melting climax. The final images—damp strings, breathing leaves, city answering—are charged directly by setting properties and would collapse without this exact environment.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are not just pretty wallpaper; the aurora’s “song” is literally the medium through which consciousness-echoes can be caught, so environment directly shapes tactic and possibility. Spatial and sensory anchors—the conch‑like cave, black sea of clouds, stone ribs—are vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s professional gaze. The small-scale setting elements (kit, vials, chip, radio) feel tactile and lived‑in, tightly integrated with the work she’s doing. The final image of returning through cloud “like a boat at harbor” meaningfully reweights the opening’s numinous suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto above the clouds, stone grapes, breathing wall, and root chamber are vividly rendered with multi-sensory specificity, and the environment structurally matters: its architecture demands the hairpin-key, offers the caretaker’s stool, and frames the descent/return. Setting and recurring objects (grotto, juniper, clouds, vines) directly charge the ending image of the world “prepared to be watered again.” The details feel filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, not like a tourist catalog. A hair more constraint from the physical environment on her choices, beyond symbolic fitness, would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, wind, chimes, and height above the waking town are all vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the choice being made. Environment actively constrains tactics—the decision literally depends on wind-driven chimes and the elevated, exposed setting—and charges the final image of Lark at the rail with gulls as “impartial jurors.” Objects-as-setting (cloak of doubt, mirror shard) recur and meaningfully reweight the ending. The sense of dawn, breeze, and weather as moral climate is both concrete and thematically functional.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: the floating rock, magnetic grotto, candles, and pond are not mere backdrop but active forces that shape action and meaning (“the grotto pulls not only stone, but time, and sometimes lineage”). Sensory details (lake smoke, copper from candles, humming air) are filtered through the narrator’s attention and consistently support tone. World rules—grotto gravity, floating candles, rising stone—are introduced through observation and ritual rather than exposition. The environment also charges the final image (following “the last ring across the pond”), turning the setting into a carrier of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon of bone and echoes is richly rendered and fully integrated into function: bones act as tuning forks, the shale pools and black mirror are tools, and spatial relations (ledges, spines, ribs) remain clear. Setting isn’t postcard; environment literally structures the method of navigation and the final ritual with the arrowhead and mirror. The sensory palette (sound, light, dust, lichen-scent) is specific and filtered through a professional’s bias. This is elite-level atmosphere; the only thing keeping it just under the top band is that environmental constraint is spiritual and methodical rather than posing acute, practical peril.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    The icebound spire, fog, cold, and the automated city are all sharply rendered and consistently filtered through the mage’s sensibility. Environment constrains and enables choices: the stairs and broken steps prompt mist walking, the notch in the masonry makes the keystone functional, and the street kiosks contextualize the radical plainness of the table and blank paper. Recurring objects (keystone, light’s “hush” on the hands) charge the final images. World rules for magic and automation stay consistent and are learned through action and perception, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    The harbor, pier, fog, and especially the sunken-ship library are vividly concrete and not decorative; the environment dictates what’s possible (only underwater can the lamplighter reach the vows and perceive sound-as-color). Details like “kelp curtains,” “ribs of the sunken ship,” and books that glow “like algae remembering lightning” are tightly integrated into action rather than static postcard description. The setting’s rules are consistent—this ship has been listening for years, storing a palette of sound-colors—and the final image of lanterns as “notes” only works because of the established sky/sea/library triad. Setting actively charges the ending rather than merely framing it.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “ambered observatory deck,” honeyed dome, gas clouds like fossilized sap, and contracted universe create a vivid, coherent environment filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting elements constrain action in concrete ways: turning the dome, tuning gyros, tending receivers, and the amber transforming into a lens that shapes the final corridor-image. The coins function as a micro-setting object, charging the closure when they warm in the narrator’s palm. World rules feel internally consistent even in their abstraction, and the tone of fossilized, post-cosmic quiet is anchored in physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory, dome, lens, dust, and subterranean brine are not backdrop; they are the mechanism and mood of the story, constraining what tactics are possible (light, cylinders, the scythe-as-focus). Sensory specificity is high and POV-filtered (“the dome breathed like a sleeping lung,” “brine kept time”), and dusk light is structurally crucial to the climax. The final image of the dark dome, harbor on the atlas, and scythe answering “with a thin, kind star” shows the setting actively charging closure. A touch more sense of physical movement in the space could deepen embodiment, but what’s here already functions at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is richly particular and fully integrated: the sapphire viaduct, salt scars, dripping joints, and harbor create a lived, constraint-heavy environment rather than a backdrop. The physical arrangement of stones, cracks, and water dictates tactics (where he crouches, how he hangs the bell, how he routes drips). Sensory detail—“breathing through damp cloth,” the bell’s “promise failing midword”—is vivid and always in service to mood and stakes. The recurring bell and sea imagery decisively charge the final harbor ripple, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drowned town, exposed foundations, rusted street corners, and “midnight ridgeway at twilight” are not just pretty—they directly constrain what’s possible (the drought enabling resurfacing, the ridge as gathering place). Recurring objects and micro-settings (wind chime, bell tower shoulders, grove stones like seats) return at the end to charge the final image. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through the warden’s professional and emotional lens (gauges, banks, levee), avoiding tourist cataloging. The mirrored hush of water and landscape supports the thematic tension between submergence and resurfacing with precise, economical strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard and waterfall are richly specific and not just decorative: the hidden orchard, prismatic waterfall, roots, and moods of light all directly shape the ritual’s steps. Objects-as-setting (reliquary, flame, crystal, ribbon) constrain choices and heavily charge the final images. Environmental details are filtered through Iri’s alchemist/mystic lens, avoiding a tourist catalog feel. The world’s rules stay consistent and are learned through how she works with birds, roots, and light rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arbor above the clouds is vividly realized and functionally integrated: platforms, rails, braided light, lantern colors, and the cradle all constrain tactics and communication. Environmental elements (cloud seams, vortex, pressure, rail, guide ring) directly shape how the narrator guides the ship and uses tools. The fantastical world’s rules are conveyed entirely through action and perception, no exposition dump. The final “ship kisses the cradle” and buckle-ringing images feel inseparable from this specific setting.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo, clouds “like slow rivers of breath,” bells in the sky, umber tiles, and rearranging statues create a richly particular, lived-in weird setting. The environment is not just decorative: “high air” and history rewriting charge the sense that choices here imprint reality, and the brain-on-altar plus static in their teeth directly shape perception and the final image. Details are economical but layered, with recurring elements (clouds, altar, tiles, courtyard) evolving as the conflict tightens. The only mild limitation is that the dojo rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way—it is more spiritual pressure than physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The annex and brook are exquisitely rendered and tightly integrated: the brook “whispers,” trades lines with Mara’s rehearsed pitch, and becomes a kind of silent interlocutor guiding her choices. The storm’s aftermath, damp planks, cedar and ozone, and the prop-shelf pot all feel tactile and specific, filtered through her designer’s eye. Crucially, the setting constrains decisions—she designs moon-phase admission, stoop debriefs, and limited crowds specifically to preserve this nocturnal haven. The final image (brook keeping the door’s shadow, seed keeping counsel) is charged by this environment, not merely framed by it.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is both setting and instrument, consistently shaping what is possible (sound must travel through it; it returns whispers “as a heavier twin”). Physical details—vents snaking to the basement, rain translated into “cymbals of tin and sorrow,” tunnel ribs grinding sorrow to pulp—are specific and charged. The environment constrains tactics (he can only reach the house via this tunnel) and decisively charges the final image as the tunnel teaches the city a new rhythm. World rules around sound and echo remain internally consistent in their magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frozen garden, mist, sundial, and pendant together form a coherent, pressuring environment rather than a backdrop; the boundary of light literally constrains where the living sunrise can go. Weather and ice actively matter (frostbitten reading, frozen shadow, future thaw) and mirror the thematic work without heavy-handedness. The setting evolves conceptually—from static frozen garden to a place that will thaw and melt its catalogue—shaping the final question about what the narrator will do then. The garden and its objects decisively charge the final image of carrying thresholds back into waking life.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus, furnaces, and ashbed are vividly realized through sensory detail (“air smells like warm pennies,” ashes “breathe out”) and consistently filtered through the alchemist’s sensibility. Environment is not just backdrop: the furnaces as “patient beasts,” the grate with “oldest coals,” and the ash column all actively shape what tactics are possible and how the ritual unfolds. The crozier and fire act as micro-setting objects that constrain and enable each choice, culminating in the gate forming from the ash’s column. The final image—embers whispering at his ankles, clear glassy blue ahead—derives its charge directly from these environmental specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is spectacularly specific and thoroughly integrated: towers as ribs, gorge as record, moon as needle, winds braiding advertisements into prayers. Environment constantly shapes metaphor and action—the climb, the gorge of signals, the mast-as-stylus, and the orchestra-pit transformation at the end all depend on this precise geography. World rules stay internally consistent in their surreal logic, and the final image is literally charged by setting (moon/perigee + gorge + mast). A tiny restraint: sensory range leans heavily visual and conceptual, with fewer grounded tactile constraints than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, from “when clocks run sideways” to the spectral grotto that literally enables the temporal ritual. Environmental details (dripping letters spelling “delay,” stars from different decades, wake lattices) both mirror and drive the stakes. The hourglass, pier, grotto, and tide all constrain choices and charge the final docking image. World rules stay internally consistent in a dreamlike mode and are learned through action rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly and economically realized—arches at odds with shadows, responsive tiles, a hall of infinite ladders—and always filtered through his and the curator’s purposes. The environment actively shapes options: rooms “study” visitors, perspectives obey their restraint, and the bridge can only exist within this mutable space. The recurring thread-object and the gallery together meaningfully charge the final image of unhooking the line and leaving the rooms changed. A slight bias toward visual imagery over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The benthic city, rippling ceilings, domes, basalt ridge, vents, and lamplight versus darkness are rendered with precise, original detail that feels fully lived in. Environmental constraints (no visible stars, pressure, light pollution in water) organically shape what navigation can mean here. The chain link functions as a micro-setting object that charges the narrator’s sense of gravity and constraint, though it doesn’t explicitly constrain a choice. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are exceptional and tightly integrated with premise and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the mist-clad atrium, fogged city, and gallery of unclaimed photographs all mirror and channel the story’s liminal work between living and dead. The environment and objects (especially the hearing aid and the photo gallery) actively guide choices, not just mood, as the narrator walks through fog and archives to find the man. Details like “glass that remembers every face” and the guard “mouth open like an exit” deepen tone without stalling momentum. The only modest limit is that the atrium itself, though striking in the opening, becomes more atmospheric than constraining once we move into the gallery.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cave, tide, and facility are rendered with vivid, POV-filtered detail—“crashing hush,” “air seams,” “brine-wet racks tilted like pews”—that all bear on what she can physically do. Environment and micro-setting actively constrain choices: the squeeze and limited air, the lock’s reliance on freezing brine, and the tidal clock all shape tactics. The recurring physical world (sea pressure, cables, ice seal) charges the final image of “the sea took a long breath,” reweighting what “between tidal changes” has meant. There’s no white-room moment; every important action is grounded in space and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal observatory under snow is vivid and specific, with sensory detail (“milky colors smoldering beneath rime,” snow “like fine ash”) filtered through a working familiarity with the equipment. Setting and objects (dome, slit, eyepiece, dish, frost) constrain tactics: the shard scrapes ice, the slit admits light to activate the ink patterns, and the dish alignment is the pivotal act. Weather and architecture shape tone and choice, culminating in the charged final image of the dome gleaming as the narrator watches “for a wiser kind of dark.” The environment feels lived-in rather than postcarded.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is not ornamental; it is the archive, the reader of stories, and the constraint that forces quiet articulation and tactile translation. Environmental elements (the echo-tunnel, storms, drought, bone towers) shape tactics and options at every stage, culminating in the canyon-as-school where the language now “travels.” The flawed diamond and birds operate within this physical grammar in a way that feels inseparable from place. The final image of the canyon’s tunnel becoming a school charges the entire setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underground garden is richly specific and omnipresent—breathing like a whale, swinging bulbs, Braille-reading roots, drain as lung—and it directly shapes action (doors jamming, seedlings moving, the vertebrae staircase). Environment constrains choices: the investigation is bound to the night, the drain is the only path downward, and the garden’s appetite for bitterness defines the stakes. Setting details evolve with events (bulbs’ rhythm changes, floor inhaling/exhaling, staircase appearing) and charge the final image of the narrator staying on as keeper. This is elite-level atmospheric worldbuilding, only shy of perfection because one or two dense images flirt with overload.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is unusually vivid and functional: sky-bridge, fog, mechanical city, orchard, and statues all constrain choices and directly shape tactics (playing “resonantly soft,” using height, the statues’ halos reacting to sound). Environmental details evolve with the action—halos guttering, copper leaves falling, branches shifting toward people—and culminate in a charged final configuration that reweights the whole world. The locust shell and bridge work as micro-settings/tools that charge key beats and the ending image. World rules feel consistent within the fable-like frame.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: alleys where “maps hold their breath,” the smuggling drones, the battery-polluted creek, and the cobalt arcade all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental danger (drones, bullets, checkpoints) and micro-settings (Mina’s doorway, the jar on her table, the arcade at twilight) shape tone and implicitly constrain choices. World rules are consistent and learned via action, not exposition. The final image of the cobalt arcade and brittle hush is powerfully charged by everything established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The abandoned circus train, weed-cracked siding, generator car, and hidden water tank are vividly rendered and always tied to action. Setting details (bells between couplers, breached water tank, menagerie car) directly shape choices and realizations, especially the oasis that redefines the problem from power to voice. Recurring objects (halo fragment, bells, mist) charge the final image and closure. The environment feels singular, lived-in, and thematically aligned without lapsing into mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scientific poetry library is richly, specifically realized—Mandelbrot napkin, Hawking-as-psalms, meteorite-and-oak desk, seabed shelves—with a coherent math/poetry/weather lexicon. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: shelving “by negative curvature” and the “saddle of space” literally enable travel, while patrons and stacks constrain how far she can go. Recurring material objects (scarf, meteorites, wet paper, salt/snow) fuse setting with thematic work in the final images. The world’s rules are fantastical but self-consistent, taught gradually through action and perception rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering archipelago, library, palette, and sea are exquisitely realized and always filtered through the narrator’s vocation (“odd-hour librarian,” “margins filled with salt”). Setting actively shapes options: causeways, fishermen, and sea all mediate pursuit, and the library-atlases-photographs triad becomes the functional stage for reconfiguring the dream into maps. Environment and objects explicitly charge the final image—the palette, plates, archipelago-breathing around windows—and constrain what “keeping” can be. The world feels both specific and rule-consistent while remaining dreamlike, which is difficult to achieve at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is unusually vivid and purposeful, especially the courtyard of broken mirrors that reorient toward a star and later form a “cathedral” that remembers swallowed whispers. Environment and recurring objects (mirrors, twilight, sky) are not decorative—they actively shape the ritual and charge the final image. Spatial and sensory specificity (“weir of shadows,” “paved with broken mirrors”) are consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The world’s magical rules are coherent enough for this length and never confuse the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and encircling shipwrecks are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action: slack tide, the hatch, the ring in seagrass, and the groaning wrecks all shape what she can do and when she must stop. Details are deeply filtered through her folklorist’s eye (fungi as cataloguers, glass as constellations), which keeps the description purposeful. The environment directly constrains the climax as tide and blurred mirrors close her window. This is immersive and functional setting work at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten library, playground, swing, and bottled dusk form a rich, coherent spatial and atmospheric web; they’re not mere backdrop but embodiments of suspended, fragile memory. The library’s physicality (dust, stacks, floorboards) and tools (kettle, chipped bowls, mirrors) actively shape how persuasion occurs. The corridor of shadow literally rearranges the space at the climax, charging the act of underlining margins and the story’s final stillness. This is exemplary environmental integration, only shy of perfect because external physical constraints on choice remain mostly symbolic rather than materially binding.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exquisitely realized: the parapet, waterfall, mossed stone, and orchard are not just decorative but define the nexus “where worlds already greet each other,” directly shaping the choice of planting site. Sensory detail is dense yet purposeful, with water, mist, stone, and flagstones all returning to charge the final image. Environment and recurring objects (parapet, crack between stones, mist) clearly constrain action and meaning at the end, though the luxuriant description occasionally verges on over-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “prism sanctuary under starlight” is richly realized and integral: prisms, ladders of moonlight, iron stair, ancient net, and responsive floor all directly shape what can happen. The environment constrains tactics (they must climb to the net, work in that precarious high space, operate within a room that can be “drunk” of sound) and charges key images, especially the final folding of the ladders back into night. World-rules (silence as dew, prisms as stitched light) stay consistent and are learned through action. Description is dense but purposeful, always tied to the ritual at hand.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are superb: the “hills beyond the ancient henge,” “rain-scoured fresco vault,” and “chamber of peeled saints” create a vivid, coherent world filtered through the narrator’s professional eye. The environment is not just decorative; the architecture of the slit that “drew storms through stones so softly that words folded into it” literally generates the whispered effect and shapes the mystery’s resolution. Weather, stone, and damp also echo the thematic concern with slow, patient change and erasure. The only ceiling here is that the henge itself, while evocative, functions more as mood than as a true constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The underwater library is vividly, specifically rendered (snow globes, swelled logbooks, algae-coated globes, fish-chewed latitude lines) and consistently filtered through a professional-diver/archivist gaze. Environment constrains action—rope line, current misreading posture, air gauge—and charges the final image of ascent and relinquishment. The snow globe and ship both function as micro-settings whose physical states embody memory and decay (“salt had started to learn the alphabet of ruin”). Setting and objects meaningfully shape choices and theme rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds” and storm-charged infrastructure are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory specificity across taste, sound, and touch (“a hum that tasted of rain and charged brass”). Setting meaningfully constrains action: the buried wires, antenna post, and vents shape how the ghost can speak and how people can respond, and the courtyard-as-body metaphor culminates in the lungs/veins/heart map. The recurring plate and storm environment directly charge the final image of the courtyard “hovering like a lung between two breaths.” Minor limitation: the larger city remains stylized rather than textured in detail, keeping the world just shy of fully immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire, elevator “throat,” scattered shaft light, and niches punched into ice form an integrated, tactile environment that continuously shapes action and meaning. Light through ice and goggles literally enables reading the cipher, and the shelves in frozen walls concretize the theme of preserved, suspended pain. Weather and altitude inflect detail (“above the clouds,” “airship scars on the ice”) and help charge the final image. The world feels both coherent and symbolically rich without collapsing into abstract allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular: salt flats under dusty starlight, a rustling balloon skin, instruments swaying, line like “veins,” and the brass telescope catching “a seam of starlight.” Details are tightly POV-filtered through an aviation meteorologist and grieving child of a navigator, so environment and tools (telescope, line, radio) are never generic. The gondola’s suspension and the sky-city metaphor tangibly shape how she thinks and acts, even if they rarely constrain tactics in a survival sense. The recurring objects and textures charge the final images, especially the line humming them back and the telescope set aside as she turns to the log.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly specific—rings, grain, resin-locked coin, dust, shelves—and setting details are always action-linked (reading rings with the coin, painting directly on bark). The condemned-building context and hush of workers, pigeons, and radio-checked foreman create a palpable atmosphere that shapes urgency and tactics. The environment constrains choices (no windows, demolition clock, the hollow that ultimately protects the mural) and directly charges the final image of dawn still glowing after the collapse. Sensory detail is rich but selective, always filtered through the artist’s tactile, pressure-based perception.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The airship, sky lanes, stranded luminance, and town below are vividly and economically rendered, with details like kettle, rigging, and halos integrated into action rather than tacked on. Environment genuinely constrains choices: steering arcs, rope play, and altitude all matter to navigating the light. Recurring objects (dog-ear, hopscotch board, instruments) are embedded in setting and help shape the tactical solution and final image. The only limit keeping this from higher is that physical constraint and danger remain more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “frozen library above clouds,” hall of mirrors, and low-tide reading room are intensely specific and sensorial, with cold, rime, and thaw affecting his tactics (softening gloves, cedar warming the glass). Setting is consistently filtered through his craft and sea-memory obsessions, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. Environmental details evolve—ice to water to window to harbor-like room—and the final thawing creak of the library recharges earlier boat/harbor imagery. The world’s logic is intentionally surreal yet internally consistent, and the environment clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard planet with floating rock arches, moss paths, hammock settlements, and air-river is richly specific and tightly integrated into action (the shard-strike, rope work, stranded families, and the final procession). Environmental constraints drive tactics—ropes, ladders, rafts, air currents—and the arches and nebula explicitly charge the closing images. Details like the mothweed-and-thyme garden and chalk on pressed moss feel lived-in rather than decorative. Only a hair more tactile immediacy during the high-stakes rescue (body weight, vertigo, physical fear) would deepen the already-strong setting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hidden lighthouse, the sea, the pane of hush, and the intricate mechanism are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the narrator’s perception and role. Environmental features directly constrain action: the hush lens swallows thunder, the beam alters riots, and the machinery’s fragility forces careful, embodied maintenance. Recurring objects (the puppet head, the pane, the gears) evolve in meaning and charge the final image of resting a hand on the machine. The setting is integral to both the plot logic and the thematic weight of caretaking time at the world’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, specific, and integrated: mechanical birds, salt-drinking trees, cliff paths, and frost all constrain tactics and mood rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental rules (shifting geometry, frost making paths lie, patrol arcs) are consistent and directly shape choices, especially the careful stepping and time pressure. The lost city/blueprint layer gives the place a memory that deepens both atmosphere and strategy (lichen map, stone corridor that “remembered being a street”). This is publish-ready level; the only marginal limiter is that the physical danger of the labyrinth is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    The braided ravine, river foam, reeds, alder shade, and swallows are not mere backdrop but the primary engine of perception and insight. Environmental details are always filtered through her scientific/symphonic mind, with the river’s braiding and pH shifts mapping directly onto the envisioned copolymer design. The chrysalis functions as a micro-setting object that constrains thought and charges the final image when she vows to bring it into every meeting. The atmosphere of damp, misted grief and precise natural imagery deeply underwrites both theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “glass orchard library floating upon a swirling sea of clouds” is not just decorative; its glass trunks, cloud sea, vellum door, and hush-vault all actively stage and constrain the protagonist’s journey and options. World rules (moonlight revealing intention, beginnings kept like seeds, access via quantified absence) are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. Environmental objects drive the key turn (glass apple + hinge contour in the air) and charge the final return to the counter and sign. The setting’s specificity and atmosphere are tightly braided with the premise of selling “beginnings shaped like blanks.”

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is gorgeously specific and integrated: desert fortress after rain, puddles as maps, dunes opening a “throat,” and a coral pavilion of frozen remorse. Environmental features constrain choices—the rain creates the puddles that guide them, the desert/sea dissonance charges the pavilion, and the kitchen tools provide the means of transformation. Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, with smells, textures, and temperatures all tied to memory and emotional charge. This is very near top-tier, docked only because the broader world beyond the fortress remains intentionally hazy rather than fully dimensional.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exemplary: the astronomical clock, silos, grain elevator, and cuckoo weight all recur as functional, not decorative, elements that shape tactics and imagery. Spatial and mechanical details (catwalks, leg house, hoist controls) are specific enough to feel lived-in while serving the metaphor of connection. The environment constrains choices—bridges from parapet to silo, catwalk stages, lantern lines—and the final image of the town as a “chorus” depends on this built geography. This is publish-ready atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The moonlit canyon is richly particular and fully integrated: mica, limestone shelves, tremors, and cold seams all mediate how memory-work unfolds and literally “amplify” the entangled dreams. The canyon’s behavior (quakes, opening seam) both mirrors and drives internal shifts, and the final walk back along “the canyon’s breath” recharges the opening image. Environmental details are filtered through the engineer’s technical-poetic gaze, avoiding tourist listing. This is excellent, but I’m keeping it just under 9 because the environment shapes the ritual and tone more than it constrains concrete choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, pollen, relic stalactites, crowns, and safes are exquisitely specific and tightly integrated with action; this is not backdrop but an active mechanism and metaphor. Rules (gravity inversion, impossible rooms, pollen as collapsed alphabet) stay internally consistent and are learned via tactile engagement. Environment constrains choices (one-hour tilt, crowns that may or may not fit, spatially “unwrapping” chambers) and charges the final image through the breathing map and the city’s locks subtly shifting behavior. Rich lyric density never quite devolves into a tourist catalog; nearly every concrete detail is doing thematic or structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grove is exquisitely realized—alder trunks that “breathe,” dew-lit hedgerow, broken telegraph line, the nearly-silent rain—all filtered through the sculptor’s attention. Setting isn’t decorative: the trees’ fibers and roots literally provide the instrument’s body, and the insulator hung in the grove charges the final image with ongoing potential if wind returns. The environment’s silence and stillness actively shape tactics (small motions, whisper-register sound) and reinforce theme. A slight restraint in figurative layering could elevate clarity even further, but as-is this is publication-ready atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The magnetic nexus, monoliths, and humming field are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the chess tutor’s sensibility. Setting is not decorative: the magnetic field constrains choices (they need the nexus and the hollow), and the environment literally responds to the ritual (“the humming resolved into quiet chords”). The basalt stone and hollow operate as micro-setting objects that directly shape the climax and the ending image. Twilight and the shifting light carefully mirror the reconfiguration from noisy exile to charged quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “shadowed workshop,” the graphite sky, and the fireworks hush create a strongly textured, coherent micro-world filtered through an acoustician’s sensibility. Tools-as-setting (copper bowl, reed, mothwing microphone, clasp) aren’t mere props; their physical behaviors shape tactics and the climax. The town’s quiet and later thunder are environmental pressures that charge both the ritual and the final image. A hair more constraint from the physical space itself (beyond mood) would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    The treetop village, swaying bridges, and rope-convergence heart are vividly specific and always filtered through the herbalist’s wind-and-scent consciousness. Setting is not postcard: the hung homes, trembling bridges, and rope junction literally dictate where the seed must be planted and what’s at stake. Environmental conditions (wind hush, canopy currents, “turning of the tide’s thought”) directly shape when and how decisions are made. The final steadied bridges and communal breath are charged by all this accumulated spatial and sensory groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, original, and tightly integrated: the inverted gravity, floating arches, water-as-road, and hollow boulder grove all shape movement and possibility, not just aesthetics. Details are strongly filtered through the pilot’s professional lens (navigating by water flow, attention to roots, sap, and orchards), giving the world a lived-in specificity. The environment directly constrains choices (must move with water, within the inversion hour) and charges the final image of planting the fused heart beneath the drum. A slight risk of descriptive saturation remains, but clarity holds and the world never feels like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    The port, container maze, grain silos, and wind canyons are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail, always filtered through a professional, aerodynamic eye. Environment is not backdrop: the container rows aligning with the boulevard and silos literally create the lethal dust devil and then the safe corridor, directly constraining options. Small objects-as-setting (patch, ribbon tape, charcoal, broken glass) are functional as tools and as charged images. The closing sense of the harbor “reassembling its orders” is earned by everything we’ve learned about how this place channels force.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern and aurora are exquisitely realized and thoroughly functional: the aurora is a metronome, the ice conducts and reshapes under sound, and the “blue ice that glowed with buried starlight” literally supports the bell. Setting details are consistently filtered through the synesthetic POV, enriching both atmosphere and world logic. Environmental changes (cavern architecture rearranging, aurora slowing to a “mirrored lake”) track causally with the ritual’s progress. The final spread of hush as “common air” is thematically charged but slightly less concretely tied back to the cavern’s physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, and the memory-stones-and-storms ecology are richly specific and always filtered through his professional eye, creating a tangible, idiosyncratic world. Setting actively shapes action: the seam lies where thunder echoes turn corners, silence makes the flute’s notes a probing tool, and the driftwood-on-talus practice translates into the market. The flute as tool-object and the environment’s acoustics both constrain choices and charge the final image of a knit seam and a breathing market. A slight expansion of how physical geography complicates his navigation in the market itself could push this into even higher territory.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The letterpress shop, the halo fragment, and the observatory across the alley are vividly realized and tightly integrated. Setting is never postcard-like; it’s always functional—the press, halo, and star-maps concretely mediate how emotion becomes text. The environment directly charges the ending image (vanished star, open door, fragment on the sill) and frames the ethical stakes of “editing” cosmic grief into human grief. Spatial orientation (workshop vs. observatory vs. night sky) remains crisp throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, humming like a tuning fork, is not decorative: its vibration and “low green note” literally enable the ritual and then charge the final image of the world’s “great heart.” Environmental detail is filtered tightly through the courier’s sensibility, with recurring green/sap/old wood imagery that parallels continuance. The ridge’s rules—responding to breath, seeds, and pitch—remain consistent and shape tactics throughout the scene. The closing sense of walking on a throbbing spine of the world makes the setting indispensable to both magic and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quartz arbor in mist, the hoarfrosted car, and the prism are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action rather than decorative. Environment and object genuinely constrain and enable choices: they can only perform this ritual where frost, glass, and the arbor’s “listening” geometry intersect, and the arbor amplifies the prism at the climax. Recurring objects (prism, frost, car window) charge the final movements and closure image. A slight cap remains because the physical setting shapes mood and method more than it imposes hard practical constraints or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard, bamboo forest, and dead river are richly specific and consistently filter through Kio’s perception, giving the piece a lived, uncanny geography. The setting constrains options (no road, dead river) and actively charges the final images (the fabric drifting up pear rows, along the river wound). Objects-as-setting—loom, amber, puzzle edges—are tightly integrated into the environment rather than floating symbols. This is very close to exemplary, only shy of perfect because some late-world elements (frogs keeping a lighthouse) feel more atmospheric than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard planet and floating arches are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the arches’ looming presence, their settling during the bargain, and the final image of bells hung on them all charge the environment with meaning. Abandoned mine shafts and terraced orchards directly shape tactics and imagery (arteries of a new heart, roots weaving ladders), making setting a functional constraint rather than a backdrop. World rules around stone, roots, silk, and gravity remain consistent and are learned through action. The only thing holding this just shy of perfection is that sensory range leans heavily visual and conceptual, with fewer tactile or auditory anchors before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    The repair bay and its sensory palette (ozone, rain, sleeping coolant, chains that are chains/snakes in other strands) are rich, specific, and consistently filtered through a scent-obsessed consciousness. Setting is not decorative: the bay itself “keeps better records than prideful silence,” the terminal and shard interface drive the key discovery, and the unlocked bay across differences in the ending image embodies the reconfigured stakes. The micro-setting of the terminal, chains, and fuel system constrains what she can know and how she can act. World rules around the spaceport and equipment are sketched economically yet feel coherent with the emotional and thematic needs of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, storm, and stone-stacked shoreline are vivid, economical, and always filtered through the keeper’s priorities. Environment constrains and enables choices: the failed lamp forces the candle improvisation, the haunted room “listening for oars” affects how she reads the packet, and the shoreline’s reach determines where she places the final stones. Micro-setting objects (sea glass, stones, candle) are charged and return to weight the ending. The atmosphere—“room above me remembered every shipwreck,” “fog swirled like breath around a sleeping child”—is consistent without feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and fully integrated: emerald-glass tower, satellite-hummed horizon, antenna-cluttered sea, phosphor-printed bodies—all rendered through the keeper’s working attention. The lighthouse’s architecture and materials (recycled bottles as bones, the glass wick, total internal reflection) aren’t just pretty; they dictate how the protagonist acts and how “news” can still be made and sent. The environment constrains and enables every meaningful beat, including the child’s drawings on the lamp room glass and the storm’s editing. It also charges the final image, where the sea “kept printing us,” making the world itself part of the thematic engine rather than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house, rope bridge, paper windows, and sun rivers are intensely specific and consistently filtered through the dye master’s sensibility. Environment and recurring objects (wing, light, ropes) genuinely constrain tactics: who sits where, when stories accrete, how the narrator can intervene. The setting’s rules—floating, moorings, sun trails—remain stable and are learned by doing rather than exposition. The final image of standing “where the colors are almost colors” is charged directly by this environmental logic, satisfying the object-as-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    The stormlit tower, labyrinth, chains, root, and trees are not backdrop but active pressures: weather charges the mood and triggers the sextant’s reactions; the labyrinth’s noises and hushing direct attention; the root’s breach of the wall literally opens the archive. Tools and micro-setting (tea spoon, ledger, pocket knife, small wrench) are integrated into action, making the environment feel lived-in and constraining what’s possible. World rules—trees as witnesses, tower as archival machine, moonlight as restorative—stay consistent and culminate in the dawn image where the environment reweights the entire piece. The specificity of details (e.g., “rusted to the sharpness of sugar,” “silvered vines” of chains) is high without feeling touristic.

    The “alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night” is richly concrete and structurally crucial: it supplies both problem (endless night, dying realm) and resource (regret-distilling trees, nursery, mica window). The mica window’s evolution from barrier to loom to covenant is an excellent example of setting-object reweighting that charges the final image. Environmental rules (mirror world, regret-fruits, woven dawns as literal light) remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. Minor deduction only because the wider world beyond the greenhouse remains impressionistic, though this barely touches the core scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the stationery shop, hidden corridor, and “municipal reading room” that warms with time all mirror the shift from shame to gentler understanding. The Order of Nestled Paradoxes and the practice of shelving books in opposites directly shape the action (reading Mistake and Wisdom together) and embody the story’s logic. Environmental details like dust “like waiting thoughts” and the city that can “hold you without knowing you” charge the final image rather than serving as postcard description. Space is coherent and tactically relevant without over-explaining world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    The courtyard and secret tea house are vivid, sensorial, and inseparable from the emotional arc—thorns, nettles, moss, lattice, lacquer, rafters all filter through this particular consciousness. Setting actively guides choices: the overgrowth invites “guerrilla gardening rather than conquest,” the hidden path and doorway enable the central encounter, and the cracked sill and garden seams become the site of crumb-offering and seed-planting. Seasonal framing (after birds fly south, sky thinking of snow) and the imagined spring return of birds charge the final image. Environment and recurring objects (bread, tea, ivy) decisively shape the ending’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “frozen library above clouds” is brilliantly specific and omnipresent, with cold, height, and weather all shaping what’s possible (isolation, icicles, hoarfrost, cloud corridors). Tools and environment—the lantern, glass slides, frost, shelves—are inseparable from how vows are read and filed. The final image of the library exhaling and the constellations rearranging is charged precisely because the setting has been so concretely established. There’s little dead description; almost every environmental detail is doing thematic or tactical work.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is richly specific—the “pier breathed,” lantern light like nerves, limes rolling “bright as moons”—and consistently filtered through Lark’s sensibility. Setting rules (the hush, the under-pier space, the river watch) are implicit yet stable and shape what tactics are possible. Environmental elements (unstable crates, limes, tight quarters, the river watch presence) directly affect the central turn. The recurring watch fob and the pier’s breathing bookend the piece, charging the atmosphere right through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integrated: “lavender bluff under aurora,” forests holding elections with glowing spore-ballots, and weatherbearers gathered like seated constellations all feel lived-in and strange in a coherent way. Environment and micro-objects (ring, sensors, spores, aurora) don’t just decorate; they help define the rules of the world and charge the final images of quorum and return. The bluff and valley frame the action and reappear at closure, giving spatial and emotional symmetry. A small limitation is that physical constraints of place (terrain, distance, danger) don’t much pressure choices beyond mood and spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, from the greasy frame on the boardwalk wall to the “subterranean crystal cave” where every facet holds remembered faces. Environmental details are tightly filtered through the artist’s perception—light, texture, and material (charcoal, mineral air, damp) all matter to what can be done. The cave is not postcard scenery; its crystals literally participate in the solution when the sketch on the crystal helps realign the lock’s tumblers. The final image of a “world like a painting with something behind it” fuses setting with theme, charging the environment as an ongoing metaphor for hidden depth and obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is intricately bound to every choice: leaf-post instead of paper, tunnels versus masked couriers, cloches sealing, jars preventing a metaphorical flood of lies, and the toxic exterior making this interior economy of truth feel like survival engineering. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action (postal routes, vents, condensate) rather than exposition. The final rain of released words literally feeding the lettuce and “the tired” charges both environment and theme in the last image. The only minor limitation is that broader civic mechanics remain suggestive rather than fully mapped, though that suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    The bluff, clouds, sculptures, and shard are exquisitely rendered and inseparable from the story’s logic. The altitude, weather, and remoteness shape who can reach Iri and how counsel is given, while the environment literally participates in the music (wind, sun angle, powdered ice). The iceberg fragment as a recurring object anchors the world’s rules and charges the final image of her sleeping with it “cradled in ropes.” Setting is not decorative; it constrains possibility and embodies theme, especially in the contrast between the “polite museum” below and this weather-driven ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse dome and desert are not just backdrop; they constantly pressure choices (limited, fragile environment; glass, pumps, shifting magnetic north) and shape the tactic of a tiny contained burn. Details like “radio of empty frequencies hissing where oceans used to pour” and mineral roses “daggering toward the paths” are vivid and deeply POV-filtered. The environment’s constraints (glass, heat, water systems, mineral roses) drive both the crisis and the specific solution. The final image—dome creaking, sand as a “sleeping giant,” roses gleaming—beautifully recharges the setting with thematic significance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    The courtyard, mailbox, thrift shop, and encroaching vans are vividly concrete and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, turning environment into a soft but real pressure field. The mailbox, locket, and hairpin function as tools/objects-as-setting that actively constrain options and shape tactics, especially in the unlocking scene. Textural details (“sandstorm calm,” hibiscus shadows, bougainvillea, sandal scuffs) deepen mood without feeling like a catalog. The final image of the unlocked mailbox and dawn gatherings makes physical setting inseparable from the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken lab is vividly and economically rendered—“Rust sighed in the beams, and silver fish stitched between consoles”—and its conditions (flooded tiles, silt, cameras, currents) directly shape tactics (dance on the floor as ‘page,’ water as accomplice, cabinets draining). The Warden Current and “archival lungs” make the environment itself antagonistic, not just scenic. The final image of the rigging’s “spider” web humming with liberated voices charges prior environmental motifs (web, tide, pressure) into a resonant closure. Nearly every descriptive choice filters through the narrator’s sensibility and serves both mood and mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The harbor, whale, docks, and salt crystal chamber are intensely specific and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, so worldbuilding never feels like static description. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables action: gravity pockets, hardened sand plates, and the listening salt chambers all dictate what can happen and how memories are accessed. Recurring objects-as-setting (lanterns, tin, crystals, whale body) explicitly charge the final image. The world’s rules are strange but internally consistent and learned through interaction rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is richly specific and fully integrated: the brook, moon, fox, alder, and stones are all active participants in the ritual rather than backdrop. The environment constrains and enables tactics—the mapping literally depends on current, foam, and reflective surfaces—and the final image (wing, brook, altered night) is inseparable from place. Details are consistently filtered through the summoner’s sensibility (grammar of water, “moon threw a ladder upon the brook”) and evolve as the conflict shifts. The nocturnal haven’s rules (sound as “smoothed hush,” code in stones/fireflies) stay stable and do meaningful world-building at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is exceptional: the stairwell, hallway, and rooftop garden are all deeply particularized and consistently filtered through the narrator’s obsession with buildings as linguistic bodies. The meteor shower and rooftop stones actively charge the final act of pressing the seal, turning environment into ritual apparatus rather than backdrop. World rules around buildings “keeping weather” and lies remain internally consistent and learned through action, not exposition. This environment palpably constrains perception and meaning, even if it doesn’t impose physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden, fountain, twilight sky, and moths are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action rather than postcard detail. Setting rules (the last star, the caretakers’ saying) and objects (fountain, hedges, shell) shape what can happen and when, directly charging the closure as dawn “unfolded its pale script.” The environment’s tone—velvet, bruised sky, ghostly moths—mirrors the story’s liminal emotional state without over-signaling. The garden’s relief and “closing its letter” at the end make the place an active participant in the narrative’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites are vividly rendered and recur as functional elements: the aurora activates the key, the sanctuary “accepts only patient trespass,” and the stalactites set the tempo for writing. Setting and object-as-setting charge the final images of leaving, dripping, and “letters breathe” with clear atmospheric and thematic weight. Detail is highly selective and filtered through the forger’s aesthetic and ethical sensibility. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that environmental constraints rarely force specific tactical adaptations beyond pacing and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, reeds, and water are not postcards; they are active participants in meaning, answering questions through physical manifestations (silt crown, reeds as pages, stone holding breath). The whispering shell and the water form a recurring micro-setting, constraining how Lio can access truth and charging the ending when the pot song returns through them. Sensory detail is lush yet pointed—“lights from distant camps pebble the dark,” “wind combs the reeds”—and always filtered through Lio’s vocation. The final promise to the water is inseparable from this environment; a different setting would break the piece’s logic and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    The glacier shrine, black water, wreck, and candles are rendered with exceptional specificity and mood; details like “portholes I cut into the ice” and “breath makes halos” feel both concrete and thematically charged. Environment constrains tactics—ice windows, cold, depth, darkness—and the melted snow globe as object-setting becomes the narrative’s hinge and its closing image. The world’s rules remain consistent across the liminal space between dreams, shrine, and wreck. Setting is inseparable from theme and action; this story could not exist anywhere else without breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exquisitely specific: the wet parapet, moonlit stones, gutters, moss, and stalls all filter through the narrator’s craftsman-philosopher eye. Environment dynamically shapes action—the wet stones and runoff are what the demonstration is literally about, prompting the councilor to use his sash and others to scrub moss. Recurring objects (parapet, bowl, whisk, fireflies) charge the final image and are inseparable from the thematic argument. This is elite-level atmosphere and integration, only capped by the global 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard under radioactive dust and the packing shed with the diamond are vivid, tactile, and consistently consequential—weather and resonator physics literally shape survival. The recurring image of fruit “like stubborn lanterns” and the dust storms constrains choices and charges the final image of a held storm and shining fruit. World rules around the resonator and microbes are clear enough to feel plausible without bogging in exposition. This is elite-caliber setting work that fully integrates with plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, and town below are extraordinarily vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Weather and altitude directly shape action—antennae sprouting sparks, lightning-baptism, seeds flung into the storm—and the setting charges the final images of calendars, kites, and shifting allegiance. Details feel selective rather than touristic, with strong sensory texture (“cool nautical dusk,” “portable flag of silence”). This is publish-grade atmosphere; the only restraint is that physical constraints of the observatory never quite force a tactical dilemma at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The feral loft, dunes, jars on the sill, and beach gathering are sensuously rendered and inseparable from the story’s mechanics. Setting is not backdrop: wind, tide, and architecture literally drive events (the trapped note, the public ritual), and recurring objects (loft, jars, music box) explicitly charge the final image. The physical environment anchors the lyricism and keeps the magic plausible within its own rules. This setting could not be swapped out without breaking the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina, lighthouse interior, and Throat of Tides are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with character perception and action (“ice floes nudged the pilings like shy animals,” “stone crouched…like a patient lung”). The lighthouse and stone are not mere backdrop; they constrain tactics—the key, the lens room, and the sonic environment dictate how conflict can be engaged. Weather and sea recur to mirror and pressure the stakes, charging the final image of the sea accepting night and the lighthouse’s relieved beam. A hair shy of 9-band only because the physical environment never forces a hard, tactical constraint beyond mood and access.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and thematically integrated: the frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and magnetic viaduct all recur and shape behavior (work only begins after freezing; the viaduct as listening post; the sanctuary as school). Details such as “pebbles stuck to its rails as if they remembered the mountain” filter environment through the narrator’s sensibility and reinforce stakes about memory, patience, and change. The final image—teaching by the coals as the basalt warms and the revolution “stood”—is charged by all prior environmental groundwork. The physical world consistently constrains options and charges images rather than serving as decorative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subway tunnel is vividly material and constantly in play: third rail, drain grates, salt crust, air shaft, and the city’s “exhale” all shape what can happen. Environmental conditions after the drought directly cause the deaths (salt-locked drains) and frame the investigation’s logic. The lantern as object-setting constrains perception and choice, dimming the tunnel when lifted and mediating the entangled memories that push the narrator to act. The final image at the air shaft, with the lantern returned to the night while rain ticks above, recharges the setting as an active moral and emotional field.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The music box repair shop is vivid, tactile, and thematically charged (“shelves of wounded melodies”), and the prison setting contrasts it with institutional “soap and waiting.” Objects-as-setting (clockwork heart, bench lamp, chapel windows) meaningfully charge the final images—the repaired heart and storm-light become operational metaphors rather than décor. Weather and light are not generic; they affect how the chaplain conceives his tactic (“Bring a chair under it, tell him where to stand”). The only small limitation is that the prison environment could impinge a bit more concretely on what’s possible in the final booth scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “Gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea” is strikingly specific and threaded through: the fumes, boiling brine, steam, and acid air all affect imagery and even the rationale for “yearning as the only motor that started.” Tools and objects (cart, kaleidoscope, arrow tip, hinge) are embedded in the environment rather than overlaid on a void. The setting charges the final image (acid wind as applause, workshop laughing back), giving the environment an almost character-like role. It could influence tactical constraints even more directly, but at this length the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The social network archive, the deep vault, the Sink, and even the smell of old servers create a vivid, coherent digital-underworld atmosphere. Details are filtered through the archivist’s sensibility (content graph, node IDs, backups), giving the setting a strong POV bias. Environment and tools (access bots, the Sink ritual) materially shape tactics and options. Recurring objects—the flashlight metaphor and mission patch—charge the final image and meaningfully frame the world’s stakes around deletion vs. remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and fully integrated: “lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes” with lantern pears and biting floes creates a strong atmospheric and symbolic frame. Environment is not merely decorative; the floes and proposed beacon saplings directly shape the amends-plan, and the child’s death on the ice is the core shared wound. Details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, avoiding tourist listing while keeping the world’s rules legible. The final floe-splitting “like a page turning” elegantly charges the last movement, though one more concrete interaction with the physical peril in the present scene could have tightened the felt stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    The drift-ice marina is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: boats “knock together like knuckles,” ice has “seams” that must be sounded, and weather actively shapes what can be done. Environment constrains choices (tapping for weak ice, clearing plankways, preparing for storm) and charges the final images of walking the ridgeline and saluting with the parasol tip. The micro-settings of clinic, pontoons, and ridgeline are all filtered through the same sensibility, giving a consistent, atmospheric world. The setting is inseparable from the premise; moving this story elsewhere would collapse its logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    The vineyard, pavilion, lantern, vines, and gravel road are not postcard backdrops; they permeate action and metaphor (“vines bow like listening elders,” “vines accept it the way old couples accept weather”). The occupational and seasonal specifics (rootstock, grafting, pruning knife, off-season hush) shape how the sentinel thinks and how he advises, directly constraining the form of his help. The setting charges the ending, where the vines’ acceptance of wind parallels the characters’ acceptance of imperfect weather in love. The space is consistently lived-in and thematically loaded without feeling over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is strikingly specific and integral: the murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, dune skin, and whisperfield wind all constrain tactics (sanding the pavilion’s breath, reading the parapet, stitching lines across gusts). Environmental elements evolve with events—the parapet heaving at midday and settling “like an animal curling to sleep”—and the valley’s forgetfulness explicitly motivates the ritual repetition. The world’s rules (clearings, echoes, thresholds) are consistent and learned through action, and the final image of the echo resting against the ribs is charged by everything we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action and meaning—the corridor of photos runs through the rows, bees “stitch punctuation,” and factory skeletons become “watchful elders.” Setting consistently mirrors and reframes the town’s relationship with its industrial past, culminating in the narrator walking the ruins until “their shadows admit they are not monsters.” Environment constrains and enables tactics: the outdoor corridor, the field’s scent, and the ruins’ presence are inseparable from how the ritual works. This is exemplary scene-anchored atmosphere with purposeful specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shadowed library at dawn, the shelves, dust, and chandelier crystal create a rich, coherent atmosphere that perfectly suits the stakes around language’s “last dictionary.” Setting details are filtered through his scholarly, auditory bias (“dust becomes constellations of practiced neglect”; hush as “the staff”). The crystal and hush function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image and method of testimony, even if they don’t impose hard physical constraints. World rules (the end of new dictionaries, the crystal’s sonic memory) are cleanly taught through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fog sculpture garden, ruined museum, and tide are richly concrete and fully integrated into action: low tide enables access, fog guides him, and the rising water reorients his driftwood compass. Environmental details (barnacled eyelids, sandblasted glass, tapes unspooling) are not postcard decor but embodiments of decayed memory and recorded time. The tide’s physical effect on his markers tangibly constrains choices and catalyzes his path to the toppled head. The final image—unwatched tapes hushed while statues “remember” for him—charges the setting as an externalized, ongoing memory system beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar observatory above a cloud sea is vivid and specific, from cracked walls and a sighing pedestal to cooling lines that “breathed like a sleeping animal.” Setting directly shapes events: the quake-induced pier misalignment necessitates the narrator’s intervention, and the observatory’s altitude and equipment define what’s at stake (capturing a faint thermal tremor in the maria). Instruments and environment function as lived-in tools rather than décor, and recurring objects (chronometer, telescope, cloud sea, leaf memory) charge the final images. A hair less atmospheric saturation in places might sharpen, but the environment is deeply integrated and constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hospice wing “above the clouds,” the glowing corridors, and the window with clouds “like slow animals” create a specific, coherent atmosphere that frames every choice. Setting details are constantly used rather than merely observed: light pooling on the blanket, the radiator, the IV beeps, and the window’s clouds all become elements in the music and in the closing image. The shard and clementine function as micro-settings or tools, constraining touch and scent and literally reconfiguring the final tableau. The final image of light pooling “like a gentle river finding the sea” recharges the earlier atmospheric work and anchors closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and integrated: the floating isle as “patient lung,” the nocturnal observatory, utensil-haunted kitchens, and mirrors all shape how noon must be “lured” rather than naturally arrive. World rules (no true noon, night as calendar, the isle sighing through its gears) stay consistent and are revealed through action. Environmental elements meaningfully constrain tactics—the lack of sun demands shutters, mirrors, and contracts rather than simple observation. The only minor limit is that physical stakes tied to environment remain soft; the atmosphere is masterful but mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly drawn (“breathed mint and iron,” fountain muttering) and always filtered through the narrator’s craft-focused, skeptical lens. Setting constrains choice—Ari can hide here because of the forgotten door; the tooth and map can plausibly be found here—and the garden becomes the crucible where truth and bone are reset. Recurring environmental details (maze map as constellations, tooth under fountain stone, stars at the end) charge the final image without feeling over-signaled. The world’s faintly folkloric rules (changeling economies, town superstition) stay consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is outstanding: the serpentine grotto, mist, tide, and cliff stairs are sensorially precise and consistently filtered through the narrator’s purpose. The environment meaningfully supplies constraints and resources—the grotto’s mist, stones, and sea glass enable non-fire light, and the “grotto breath” literally feeds back into the village garland at the end. Recurring objects (sea glass, kelp fiber, shells, blackened beams) charge the final image rather than functioning as décor. The world feels lived-in and coherent without any museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly rendered through multiple senses and remains tightly filtered through the narrator’s perception, never feeling touristic. Crucially, the environment shapes tactic and closure: it is where they first met, where the icicle pattern guides steps, and where the pendant is literally grafted into the transformed “wound” of the floor. Details like “loam that tasted silicon once and tastes rain now” are precise, thematically charged, and instrumental to the final image. The setting’s rules and evolution stay consistent, and the garden/data center fusion charges nearly every major choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    The feral nexus in mist, braided river/road, and freight “iron hymns” are specific, sensuous, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s artistic preoccupations. Setting is not postcard background: the nexus and the contrary river literally stage the pact and shape options (enter the water vs. stay on the path; river vs. market road). The spiral shell as micro-setting/object links body to environment, “align[ing] with the secret spine of water” and charging the final images of doors and alternative lives. Weather and atmosphere (“mist,” “swirling hush”) actively affect perception and choice, not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The verdant arbor, wells, fields, and harvest moon are not mere backdrop; they’re active participants in the rite and visibly respond once the remedy takes, charging the world with agency. Details are selective and tactile (dew trembling into tone, wax growing wicks like “green tongues”) and consistently filtered through the communal/narrator’s reverent perception. Environmental conditions (the specific arbor, dawn, the harvest moon’s timing) meaningfully constrain when and how the ritual can succeed, giving the setting structural weight. The final image of the arbor’s “new calm” and the earth answering folds setting directly into closure, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater, the glassed-ash lip, and the frozen-but-breathing lake are vividly realized and consistently pressure what’s possible (cold, hush, immobility). Setting details are always doing double duty: ladders, wires, and labels as both detritus and mapping tools; the plate and fissure as anatomy (“borrowed vertebra”). World rules (frozen aurora, silent grid) are implied through concrete effects rather than explained. The environment materially constrains tactics and charges the final exhalation image, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The marble cavern, light shafts, water drips, brass prisms, and jars form a richly specific environment that is inseparable from the mechanism and from how sound behaves. Setting is not postcard decoration: the geometry of the cave and the timing of light directly inform his mapping, the placement of the timer, and the “harvest” itself, and the cellar at the end concretely extends that spatial logic into his later life. The sensory texture is vivid and controlled, with details like “veined column,” “white ribs,” and “noon beam shifted” doing thematic and functional work. A slight tempering of the constant figurative density could make the atmosphere feel even more effortless, but as-is it is near top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bronze grotto, river throat, and overlying “shingled” city are rendered with striking, specific sensory detail that remains tightly filtered through the narrator. The lamp, stone, ribs/whalebone, and thawing streets recur and evolve, charging both the ritual and the ending image. While the environment doesn’t overtly block physical choices, it does constrain and enable the ritual (the secluded grotto, the lamp’s modest “coin” of light), and its transformation at dawn mirrors the narrator’s internal shift. Description is dense but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The loft with its rain-beaded skylight, hanging ropes, and proximity to the circus yard is vividly rendered and deeply POV-filtered, with details like “ropes hang like molted skins” and rain “lenses” doing double duty as world and metaphor. Environment materially shapes tactics and images: the skylight and rain teach her the “hinge,” the kettle and bench define her ritual space, and opening the window at the end is a meaningful spatial action. Weather and objects recur in charged ways without feeling over-signaled. I’m holding just below 9 because while the setting clearly charges the ending, it constrains emotional choice more symbolically than logistically.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly original and specific—“a kinetic lagoon…a raft of turbines…ladders of wind”—and always filtered through the narrator’s scavenger sensibility. Environment and objects constrain choices: the lagoon houses eroded ambitions, the turbines become timekeepers, the carousel skeleton below represents a renounced path. The final movement, measuring minutes by turbine sighs and turning ambitions into “sand good for gardens,” shows the world actively reconfiguring options and charging the last image. A touch more concrete spatial anchoring amid the lyricism would be the only small upgrade left.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The spaceport terminal is vivid, specific, and functional: rain pooling in the ballroom, dark medbay, moldy archives, reversed escalator used to move heat—environment constantly shapes tactics. The carnival leavings (confetti in vents, chalk schedule over evacuation map) add layered history without feeling decorative. The sextant as a micro-setting/tool is smartly woven into navigation of the “maze of intentions” and charges the final image. This is very close to exemplary; a slightly wider sensory palette beyond visual and mechanical detail could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and thematically fused with the arc: the soundless sanctuary, open clock cases, and “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” all mirror his need for held, resonant silence. Environmental details aren’t postcard description; they actively guide his tactics (barefoot on wet crystal to “copy later into time,” not winding the clocks, using the sanctuary as a room “the world forgot to visit”). The sanctuary and forecourt recur in the final images, charging the closure—the “glacial hush” turning from marble to water under his ribs is both bodily and spatial. It stops short of a 9+ only because the environment shapes mood and practice more than it concretely constrains options.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canal, locks, and radio-silence dawn window are vividly realized and feel tactile, with details like slime-green seals and twilight ribboning along the water. Setting constrains tactics (needing the lock steps, chain, and boat) and underwrites the conspiracy mechanics (flood angles, transmitter sleep). The recurring environment—water, locks, maps—directly charges the final image of “the canal unfolded a truer city.” There are no spatial confusions; atmosphere and geography work in lockstep.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, golden dock under snow, fog, rope, and fulgurite glass are richly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s craft-obsessed lens. Setting is not mere postcard: the rope and glass are functional tools for reading memory, the amphorae sit among eelgrass roots, and the dock’s “ticking like a clock” subtly charges time and duty. Weather and environment (fog thickening, snow, ocean as midwife) support the meditative tension rather than obstruct specific actions. The only minor limitation is that physical constraints (cold, danger, logistics) never materially alter tactics; the environment is more spiritual than practical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor, garden, quince, cracked fountain, and palace thread create a fully inhabited, coherent world whose rules (slightly numinous, but consistent) are learned through action rather than exposition. The garden in autumn is not mere backdrop: the quince bruising, leaves as coins, and later quince-fall at her reading all charge the emotional weather and closure. The micro-objects (thread, teacup, deck chair, wolfshead prow) are sensorial and thematically loaded without feeling over-symbolic. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the environment rarely constrains concrete tactics; it mostly inflects mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vividly specific and fully integrated: the suspended palace, stalactites, chains, iron forests, and mills are not postcard details but active forces shaping acoustics, cradle design, and the climactic storm-sway. Environmental features directly participate in the plot—the chains’ tremor, the rose window, lightning in the ravine, and the mills below all modulate pressure and enable the hatching. Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, consistently filtered through the prince’s sensibility (mechanical vs. feathered beauty). The final images of vines on iron and rust growing petals are charged payoffs to the earlier world-building, reweighting the entire environment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: dunes, obsidian lagoon, kelp, salt, cooled lava, and gulls as “pale runes” all shape tone and ritual rather than acting as backdrop. The lagoon’s properties (obsidian skin that sings when clouds move) directly motivate her visit and structure the key listening moments. Objects-as-setting—the coin, red thread, black sand—are deeply embedded in how she navigates both environment and emotion. The final station images (coin above the door, sand by the hose rack) carry the environment back into her daily world and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The city of forgotten fountains is rendered with vivid, specific, and consistently purposeful detail: dry basins, tiled fish, bronze eyelids, lime-streaked statues all carry thematic and atmospheric weight. Setting constrains action (breadcrumbs on pavement, fountains as loci of memory) and directly shapes tactics via the box and the plazas. The recurring environment of drains, tiles, and fountains strongly charges the final image of walking “in the city of forgotten fountains.” A slight check is that sensory range leans heavily visual, but the integrated world-building is nonetheless excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nebula garden is vividly and consistently rendered—petals, mist, sonar, ships’ heat—and its rules materially constrain choice (no flame; light must be resonance). Details are always filtered through the gardener’s sensibility, keeping the world from feeling like a neutral backdrop. The setting actively shapes tactics (petal-rain, echo-corridors, cool glow) and charges the final image of the narrator remaining “among the falling petals, counting again.” The only limitation is that spatial stakes remain poetic rather than sharply choreographed around a concrete, time-bound risk.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient greenhouse is exquisitely realized and always functional: glass ribs, condensation “planets,” broken vents, cracked roof, and lettuce beds all shape mood and behavior. It constrains choices (a protected, ritual space where grief is processed; the hush that carries the mother; butterflies testing the roof and landing on words) rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental shifts—the storm that “tests the roof,” the migrating butterflies, the ash gold evening—track the emotional arc and the passage of time. The space charges the final image, even if the kite itself is on stone rather than in air, by having taught us to read controlled calm and fragile shelter as the condition for this work.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    The harbor, leaning clock tower, and “tidal obsidian ridge” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through his craft and guilt. Environment and objects actively constrain and charge choices: salt-scarring, tides, and the fragile pause of the pendulum define what’s possible in the adjustment scene. The ridge is more than backdrop; it swallows confessions, returns “mirror shards of night,” and answers the tower’s bells at the end, making the final image deeply located. The broken rake handle as a tide-smoothed tool of repair functions as micro-setting and is integral to both mechanism and ethical work.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt silo, cemetery, asters, poplar, and tapestry form a striking, coherent environment whose details are filtered through the gardener’s sensibility and grief. Setting is not postcard: the silo’s metal “listening,” the earth carrying echoes, and the sovereign case as a provisional grave marker all constrain tactics and charge the final images. Sensory and atmospheric specificity is high without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, prism lamp, and modeling tools create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels idiosyncratic and lived-in. Environment is not postcard: the ice “rehearsing thaw” and the unfrozen oval the kingfisher finds directly shape the narrator’s thinking about fractures, hinges, and non-destructive paths. The final image of the “page [that] waits like ice” is charged by this setting history. A minor reason it doesn’t go higher is that physical constraints from the spire itself don’t overtly alter tactics beyond mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember alcove, brick bones, mist, ash, and radio glow form a dense, lived-in micro-setting that is constantly in play—she cloaks the glow, listens in the darkness, sweeps but “not to erase drafting,” sleeps by ember light. Environment both constrains (secrecy, isolation after the “story famine”) and charges the final image of the warmed floor and breathing dust. The atmosphere is vivid and purposeful without devolving into a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exquisitely integrated: the house, studio, and Vanishing Point Gallery each feel distinct yet thematically linked through dust, hush, and thresholds. The rocking chair and skylight function as micro-setting constraints that literally and symbolically shape the final image and the experience of visitors. Spatial progression through rooms, hallways, and the final chamber undercuts “safety” and pulls readers inward. Environmental detail always comes through the artist’s sensibility, avoiding tourist catalog while deeply charging the last scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sewer, sunken city, drowned library, and silt-choked gates are not just atmospheric but actively shape tactics and stakes, especially the forgotten dock and chalk-marked walls guiding the escape and timing the flood. Details like “mussel shelf like a gold tooth in a cracked jaw” and “salt writes its own index” are vivid and POV-filtered. Environmental constraints (rising water, jammed sluice, sediment buildup) directly force the protagonist’s key actions. The setting is dense but never white-room or touristy; every major physical detail participates in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The velvet library in autumn is not mere backdrop; it actively shapes tone (“traveled stillness”) and frames the choir as guests in a larger, remembering space. The recurring object-as-setting—the rosette—functions like a portable micro-setting, constraining choices (used as a “temporary star” between Rafi and Ola) and charging the final image as it passes through warm hands. Details (curtains as “patient throats,” shelves “breathing through spines”) are filtered through Mara’s musical sensibility, keeping description purposeful and character-specific. The final line explicitly ties setting to closure (“The velvet library kept their breath”), making the environment integral to the emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted greenhouse and drowned district are vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated with character and theme (“metal remembered rain,” glass and ash in the soil). The environment directly shapes tactics: secrecy, ruin-as-resource, and the greenhouse as both illegal kitchen and nursery for the knowledge fruit. Setting evolves with the action (alignment brightening, greenhouse changing color, tree’s emergence) and charges the final image of rebuilding. A minor ceiling comes from the world’s external logistics (e.g., city surveillance, wider floodscape) staying hazy, though it doesn’t harm scene clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly specific and integral: the lightning collection tower, lacquer box, capacitors, and drone hives are all tactile and world-defining. Environmental details (“nectar dusk,” “stormfruit,” “hive-warm twilight”) are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility and echo the bee/ritual motif. The tower and box also function as tools that constrain options and drive the action at the crown. A slight risk of sensory overabundance remains, but it supports rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is exceptionally rich: the bay, houses, and interior objects are rendered with precise, sensuous detail that always passes through the narrator’s idiosyncratic filter (“streetlights daydream,” “porch reclines a degree more each year”). Micro-setting—the arrangement of small domestic items—doubles as both worldbuilding and diagnostic tool, fully integrated with the concept. Environmental features (salt, rope, dill, shutters, crooked steps) mirror each house’s “temperament” without lapsing into blunt symbolism. The recurring domestic space and the orris shard as a kind of portable micro-setting charge the final insight about attention and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater city garden is exquisitely realized and constantly active in the story’s mechanics: cracks in the dome allow access, eelgrass threads the ampoule, barnacles act as ushers, coral forms benches for argument. Setting is never mere backdrop; water carries telepathy and memory, and “structural weakness” in the dome and founder statue literally shapes what can be done. Sensory specificity (silt as breath, glassfish spelling names, foxglove-stained glass) is vivid and always filtered through Oris’s consciousness. The environment also charges the final images (breach as listening wound, foxglove glass tinting sunlight), satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The infinite staircase, rail, chalk, apertures, and crack form an integrated environment that continually shapes perception and choice (no landings, “gaps” as Opportunities, the crack as a sideways exit). Setting is filtered through the narrator’s mathematical/regret-obsessed lens, making it feel both concrete and metaphysical. The staircase’s constraints and the luminous seam explicitly charge the final image. A bit more tactile, multisensory grounding (beyond visual and conceptual) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smoggy city are vividly realized through specific, sensorial detail: tomato vines, damp soil, saffron quiet, sirens and laughter below. The setting actively shapes the story’s logic—the greenhouse as shrine and drop-point for offerings, the roof as liminal space where city and moon meet, the smog-dimmed moonlight empowering the brush. Environmental motifs (moonlight, plants, the box) recur and charge the final image of a “small republic.” The only thing keeping this from 9+ is that the physical constraints of the space rarely force tactical choices beyond mood and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto city and waterfall are rendered with granular, multisensory specificity—“rosewater dread,” snail-shell vents, stalagmite elders, “cold lace” spray—filtered through a museum guide’s sensibility. Environment is not decorative: damp threatens artifacts, the waterfall’s key change signals a psychic shift, and the liminal space at the spray becomes the crucible where names are tested and vows made. The emerald lens, wax, bread ovens, and hive box function as micro-settings that constrain what’s possible. The final image of galleries that “breathe honeyed mist and memory” directly recharges the earlier environmental texture.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, gray sea, and tidal chamber are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; we always know where we are and how the environment feels. Setting meaningfully constrains choice: isolation, low tide, and the stone’s placement at the lighthouse’s base create a pressure cooker where the only real options are the door or the life anchored to this place. Recurring objects—the hunger stone, the lantern, the staircase spiral—charge the final image when the yoyo’s path mirrors the descent and is then reversed. The atmosphere is rich without drifting into white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse and its “lingering luminance” are intensely specific and filter every beat, from the ferris skeleton to the bruised bulbs and algae-like afterglow. Environment and recurring objects directly constrain choices: the clasp and plywood lips, mirrors that create “new negatives,” and the light at the end that “wrapped it like old milk” all shape tactics, not just mood. The setting evolves with the action (outside → mouth → corridor → pedestal → deeper interior → sealed exit) and charges the final image of slipping out “through a slit of daylight disguised as a crack in painted night.” This is an exemplary fusion of world, body, and object functioning as setting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating orchard on salvaged driftwood is vividly realized and continuously used: trunks as vulnerable structures, crates and oars as tools, hull and rigging as instruments, and the stormy sea as both threat and sound-source. Weather and environment directly shape options (finding the leeward angle, building the perforated tower to redirect wind, hauling in the knife net). Sensory specifics—“blue hour,” “indigo into the brine,” bees thickening the air—are filtered through the musician-prophet’s ear, keeping worldbuilding tight and purposeful rather than touristic. The final image of sitting among pears while clouds rewrite into silence is charged by all that environmental pressure and feels inseparable from this exact setting.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is remarkably specific and integrated: turtle-shell city, algae roofs, barnacle constellations, and the watchers as “nailheads” all filter through the cartographer’s professional gaze. Environment constrains tactics (moving across roofs and ridges, reading shell patterns, the corridor of glare) and charges the final image (“turtles keep their vast time” vs the narrator’s imminent measuring). World rules are consistent and taught by use, not exposition. The sensory texture and scale feel both fresh and functionally tied to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thoroughly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility: “long throat of shadow,” ivy whispering, lockers coughing soot. The railway station and coal scar are not just backdrop; they embody the buried history and physically supply the ledger and scraps that drive discovery. Environmental details evolve with action (broken roof, rain of seeds, soot from lockers) and thematically mirror the excavation of truth. The final return to the town clock ties place to time and record-keeping, charging the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion, river, and drawbridge are exquisitely rendered and inseparable from the story’s stakes and tactics (access depends on water level; underrooms shape his movements and where he hides notes). Details like “a ballroom for weeds and the rinse of late light” and “underrooms breathe out a damp that smells like letters never sent” are vivid yet purposeful, mirroring his archival obsession. Environment and recurring objects (pavilion, waterline, door hinge) decisively charge the final image of him leaving notes and marking tomorrow’s depth. The density is high but remains legible and goal-filtered through his professional, melancholic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken library and drowned city are rendered with exceptional specificity—silt, barnacled arches, crabs in ducts, shelves like kelp—and always through Ossa’s professional gaze. Environment constrains choice (she waits for the blackout to strip away the “dye” of noise) and charges the final image, with the hum trying to “recoat everything” while stillness lingers on the spines. The world’s physical logic and atmosphere feel consistent and lived-in rather than touristic. This is publishable-level setting work, only narrowly short of utterly transformative because the environmental danger never directly tests her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lushly specific and always active: the basilica, floating island, spiral stair, kettles, and tea shrubs all inform the rituals and options available. Environmental rules (lanterns that sip dreams, stairs that invert ascent/descent, offerings to the sky) are consistent and shape the protagonist’s tactics—he must brew cranes from vapor and glass here, not paper. Sensory detail is dense yet purposeful, and the basilica’s light and altitude tangibly mirror and modulate his inner state. The final image of guests softening as lanterns drift overhead shows the world itself reweighted by what has occurred.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: the floating observatory, storm-scarred plateau, ruined convoy valley, and “cold machine choir” in the sky all feel specific and lived-in, not generic SF wallpaper. Environmental elements directly constrain and charge choices—the hovering platform allows her to drift over the basin, the glass mediates her contact with the valley, and the fans/breakers clock the observational window. The geode and body-as-instrument function as micro-setting, culminating in the final image of being “lifted” by pooled potential. A touch more concrete operational detail about the commander’s infrastructure or the machine choir’s behavior under study might deepen the situational stakes, but atmosphere and specificity are already elite.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory, dome, brass gears, cracked tiles, and underfoot constellations are richly specific and always filtered through the pilot’s professional gaze, giving the place a lived, functional feel. Setting directly shapes choices (pulling the rope, launching drones through the slit, reading carvings and fissures as punctuation) and charges the ending as the dome rotates with their new script. The dusk-to-night transition mirrors the conceptual brightening, and the observatory becomes “our compass,” making place inseparable from closure. This is elite-level integration of environment with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and integral: cobalt terrace, misnamed beach, driftwood carvings, and the sea as “archivist” all do more than decorate; they embody the story’s memory/record theme. The Parliament of Wood and carved planks directly drive action and discovery, while the terrace and dusk light frame the emotional pitch at beginning and end. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator’s archivist sensibility, building a coherent atmosphere. Very slight risk of image density crowding the more procedural aspects of the beach search keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The parapet in mist is vividly realized and constantly present, with weather and narrow stone shaping the characters’ movements and reinforcing risk (“slick teeth of stone”). The micro-setting of the ledger and drawer pull functions as an emotional and symbolic ground, particularly at the climax and ending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with “furrowed hush” and the clipped coin of the moon aligning tone and space. The only minor limitation is a slight preference for visual and metaphorical texture over other senses.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    The coastal setting is vividly rendered through fog, pilings, eelgrass, utility poles, dunes, and gulls, all filtered through the navigator’s professional bias. Environment and tools decisively constrain choice: the launch, shallows, channel, and especially the utility poles determine tactics and make the rescue possible. Weather and sea-state are not postcard backdrops but active pressures, echoed in metaphors of tide and backlash. The final return to the “ordinary and merciful” launch reweights the opening image and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is richly particular and integrated: bioluminescent lake, melted street-sign skiff, jars of rain with faces, the rusted gate and murals all feel necessary, not ornamental. Environment shapes action and identity (the protagonist literally becomes a ferryman; “the lake would stain me kindly, in rings of useful ache” charges the final image). World rules—commodified pain, empathy as resource—are learned through interaction rather than exposition. The recurring spatial elements (gate, stairs, dock, lake, machine) organize the story’s emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard and its permanent moonlight, the beasts, and the spices are not backdrop but active participants in the ritual and its rules, especially as the orchard “answers” and counts breaths. Environmental features constrain and enable choices: the fortune slip is planted between roots; Mira returns as dew inside apples; the moon’s persistence defines the temporal frame of their continued bond. Sensory specificity across smell, touch, and sight is rich yet purposeful, tightly tied to grief and conjuring. The final image of sap climbing and dew in apples is inseparable from this setting.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and purposeful: the “midnight glade above clouds,” frost-petaled grasses, lantern insects, and cloud-staircases all feel unique yet legible. Environment and objects function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image—the saucer, tablecloth, mobile moons, and insect-light all mediate her access to lost time and to atonement. World rules (clouds as stairs, stalled seconds in a bell jar) remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than explanation. The final return to the glade at dawn and the tablecloth tracing firmly ties setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The recycled spaceship, comet-anchor, greenhouse, albums, and bulkhead-scale are vivid and always filtered through the narrator’s needs. Crucially, the environment constrains choices: gravity variation, the lock’s weight-sensitivity, star-positioning via tear-salt, and the sterile greenhouse all impact tactics and meaning. The final image of keeping the ship warm with new sprouts directly charges the prior setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The black sand beach, basalt shelves, safe ridge, and the volcano’s lateral exhalation are tactile, specific, and structurally active—setting literally dictates where people can stand safely and how the evacuation functions. The jars and lightning bugs operate as micro-setting, turning terrain into a readable map whose glow constrains choice and shapes the final image. Weather/sky (“moon slipping behind the earth while Mars grazed a shoulder of cloud”) modulate light in ways that matter to visibility and mood, not just prettiness. The world feels coherent and lived-in, not touristic, with only the faintest whiff of “beautiful everywhere” lyricism in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are rich and purposeful: the luminous fort, the blackout, the “cradle of sparks,” and the sundial all feel lived-in and tailored to this story. The environment constrains and enables choices—the blackout creates cover, the glare of the fort motivates the revolution, the workshops and vents make the transformation physically plausible. Sensory detail is vivid without losing orientation (“coals dream under ash, and wires rest like snakes learning to be lines”). The recurring objects (quill holder, sundial) function as micro-settings that charge the final configuration.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless world, and eel banners aren’t just pretty—they actively constrain tactics and enable the magic (stones along the cliff lip, currents as grammar, aurora leaning to crown the water). The lack of friction and the need to “teach the ground to listen” turn setting into live problem and solution. Recurring objects—the stones, the pouch of star dust, the aurora—charge the final images of traveling coasts and reading the sky “like scripture.” The world feels coherent, particular, and indispensable to what happens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the stormlit observatory, switchboard, camera, timer, and city map all feel tactile and specific. Weather and altitude actively shape tactics (timing exposures, counting beats between thunder, “rarefying” fear) and charge the metaphors of scars and lightning. The environment directly contributes to the conceptual closure by making the city’s wounds literally readable from above. A slight saturation of atmospheric detail edges toward lushness but never quite undermines clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass atrium and brook are not backdrop but machinery: panes, light, and reflections are the means by which the code is solved, and the final “floor untied itself” image is inseparable from that environment. The brook’s “shallow applause” and the atrium’s “dignified chaos” also echo and deepen the story’s tonal and thematic concerns. Tools and micro-setting (needle card, sundial, panes) tightly constrain tactics at each step. This is exemplary object-as-setting work; only the tiniest restraint in sensory range keeps it from feeling fully immersive at the absolute top level.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted library, fence-as-harp, bus exhalations, and moonlit city form an atmospheric, specific environment that feels fully inhabited and tonally precise. Setting repeatedly interacts with action—the decaying library demands patchwork ingenuity; the fence and bus flows literally carry poems to strangers; the dawn “blue lid” reweights the night’s work. World rules are consistent and conveyed through lived detail, not exposition. The only limit to a higher score is that the environment mostly supports and mirrors rather than tightly constraining concrete tactical choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station and the tidal arbor are rendered with rich, specific imagery—glass concourse, foam-roped branches, flickering compasses—and always filtered through the musician’s sensibility. Setting isn’t postcard-only: the projector, arbor, and stage actively enable his attempt to meddle with fate, and the broken clock on the stump charges the final return to the concourse. World rules (the portal reel, the tide in the sky) are surreal but internally consistent and learned via action. The environment strongly underwrites theme and mood without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integral: the ridge, reef, hibiscus, and monsoon do not read as backdrop but as active participants that constrain options (the listening “ear” hollow, the race against rain). Environmental details are always filtered through the reality checker’s sensibility, maintaining coherence while layering sensory richness (scent-speaking flowers, “bruise of approaching rain”). The ancient ridge in bloom and the ear-shaped hollow directly determine where the seed can work, and shells mixed into the sand at the end charge the final image with future-listening. World rules—collective memory as ecology—stay consistent and are dramatized rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    The islet after rain, cove, casuarina trees, and town across the channel are vividly realized and always filtered through the narrator’s bonsai/maritime sensibility. Environment and objects (cove, driftwood, tides, lace, compass) don’t just decorate but constrain choice and charge the final image—the protagonist must physically go to that specific cove at that tide. Weather and water mirror interior states without feeling like blunt allegory. The final bow to the tide and diffusion of sea-blue into the garden miniatures shows setting as an active thematic engine, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is rendered with tactile specificity ("algae slicked tiles," "tomatoes gone to filaments") that directly mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The micro-setting of the dust on the slide acts as the essential bridge between the macro (neutron stars) and the micro (greenhouse), charging the final image with earned significance.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset; the canyon acts as a "kiln of listening," actively pressuring the protagonist's choices. Sensory details like "flaking its own moons" and "toothless edges" ground the speculative elements in tactile reality, effectively using the micro-setting to charge the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "winterglass conservatory" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details that align perfectly with the "hush" premise. Imagery like "ice-limned ferns" and the "lattice of mirrors" grounds the speculative elements in a tangible physical space that effectively constrains the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.6)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active participant that constrains movement and dictates the physics of the scene. The "impossible spaces" and "thin as breath" water are not just backdrop but tactile barriers that shape the protagonist's method. The atmosphere is dense and specific, elevating the library from a location to a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vivid, specific imagery ("rust-red rib cage," "bruised clocks") anchors the setting and effectively establishes a cohesive atmosphere. The physical environment acts as a constraint and mirrors the community's brittle emotional state with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    The viaduct and camera obscura are visualized with vivid, albeit heavy, imagery ("vines... like shy comets"). While the setting is atmospheric, the relentless metaphorical filtering distances the reader from the physical reality of the space, making it feel more like a dreamscape than a grounded location.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "living bridge garden" is the story’s standout feature, functioning as both antagonist and mirror by actively constraining choice ("bridges grow where footprints wish to be"). The environment is vivid and distinct, though the score is capped by line-level density issues that occasionally clutter the description.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's standout feature, blending carnival whimsy with post-apocalyptic decay ("dust the color of old tickets") to create a vivid, tactile world. Specific details like the "porcelain fish" and "trapdoor etched with seedheads" ground the scene effectively. The setting actively participates in the theme, transforming a place of hollow prizes into one of genuine value.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the sunken greenhouse and ashen forge create a vivid, distinct atmosphere. The sensory details are immersive, effectively blending the underwater environment with the synesthetic experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong, specific atmospheric details ("green-bottled lake," "scent rose, bitter and clean") ground the magical realism effectively. The station setting actively constrains the magic and the path, serving as more than just a backdrop. The transition from sunset to moonlight is handled with good sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric detailing is the story’s strongest asset, with vivid imagery like "melting in lace patterns" and "pipette ghosts." The environment actively participates in the mood, though the "snow science" line blurs the concrete with the abstract a bit too loosely.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, with "iron stacks" and "tidebreath" creating a distinct, rusty-lyric atmosphere. The environment effectively constrains the action, providing the specific tools (skylight, cast, darkness) needed for the decryption scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting detail is vivid and immersive ("bees slept inside stone," "salt stings her knuckles"), creating a tangible sense of place. The storm and the failing light act as active pressures that constrain the characters' choices and pacing effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frozen courtyard is vivid and tactile, acting as a constraint that shapes every action and thought (frost, sweeping, squeaking snow). The transparent ice violin is a brilliant central object that bridges the physical setting and the metaphysical inquiry. The atmosphere of "twilight" and "hush" is sustained and functional, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and immersive, with the "crystal whispering forecourt" serving as an effective atmospheric anchor. The sensory details of the rain and light support the fable-like tone, though the optical mechanics of the climax strain the physical reality established by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The garden is a fully realized antagonist and partner; the maze physically constrains the protagonist to force a choice, satisfying the 9+ criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the ravine, the ozone-smelling vault, and the specific mechanics of the gantry constrain and enable the action. The "magnetic nexus" is grounded physically rather than remaining an abstract idea, anchoring the speculative elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional, acting as both atmosphere and antagonist. Details like "sandbags puffed like lungs" and the "lanternslide opera" projection are vivid and strictly functional, constraining the protagonist's movement and defining the rules of the encounter. The environment is fully integrated into the plot's causality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but a toolkit; the barometer, anemometer, and ice scale are integral to the plot's progression and thematic realization. The sensory details ("galvanized rooms stitched to stone") ground the high concept in tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting acts as the primary antagonist and truth-teller; the tunnel holds silence "like a cup" and the valve wheel functions as a tactile connection to the past. The sensory details ("yellow coin," "breath tasted of iron") are not just atmospheric but evidentiary, grounding the realization in physics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the standout feature, acting as an antagonist (the growling river, the rot) and a resource (the obsidian room). The environment explicitly constrains choices—forcing the narrator to burrow through a "bricked niche"—and the sensory details ("veined with moss," "slick with the breath of water") are vivid and immersive. The "micro-setting" of the tunnel and the obsidian room charges the final image of regeneration.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("shadows grew crisp," "dreaming roots"), grounding the eclipse effectively. However, the description occasionally leans into poetic fallacy ("hill itself listened") or cliché ("ravens wrote cursive") that distances the reader from the raw physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "silo library" and "prairie erased by salt" are rendered with distinct, evocative texture. Imagery like the silo as a "fallen compass needle" anchors the surreal concept in physical geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    Imagery is vivid ("worn brass blinking like a moon") but operates as floating ornamentation due to the lack of scenic grounding. The setting feels like a poetic backdrop rather than a physical space that constrains action or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystalline orchard is vivid and integral, physically constraining the final image (leaning bodies mirroring the crater). While atmospheric, some descriptors ("stardust sugar," "dawnlike hush") lean toward the precious or generic, slightly softening the grit needed to ground the fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional; the rooftop canals and the sleeping giant are not just backdrop but active constraints that dictate the timing and danger of the scene. Sensory details are precise ("spine-ladders," "metronome of rain and stone"), and the physical integration of the giant's breath into the water's movement is brilliantly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "cavern orchard" is atmospheric and vivid, providing a strong surreal backdrop for the ritual. However, the description occasionally veers into the ornamental ("mineral blossoms," "fruit glistening like cooled tears") rather than strictly constraining the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmospheric details ("sapphire hush," "dustlavender," "creak like old oaks") are vivid and effectively ground the magical elements. The sensory experience of the "crawl space" perspective is well-rendered, creating a distinct texture that supports the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric and lyrical, with strong sensory anchoring in the nursery ("smell of runoff and tin," "mossy trellis"). While the timeline drift prevents deep immersion in a single moment, the textural consistency of the setting effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.6)
    The setting is atmospheric, effectively blending the city with the metaphysical train, but relies heavily on pathetic fallacy ("listening room," "expectant breath"). The "Fortress of unspoken truths" is a literalized metaphor that flattens the nuance of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of the tower and the whale migration is vivid and atmospherically rich, anchoring the surreal elements effectively. However, the description of the magical space ("table cleared of fear") veers into abstraction, reducing the visceral impact of the final location.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specifically rendered, with the "prismatic escondite" and "obsidian mirrors" creating a strong, surreal atmosphere that constrains the ritual. The physical environment actively participates in the magic, though the relentless personification of inanimate elements ("geometry had the tone of rumors," "floor and ceiling trading rumors") occasionally threatens to turn the setting into a cartoonish ensemble rather than a place.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional specificity; the "citrus, ethanol" and "thin pencil-lines" of breath create immediate immersion. The vintage ink pot is a masterstroke, functioning as a micro-setting element that physically charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "catacomb orchard" is a vivid, constrained environment that drives the imagery (roots, bones) and physically yields the plot objects. However, descriptions often drift into abstraction ("starlings circled like punctuation") or cliché ("dew jeweled") rather than sticking to sensory grounding that pressures the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is the story’s strongest asset; the "golden arcade at dawn" is rendered with tactile specificity that grounds the surreal premise. The environment actively constrains the protagonist (lighting, chalk on stone) and feeds the resolution (the busker’s sound). The atmosphere of "futuristic nostalgia" is successfully dramatized through imagery, not just the label.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "cobalt observatory" is realized with tactile precision, from the "brass rails" to the "glass glove." These details are not merely decorative but constrain and enable the stitching magic (e.g., the dust, the charts), grounding the surreal premise in a vivid physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "tidal arcade" acts as a functional tool for the narrative, not just a backdrop; the puddles, lighting, and architectural "ribs" actively constrain and enable the narrator's trick. The sensory detail is vivid (copper, salt, wet shadows), grounding the abstract concept of "orchestrated serendipity" in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and vivid in its high-fantasy tone, but the setting feels somewhat disembodied—a "white room" filled with poetic objects rather than a grounded place. The sensory details ("lantern gnats," "wet stone") are beautiful but often float without spatial concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the story's strongest asset; the "bait shack," "sunlight smells like tar," and "mist" create a vivid, lived-in atmosphere that grounds the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on stock literary descriptors ("cathedral calm") and confusing metaphors ("moon's throat"). The immediate repetition of the distinct word "obsidian" (lines 18 and 21) breaks immersion and highlights a lack of lexical control.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "drowned district" is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("ribcages of towers," "fireplace black as kelp").

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is evocative, utilizing a surreal, fluid logic ("walls soften like breath") that suits the premise. The "soundless sanctuary" is vivid, though the extreme mutability of the space ("corridor bending to accommodate") lowers the sense of physical grounding and constraint, making the setting feel more like a compliant dream than a concrete place.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is immersive and sensory-rich, effectively blending the physical ruin of the orchard with the surreal mechanics of the dream. The environment actively constrains the characters, forcing them to align with "winters of bark" and specific angles of light.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory specificity is high, with details like "peeled lacquer," "thorn and nettle," and "bindweed" effectively grounding the secret tea house. The environment actively constrains the narrator's approach, requiring the "pruning knife" and patience, though the "palace" element feels slightly less tethered to the urban reality than the bakery.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated; the "quartz hush" and "frozen library" are not just backdrops but active physical constraints that shape the magic (breath frosting the lens, icicles spelling alphabets). This creates a tangible, high-pressure environment that dictates the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory specificity is excellent, anchoring the scene in "salt and rot" and the "breath of limes" while using the silence to amplify minute sounds. The setting actively pressures the characters, enforcing the non-verbal communication that drives the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the transition from the carnival to the "cool mineral air" of the crystal cave is vivid and tactile. The "crystal throats" and "frozen dawn" provide a specific, memorable grounding for the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory specificity (&quot;sandal scuffs,&quot; &quot;hibiscus shadows&quot;) that effectively grounds the opening. While the atmosphere is palpable, the description occasionally leans into over-poetic abstraction (&quot;city still holding its inhale&quot;) that distances the reader from the physical reality of the courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistent, but the physical parameters of the setting are incoherent. The story posits a sunken, water-filled lab where characters write in journals with ink ("standing up like hair") and dance without buoyancy constraints. This lack of physical fidelity turns the setting into a decorative backdrop rather than a tangible environment that pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting specificity is exceptional, particularly the "salt crystal growing chamber" and the whale as a "hill that moves only in rumor." Objects like the "scroll of glass" and the "tin of pressed wildflowers" are not just atmospheric but function as essential constraints and tools, grounding the magical realism in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)

    The atmospheric details ("bruise of cobalt," "sea syllables") effectively establish a coherent, magic-realist tone. The setting is vivid and anchors the action well, though the descriptor "velvet" leans slightly into genre cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "cradle of air" and "bone pale metal" effectively mirror the internal state of the forger. The setting is vivid but occasionally repetitive (stalactites mentioned three times) and relies on a "white room" quality where the sanctuary feels isolated from the world's physics. The integration of the key and case into the environment is tactile and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting functions as a character, responding with specific, constraint-based reactions ("reeds brush together," "stone refuses to breathe") that drive the plot. The sensory details ("pebble the dark," "sand-syllables") are tightly woven into the magic system.

    Vivid, textural sensory details like "nautical dusk" and "gossiping bones" effectively ground the magical realism. The observatory is not just a backdrop but an active constraint that shapes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific, evocative details ("saltwood and rope," "smelled of iron and tea") grounding the feral loft. The setting actively flavors the narrative tone, though it serves more as a poetic backdrop than a source of physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's anchor, with vivid sensory details like "windows were freckles of dying light" and "bell-notes of ice" establishing a strong sense of place. The setting is tangible and specific, doing the heavy lifting that the plot misses.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, with vivid imagery like the "basalt sanctuary" and "magnetic viaduct." However, the reliance on high-density figurative language occasionally unmoors the physical reality, making the environment feel more like a backdrop for metaphors than a constrained space.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional, using the paradox of a flooded tunnel in a drought to generate thematic pressure. The image of salt crusting the grates—"white teeth of thirst refusing to let water escape"—perfectly physicalizes the story's central tension between thirst and drowning.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the shop is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details like the "thorn of bent metal" and "brass filings." The use of the clockwork heart as a micro-setting/prop effectively grounds the abstract theme in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "gears-and-cogs workshop" and "acid sea" are vivid, sensory-rich environments that constrain the action (steam lifting the cart). The setting is well-integrated with the premise, though the "acid" danger remains largely atmospheric rather than an urgent physical threat in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting of the "social network archive" is rendered with vivid, atmospheric detail ("smelled like old servers," "sweeping a beach at night"). The "Sink" and its lyric challenge create a specific, memorable digital-physical geography. The sensory details effectively ground the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "shifting ice floes" and "lantern pears" providing necessary atmospheric pressure. The environment actively constrains the conflict (the need for safe paths) and shapes the final resolution (beacons and tide-based shifts).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is an active antagonist and teacher, integral to every beat. The interaction with the "parasol tip" as a tool for sounding the ice is a standout detail that constrains choice (finding the child) and charges the final image (the salute). The sensory details ("old vowels," "coughing brine") are vivid and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vividly rendered with strong sensory details like "air tastes of apple skins" and "pavilion glass murmurs," establishing a cohesive atmosphere. While the imagery borders on ornamental, the pavilion and vineyard successfully ground the metaphorical dialogue in a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The juxtaposition of the lavender field and factory ruins creates a distinct, grounded atmosphere that supports the ritual. However, sensory details occasionally drift into abstraction ("smelled like... moonlight") rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's standout feature; the "apologizing hinges" and "constellations of practiced neglect" create a dense, living environment. The sensory details are purposeful, reinforcing the theme of a world that speaks when humans are silent.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "drowned busts breathed mist" and "statues sculpted from ship anchors." The setting actively shapes the mood and the protagonist's ritualistic actions.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's standout feature, with the "burn scar" Moon and "singing" motors creating a vivid, tactile environment. The setting actively constrains the protagonist's method (the quake's aftereffects) and charges the final imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory specificity is a strength, particularly in the "hymning the mundane" sequence (radiator clang, sneaker squeak). The hospice setting ("radiant haven") is vivid, though occasionally the description tilts toward the flowery ("light pool... like a gentle river").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)

The setting details are vivid ("collimators asleep like cattle," "chalk you could taste") and essential to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is active and metaphorical; the hedge maze and secret garden are not just backdrops but externalizations of Ari's hidden guilt. The fountain and the "mint and iron" smell create a vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like "sand-smooth slate" and "wet reflections" are vivid and specific, grounding the abstract theme. The setting actively provides the tools for the character's work, though the "milk into tea" simile in the final third feels generic compared to the earlier marine specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is active and constraining; the "bowl of ferns" where servers hummed and the path mapped by "thawing icicles" dictate the characters' physical movements. The moss garden acts as a third participant, enforcing the theme of gentle decay and regrowth.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strongest category. The "feral nexus" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("bloomless thistle," "rust reeds," "ink under his nails") that ground the metaphysical concept. The atmosphere is cohesive and supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("verdant arbor," "dew," "needles") but remains a generic fable backdrop that rarely constrains the action. While the "listening ear" frame is a specific detail, the environment largely cooperates with the characters rather than providing friction or shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "ash wood" and "rain-beaded skylight" grounding the abstraction effectively. Sensory details are rich and purposeful, though the reliance on "silver music" and personified rain occasionally pushes the atmosphere toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional—specific, vivid, and constraining. The "kinetic lagoon," "ladders of wind," and "raft of turbines" are not just backdrops but physical forces that dictate movement and pacing. The integration of the "carousel bones" below adds vertical depth and history to the environment, grounding the surrealism in a tangible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting of the shadowed garden is atmospheric and active; the "intimate geometry" of the fountain and the falling quince trees support the emotional beats. The environment feels like a participant in the ritual rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering a vivid and cohesive vertical world of stalactites and iron forests. The atmosphere is immersive, though at times the relentless metaphorical descriptions threaten to obscure the physical geography.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting details are vivid and specific ("obsidian folded tight," "sea lettuce"), effectively grounding the fable-like tone and constraining the ritual's mechanics. However, the description occasionally drifts into ornamentation that slows the pacing, prioritizing aesthetic density over narrative utility.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details—"fountains tiled with eyes," "bronze eyelid," "dry rill"—effectively establish a surreal, mythic tone that supports the fable. The setting is active, with the city itself whispering and providing the breadcrumbs that guide the plot. While evocative, the imagery occasionally feels dense and ornamental rather than strictly grounding the action in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and distinct, with the "black glass" and "salt-scarred brass" providing tangible constraints on the mood and action. The tower's interior mechanics are rendered with tactile specificity that grounds the more abstract "time" themes. The repetition of the full phrase "tidal obsidian ridge" three times draws slightly too much attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is vivid and establishes a consistent "velveteen gloom," though the setting feels more like a stage set than a real place. The "cobalt silo" and "listening metal" are evocative, but the spatial logic of burying a sack under a tree to be found by a tapestry map is convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake create a strong, isolating atmosphere that constrains the mood effectively. The sensory details of the ice and the modeling tools (beads, threads) ground the abstract concepts in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, with evocative details like "needle-snow" and "brick bones." The setting feels distinct and immersive, though at times the density of metaphor ("rooms... warm as memory") threatens to obscure the physical grounding of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)

The sensory environment successfully pressures the narrator’s choices and reflects their internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the "sedimentary layers" and "silt humps" are not just scenery but physical obstacles and tools that shape the solution. Sensory details like the "mussel shelf like a gold tooth" are vivid and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "velvet library" is a strong, atmospheric setting that actively participates in the story ("library listened," "curtains like patient throats"). The sensory details effectively ground the abstract themes in a specific physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("foxglove-stained glass," "ribs of the fallen dome") that grounds the abstract concepts. The environment actively shapes the "threading" action, integrating setting with plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    The staircase is an active, breathing antagonist rather than a static backdrop; details like the "black slots that sip my warmth" and the chalk that "refuses to wear down" create a vivid, claustrophobic reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist, forcing the specific tactical adaptations (eating dice numbers, writing proofs) that drive the story.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like "peppery scent of tomato vines" and "wilted basil" grounding the "saffron quiet." The environment actively supports the mood. A higher score is precluded only by the lack of a setting element providing a hard constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not just atmospheric but functions as a primary antagonist; the dampness and "thunderwater" actively threaten the history the narrator must save.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmospheric and specific; the "gilded L" and "metal mouths coughing soot" create a vivid, distinct texture. The setting actively pressures the narrator, though the "shy reporters" simile feels slightly meta and pulls focus from the immediate sensory experience of the historian.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like the "lace of arches veiled by green water" and "carp listening like patient archivists." The submerged pavilion feels tactile and grounded. However, some imagery strains for effect (the lighthouse simile), preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Atmosphere is exceptional; the "barnacled arches" and "books weeping salt" create a visceral, immersive environment that actively constrains the plot (the need for silence, the dampness affecting the paper). The sensory details are precise and thematic (salt, silt, violet ink), grounding the high-concept premise in tactile reality. The setting is not just a backdrop but an antagonist that the library must "school itself" to endure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the steam from the tea and the light of the basilica become the literal tools of the resolution. The "floating island" and "glass basilica" are rendered with sensory precision that constrains the protagonist's options (e.g., using vapor instead of paper). This deep integration of environment and agency justifies the high mark.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Atmosphere is exceptional; sensory details like "metallic clicks like ice" and "moth colored light" are vivid and purpose-driven. The setting acts as a pressure cooker that mirrors the internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a standout strength, effectively blending archaic machinery (brass gears, ropes) with futuristic tech (drones, matrix chips) to create a specific, tactile atmosphere. The physical grounding of the observatory helps anchor the abstract nature of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "Parliament of Wood"—a driftwood archive of births and deaths—is a brilliant, specific invention that elevates the story. This setting actively constrains the characters’ search and charges the final realization, transforming a standard dialogue scene into a physical excavation of truth. The atmospheric details of salt and sea effectively permeate the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and functional; the mist and the narrow parapet physically constrain the characters and enforce the "close quarters" tension. The atmosphere effectively supports the "neutral territory" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Excellent use of the utility poles as a constraining environmental feature that shapes the protagonist's tactics. Specific details like "galaxies of mud" and the mechanics of the channel ground the scene vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is rendered with vivid, surreal detail ("melted street signs," "jars of rain").

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but the engine of the magic; the "permanent moonlight" and specific sensory details of the spices create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The orchard functions as an active participant, responding to the ritual with "rustle" and "drip."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The use of the saucer crack as a literal map is an inventive constraint that physically guides the protagonist's journey. The "glade above clouds" and the "chamber of stalled seconds" are rendered with sensory precision that grounds the magic in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details like the "quilt of hulls" and the "greenhouse where spinach refused to sprout." The "maps of tears" on photographs provides a surreal but effective visual anchor for the navigation process, though the environment occasionally feels more like a stage for the metaphors than a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral to the plot, acting as both antagonist and stage; the "black sand," "basalt shelf," and "active volcano" constrain movement and dictate the pacing. Sensory details like the "glass chiming" and "murmuring plume" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is consistent and vivid, successfully evoking a dreamlike twilight, though the relentless personification ("hinges breathe," "lanterns pretend") sometimes obscures the physical geography. The setting serves the theme well, but the heavy metaphorical layer distances the reader from the concrete sensory reality of the fort.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The premise of a frictionless season is not just atmospheric but functions as a hard constraint that necessitates the specific method (math rocks) to enable action. This integration of setting physics with plot mechanics is exemplary, charging the imagery with narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric pressure is palpable, with the observatory and storm rendered in vivid, sensory-rich detail ("brass switchboard," "dome hummed"). The setting actively shapes the ritual, grounding the abstract concepts in physical space. However, the description occasionally veers into overwriting ("marginalia on a page already argued with"), where density threatens to obscure rather than clarify the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is utilized masterfully, not just as atmosphere but as a mechanical constraint for the plot; the specific interplay of light, glass, and the sundial drives the solution. The environment actively constrains the characters and enables the resolution rather than just hosting it.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "rusted library," "rain and iron," and "books breathing" create a cohesive, immersive world. The setting actively participates in the mood, though the metaphor of "ribs" is repeated ("stacks are ribs," "feeling like ribs again"), which slightly diminishes the impact of the imagery through redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting imagery is the story's standout feature, with surreal, tactile details like "keys stitched from postcard ivory and umbrella ribs." The transition from the glassy station to the tidal arbor is vivid and grounds the magical elements in specific sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, active, and integral to the plot; the specific geography of the "sleeping ear" hollow constrains the climax. Sensory details are lush ("petals debate," "red rain"). The score is capped at 8.8 per the global gate because the closure (Q2) does not reach the 9.0 threshold of visible cost required to unlock higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rendered with sharp, purposeful details like "casuarina branches" and "salt grass" that filter strictly through the tutor's perspective. The "driftwood nested like unkempt bonsai" perfectly mirrors the internal conflict.

Weather is not backdrop but antagonist: frost, twilight bloom, wind combing decks all push choices. Final image of cold-salt, new-paper air is re-charged by earlier salt-rimed wings, fulfilling 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is protagonist: “the whole place is a flooded opera house…tired moons.” Lantern-star constellations on ceiling, swollen door exhaling perfume—details constrain movement (must step on reflections only). Micro-setting (baton box of bone-white sticks) charges final image. One geography slip: “pocket no architect would claim” risks abstraction, but lyrical license holds.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Station environment directly shapes tactics: platform edge tests stance, scale weighs breath, anemometer lee hosts paper fulcrum. Weather instruments recur with each reflection beat, constraining movement and supplying metaphors that converge in closure; micro-setting (paper, glass) becomes continent map—no 8.8 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel’s cold arch, beaded valve, and copper drip form a micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice—hands freeze, threads bite, sound metronomes the turn. Selective sensory economy favors touch and hearing over visual catalog; every droplet and grease-bead is repurposed as rosary, verdict, lung. Spatial choreography is immaculate: wheel, pipe, ladder memory track without drift. The setting evolves—pipe sighs after torque—so environment participates in causality rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Library-catacombs, obsidian cellar, origami swan, and river-amphitheater are tactile, odor-rich, and sonically alive; each object is handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: the swan’s creases steer literal footfalls, the obsidian shelves hum under touch, and the bricked niche yields to shoulder pressure, all grounding the lyric shifts. Sensory hierarchy mirrors keeper’s archivist bias—ink, mulch, mildew—never drifting into tourist catalogue. Final image of “flakes of mortar seasoning my tea” fuses setting with bodily intake, charging the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sage ridge courtyard acts as resonant instrument: heat, stone, ravens, crickets, and the dreaming-root tree supply sensory hierarchy that narrows to the locket-on-wood soundboard. Micro-setting (tree-as-stage, body-as-brace) constrains the final musical gesture; no environment swap possible without breaking the acoustic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The reclaimed silo library, ladder-spined and salt-stripped, is not backdrop but instrument: its slanted floor dictates where tragedies and hopes must be shelved, constraining the historian’s final gesture. Micro-objects—brass disk, tapestry fragment, half-burned diaries—are handled, flipped, returned, their temperature and texture guiding tempo and memory retrieval. Dragons chalked by children on the outer skin become a counting lesson, binding play to future catastrophe. Environment thus steers both tactics (where to place books, where to kneel) and the closing image of “something like weather” shifting inside the silo.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harbor, causeway, and lighthouse are filtered through a night-walker’s selective eye—“the lens grumbles in its sleep”—so setting becomes character. The sugar-sticky hands and salt-white boots tether the final image to tactile consequence. Spatial choreography is clean: from dock to causeway to lantern room without drift. Weather is used as moral barometer—“the tide thought things over”—but the metaphor is anchored in the narrator’s footfalls, not authorial ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The chapel-as-dimensional-anchor is never explained yet constraints choice: its pews funnel sound, its altar holds the palette that ultimately traps the voice. Micro-setting—the matte ultramarine palette—functions as portable lake, body-double, and finally moon, charging the closing image. Exterior world remains sketch, but interior geometry is tracked without drift. Sensory triage favors hush and pigment over visual excess, matching the priest’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frost staff scored with shell-edge, the thawing panes, and the shell itself as micro-setting directly constrain the conductor’s method and charge the final thaw-image. Environmental details evolve causally—from “ribbons through the ribs” to “panes blushing with thaw”—mirroring interior surrender without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Glowing viaduct after rain functions as micro-setting that literally prescribes each footstep via reflection-pathways; the wet stone, neon gutters, and “cooled wires” scent constrain balance and visibility, charging the final image when the protagonist lowers to the stone. Environment is inseparable from tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern is not backdrop but instrument: basalt “swallows sound into velvet,” constraining how Oko tunes drums to dream earthquakes. Micro-setting—the broken phonograph needle—literally charges the climax when pierced through skin. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s deaf bias: touch and vibration precede sight. Weather (“dry leaves ticked like distant metronomes”) syncs with seasonal transition, coaching the reader to feel time pass without exposition.</answer>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when the backward playback first rubs frost from her bones; second beat deepens when she realizes she had already stopped feeling. Agency: she rigs, threads, and bows; no coincidence. Cost is legible: the filament could snap, the needle could re-break, the city might still refuse to thaw. One meaningful tightening satisfies 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Courtyard stones, barometer ticks, and pigeon-warmth are tactile and selective; weather readings double as emotional barometry, charging the final image. The micro-setting of the bench-as-stage and the arch-as-exit directly shape the stealth exit tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography survives the single long paragraph; bodies track cleanly. Only the off-stage museum spire is mildly abstract, but it never governs a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Greenhouse operates as micro-setting that supplies the UV resource and the last amber-variant; spatially tracked without drift. Moisture, glass, cedar scent filter through POV grief-heightened senses. “Lanterns blooming along the stair” memory fragment anchors era and class. Environment literally guides the final handshake—“return when the garden requests a witness.”

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is not backdrop but instrument: terra-cotta walls record fingerprints, starlight chooses when to speak, and the rope-warmed stalagmite becomes fulcrum for the final choice. Grotto micro-geography (dust, spiral, chill of storms) literally constrains where footprints can be woven and where the mirror of refusal appears. Sensory hierarchy follows poet attention (“taste of silt… then throat”) rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse-shipwreck chimera is not backdrop but tactical resource: rusted hulls police the wind, brackish light dictates which roots drink, the tide literally opens the door to the final breath. The mendicant bowl serves as micro-setting whose shifting contents (marble, shell, seed) constrain each micro-choice of what to keep or gift. Sensory hierarchy obeys the violinist’s ear—quiet is heard before it is seen. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies orbit the bowl, tide laps exact steps, no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber grotto is no postcard; its resinous air electrically mediates every beat—static serves as “braille between our pulses.” The blotter petal is micro-setting that alters tactics: curled, lifted, shared, it literally carries the volatile hope. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies, petal, coat, fossil shelves all track without drift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—chemist’s nose, cartographer’s eye—so environment constrains choice rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    The colonnaded, starlit, gull-gossiping library is tactile and atmospheric; lamps sway, paper lamps nod, spatial choreography holds as bodies move from desk→roof→pier. Salt air and violin resin fuse occupational and emotional textures, constraining choices (wind dictates rooftop rehearsal, resin repairs splinters). Micro-objects—locket, ledger, rope bookmark—are handled on-page and return charged at closure. Sensory economy favors sound and smell over visual catalog, supporting musical tide metaphor without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment as tool: the crystalline panes literally mirror faces, forcing self-recognition and recruiting townsfolk; the obsidian shards become the lattice’s teeth, constraining how the arbor must be built. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies pivot at the ribs, flour drifts on wind, crater sings or quiets in causal response. Sensory hierarchy filters through the sculptor’s reed-sculptor hands: stardust sugar grit, mineral sigh, humming nets of light. Only the "void-sun" physics remains un-anchored, a hairline abstraction that stops it at 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rooftop canal system is not backdrop but hydraulic protagonist: tilted “pages,” sluice lips, and exhalation tides literally script the interrupted cadence that births echoes. Micro-setting( pendant pressed to rail, lichens under palm) constrains every tactical choice. Sensory economy—hush/rush metronome, cold metal on throat—mirrors internal state without declaring it. Spatial choreography is flawless: bridges gutter-to-gutter, body angles for sketching, water-level breath-tracking all remain traceable across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard is not backdrop but instrument: fruit skins become “equations wearing festival clothes,” the moon-thread rope lowers a spatial path the protagonist must physically crawl through. Mineral blossoms on trunks and ticking stalactites constrain timing and acoustics, forcing hushed breath-counting. The stepping stone’s chipped tesserae literally map constellations that guide the final arc; remove it and the climactic proof collapses. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—he notices mineral sweetness because chemists “taste” air for data—never tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Library-as-body metaphor is sustained: joists as ribs, Rare Folios Room as mouth learning, atlas case as storm-shelter; these concrete mappings constrain movement and hiding places. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—felt drafts, smelled cedar, heard metallic ticks—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: grate→atlas→chair→cache→arrow, every vector legible. The outage-timeframe and “sapphire hush” directly shape acoustics that let the tape speak, satisfying the 9+ environment test.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.4)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that literally supports the final vow; rain-drenched linden leaf constrains her palm and recharges the ending. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and urgent: “droplets clung like second thoughts.” Spatial choreography (ivy braiding hop) tracks cleanly. Weather affects every tactical choice; no static catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cave is not backdrop but instrument: crystal ribs ring when we breathe, salt scale tastes on the tongue, and the final tonal birth is inseparable from the pearl’s lift. Environment actively constrains—sound paths, breathable dark—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies drift ahead of themselves, distances tracked by echo. No other setting could host this exact shift.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ivory harbor is not backdrop but instrument: the wet glass, staff-line masts, and valve-on-sill constrain how sound and memory can be organized. Micro-setting succeeds—the corroded valve’s lichen-green ports dictate the intervals of possible notes. Weather’s shift from rain to mist is causally tied to the workers’ glances upward, proving environment alters social attention. One minor spatial wobble: “balconies hung with damp laundry” appears after the exile’s end yet feels like a frozen diorama rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Body, tool, and recurring object converge: the phantom punch constrains every choice (cannot board without it), the folded maps become literal stepping-stones into the mouth, and the starlit mist vault lowers to a “sheltering lid” once the fare is paid. Spatial choreography is impeccable—tracks end, platform sinks, stars bend—each environmental shift causally tied to the punch’s action. Sensory hierarchy reflects cartographer bias: visual patterns first, then haptic (“carriage smelled of chalk, rain, and something like thunder”). The final image—“the hour reset”—recharges every prior clock reference.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stone ribs, whale breath, salt chimes—setting is tactile, smelled, heard; parapet, transit scope, and tile are tools that literally steer attention and choice. The whale-road and cold-front arrival time the final alignment; tower architecture allows the tile-to-scope placement that triggers the closure image. Micro-setting (the shell’s whorl mirroring a constellation) constrains the pen’s spiral and final inscription. Setting evolves with weather and migration, never wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The escondite, the obsidian trapezoid, and the fragment are micro-settings that double as tools—each hums, warms, or cools to cue spatial rebellion, directly constraining tactics. Sensory economy is ruthless: “spectrum like carefully polished knives” fuses sight with threat in five words. Spatial choreography is immaculate—floor and ceiling trade places, yet bodies never float untracked. Weather is not backdrop but engine: the storm’s red auroras braid the fragment, feeding the mutiny that rewrites the room.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prep-room’s citrus-ethanol death breath is not backdrop but tool: the gel that cools Arman’s skin doubles as scent-mask for the director. Spatial choreography is surgical—cart wheels clear the sink drain radius, camera blink interval timed to breath margin. The ink pot’s scarred glass becomes a lunar timeline that constrains the final signature. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the last image where the narrator’s stained fingerprint becomes evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Basin, glass shard, lamp, and bonsai needles form a micro-setting that actively constrains method and mood; ice squares force gilding adaptation, proving indispensable. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual refraction, tactile cold, auditory hum—mirrors the stationer’s attenuated attentions. Spatial choreography is clean across refracting beam and folding letters. Environment charges the final image: frozen halo fragments echo broken yet luminous histories.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Container labyrinth, catwalks, refrigerated vents, and oily water constellations are rendered through the narrator’s sieve-like attention; every sensory note doubles as tactical intel (“the port speaks in clanks and low vowels, telling me where to search next”). The poison-label object constrains the final gesture and is re-handled twice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across night-time approach to the widow’s warehouse stack; only minor moment—no anchor for how he exits the guarded yard unnoticed—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Observatory-as-instrument constrains tactics: the dome’s throat shapes resonance, the half-finished cello needs the cliff wind to speak. Shell, wood, and star-dust form a micro-setting triad that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: gulls are “unfinished thoughts,” star-dust is tasted, not seen. Spatial choreography stays clean across continuous scene; no off-stage leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Environment supplies the decisive tool—raft ballast console—activated through the chip’s grit, so the setting literally bends the plot. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered by Nessa’s planner gaze: she notes pigment codes, crowd flow, lantern wiring routes, never drifts into tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is impeccable from drum-barge to scaffold to hold; bodies and distances stay trackable. Weathered salt, solder burns, and paint viscosity body the city as working machinery rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The moonlit crater is rendered through instruments the narrator must handle—camera, ampoule, vials—so setting constrains every tactical move. Ancient snow seam, peppered basalt, and radio dishes supply tactile, visual, and acoustic layers without catalogue drift. Spatial choreography is immaculate: lip, seam, slope, array track without drift. The final image reweights the prior snow-and-silence motif, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog, wet rails, and harbor bells are not backdrop; they actively scramble the drone’s sonar and force the rain-basin innovation. The shop’s “circuits, brushes, and bowls” micro-setting constrains every beat; when wind ripples the bowls, the artisan’s entire geometry collapses. Spatial choreography is impeccable—porter shouts move left-to-right, chain clatter supplies auditory north. Only missing 9+ gate: no single environmental element recharges the final image; the drone lands warm, not the mist or rails.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Outpost iron, lake’s held breath, black water under culvert all constrain movement and supply tools (glass, valve) that charge final image. Frosted girders hum like teeth—setting mirrors inner tension. Patterned cold returns in every beat; no static postcard. Falcon as mobile setting piece re-weights at landing and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cobblestone micro-topography, bronze hairline crack, and fork-against-stone vibration give tactile constraints; the archway’s throat-clearing and the cistern’s breath integrate setting into action. Weather stays off-stage, but spatial choreography is clear and the fork-as-micro-setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment-tool symbiosis: crystal vial and limestone nave constrain tactics—vial’s emptiness dictates signal modulation, temple acoustics dictate placement. Micro-setting (belt spool, frieze fish) charges final transmitter nest. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: color drains to “bruise of brown,” sound narrows to hush-fold. Spatial choreography flawless—line, column, doorway surge tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse-prison is not backdrop: barred sightlines force prisoners to “see what they were not touching,” a constraint that shapes the narrator’s desire to cup silence. Copperlight, salt-green locks, gulls laughing like verdicts—each detail is filtered through the POV’s guilt-ear. The lattice acts as portable micro-setting; its squares physically throttle sound, enabling the final transfer. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → door → ribs → lens → drain.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass walls, graft scars, and the bead-anchored doorway constrain every tactic. Winter-cracked fields outside act as counter-pressure, making the internal night feel chosen rather than imposed. Sensory hierarchy follows the keeper’s priorities: soil warmth, sap scent, chime timbre. Final image—the bead hung in the doorway—recharges every prior pane-reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The red canyon breathes rust and thyme; mirror-basins remember storms—setting constrains pace and footfall. The tether functions as micro-setting, its knots dictating where Sera can safely retreat. Spatial choreography stays clean: left turn → throat → chamber → altar, all tracked with ink-dots. Only the town’s off-stage reaction keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arcade’s stone, benches, and chalk constrain every tactical move (kneeling, sliding, reading); the ‘ebony clipboard’ becomes micro-setting that warms under sun and vibrates under music—environment directly shapes the naming decision.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory is not backdrop; its brass rails, domes, and echoed silence are tactile tools that guide the embroidery ritual. The eternal candle functions as micro-setting—its flame bent "left, then right"—and directly constrains the final synchronicity beat. Weather (maple leaves as bead-choir) evolves with the coup rehearsal, mirroring internal tension. Only micro-slippage: spatial choreography of the "small desk" relative to the dome eyepiece is briefly floaty, but the candle re-anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mangrove is no backdrop; its blackwater mirror literally lifts the memory-page that bears Mara’s name, forcing the protagonist to re-see the hinge. Body-as-setting (palm scar that “keeps time like the tide”) and the shard-as-tool constrain tactics: when the shard dangles motionless, stillness is rehearsed. Spatial choreography is clean—skiff, lantern, heron, root—tracking across the single anchored beat. The final image of a “listening” path is charged by every prior sensory particular (salt-sanded gargoyle tooth, fogged glass syllables).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist-clad atrium and coral fragment function as micro-setting: the coral’s grooves steady the translator’s pauses, literally guiding speech rhythm, while the fog exteriorizes the treaty only legible by touch. Spatial choreography is clean—bedside table, sleeve reach, palm-turn—anchoring bodies. Weather and object constrain choice rather than decorate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sensory selection stays painterly—tangerine cart, pewter ladders, pith in pockets—each detail filters through the artist’s chromatic eye and steadies the hallucinatory fog. The orchard’s ruined architecture (branchless trees, bricked wells) constrains where projections can land, shaping the communal display. Micro-setting triumphs: the fresco shard’s pomegranate seeds become the color key that calibrates the final light-show, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “listening shells” parabolas, sun-warmed coping, and hairline crack function as micro-setting that directly constrains sonic restoration tactics and final image. Sound wave garden rules (echo returns clothed, temperature-shifting chords) are learned through action, never exposited. Spatial choreography is immaculate: coin rolls along coping, echo fingers trace vines, visitors lean into dishes. Final image—“map unfolding in the air”—recharges the nickel-as-map motif under the same curved geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass walls, hornworm surge, and lacewing punctuation directly shape tactic and climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—smell of pollen, slap of moths—guiding the “sideways breath” evasion. Spatial choreography tracks clean from trellis to threshold ribbon. No environmental constraint charges the final auditor foot-step more than the beans themselves, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Shell-as-body micro-setting constrains every choice (sleep, song, treaty signing) and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows poet-bias: ink-salt echo, nacre whorls, pressed sea-blooms. Spatial choreography remains coherent—drip-creak orchestra tracks across chambers. Weather/tide are integrated causally, not decorative. Lacks 9-band only because environment never actively threatens or limits physical mobility; it shelters more than it tests.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.5)
    The opal library, cloud-skin balloons, and lightning-glass cliff are not picturesque backdrop; they constrain every move—lantern swing, tether hum, balcony offering. The bamboo tube’s fracture and velvet pillow focus the entire drama into a single micro-setting that must be mended without muting its voice. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-biased: sound and touch dominate, sight is pearly half-light. Setting charges the final image—the chime’s ring travelling to rooftops—making the library both womb and transmitter.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ink well, lamp, and shelves function as micro-setting: the glass well “returns my face in wavering glyphs,” constraining caution; shelves “sigh,” guiding the choice to sing the pages. Salt-ravine flashback is anchored to present tactile cue (the quill dip), satisfying BRR. Auditory detail dominates—overtones, cadence, listening shelves—true to linguist POV. Final image of dawn uncoupling from night reweights the archive from tomb to threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The breathing volcano-amphitheater is not backdrop; its exhalations time every beat and the hidden sluice behind the stage supplies the physical compromise venue. The antique chain functions as micro-setting: its brass sag literally draws the equilibrium line that gates must follow. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—pressure is heard, tasted, smelled rather than seen. Minor slip: “dormant volcano” never clarified as geologically plausible yet still active; waver keeps it under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Attic as micro-setting constrains every tactical choice—dust motes become wind map, beam becomes perch, Mars chip counterweights slips. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: foxed atlases and buckled ledgers noticed first, smell of glue last, mirroring the archivist’s priorities. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, birds, boxes, hatch track cleanly. The final image reuses the skylight, now “blooming withering,” charging setting with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism terrace is both setting and tool: its glass seam is the literal threshold that must be palmed open, its color refraction supplies the final orchard projection. Micro-setting (bench grain) constrains the “intuit” action and directly maps the weather code—no other surface would serve. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drowned city is rendered through tactile, POV-filtered specifics—“glass fronds swayed like thought,” “reefs as constellations.” Environment constrains the breathing ritual and charges the final dome image, satisfying the 9-band gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across hatch, garden, lab, dome. A micro-slip: “seaweed-draped hatch” is the only anchor for depth/pressure, leaving submersive physics partly inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    The geode-cave is tactile—“light moves like patient fish,” seeds sprout underfoot—and the crater glass object functions as micro-setting that guides the vision beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; no props teleport. The cave never actively constrains exit or supplies resource scarcity, so environment informs but does not force the final tactic, keeping it just outside 9.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal arcade is no postcard; its salt-eaten ribs, moon-latticed water, and coin-polished stone actively coach every move. Micro-settings—ivory bishop on trembling reflection, chalk circle the tide gnaws into “confetti that refuses to drown”—literally steer the culminating skim-shot. Sensory hierarchy is performer-specific: scent of drying accordion bellows, nickel nebulae, sound-maps of plinks. Final image recharges the same pillars now breathing with restrained tide—setting as conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Body-as-setting (“shoulder became a sky”) and moonstone-as-micro-setting constrain every stroke of the verse; garden’s scent-shadow registry-free status enables the crime. Spatial choreography clean: basin, shoulder, cloth, forehead press track without drift. Sensory economy vivid (“petals hear vows without reporting them”) yet never stalls momentum. Environment reconfigures at end into “harbor of a shoulder,” charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is not backdrop but instrument: the salt film on glass, the bait-shack pond, the cranes coughing beyond the headland all constrain what can be built and salvaged. The micro-setting of the round pond functions as a tuning fork—its rings dictate the atrium’s geometry and the benches’ fate. Weather (mist as choir, winter deals) is treated as material to be cut and polished, not scenery. The ferry ramp’s ghost inside the architect’s arrows is a spatial memory that literally becomes seating, so environment charges the final image and tactics alike.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Moonlit ridge constrains every move: wind “arrives honest,” stone warms paper, ash field memory. Porcelain box functions as micro-setting—its brittle music against chest dictates cadence. Town lights blink like unopened eyes, mirroring refusal to forget. Final image recalibrates walker to sky—environment recharges stance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a tactile co-protagonist: tide, stone, skylit clefts, and the brass gauge constrain every motion. Sensory hierarchy mirrors the POV’s engineer-poet hybrid—pressure readings and cathedral calm in one breath. Spatial choreography is flawless; the moon-lit water surface is tracked as a working plane for the balloons. Final image: tide climbs “like a careful idea,” environment directly charging the conceptual reprice—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment (ivy-veined passage, half-sleeping coals, tide-stilted house) constrains every move—ivy dictates entry route, floor yields letter only after hopscotch shock, coals warm the negative. Sensory hierarchy mirrors cartographer bias: sound first, touch second, sight last. Spatial choreography is flawless; the sideways-curtsying house stays trackable. Final image—house rising on memory-stilts—recharges every prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and water-thread studio are filtered through a POV that notices light, scent, and drip rhythm; every detail bends toward the mirror-work. Micro-setting (pane, rafter droplets) directly constrains the breathing exercise that unlocks the first vision. Spatial choreography is clean: led downstairs, corridor of reflected gardens, final king-failed mirror. Weather residue (after-rain lanterns) quietly charges the closing “reef remembering sunlight.”

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace’s cracked stones brightened by fennel and thyme, the bowl of spent casings, and the children’s sheep in terraced shade all filter through the negotiator’s selective attention, grounding status shifts. Weather—coastal wind, dusk bluing into lantern moons—mirrors the cooling of rhetoric without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds: delegates place objects on the table, rise together, face the sea; bodies and bowl track cleanly. The micro-setting of the clipboard as “agreements clipped like folded wings” constrains the final act of clipping provisional accords, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Salt flat’s glittering crystals cut boots, constrain stance, and mirror the fractured grace of the mission. The drought-engineered basin acts as both stage and accomplice, guiding where cracks converge. Cracks-as-map, egg-as-bell, and chamber-as-resonator form micro-settings that charge the final resonance. Sensory detail is selective—sound of tuning fork, sting of salt—never catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prism sanctuary functions as both environment and tool: its glass throats literally refract starlight into the rainbow threads she manipulates, constraining her path—she must kneel, handle cold surfaces, work within its geometry. Snow courtyard supplies tactile pressure: frost translated “without complaint” becomes the surface she writes runes upon and later lifts to descend. Spatial choreography is flawless: bowl → grate → looms → return, each object’s state tracked.

    Sensory selection is acute: salt-cooled crown, warm ash breath of the ember grotto, starlight thick as wound. Each setting micro-shifts the queen’s options—ridge narrows path, grotto offers lantern alliance, cobalt cave presents the stone double. Environment-as-tool use peaks when starlight is daubed on her brow, literally unlocking the dream. The final image reuses the crescent mark to signal fused identity, meeting the 9+ gate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ember nexus is not backdrop but apparatus: sparks knit constellations that the protagonists must calibrate rather than merely admire. The nautilus columella curl functions as micro-setting—its spiral gutter literally guides the pocket sun’s bead, constraining the final calibration. Sensory economy favors tactile heat over visual catalog; twilight is felt as “eclipse shadow” temperature shift. One hairline over-ornament: “moths that have learned metallurgy” momentarily swerves the POV diction toward fey, but the image pays off by charging the ash crownlets that settle on hair.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The birch bark scroll operates as micro-setting: its scrapable surface and glittering ink literally constrain how the protagonist can read/rewrite time. Cabin stove, frost patterns, and rasping snow are filtered through a ranger’s professional eye for weather and fuel. Spatial choreography is clean—floor rising like a wave keeps bodies and kettle tracked in the dream ascension. Final image of stovepipe underlining the sky charges the closure with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fog, drip, brass, and cracked ceramic are filtered through a nose that no longer smells—every sensory note is inverted, selective, and urgent. The shop’s micro-geography (basin, siphon, lamp, thermos) constrains every gesture; the screw’s exact fit is felt in the fingertips of two strangers. Environment and body fuse in the final image: the clepsydra becomes a surrogate infant cradled against the chest, water-pulse substituting for heartbeat. No postcard filler; each detail is handled, weighed, or listened to under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Floating basalt platform, ink crystallizing under stress, and storm-rimmed sky are not backdrop but tactical constraints: the cup surface must stay level, breath must fit between thunder rolls.

Final image of pearled footprints is environment re-weighted, satisfying 9-gate, but spatial choreography of “march to control deck” is briefly fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting acts as micro-instrument: guardrail “tired eyelid,” scaffold fabric city, river-light pixelating through lattice—all constrain movement and sight, forcing the protagonist to kneel, read, then play. Mountain pullout is not postcard but crucible; wind and traffic provide live metronome that the fiddler must play against. Final image—bridge trusses applausing—returns environment as active agent, sealing the ledger receipt.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Environment is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered: salt-flat wind, peeling lion decals, kettle steam in half-lit car. The train itself constrains movement—no hallway escapes, only linear cars—so spatial limits quietly shape tactical choices. Weather and sound (distant trucks, breathing rails) mirror internal dilapidation without overt symbolism. The foreign bills taped above bunks function as micro-setting objects that evolve state and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory itself—red lamps, dome gears clicking, Cepheid vow—functions as micro-setting that constrains how and when they can “translate light into grammar.” Sensory selection skews auditory (domes click) and tactile (paper stones), reflecting chronicler’s night-trained perception. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene; no floating props. Setting subtly guides choice: only variable stars at this hour can unlock the glyphs.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The swirling orchard-vortex is not backdrop but tactical obstacle: raft angles against its current, branches drop fog only after truth is hauled. Sensory hierarchy obeys druid bias—sound of creaks, cold thread tug, taste of static—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: raft, gunwale, pouch, lantern, mayor onshore track without drift. Micro-setting objects (bone whistles, kelp lines, seed) constrain method and final image; coin in pocket recharges earlier “receipt” motif, gating 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is micro-focused on graft, bark, wax paper, and reflective pool—each object constrains movement and charges the final image when the pool rises “like a plate.” Selective sensory triangulation (scent of clipped decisions, scar tingling) keeps economy tight. Place anchors remain surreal but internally consistent, supporting lyric mode. The glade’s cobalt hue and eclipse function as environmental pressure without drifting into postcard tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but instrumental: the bone-hand cupping earth becomes the planting site that enables the closing contract, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory triage matches urgency— candle soot, brass light, root-knuckles—while spatial choreography stays clean across the lantern swings and seed scattering. Slight over-milk of “bones chimed whenever a breeze lost its way” is the only decorative excess preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The trailer’s rusted squat, rock-dust frost, and puddles flecked with mica are filtered through the POV’s roadie eye—“evaporated applause” is character-specific. Spatial choreography is clean: door wheeze, locker on desk, narrator’s boots. Micro-setting (the cloth) constrains the final choice and charges the last image. Weather and quarry bowl serve as acoustic memory, mirrored in “echo valley longing.”

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but active crucible: filings swim to rail-lines, trunks settle like sentences, the tuned soil decides whether the seed will bear silence. Micro-setting—the pouch of woven reeds, the cradle of filings—constrains the planting gesture and charges the final helix image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: a cuneiform hand notices grooves before color, the translator hears grammar in bark pulses. Weather is not picturesque but argumentative, and the arbor listens, guiding the protagonist’s breath-bridge tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal atrium, creel, and bell-metal corner are tactile micro-settings that constrain procedure (filing, smelting, word-catching) and return charged in the final hush; salt, kelp, and bell-resonance mirror the migratory identity stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quartz spire functions as micro-setting that physically crowns the pearl, charging the final image; the cave’s hush and light-veins constrain the inspector to turn off sensors and later to listen instead of seal.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The station’s green chapel and the sluice gate’s rust scars are not backdrop; they narrow options by offering only one viable path—through the graffiti, through the gate, into the water. The accordion bellows functions as micro-setting: its patched tape embodies the brother’s patched lung and dictates the narrator’s breathing rhythm at the climax. Ivy, rails, and culvert mouth evolve causally with the narrator’s discoveries; no detail is static. Final image—the stick margin—grounds the reconfiguration in tactile place.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glowing library in mist is no backdrop; its breathing windows and legible curls of fog actively negotiate entry, forcing the protagonist to translate pauses into proof. Micro-setting inside the watch—gears etched as cipher—constrains every tactical choice (turning screws by degree, matching breath to stuttered ticks). Sensory hierarchy favors hush and glimmer, narrowing perception to what can be heard or half-seen, exactly fitting a quest for unspoken words. The final image of a corridor “shining like an unwound spring” recharges every prior mechanical detail, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The velvet dome, midsummer heat, and ice violin constrain every tactic: heat literally perforates destiny by melting the instrument. Micro-setting (coffee cup, stained saucer-as-star-map) doubles as tool and divination surface, re-weighted in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Ilya’s plant-mediated perception, keeping description purposeful and plot-functional.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Skyborne conch-grotto, aurora veins, chip glass, and porcelain tap all constrain tactics: the aurora supplies the “static” the device drinks, the grotto’s isolation prevents outside rescue, the chip’s green kiss is the only possible interface. Sensory hierarchy stays mortician-specific—notice the cooling rails, the mathematical fold of cloths. No extra geographic fat; each detail either enables or limits the ritual. Setting charges the final image: aurora pales but leaves the “shawl of air.”

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Grotto, clouds, juniper, and hairpin function as micro-settings that directly constrain action: the slit accepts only the comb-shaped pin; the stool dictates caretaking posture; scalloped map seeds must fit the root bed. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias—iron-grape taste, vineyard hush—integrating setting into emotional stakes. Final image charged by these constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lighthouse gallery, wind-raked and chime-strung, is not backdrop but instrument: the breeze literally votes through scavenged metal pipes, constraining the choice. Micro-setting object—the cloak stitched from campaign banners—physically billows with doubt, charging the final image as Lark buttons it against the rail. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-biased: narrator clocks “gulls keep time” before town geometry, aligning with his hired-watchman attention. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean across climb and stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating platform, magnetic grotto, and pond-as-mirror constrain every beat; the setting is the clock that keeps them aloft and the mirror that teaches vanishing. Sensory detail is selective—“sycamore hush,” “lake smoke and copper”—and the final image of dawn moving hush to sparrow recharges the opening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The towers of bone, seep-mirror, and corded arrowhead function as micro-setting—each constrains the skimmer’s listening stance and is charged in the final cast. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: sound > sight > touch. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible shifts.

    Icebound spire, broken steps, and the keystone notch constrain every move; environment literally flexes under the protagonist’s test. Selective sensory hits—cold ringing in teeth, fog braiding like rope—mirror internal hesitation without tourist catalog. The body becomes micro-setting when burnt hands decide the stone is set. No object or place is described without altering next tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Kelp curtains, silt-furred books, ribs of the ship yawning like wet timbered bells—every descriptor is filtered through the lamplighter’s nocturnal, tidal attention. The hotel skeleton key tag functions as micro-setting: its brass oval against his throat constrains the choice to leave his own vow pressed into the ledger, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; the drift nudges him, lantern-shadows rest on shoulders like temporary birds, anchoring body and tool. Environment, body, and object all participate in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ambered dome functions as micro-setting: its gyro rotation physically constrains the final listening angle, charging the closure image. Coins as planet-objects are tactile, weight-bearing, and re-used (“their faces stitched a pattern”). Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under crisis. No extraneous astronomical exposition; world-rules emerge through action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory’s cracked lens, wax cylinders, and salt-eaten acoustics actively constrain tactics: only through “scattered light” can the reaper read the broken syllables. Body-as-setting appears in the trembling hand that steadies the atlas page against the glass, a micro-choice that decides whether Miren’s figure will settle or fly apart. Weather and environment (dusk light, brine metronome) are filtered through grief-narrowed perception, never touristic. Final image—the scythe answering with “a thin, kind star”—charges the tool with emotional cost, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting; only slight over-painting in the ivy-softening line holds it short of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is not backdrop but instrument: the salt-scarred viaduct joint, the reed metronome, and the fractured bell’s lip literally guide the water drops that re-synchronize time. Sensory economy is perfect—breathing-through-damp-cloth sea, chalk on rough sleeve—each detail selected for tactical use in Efan’s experiment. Micro-setting (the bell as bridge) directly enables the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean as Efan crouches, taps, threads, and finally sets the bell across stones.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Reservoir mud prints bones, rusted street signs, sapphire label lacquered by time—each tactile detail filters through the warden’s professional eye. The grove’s stone seats and mirrored hush of water constrain the final choice, literalizing “meeting place.” Micro-setting succeeds: the label’s blue flourish reappears in mentor’s script, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions as he kneels, pockets, walks the cracked flats.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting triumph: the reliquary, flame-cup, and copper waterfall beam constrain every tactical choice. Kaleidoscopic waterfall is never decorative—its six moods of light meter Iri’s internal clock and final color shift signals closure. Spatial choreography pristine: we track her path from veil entrance → root nest → grass press without drift. Orientation anchor (“auburn-haired alchemist stepped through the mist”) lands at word 14; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor’s creak, the rope’s hunger, the lantern’s green-blue fog—each tactile detail constrains the next tactical move.

Micro-setting (the jar) literally vibrates to approve the final choice, constraining the custody decision.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective sensory triage—damp planks, cedar-ozone breath, gutter rattle—mirrors Mara’s narrowed attention. Micro-setting (seed pot) constrains her final gesture; its prior black-light life recycles into new stakes. Spatial choreography flawless: envelope → floor → window → soil → pot tucked beneath note. Brook as metronome threads throughout, recharging the last image (“kept her secret”).

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The echo chamber tunnel is rendered with sonic particularity—whispers return “heavier,” rain becomes “cymbals of tin and sorrow”—and this acoustic alchemy directly charges the closure. Spatial grounding is deliberately dreamlike, yet bodies and machines remain trackable: vents snake to the basement, the pull cord is fingered, knuckles redden. The tunnel’s rule-set (it returns only what you risk) constrains the conductor’s tactic of yanking multiple cords, so the micro-setting passes the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen garden, mist, and arrested sundial shadow are not backdrop—they are tools that force the waiting stance and make exile tactile. The bead’s “small sunrise refuses to cross the line” literally draws the boundary the narrator must internalize. Every descriptive stroke is filtered through the POV’s homesick perceptual lens, so setting and body are indivisible.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Furnace breathing, warm-penny air, ash grate—details are filtered through alchemical POV and constrain every tactical nudge. Micro-setting (crozier’s spiral, coals’ conspiracy) doubles as tool and terrain, charging the final image. Spatial choreography tight: crozier rolled, slid, snapped, fed—no impossible moves. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses underplayed, keeping below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)

Spatial choreography is immaculate across the climb. Micro-setting (velvet box, lightning scar) doubles as tool and wound, directly enabling the climax. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, matching the interpreter’s vocation. One hairline slip: “city laughed with me” is sonic but sourceless; still, environment indelibly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    The spectral grotto’s star-varnished water and dripping letter-ceiling are not backdrop but tooling: the mirrored constellations supply the exact grid the narrator aligns with wake-trails to force the timeline merge. The hourglass functioning as micro-setting—filled sideways, flipped “across”—constrains the final choice and charges the last image. Every sensory pick is filtered through ferry-hand priorities: the “bulkheads hum like a beehive of calendars,” a sound only a live-aboard would notice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the boat grazes “a seam of cold” and the mast-scrape leaves star-scars that persist into the frost-timetables.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Gallery walls, warping floors, and dust-speck vents act as tactile antagonists, forcing stance adjustments; the sinew thread serves as micro-setting that literally ties light, dust, and bodies into a mutable bridge.

    Canal, lock, slime-green seal, and sundial compose a micro-setting that actively resists or yields to the protagonist’s leverage; the twilight parchment ribbon guides literal navigation. Sensory hierarchy favors cold, sound, and weight—perfect for salvage. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff kiss to warehouse quay. The seal stamp and angled flood-gates embed social rules inside physical objects, constraining later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment (golden boards under snow, fog-lamped harbor) constrains every move: cold slows fingers, fog narrows perception to rope and seed, dock’s tick enforces patience. The fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting—warm conduit inside the mitten—altering tactics (listening stance, seed-breathing). Spatial choreography is flawless: skiff, bollard, coils, seeds laid in a row, all tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy follows collector’s bias: smell of hemp over brine, hush over color, texture of fray over visual panorama. Final image recharges the golden varnish memory-color, now weight-shifted onto seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden’s quince, moth-bit coat, copper-kelp air, and the fountain’s cracked lip all double as emotional instruments—objects that constrain distance, dictate seating geometry, and finally applaud the woman’s weeping by fruit-fall; the thread itself functions as micro-setting, its tension dictating when the bridge of presence can be crossed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is protagonist: hanging corridors, gear-lit ravine, rose-window aerie constrain every tactical choice—materials for cradle scavenged from palace itself. Sensory hierarchy obeys prince’s attention—velvet threadbare against brass cold, harp strings “remembering storms”—micro-setting (egg shell, cradle peg) charges final image when feathered light lands on “every bolt.” No scale creep: entire mechanical world implied through selective stalactite/palace details. 9+ gate met: environment shapes tactics and final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-settings—black-sand pinch, coin pendulum, olive seedling—function as tactile tools that constrain tactics. Obsidian lagoon mirrors internal glass-edge while remaining a real geothermal vent; choreography stays clean. Sensory economy favors salt-lava-kelp triad, never tourist catalogue. Final image of coin above hose rack re-weights workplace sanctum, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stained glass box functions as micro-setting: its angled light literally creates the stepping-stone ovals, constraining every downstream move. “City of forgotten fountains” is never museum-tour; tiles of fish and eyes, lime-streaked statues, vapor on tile all feed POV-selective attention and thematic drought. Spatial choreography is flawless—tracks from plaza to arcade to eye-tiled fountain without drift. Environment, tool, and recurring object jointly charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nebula garden, brass gear, and sonar pings are specific sensory anchors; the cool lantern-petals constrain tactics by replacing ship-flame. Spatial choreography holds across the single orchard walk. The micro-setting of the gear in palm recharges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Greenhouse ribs “singing like tide,” condensation “small planets,” dirt path glowing “as if the floor remembered sunlight” are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain action: the singing glass accepts each chisel tap as a measured tide, determining carving rhythm. The cracked roof and lettuce beds provide spatial staging for the father’s steadied breath; butterfly feet on syllables literalize the setting’s veto power over ornament. Final image: kite-curve cut shallow into marble under a sky “ash gold,” environment and object fused into one charged micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    Tidal obsidian ridge, brass-scarred pendulum, and rake-handle-as-micro-setting constrain every tactical move; the ridge’s hiss and mirror-shards physically underfoot charge the final shared launch, while the tower’s salt-scarred gears body the moral stakes—no description is ornamental, all is handled.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Selective sensory detail (velvet unwinding, migrating echoes, asters’ stubborn color) filters through the gardener’s professional eye; the silo’s metal ribs and the ring of asters function as micro-settings that constrain digging and planting choices. The cobalt silo under stars re-appears in the final line, now “charted by mercy,” re-weighting the atmosphere. One hairline slip: the poplar limb break is mentioned once and never felt again, keeping this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian spire’s trapped heat and the lake’s “slow thunder” actively shape the cartographer’s need for a tempered, hinge-based solution; environment literallyPresses against decision. The kingfisher’s dive through the one unfrozen oval recharges every prior image of fracture and canal, making the setting co-protagonist. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (silence, knife-bright air) without checklist excess. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single room.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alcove, radio dial, and drifting ash function as micro-setting: they constrain listening posture, hide the illegal signal, and literally provide the “pages” on which dust writes. Selective sensory economy—glow as “small lunar theater,” ash “warm as memory”—mirrors the narrator’s attenuated attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: shawl cloaks glow, moths orbit dial, floor murmurs after ash is blown. Weather (needle-snow, thistled calm) externalizes the barbed hush that defines the broadcast’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rocking chair functions as micro-setting: its joints’ tired metronome literally times the family’s secrets and is carried to the gallery where its final rock becomes the closure image. Ash is tactile—paper dust smells of “singed sugar,” sticks to binder, greys the jar rims—constraining how the narrator handles each brushstroke. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track the chair from hallway shadow to skylight circle without a single pronoun drift. Light through the mask’s kintsugi rivers is the visual signature that charges the final image, making the chair’s motion feel like a cathedral bell tolling inside a bone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    The chalk‐marked flood wall, the barnacled sluice wheel, and the soggy strata of drowned pamphlets are not backdrop—they are the tools that save the lower quarter. The environment literally steers the body: footing on algae, timing of tide, housing of the orphanage. Sensory triage mirrors urgency—smell of rot, metallic scrape of cog, cold water at shins. One minor flicker: the exact spatial relation of tunnel-to-dock could be one sentence sharper, but the final image of the wheel “snapping into place” re-charges every prior detail.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet library is not backdrop; its curtains “like patient throats” and shelves “breathing through spines” literally absorb the choir’s sound, turning setting into resonating chamber that later “exhaled dust and memory.” Autumn is handled as “a hush made visible,” a sensory filter that narrows perception to listening. The rosette serves as micro-setting: handled, dropped, caught, and finally warmed by every palm, its changing state tracks the evening’s arc. Spatial choreography stays coherent—cabinet, table, music stand, doorway—without white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains every move—glass shards in soil, copper-veined leaves brushing cracked panes—so environment literally shapes pruning choices. Weather (wind rehearsing old song) and planetary light curve act as timers, forcing the chef to taste faster.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tower’s metal scent and “stormfruit” capacitors are tactile tools that calibrate the final image; the lacquer box is handled in three states—hidden, opened, surrendered—charging the closure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly up the iron stairs; bodies never ghost. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: the keeper notices honey smells and waggle coordinates, not street names. Environment constrains the pivotal choice—only the crown platform can mate lightning to crystal—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bay, body-as-setting, and orris shard all constrain tactics: tide-light pulls thread-needle, shard warms or stays cold determining next cottage. Selective sensory filtering (“damp rope and dill,” “broom lodged under a chair”) mirrors POV bias. Micro-setting (stair grain fitting beetle tin) directly charges the final image. No environment-driven choice failure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Foxglove-stained glass, coral wrist, eelgrass filament—every object is handled, not catalogued, and each constrains the threading action. The underwater garden’s pressure (plankton storm risk, barnacle ushers) directly enables/disables moves. Final image of “patient gold” sunlight through empty ampoule recharges the tint’s earlier warning/hymn duality. Spatial choreography across dome crack, bronze bench, founder statue is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Infinite staircase taught immediately; its rule—motion without arrival—constrains every tactical move (dice rolls, chalk lemmas). Micro-setting: dice, crack, chalk are tactile, handled repeatedly, and charge the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and sight; breath-mirror metaphor threads through without overwriting. Spatial logic stable; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rooftop greenhouse under smog-choked moonlight is rendered through peppery tomato vines, glass filmed with city exhale, mint that “remembered rain”—details that constrain available tools and light for painting. Spatial choreography is clean: brushbox beside wilted basil, folding stool, neighbor’s placement of the paper kite. Weather (saffron haze, moon coins) directly governs visibility and painting method. Micro-setting (brush, saucer of moonwater) doubles as crucial props that enable the closing stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Grotto, waterfall mist, and bee-smell constrain every move (ovens from cisterns, crumbs into wax). The green lens functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid that literally rewrites walls, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: children notice candle flicker, elders track driftwood fires. No static postcard; place evolves with each bread-letter launched into spray.

The hunger stone’s pulse literally charges the closing image. Salt-sweat, pitch, and orchard-wind anchor era without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Abandoned carnival funhouse constrains tactical movement: rusted hinges demand the clasp, fluorescent afterglow crawls like algae to blur visual bearings. Opera-clasp-as-tool alters two beats—opens the laughing mouth then unlocks the daylight slit—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual/tactile, matching photographic curse; gasoline-mothball air anchors timeline post-resuscitation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating orchard is never static backdrop; its hull chalk, slosh timbre, and leeward angle constrain every tactical placement of crate, oar, and pineapple. Micro-setting—the lacquered mallet head, the bee swarm ceiling—directly shapes the final acoustic shield. Sensory hierarchy obeys the prophet’s ear-centric vocation: sound leads, sight follows, touch arrives via vibration. Because the driftwood circle’s physical limits steer the climax (the tower of crates must fit the deck), the 9+ gate is satisfied; the slight reserve reflects a wish for one more smelled or tasted detail to widen the bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is not backdrop but pressure plate: shell ridges dictate footfall, algae roofs gauge wind, turtle motion limits escape.

One hairline slip: “forbidden horizons” is abstract amid otherwise concrete sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog, salt, rope-taste, and barge-throttled horizon are filtered through a navigator’s trained eye; no tourist catalog. The red kayak deck, galaxy-mud footprints, and eelgrass grounding are tactile anchors that alter tactics—draft, trim, push-off. The astronomical compass as micro-setting constrains the final image: its brass becomes the literal weight that steadies the ribcage. Weather shifts from clinging worry to lifted veil exactly synchronized with interior tilt—environment performs the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bioluminescent lake is not backdrop but active creditor: its algae-comet tails illuminate the narrator’s confession, the pillar-jars enforce the moral ledger. Bench-seat dock and melted street-sign hull tether the underworld to the city above. Exact, sensory idiom (“water whispered with algae”) constrains the skiff’s path and charges the final image of stained rings.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is never catalogued; instead, ‘apples shining like moons within the moon’ and ‘beasts with velvet feet’ supply micro-setting that actively guides the ritual—every sensory detail is filtered through the narrator’s spell-bound priorities and charges the final image where scent-keeper breath becomes the new orchard language.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The midnight glade above clouds is evoked through frost-petaled grasses, lantern insects swinging “abdomen lamps like pendulums,” and clouds stacked into staircases—details that constrain movement and supply the literal path downward. The saucer’s porcelain channel and the birthday tablecloth function as micro-settings that guide the card placement and hand-tracing ritual, directly shaping the rite’s success. Spatial choreography is clean: the narrator pockets the crib mobile’s moons, climbs, lays cards, descends, returns.

Minor wish for more body-in-space orientation during Captain’s entrance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is weaponized: cliff lip and frictionless season literally decide how bodies can anchor or slide; the aurora’s pressure is metered through “singing wire” and “velvet gravity.” Painted rock weights and colored nets make math tactile, charging the final spiral. Micro-object—the emptied pouch—carries the price at the end, qualifying for 9+ gate. Only the village geography stays sketch; spatial tracking inside the spiral is impressionistic, not crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory dome operates as micro-setting: its brass switchboard, milky camera eye, and lightning-fed wires constrain every choice the poet makes. Storm-wet air thins lungs, forcing slower breath that matches the timer’s tick; altitude and weather together decide when masks slip. Spatial choreography is clean: steps up, envelope exchanged, chart spread beneath boots, finger tracing ash-lines.

Final image of cracked soil “like lips” ties setting directly to closure, charging the land as both wound and mouth awaiting story-seeds. Every detail serves pressure or payoff—no white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges every turn: drowned trees “ring,” shipwrecks “chime,” and the ashen forge tempers silence. The setting functions as both instrument and archive, with shells on twigs “remember[ing] storms by salted scars,” directly enabling calibration. Crucially, the environment shapes the climax: the aurora bleeds into the forge to cool the compass into a listening bowl, and the final image ties cellular mitosis in trees to human healing. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure without white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    The emerald station functions as micro-setting: its green tiles amplify moonbeams, its freight door hides destiny, and its turnstile of sycamores channels action. The jar of moonbeams—a tool-as-setting—constrains choice (sweetening shadows, opening bouquets, reviving photos). Sensory detail is selective and urgent: bitter-clean scent, velvet moth wings, cold oil-and-stars air. Every environmental element charges the final image where moths “stitch our way with translucence,” tying setting to thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned control room functions as micro-setting: ice-laced consoles constrain action (melting must be wiped, circuits dead), while the kiln—a dragged-in artifact—enables transformation. Crucially, the environment charges closure: meltwater “ran with a sound like paper being forgiven” directly echoes the bookmark’s narrative weight, binding physical thaw to emotional release. Sensory hierarchy reflects Arlen’s priorities—sound of dripping ice, smell of brine in flasks, tactile warmth of glass—never tourist cataloging. The recurring bookmark and melting ice evolve causally, altering tactics (wiping switches, timing work to thaw) and crystallizing the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting: iron stacks groan like ships, skylight enables constellation alignment, ladder hides the steel box—all constrain choices. The seashell and cast are tactile extensions of environment, their textures woven into action (“plaster painted with galaxies,” “rope over wood” murmur). Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (focus on touch/sound over sight), and the final roof scene uses spatial choreography to heighten vulnerability. Setting charges closure: stars witness reconciliation without judgment, making the library an active participant, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the storm-tossed ridge fort isn’t backdrop but co-agent—the salt-stung knuckles, broken battlement, soaked stones all constrain choices and charge the ending. The “ambered hush” of towers and black sea aren’t decorative but shape perception and tactics (e.g., holding lantern away from wind’s ear). Gold leaf bruising like “ripened fruit” ties object to environment with irreplaceable specificity. Final image of star as “nail” and sea as “single muscle” reconfigures the entire spatial logic with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting and active constraint: snow dictates tread movement, frost shapes the violin, twilight triggers its appearance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“pale pines lean… flagstones glazed with quiet”), never touristic. The environment charges the final image—the violin “shines through me, as if thoughts were light”—and directly enables the central action (sweeping, playing). Weather alters tactics (salt trail, generator hum in F-sharp) and evolves causally across loops.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crystal forecourt isn’t backdrop but crucible: rain-slicked puddles become “glass throats” that “know,” crystals “chime” as witnesses, and tarps stitch the screen—all constraining choice (e.g., projecting between “rain columns”). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: post-rain hush sharpens focus on visual/tactile cues (lens, doodles). The setting’s rules—silence, reflection-as-agreement—are consistent and pressure-coherent. Final ripples across shoes charge closure by merging environment and emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)

    Setting operates as both environment and tool: the Sluice’s scrap-metal architecture (“rib cages of buses,” “skins of refrigerators”) directly enables the phonograph trade and shapes tactile interaction. The cracked wasteland isn’t backdrop—it constrains movement (“no wheel could chew through”) and supplies the relay’s materials (rebar, copper crow). Final image is charged by setting: the scarecrow tower only functions because it’s built from the same logic of salvage that defines the protagonist’s worldview. Sensory specificity (gusts like “a door learning to breathe”) filters through POV without tourist detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.4)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: stars drift unnaturally, time stretches footsteps, glass magnifies temporal shells.

Sensory detail is purposeful: salt-sweating stones, brass-and-pitch hands, bone-and-lead yoyo—all filtered through the clockmaker’s profession and obsession. The environment charges the final image: wind from beyond smells of “orchards I had never planted,” making the refused future visceral. Every object ties to theme and tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse operates as micro-setting that constrains every choice—the laughing mouth as lock, mirrors as identity editors, clown pedestal as altar. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “rain rolled in mothballs and gasoline,” “bulbs glowed like bruises,” “afterglow crawling like algae.” The environment actively pressures tactics (e.g., using the clasp to pick the door) and charges the final image (daylight as “crack in painted night”). Recurring objects (clasp, dictionary, camera) are tactile and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting—a sentient orchard afloat on driftwood—is not backdrop but active constraint and resource. Every object (fruit, crates, oars, pineapples) functions as instrument or map. The blue hour’s indigo brine and cloud-hem mouth directly shape tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite lyric compression; the body (wrists “quick as rain”), tools (mallet), and environment co-evolve under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.6)
    The turtle-shell city isn’t backdrop—it constrains movement (roofs as paths), shapes perception (swaying streets), and charges the ending (turtles keep vast time as protagonist walks toward erasure). Tools (whistle, maps) and body (sandals, heel on shell) function as micro-settings that directly enable or pressure decisions. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through cartographic obsession—algae roofs, salt scars, bleached limpets—all serve pattern language and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ivy-choked station functions as micro-setting: rails swallowed by moss constrain access, the broken roof admits sky that illuminates evidence, and lockers cough soot that stains the historian’s hands. Every atmospheric detail filters through the POV’s professional bias—brick whispering memory, ledger as illuminated manuscript. The setting charges the final image: rain of ivy seeds like “shy reporters” validates the act of witnessing. Environment directly enables the recapture and frames its moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    The submerged pavilion isn’t backdrop but active constraint: water depth dictates access, silt obscures then reveals, and the service door’s rust seals narrative urgency. Tools (tripod, inkwell) and body (boots, hands wrestling the latch) function as micro-settings that shape every choice. The final image—pavilion brightening “as if memory were bioluminescent”—charges the setting with thematic resonance without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sunken library isn’t backdrop but active constraint: silt, brine-swollen drawers, duct-clicking crabs, and tidal groans shape every move. The pearwood stamp—a micro-setting—charges the final image, its violet ink and cracks embodying fragile authority. Even the body becomes setting (“stillness take me by the wrists”), grounding perception in tactile specificity that never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.6)
    The glass basilica isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges the narrative: its prisms seed the maker’s lungs with color, its nave hosts the altar of sky, and its structure dictates the spiral ascent that deepens air into cellar-taste. The floating island’s tether shifts in response to emotional climax, and tea shrubs move “like sleeping lungs,” mirroring internal rhythm. Tools (lenses, brass reeds) and body (spit-polished stones, stinging eyes) function as micro-settings that shape choice. Final image—lanterns drifting over guests’ softened eyes—is charged by every prior atmospheric detail.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the floating observatory isn’t backdrop but active constraint—it drifts, tilts, houses cooling circuits, and positions the protagonist above the basin. The geode crystal under skin acts as embodied setting, its facets teaching attention-bending. Every atmospheric detail (green-bruised sky, moth-colored light, unspooling village lights) filters through the protagonist’s physicist-poet perception and charges the final image. Weather, tools, and body cohere into a single resonant environment that shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ancient observatory functions as micro-setting: its brass gears, fissured stones, and slit of sky directly constrain choices (pulling the rope, guiding drones along cornices). “Brilliant dimness” evolves from atmosphere to conceptual anchor, charging the final image where night trusts them with missing pieces. Sensory detail is selective (propellers whispering, photons and doubt, knees wearing constellations smooth) and filtered through the pilot’s professional gaze. The dome’s rotation and city below reflect internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as micro-setting and constraint: the cobalt terrace frames emotional stasis, while Parliament of Wood—a shore where “the tide leaves minutes… like letters addressed to no one”—enables the story’s resolution. Driftwood carvings aren’t backdrop but active archive; the watch hand’s salt-stained state ties environment to character history. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: gulls stitch “commas,” wind sifts “a sieve of reed mats,” and dusk light renders the watch hand “alight… like a compass.” The sea’s role as witness (“accepted the paper as if it already knew”) charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storm-worn parapet functions as micro-setting that constrains choreography (“slick teeth of stone”), pressures choices (limited visibility, narrow space), and charges the final image (widening only after exchanges). Weather and mist evolve causally—from “furrowed hush” to thinning—and mirror internal stakes. The drawer pull acts as object-as-setting, its brass “remember[ing] both names.” Sensory detail is selective and urgent: footsteps “like a sentence being considered,” wind pressing mist “until we had only each other.”

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coastal setting isn’t backdrop but active constraint: fog limits visibility, pilings echo judicial guilt, eelgrass grounds the father’s boat. Crucially, the utility poles function as micro-setting—they guide navigation and charge the final image (“humming grid”). Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (salt, rope, hum) then calm (saplings, dunes). The astronomical compass as tool constrains choice by embodying past failure and present resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underground bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice—the glowing rock, algae-whispering water, and jar-crowned machines shape tactics and culminate in the skiff’s comet-tail illumination. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (cooling air, blushing stone), filtered through the narrator’s jaded wonder. The environment directly enables the climax: the lake’s reaction validates truth-telling. Final image ties setting to stance—“tie the skiff to shore” becomes moral anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight functions as micro-setting and active crucible: apples shine like moons, roots accept treaties, wind braids with steam. Crucially, it constrains choice—beasts respond to mortar-as-bell, soil demands slips—and charges the closure (dew inside apples, sap-climbing fortune). Sensory specificity (velvet feet, early-pear eyes, comet-dust smoke) avoids cliché while deepening mood. Every detail serves the ritual of reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    The midnight glade functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: frost-petaled grasses, lantern insects, and cloud-staircases aren’t backdrop but active participants—their pendulum lamps mark seconds, their dimming honors ritual. The saucer and onyx ink serve as tool-setting hybrids that dictate the rite’s form. Crucially, the glade’s physics enable the descent into the moonlit undersea, making the chamber of stalled seconds spatially and thematically inevitable. Final image (“clouds dazzling like scales on a sleeping leviathan”) reconfigures the environment as both cradle and witness, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its albums, greenhouse, and bulkhead scale constrain tactics and charge the ending. Salt veins from dried tears on photographs guide navigation—a tactile, sensory-specific system that merges environment with emotion. The kwan yin’s tear cools pulse and weighs compassion, directly enabling balance at the lock. Final sprouts in the greenhouse reconfigure desolation into fragile hope, tying setting to thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The black sand beach, basalt shelves, and wet rope aren’t backdrop—they constrain movement, anchor bottle placements, and dictate where “sand remembered.” The recurring jars function as micro-setting: their light draws characters into prearranged paths, directly shaping evacuation tactics. Final image—fireflies drifting upward against ash-curtained stars—charges transformation through environmental juxtaposition. Sensory specificity (gritty shore, salt-shimmer, tidal hush) filters through Mara’s tactile urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    The luminous fort functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its architecture (stair, banner, bastion, workshops) constrains movement and enables coded communication, while tools like the sundial and quill holder shape tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful (“coals dream under ash,” “wires rest like snakes”) and filtered through the sentinel’s craft-trained attention. The setting evolves causally—from oppressive spectacle to collaborative hearth—and charges the closure: dimming the fort literally reshapes how the town sees itself. Every spatial cue tracks cleanly, with no white-room syndrome or floating geography.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    The tidal bluff under aurora isn’t backdrop but active crucible: frictionless stone dictates movement, auroral pressure tunes painted rocks, and collapsing star dust responds to celestial mood. The setting constrains every tactic—rocks must be placed despite slipping ground, eels rise only when numbers cast nets—and charges the final image as the pouch and gleaming stones hold the shore to a “course it could believe.” Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early focus on glimmering footprints gives way to tactile star dust and cold silver eel-halos. Environment and body fuse; the cliff trembles as stakes peak.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    The observatory isn’t backdrop but crucible: its stormlit dome channels lightning into “arterial lines,” making the city’s pain “navigable.” The darkroom timer, brass switchboard, and ash-constellation photograph constrain choices and charge the ending—the timer stops at thunder’s crest, aligning exposure with revelation. Weather actively shapes action (“air admits its ghosts”), and spatial choreography (steps, railing, chart on floor) remains precise. The setting functions as a living archive of trauma and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    The atrium functions as micro-setting: glass panes refract light to enable decoding, the brook’s cadence mirrors Liese’s voice, and spatial choreography remains exact during fencing. The needle card and sundial aren’t props but environmental constraints that shape choices. Final image (“glass became sky drawn near”) charges closure by transforming setting into threshold. Sensory detail is selective—light “skitters,” air smells of “rain on chalk”—filtered through the philosopher’s perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its “ribs” become shelves, its fence a harp, its broken door rebuilt from scavenged parts. Weather, stars, and moonlight aren’t backdrop but tactical markers—the moon’s arc times their work, graphite-smell signals transformation. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: rain-and-iron skin, clinking copper, breath ghosting—all filtered through the poet’s transient perception. The final image (“skyline has teeth marks”) reweights the setting from ruin to contested, living architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal arbor functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: paths rearrange “as if choices were kelp,” forcing navigation by flickering compasses. Recurring objects—the broken anniversary clock, film reel, makeshift keyboard—charge the final image when the clock is set on a stump and the arbor sways “as if years themselves were listening.” Sensory detail is purposefully selective (salt, green bark, hissing film) and filtered through the pianist’s musical perception (“wind applauded through leaves”). The station’s glassy concourse and cloud-braided arbor mirror internal states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    The ancient ridge isn’t backdrop but active agent: blooming stones “waken,” hibiscus shed anthers as red rain, soil softens to greet returning relatives. This micro-setting constrains choice—the right soil appears only through interpreted dreams—and charges the final image: the sprouted tree’s leaf glints with reborn village roofs. Sensory hierarchy (scent, touch, sound over sight) reflects the reality checker’s empirical whimsy, while monsoon weather tightens tactics without cliché. The conch and tidebook function as environmental extensions that shape action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as micro-setting and active crucible: the islet’s salt grass, casuarina needles, black rock, and wet sand directly enable key actions (laying compass, reading lace, speaking apologies). The post-rain clarity and breezy light diffuse sky into “kinder shavings,” shaping the narrator’s perceptual shift. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the lace drinking cove reflections, the sea’s “rhythmically placid hunger”—making regret tactile. Rain, wind, and tide aren’t backdrop but co-agents in the thematic resolution.
