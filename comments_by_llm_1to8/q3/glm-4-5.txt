  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.1)
    The canyon setting is described lyrically ("vast tapestry of stars," "ancient rock walls") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The glass plates and frost are introduced as method but remain decorative; no spatial choreography grounds their placement or Lena's movements around them. The micro-climate detail is told rather than used. The setting does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.4)
    The winterglass conservatory anchors space and provides vivid sensory texture—transparent walls, ironwork, heat-pattern amplification—but these details remain decorative. The conservatory does not constrain Elena's actions or supply a resource that alters her tactics; she could perform her heat-mapping anywhere. The setting enriches atmosphere without shaping the beat that matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The underwater library's "impossible spaces" and architecture are visually striking but remain postcard description; the environment does not constrain Elias's movements or choices (airlock functions conveniently, no navigation obstacles). The lens fragments as objects shape the ending assembly, lifting the score moderately. Spatial choreography inside the library is vague—pedestal location, Elias's movements, and the manifestation of ethereal figures lack concrete staging.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor and ridge setting anchor the opening and return at closure, and "amplified quiet" is invoked twice to support atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective—moon, night air, horizon—but the arbor itself remains decorative; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The northern settlement and eastern checkpoint are named but not rendered as lived spaces. The environment supports mood but does not pressure the protagonist's final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight viaduct and wisteria are vividly rendered in the opening, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara could perform the same revelation anywhere. The camera obscura projects an image, yet its mechanics (how breath alters the lens, what the rough-hewn wall contributes) remain vague. The "foggy lucidity" tag is asserted but not embodied through selective sensory detail that narrows perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    Spatial anchors appear late and remain vague—"center of her creation," "living bridge garden"—without concrete texture until paragraph three. Sensory detail is largely visual and generic ("vibrant green tendrils," "iridescent properties"); the garden's "breathing" movements and hyperbolic geometry are declared but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final "disintegrate" image involves the body but does not charge the closure with environmental cost. Because the Orientation Test penalty was applied in Q2, Q3 is capped at 7.0 per the global rule; however, the piece does not approach that ceiling due to thin grounding and ornamental use of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carnival redemption center is anchored early with dust, broken windows, and empty shelves, and the piano bench functions as a micro-setting object that enables the vault discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the escape sequence. However, the environment never forces a tactical choice—Elara moves freely, the back door is simply available, and the barren fields beyond serve as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks create vivid atmosphere with selective sensory detail (fractured light, phosphorescent jellyfish, water amplifying color-sounds). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics. The forge's "ashen residue" and aurora lights are described but never pressure a decision. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting potential (water's peculiar amplification quality) is mentioned but not dramatized as a tool or obstacle that shapes the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The emerald station tiles, golden-hour light, and moonbeam jar provide vivid sensory anchors. Spatial choreography remains clear (counter, window, stationmaster's office, workshop). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the station's layout does not constrain Lillian's theft or shape her tactics in a way that charges the final image. The workshop arrangement of portraits is described but does not impose a meaningful spatial or material constraint on the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned control room is established early and provides concrete anchors (windows, gauge, corroded metal, copper panel). Spatial choreography is clear and the kiln/pipe/bookmark remain consistently placed. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The reclaimed copper appears only in the penultimate beat without prior setup, weakening the "salvaging" claim.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted library and broken skylight provide atmospheric detail, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague—"between shelves," "restricted section," "grand entrance"—without coherent layout. The cast and seashell are handled, but their physical properties (phosphorescent glow, warmth) feel ornamental rather than tactical. The stars and constellations return at the end but do not alter Maya's options or charge her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort and tower chamber anchor setting early with vivid sensory detail (winds, thick walls, marbled hush). The three pebbles on the table and the gold leaf booklet supply recurring tactile anchors. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it provides atmosphere without pressing the oracle's decisions. The setting charges the final image when the booklet glows, reaching the lower edge of the constraint band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight provides vivid sensory anchors (crystalline snow, blue and lavender hues, metallic tread echoes) and the violin's ice-crystal structure charges the final image when it dissolves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Unit 347's cleaning routine and the courtyard's spatial details remain static decoration. The setting supports atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystal whispering forecourt is evoked with sensory specificity ("raindrops on the crystal structures creating a soft melody") and recurs to frame the ending, achieving a charged reprise. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices during the patrol; the projector booth, hidden chamber, and crystal structures serve as stage dressing rather than spatial obstacles or resources that alter her tactics. The lens qualifies as a tool that enables her discovery, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite the setting's largely atmospheric function.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The garden maze is vividly established with pathways, marbles, night-blooming cereus, and shifting routes tied to emotional state. Sensory detail is present (rustling leaves, light through cracked glass) and filtered through Elias's gardener perspective. However, the maze's mechanics (paths shift by emotion) are told rather than demonstrated through a specific navigational choice that alters outcome. The marbles anchor setting but remain ornamental rather than constraining a key decision.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    The xenobiology research station and magnetic nexus supply atmospheric detail, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—they function as backdrop. The "violet skies" bird and twilight cycle are mentioned but do not pressure Aris's actions. Spatial choreography (containment unit, console, levers) remains generic and does not evolve causally with events. Micro-setting potential (tools, console) is untapped; no object or environmental feature forces a tactical shift or stakes recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (ankle-deep water, gilded walls, pearls-in-the-deep keys) that sustains atmosphere and filters through Elias's musician's perspective. The grand piano "miraculously untouched" in shallow water constrains the final choice (he must play it to complete the ritual), and the translucent ghost figure in the wings charges the ending image. Spatial choreography (wading, approaching stage, positioning at piano) remains clear throughout. The setting does more than backdrop; it provides the material conditions (water damage, preserved piano) that enable the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mountain weather station at 11,200 feet supplies vivid sensory anchors (cold floor, inch of snow through window seal, massive observation windows) and the altitude constraint is signaled early as necessary for prophetic clarity. However, setting details accumulate without altering Elias's tactics; the station functions as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. The botanical illustration and auroras charge the final image but the cave coordinates and indigenous legend arrive late without prior spatial grounding, weakening micro-setting coherence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned train tunnel and valve wheel supply concrete anchors, and the tunnel's "oppressive darkness" and "damp air" ground the scene. The valve wheel is handled twice (knelt to examine, then clutched warm) and charged at the ending, allowing micro-setting credit. However, spatial choreography lacks clarity—Marcus moves "forward," kneels, stands, walks back without dimensional grounding—and the tunnel never constrains a choice or alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian refuge and the library catacombs are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cascading murk, leaf litter, ozone and ancient paper). The origami swan functions as a micro-setting object that enables the transit but does not constrain a choice at closure. Spatial choreography is clean across both locations. The regenerative silence pocket charges the final image by reweighting the keeper's detachment, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sage ridge setting is signaled early and returns at the eclipse, creating spatial coherence. Sensory detail—sage fragrance, cooling air, eerie twilight—filters through Maya's focus and shifts with the eclipse's progression. The drum as a micro-setting object constrains the closure beat: Lila's drumming is the vehicle for her breakthrough, and its tactile presence charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting or tool must affect outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    The silo library is anchored early with sensory specificity (curved walls, bronze quiet, metal bones). Setting details recur (hearth, upper level, deepest chamber) and the "bronze quiet" modulates atmosphere across beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard description. The tapestry and diaries are handled, meeting the micro-setting option, but spatial choreography stays vague—no use of proximity or access pressures the historian's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and anchored early (rocky island, circular room, ancient typewriter, spiral staircase). However, the environment remains postcard-static across the night; no tool, constraint, or spatial detail alters a choice or charges the final image. The delivery container and morning boat appear only as mechanical transit, not as pressure points. Micro-setting potential (typewriter, lantern, delivery container) is present but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "dimensional anchor" and "loop pedal" are named but never constrain a choice or supply a resource with cost. The church is generic; no sensory detail (sight, sound, smell) is filtered through Michael's professional or personal priorities. The indigo paint and symbols decorate the floor but do not alter tactics or options. Spatial choreography is unclear: Sarah's position on "the altar" and Michael's movements remain abstract. No micro-setting (body, tool, object) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are described vividly with the mirrored-horizon effect and dawn refraction creating a charged visual signature. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a backdrop for internal reflection. The nautilus shell is handled twice (taken in hand, placed to forehead) and described in relation to the lake, giving it modest spatial presence but no functional pressure on outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing viaduct is anchored early and returns at closure, fulfilling Setup and Payoff gates. Sensory detail is vivid ("damp golden stones humming," "bruised purple" sky) and filtered through urgency during the eclipse sequence. However, the viaduct does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as backdrop for passive observation rather than shaping Elias's tactics, capping the score below 6.0 despite strong descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cavern and phonograph appear early and recur, but remain postcard-level: "shadowed alcove," "stone walls," "audibly muted." The broken needle and turntable do constrain Eleanor's method (backward play), satisfying micro-setting criteria at minimum. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the environment does not pressure a key choice or charge the final image beyond serving as backdrop, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.1)
    The courtyard anchors the scene with functional detail (cobblestones, fountain, apartment windows), and the dusk timeframe creates atmospheric coherence. However, setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than constraining choice—Elias moves "laterally around the perimeter" to avoid observation, but this tactic has no consequence and the environment never pressures his options. The pigeon's "unusual silver feathers" appears only at the end as a token detail without earlier setup or payoff in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto and starlight are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (warm hues, silver wash). However, the environment remains postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice, supply a resource that alters tactics, or charge the final image. The rope becomes the de facto micro-setting and does appear across beats, but its physical properties (frayed, worn) are decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by ancient shipwrecks" is vivid in declaration but remains postcard-static: we never see Kael navigate spatial obstacles, retrieve tools from specific hulls, or choose one wreck over another for acoustic reasons. The mendicant's bowl is "placed at his feet" during the climax, but we're not shown how proximity to "certain parts of the wrecks" amplifies vibrations—mechanics that would ground the setting's function. The greenhouse glass walls and wooden hulls "resonate" in the final beat, yet no earlier scene teaches us their acoustic properties through Kael's perception under pressure. Sensory detail defaults to visual (orange and purple sunset, cracked windows) without embodying how chronic hush alters sound, touch, or spatial movement in ways that constrain Kael's art.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber grotto is vividly evoked with selective sensory detail (amber hues, dusk light, static electricity) and the blotter petals anchor the professional world concretely. However, the environment functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a meaningful beat. The static electricity serves exposition ("allowed him to detect") but never pressures a decision or enables a discovery that changes the scene's outcome, leaving setting ornamental despite its specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "breezy library under stars" anchor is vivid and recurs at closure, charging the final image with a sense of return. Spatial details—roof panels retracted, upper pavilion, seaside café—ground key moments without excess. However, the library's interior mechanics (how archives constrain Eleanor's daily choices, how funding cuts manifested physically) remain abstract, limiting micro-setting pressure. The body and tool layer is thin; papers "tousled by breeze" appears once without evolving into tactical use.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The crystalline orchard and luminescent crater provide vivid, otherworldly anchors with consistent sensory detail (glowing fluid, obsidian outcrops, transparent trees). Spatial choreography during the search (rappelling, pulleys, submerged path) is coherent. The arbor functions as a meeting beacon and final canvas, charging the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it remains atmospheric rather than tactical, capping high-band entry per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rooftop canals and central tower provide a fantastical frame, but spatial choreography across rooftop leaps and tower entry remains generic without distances, obstacles, or micro-setting that alters a choice. Sensory detail leans visual and abstract ("crystalline cage," "ethereal light") without tactile or auditory anchors that would ground the "place where echoes are born." The pendant and sketchbook are handled twice but do not constrain movement or resource use. The giant's breathing and cloud-stirring offer atmospheric pressure but do not force a tactical adaptation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cavern orchard with bioluminescent fruits and dripping stalactites establishes vivid, specific texture. The mosaic stepping stone functions as a ritual anchor and shifts its pattern at the climax, which charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—no resource scarcity, no environmental cost—and the moon's penetration of the cavern ceiling is asserted without spatial logic or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pipe-chase setting and crawl-space architecture supply vivid micro-geography ("wedged between a copper water pipe and the plaster wall") and the power outage creates temporal pressure. However, the library itself remains generic—no room names, no spatial anchors beyond "east wall." The fragment's warmth and catalog number offer specificity, but the ending diffuses into vague future action rather than using the environment to constrain the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mossy trellis, moist soil, and rain-soaked greenhouse ground the nursery convincingly; sensory detail (dripping wood, doubled linden growth) is selective and pressure-relevant. The trellis returns at closure and charges the final reflection, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, but spatial choreography during the vents-open night remains vague—no concrete image of Elara walking away or returning makes the discovery visceral. Occupational plausibility (rain shields, soil composition) reads credible without overexposition. Environment constrains mid-story tactics (shields versus exposure), lifting this above postcard mode.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal island, rain trails, and lighthouse anchor early and constrain discovery (brooch "half-buried in the sand"). The brooch's warmth and the pigments' mineral specificity charge the exchange beat. However, "continental gallery" and "dam broke" remain abstract; the studio setup in the visitor passage lacks spatial grounding, and the island's pressure on tactics is more asserted than dramatized in micro-moves.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (humming melodic resonance, luminous walls that absorb and reflect sound). Overlapping shadows that "radiate their own illumination" create a purposeful atmospheric tension. The cave constrains Elara's experience and provides the medium (crystals) through which the transformation occurs, charging the final image as shadows inhabit the structures. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor deduction: the cave's acoustics are mentioned early but do not constrain a tactical choice; the environment primarily enriches mood rather than forcing a decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ivory harbor is vivid and the "navigated absences" frame filters setting purposefully. Ocean spray, pale stones, and briny scent anchor atmosphere. However, environment remains largely postcard backdrop; no tool, spatial constraint, or object materially alters Elina's tactics. The trumpet valve appears but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it sits on her desk as symbol, not functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "starlit vault in mist" and "fortress of unspoken truths" are evocative but remain postcard description without constraining choice or altering tactics. Ethan walks through the space, notes constellations and crystalline structures, but never uses the environment's features to solve a problem or face a trade-off. Spatial choreography is vague—cracks form arrows, mist coalesces into emotions, yet we never track his body's position or the vault's physical limits. The phantom punch and the cracks guide him passively; the setting decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.6)
    The tower remains a postcard—"open," "stargazer's," filled with "soft, resonant harmonies"—without spatial choreography, sensory specificity, or functional constraint. Whale migration operates as lyric backdrop rather than pressure on tactics or choices. The tile's physical properties shift convenience ("pulsed with subtle energy," "responded to specific sequences") but never constrain an on-page decision. No tool, body detail, or micro-setting element charges the final image or alters a choice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prismatic escondite offers vivid color-shifting walls and dimensional windows, anchoring early. The amulet fragment recurs across beats (touching, manipulating, glowing), satisfying the micro-object-as-setting test. However, the solar storm and magnetic fields remain atmospheric backdrop; neither constrains a tactical choice nor charges the final image. The dimensional windows show rebellion but do not force Alistair's hand—he observes, then decides off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly anchored with sensory details (refrigeration hum, chemical scent, stainless steel) and recurs throughout, grounding Maya's emotional arc. The setting provides concrete resources (the director's office, safe, seal) that enable the breach. Spatial choreography is clean and the "deathly vitality" motif is integrated into Maya's philosophy. The ink pot as micro-setting object charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the broader prep room doesn't constrain a choice as directly as it could—it's more backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop station are vividly described ("blooming labyrinth," "miniature forest representing a different epoch"), but setting remains postcard backdrop—neither environment nor tool constrains a choice or alters tactics. The fluorescent lamp is handled at dawn but its mechanics are told rather than dramatized through spatial interaction. Spatial choreography is coherent and sensory detail is selective, preventing a lower score, yet the 9+ gate (environment/tool must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly sketched and returns across beats, filtering perception through industrial scale and metal. Tides function as temporal rhythm but do not constrain a choice. The poison-bottle label is mentioned twice but remains symbolic rather than a lived constraint. Setting description is purposeful and POV-colored, yet no environmental feature directly alters a tactic or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory setting provides vivid anchors (rusty hinges, dust galaxies, telescope pointed at Lyra) and the storm frames the opening effectively. However, the space becomes a static backdrop once Evelyn enters; no environmental constraint shapes her actions or the closure. The painted seashell and cello are described but not integrated as spatial tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting potential is present but unused.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating raft city, perpetual carnival atmosphere, and graffiti murals are vividly established early and recur throughout. The foundation stone chip appears in three beats (pocket, clutching, returning) and the final placement charges the closure moment by reweighting collective vs. individual power. However, spatial choreography is vague—Maya's movements through the city lack concrete geography, and the corporate emissaries' visit and council meeting occur off-stage or in summary, reducing environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moonlit summit and lunar surface are anchored early with sensory specifics (rocky ground, bulky space suit, crater valley). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The setting provides vantage and isolation but does not constrain a key choice or materially alter tactics—Elena's plan unfolds without friction from the environment. The final image references the "now-sunlit summit" but the shift is descriptive rather than causally charged, keeping the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mist-coated depot and water-bowl technique are vivid and purposeful, anchoring atmosphere and method. Spatial choreography is clear (platforms 3 and 4, open doorway, worktable). The water bowl constrains the diagnostic method and charges the drone's hovering finale, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the setting itself does not force a choice—Elias could perform this repair anywhere with his tools, and the departing ship functions as distant backdrop rather than a pressure that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and auroras provide vivid atmospheric grounding. The condensation patterns on glass recur with shifted meaning and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clean across the journey. However, occupational detail (atlas editing, measuring instruments) remains ornamental; the tools don't constrain a choice or reveal professional priorities under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Silverwood is vividly rendered with skeletal buildings, moss-furred stones, and cracked cobblestones that Silas tests underfoot. The ebony tuning fork and cobblestones function as micro-setting elements that constrain his method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the archway, bell tower, and pathways. Sensory hierarchy reflects Silas's professional focus on resonance and vibration, creating purposeful specificity that supports the accumulative design and participates in the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underwater temple setting is vivid—"massive columns of an unknown stone," "mineral-rich water"—and the oxygen gauge functions as a live constraint. However, the temple's spatial choreography is vague: Elena "noted earlier" a symbol pattern but we never saw that observation, and the chamber's luminescence mechanism is described rather than physically navigated. The crystal vial's hexagonal shape matching a depression feels like late-introduced convenience rather than emergent geography.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and lattice are named repeatedly but never constrain a choice or shape tactics—they remain atmospheric backdrops. The copperlight filtering through the window and the scent of salt/sorrow establish mood but do not evolve causally or charge the closure. Spatial choreography is vague: the confessional lattice's location relative to the cell, the door's function, and the reef's proximity are never anchored in action.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The greenhouse supplies vivid sensory detail (bioluminescent blossoms, frost patterns, terracotta pots) but functions as postcard description rather than constraint. No environmental element narrows a choice or charges the final image with cost; the setting remains static decoration. Spatial choreography is vague—bride "drifts," groundskeeper "finds"—with no lived-in handling of tools or objects that affect outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    The red canyon labyrinth and harbor setting are vivid but remain postcard backdrops. The canyon "rose like dragon spines" and "pulsed with new life" without constraining any choice or altering Elara's tactics. The illustration plate and thread/needle are handled across beats, yet their physical properties (weight, friction, wear) never shape an action. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers "followed her sleepwalking path one night" without legible distance or effort.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly established with roots snaking between bones, creating a distinctive micro-setting. Trees "lean in" and roots "tighten" as Kaelen works, lending the environment a charged presence that supports tone. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography (dig sites, tomb center, orchard perimeter) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The golden arcade at dawn is rendered with consistent sensory detail (light shifts, metallic structures, polished wood) filtered through Elara's professional lens. The clipboard functions as micro-setting: handled across multiple beats and charged as "intimate like an old friend." Spatial choreography (arcade walkway → receptacle at end) guides movement and the final act. Setting contributes to tone (futuristic nostalgia) but does not constrain a choice at closure—the letter drop is unobstructed.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt observatory and autumn setting are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the piece early with prismatic light and crimson leaves. Sensory detail (candle flame, elongated shadows, autumn winds) recurs and charges key beats. However, the observatory itself does not constrain a choice—Elara's embroidery could occur in many locations without altering tactics or outcome. The eternal candle and her workspace pressure the atmosphere but do not materially alter her decisions. Micro-setting qualifies but lacks the causal grip for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, and moonlight are vividly sketched and anchor the single scene well. However, the environment remains scenic; it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The gargoyle shard and window function as props without spatial friction. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not pressure the protagonist's movement through the space.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and recurring, with sensory anchors (damp bench, tropical plants weeping mist, fading light through glass ceiling) that frame the scene. The coral fragment's "labyrinthine grooves catching the fading light" and the smudged cast notes provide tactile micro-settings. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it serves as backdrop rather than participant. The setting charges the final image through the mist and fading light motif, which supports atmosphere but stops short of the 9+ gate requiring direct influence on a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.6)
    The orchard district's fog and ruins are evoked but remain postcard descriptions that do not constrain a single on-page choice. Spatial choreography is vague: Amelia moves from ruins to studio to observatory without tactile grounding or proximity that shapes decisions. The fragment itself—smooth, cool, muted—is described but never used as a micro-setting that alters tactics. Sensory detail is generic ("soft contours," "sunlit orchards heavy with dew") and not filtered through Amelia's professional or emotional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden is vividly sketched with acoustic architecture, chimes, and wind sculptures that color the scene. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The nickel's vibration and reflected sound constrain Elena's perception and guide her final brush-work, charging the closure image. The setting does meaningful work, lifting the score into mid-6s despite occasional decorative sensory details that do not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.8)
    The greenhouse, gardens, and gourd seeds are listed and described but never constrain a live choice or charge the final image; Kaelen shakes the rattle "above a row of newly planted chrysanthemums" without spatial consequence. Seven garden plots and carnivorous-plant patterns are catalog items that do not affect tactics. The piece offers tour-guide breadth (tomato plants, mint, cereus, mycelial network) without selective, character-filtered urgency or a single moment where environment alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.6)
    The shell is described vividly ("pearlescent walls," "spiraling chambers") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop. The galaxy postcard is handled twice (arrival, final resting place) but does not enable or block an action. Spatial choreography is vague—where the poet sits, how inhabitants are arranged, how blossoms "spread" physically—leaving the reader to imagine logistics rather than tracking them on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and floating setting are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (clouds beneath transparent floors, light fragmenting through petals). The preservation chamber and phonograph supply concrete tools that anchor the restoration action. The wind chime's physical crack and the focusing lenses constrain Eleth's method, charging the final image when the restored tube rejoins the array. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the setting filters through Eleth's curatorial POV without tourist-catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    The archive is anchored early with dust motes and dim light, and the glass inkwell recurs across beats. The inkwell "seemed to glow" and is "nearly empty" at key moments, tying its state to Elena's progress. However, the archive itself functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no spatial detail pressures her choices or alters tactics. The inkwell's depletion charges the final moment modestly but does not fundamentally shape the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crumbling amphitheater inside a dormant volcano is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (moss-covered stone, dappled light, volcanic dust). The breathing rhythm recurs but remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting supplies the inscription that enables the solution, lifting the score into functional territory, but the environment does not pressure tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    The attic setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (aging paper, slow decay, skylight beam, dust motes). The meteorite as paperweight and the dust-mote swirls function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, spatial choreography occasionally drifts—Elara moves between examining the meteorite, writing, and releasing a bird without clear transitions. The skylight and dust patterns constrain her method of divination, lifting the score toward the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    The drifting prism terrace, crystalline archways, and violet-light pillars provide vivid imagery, but remain postcard description—no spatial constraint alters Elara's tactics. The oak doorway's grain pattern signals method use, lifting slightly. Sensory detail (prismatic light, corn-stalk rustling) is present but not filtered through urgent choice. The final corn maze anchors emotion but arrives too late to shape prior moves.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    The underwater research facility is vividly described (flooded corridors, reinforced glass, collapsed dome, filtered moonlight), and spatial choreography remains clear. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The feather's pull guides Maya through the facility without friction, and the dome's partial collapse conveniently allows moonlight exactly when needed. Micro-setting (the glass barrier) appears in the gesture of pressing her palm, but does not charge the closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The iridescent geode cave is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("geode walls shimmered," "cheerful gloom," "crystallized air"). The setting enables one on-page action (planting a seed into a crack) that triggers visions, giving it functional weight. However, spatial choreography remains static—no constraint forces tactical adjustment or alters the protagonist's moves under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal arcade is anchored with vivid detail (glass ceiling, stars, marble floors, high-tide flooding) and the harbor breeze, string quartet positioning, and acoustic properties are noted. However, setting remains ornamental: the arcade's unique flood feature is mentioned but never affects Leo's tactics or choices. The bishop piece and the woman's phone create brief spatial beats, but neither the tide nor the stars constrain action at closure. Sensory selection is adequate but does not reflect urgency or POV priority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    The twilight garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail (flowers "too reminiscent of happier times," scents evoking the pre-ban world) that grounds Lira's exile and charges the thematic stakes. The moonstone speck and the "aperture in the space between stars" function as micro-setting elements that guide her transformation. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the garden's "deep magic" enables her anchoring, meeting the 9+ quick test requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image. Minor deduction: the nostalgia ban's sensory specifics (flower colors, air scents) are mentioned but not shown altering a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered through sensory detail (shimmering bay, dew on spiderwebs, mist), but the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The prism atrium and pond do not pressure Mara's choices or supply resources that affect the outcome. Spatial choreography is clear, and the micro-setting of the pond provides a lyric anchor, but it does not meaningfully alter tactics or charge the closure—Mara's realization would stand unchanged without the stone or the ripples.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moonlit ridge, pines, and night sky anchor who/where/when cleanly in the opening. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (gravel crunch, cool porcelain, moonlight silvering the crack). The box functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its crack examined under moonlight, and it constrains the firefighter's reflective stance at the apex. The final image—moonlight making the fracture "seem less like damage, more like a deliberate stroke"—charges the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tide-polished grotto is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("soap bubble," bioluminescent algae, kaleidoscopic light). Spatial choreography is coherent and the returning tide supplies a temporal constraint. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain Elian's choices or alter his tactics—he arranges decorations unimpeded and the environment remains passive backdrop. The grotto charges the final atmosphere but does not shape the closure decision or cost, limiting higher-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage is sketched with selective detail (stone, vines, fireplace) and returns in the developed negative, creating a visual reprise. The chamber's fireplace supplies the diaries, so setting enables discovery. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates her movement; she kneels, extracts, returns to the lab without spatial friction. The body and tools (recording device, developing solution) appear but do not pressure tactics. Sensory detail is present but not character-filtered or urgent. The passage's pristine-versus-reclaimed contrast charges the conceptual frame but does not alter Elara's on-page options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.7)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and rain-created droplets are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The prism fractures her image into possibilities, which charges the vision sequence. However, the terrace functions more as backdrop than constraint—she completes her ritual without the environment resisting or altering her tactics. The rain amplifies resonance (told) but does not force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    The ancient terrace, celestial bodies, and stone canopy provide consistent spatial grounding and sensory anchors (salt air, three suns, moonlight). The ebony clipboard returns at multiple beats and its final placement serves as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's professional lens (worn leather shoes, weathered cloak), though some descriptions drift toward postcard phrasing ("hues of impossible beauty"). The environment constrains the ceremony's ritual structure and the terrace functions as both stage and witness, meeting the 9+ threshold test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.7)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered—crystalline surface, cracks converging like spokes, rain striking "like tiny bells"—and shapes the journey's structure. The setting constrains movement (expensive boots crunching, salt biting knees) and the crack-map provides tactical guidance. However, the nesting grounds and depression are mentioned but not physically anchored in a way that pressures the final choice. The micro-setting (body, egg, kneeling posture) charges the ritual moment, lifting the score, but the helicopter's sudden appearance introduces a spatial element without prior grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "silver courtyard under snow" recurs and brackets the piece, providing a lyric frame, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a backdrop. Sensory detail is selective (snowflakes, moonlight, breath), but no environmental feature pressures Elara's decision. The micro-setting allowance (threads, prism) is invoked yet remains metaphorical without spatial or physical grounding that would reach 6+.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The radar dome appears early and recurs, constraining Elias's workshop space, which lifts the score into functional range. Sensory detail is generic ("twilight painted the dome's interior in shades of indigo") and filtered through no particular POV bias. Spatial choreography is loose—puppets, story stick, and stage move without clear tracking. The setting never forces a choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The verdant grotto above the clouds is vividly realized through selective sensory detail: moss, orchids, mist-shrouded peak, cloud-touched trees, "blushing stillness of dusk." The setting charges the final image (grotto as sanctuary where memory lingers) and the floating garden "transiently rooted" constrains Aris's presence, reinforcing the temporary nature of their work. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (glass jar, stone marker, knotted structures) grounds the action and the moth wing attachment moment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.7)
    The icebound sanctum is vividly anchored with aurora, ice stairway, and the glowing rope. Sensory detail—frigid air, frozen tears, aurora's shifting light—grounds the scene and modulates with urgency. The rope as a tool constrains Elara's action (she must separate threads without breaking them), reaching the micro-setting standard. However, the environment does not alter tactics or create a live obstacle; the sanctum cooperates once the pattern is matched, and the space functions more as a stage than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest establish atmosphere but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The storm amplifies her ability without dramatized mechanics or tactical cost. Spatial choreography is vague—wafer seal positions, symbol circles, and bunker layout remain abstract. The micro-setting (body, seal, symbols) does not constrain choice or charge the final image; sunlight filtering through vines is decorative rather than functional. Setting detail serves concept illustration over scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    The Babylonian palace setting provides atmospheric detail (clay tablets, ziggurats, celestial maps) but remains largely decorative postcard description. Spatial choreography is unclear—where exactly is Anu within the palace-observatory, and how do objects like the tile, candle, and papyrus relate physically? The magic square tile does constrain the final beat (hovering, unfolding), lifting the score slightly, but most environmental details do not alter tactics or choices. Sensory hierarchy and POV-filtered perception are absent; details read generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The sanctuary's soundless quality and shifting walls are vividly rendered ("walls breathing slowly like living tissue," "starlight given solid form"). These details create atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or charge the final image; Marcus's decisions are unaffected by spatial layout or sensory pressure. The music boxes—objects that could serve as micro-setting—remain symbolic props rather than tools that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the "ethereal halls" anchor the reader, pushing the score into mid-band despite the lack of choice-shaping constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cap applied at 7.0 per Orientation Test. The ruined orchard, fog, and twilight frost are vivid and recurring, but they remain atmospheric rather than constraining choice—removing them would not break the repair logic. The sextant's brass arm and mirror are described, yet spatial choreography of the workshop and the mirror maker's hands stays generic. Sensory detail leans visual; the workshop perches "on the edge" but does not pressure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard-spanning-rafters setting is vivid and purposefully surreal, anchoring the piece early and returning at closure to "murmur its approval." Spatial choreography is clear; the mosaic path, tiny bridge, and cathedral column are used tactically. The seed planting near the carved names integrates setting into the final image, charging it with generational continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.1)
    The astral orchard and asteroid setting provide vivid sensory anchors—"petals that shone like captured starlight," "phosphorescence casting long shadows"—and the orchard reappears at key beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The bathroom as micro-setting is mentioned but not used in a way that pressures decision. Spatial choreography is clear, and the dome habitat, orchard, and research chamber provide coherent geography, but setting does not participate in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.6)
    The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain receive vivid description ("shelves twisted like climbing vines," "books whispered their contents") but function as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara navigates without spatial friction or choice shaped by access. The botanical diary glows and guides without material cost or tactical trade-off. Spatial choreography is loose (the guardians "swirl," the cavern "holds," but distances and thresholds remain vague). Sensory detail leans visual and metaphorical without anchoring touch, sound, or proximity that would pressure a micro-decision.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The carnival ship setting is vividly established (rusty hull, foggy bay, faded murals, broken greenhouse) and returns at closure ("The carnival ship continued drifting"). The emerald tree in the greenhouse charges the final image, and the fog presses against portholes as Elara descends, creating atmospheric coherence. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara moves through the ship unimpeded, and spatial details remain decorative rather than forcing decisions. The tree functions symbolically but does not alter her approach or options.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered with brass cogs, bronze chains, and the materialized door. The rope's shifting braids and the chamber's golden light at closure are specific and atmospheric. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint materially alters Eleanor's tactics or choices. The rope is handled, but the room itself does not pressure decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harmonic caves are vividly rendered with specific details—ripple marks, Ice Sanctum, ancient ice preserving climatic history—and the setting directly enables the solution (crack patterns in ice provide the counter-frequency). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the mapkeeper's professional priorities. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and return to the convergence point.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glass humming pavilion is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (walls singing with wind, vibrating with starlight), and the beacon tower's spiraling stairs and broken prism add spatial coherence. The pavilion's sympathetic resonance and the ancestors' whispered guidance create atmosphere that supports the mystical tone. Yet the setting remains largely a backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she could perform the same star-charting and alignment work in any structure. The final hum joining the beacon's light charges the image modestly but does not impose a tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystal forecourt that whispers stored conversations and the shadow-length method at monuments are vivid, purposeful micro-settings that shape Elthion's task. The stormlit observatory bookends the piece, and the solidified fog functions as both atmospheric constraint and archive. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, forecourt center, monument base), and sensory detail—rain remnants, crystal whispers, fading light—modulates with the deepening hush. The crystals amplify his final vow, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    The blooming fortress, mosaic pathways, and tower are anchored with consistent sensory specificity (night-blooming cereus, tessellation patterns, acoustic properties). The fire spinner's rag functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and integral to the climax. However, the environment remains largely decorative; flowers "lean toward the light" in metaphorical response rather than constraining Elias's choices. The starless night frames atmosphere but does not impose a tactical cost or tighten his window of action. Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard → fountain → tower) and the rag's changing state (wrapped compounds → ignited sections) tracks causally.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto is anchored early with stars, tidal pools, and stone walls, providing adequate spatial grounding. Sensory detail is present (jade cicada warmth, star reflections in pools) but largely decorative; the setting does not constrain Maya's choice or force a tactical shift. The pools function thematically (transition metaphor) but do not alter the conversation's stakes or outcome. Micro-setting option: the jade cicada is handled but does not pressure the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    The xenial trellis is vividly rendered ("luminous flowers with fragile bells that chimed without audible sound") and the gravity-inversion mechanic is coherent. Sensory hierarchy shifts across altitudes (metallic taste, hollow quiet, honey-light). The trellis charges the final image by providing the gilded hush, meeting the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography is clean, though the bunker interior receives less grounding than the aerial ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.6)
    The drifting prism terrace, gondolas, and storm glass vial supply vivid, purpose-driven detail that filters through Elias's professional priorities. Sensory selection—rainbow patterns, crystalline predictions, vaulting hush—serves atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; spatial choreography (how passengers board, where Elias stands relative to them, how prisms are "adjusted") remains vague. The setting decorates rather than pressures, keeping this functional but below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.4)
    The retro-futurist world supplies vivid imagery—holographic deserts, memory-formatted forests, digital fruit—but details remain decorative rather than constraining. The kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard are visited as set-pieces; spatial choreography is clear but props don't alter tactics. The chronometer's four-hour countdown to sunrise anchors the timeframe yet never forces a choice or shortcut. Sensory hierarchy is consistent but the setting functions as backdrop, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ashen sanctuary is vivid ("charcoal," "starlight," "cold") and the doorknocker ring serves as micro-setting that constrains the choice to open the threshold. Sensory details are purposeful—breath forming mist, ring pulsating with warmth—and the northernmost wall of stars provides spatial anchoring for the threshold action. The setting participates in the closure (stepping through the door formed from "starlight and sorrow"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement of charging the final image, but the elevated diction occasionally abstracts the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly described with purple-glowing species and spore-filled air. However, the environment remains decorative; no physical constraint shapes Maya's descent or the bolt's discovery. The "dangerous instability" of lower chambers is declared but never tested on the page. Spatial choreography is vague—"lesser-known sections," "lower chambers," "third terrace"—without concrete distances or effort that would make the journey tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sepia reading room and golden shadows recur throughout, providing atmospheric cohesion. However, the setting remains decorative: the room's layout, the carving's position, and the hidden compartment are introduced only when needed, with no spatial grounding that constrains earlier choices. The gramophone is positioned "at the room's center" late in the sequence without prior spatial logic, and the floorboards shift to reveal the compartment with no earlier hint of their existence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly rendered with phosphorescent vines, crystalline fruit, and internal light casting ethereal shadows. Sensory selection is atmospheric but tilts heavily visual; the "scent of distant places not yet discovered" arrives late and remains generic. The greenhouse's "endless twilight" provides sanctuary from judgment, but this constraint operates thematically rather than forcing a tactical choice or altering Galen's path. The environment does not constrain a decision or charge the final image with specificity, capping the score below 7.0 per the Q3 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The file room, drawer seven, and dust patterns provide concrete micro-setting. Dust analysis (radiating circles, seasonal signatures) is specific and unusual. The button's tarnished brass and missing-button photograph create tactile detail. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure—the final office meeting is generic. The dust method shapes one middle beat (file selection) but does not charge the ending image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    The auric lagoon under starlight provides a vivid visual anchor and the underground data vaults add spatial stakes. The marshes enable the escape tactically, meeting the micro-setting test. However, much setting detail remains decorative—"bruised purples and oranges" at dusk, the "liquid gold" water—without constraining Mara's choices. The phone booth key's physical interaction (insertion, glowing) does tie object to setting at the closure beat, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    The radiant grotto and prism atrium are vividly described with light/mist/dewdrops, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is purposeful. However, the atrium's "perfect acoustics" solve the problem without prior complication, and no environmental element pressures Ethan's tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ashen arbor, mossy platform, and sorting tools are vividly rendered and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent (Elara cross-legged on platform, sorting tray, tweezers, monument placement). The moonstone cabochon dust speck constrains her attention in one beat and is added to the monument, altering its glow—this micro-setting interaction elevates the score slightly, though the environment does not force a difficult choice or charge the final image with trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The workshop, attic, greenhouse, and subterranean cavern are anchored with selective sensory detail (broken glass ceiling, scent of decay/rebirth, mist-lit chamber). The compass and vine-ladder construction use objects to constrain improvisation. The underground clocks powered by natural rhythms provide a conceptual setting that charges the theme. However, spatial choreography during the descent and within the chamber remains vague, and the greenhouse-to-waterfall transition compresses without clear navigation beats. The setting shapes the conceptual turn but doesn't pressure a tactical choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The foundry setting provides concrete sensory anchors (steam, rain, furnaces, copper disc) and Elias interacts with tools across multiple beats (etching, heating, retrieving). The rain-washed surfaces recur purposefully. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias's success is unimpeded by resource limits or spatial pressure. The final image is charged by the foundry's transformation, lifting the score, but the setting remains more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Echo Gorge's sonic distortion and the misaligned harp provide purposeful atmospheric detail that guides the pursuit. The crocodile's tooth and bell are handled concretely. Spatial choreography (canyon, cave) remains clear, and sensory detail (lavender/gold sunrise, warmed tooth) is selective. The environment enables but does not constrain a pivotal choice, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered with specific sensory markers (blue-violet hues, glowing bark, unusual light revealing hidden truths) and the setting actively constrains Kai's perception and choices—he uses the forest's light properties to decode the pewter strap. Micro-setting (the forest floor, the ancient tree he braces against) grounds action. The setting charges the final image by providing the necessary context for revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate test. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("systematic deconstruction of his humanity") that pulls away from concrete environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist's market is vividly sketched ("rope bridges and wooden platforms," "swaying stalls") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint; no choice is shaped by proximity, access, or environmental pressure. The lighthouse lens fragment recurs across beats and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that elevates the score. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and sensory detail is selective without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned ticket office is anchored with sensory specifics (decades-old popcorn, grimy windows, collapsed counter) and the fluorescent buzz serves as a recurring constraint that times the spirit appearance. Dust accumulation patterns guide Marcus's investigation and the ceiling focus reflects his elevator-tech POV. The mainspring barrel discovery beneath debris is tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean (office interior, counter, ceiling view) and the setting pressures the 4:17 PM timing choice, charging the final image when reality cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass orchard library is vividly described with sensory specificity (crystalline branches, transparent walls, dendritic frost patterns). However, it functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint—Eldon's choices are unaffected by spatial detail. The bottled whisper's placement "beside the antique letterpress" does not alter tactics or access. Micro-setting (the vial, the press) appears but does not charge the final image with constraint or resource pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The baroque asteroid with "spiraling gold filigree," "cave-like dwellings," "floating libraries," and visible Time as "golden dust motes" is vivid and atmosphere-rich. The temporal storm's "shimmering curtains of rippling moments" charges the writing scene, and the mirror-covering ritual creates spatial/cultural texture. However, the asteroid's architecture and the storm function primarily as backdrop; they do not constrain Elias's choices (he writes indoors at a table, storm outside) or supply a resource that alters outcome. The crystal vase shard sits on the table but does not interact with the environment in a way that pressures tactics. Sensory detail is present but filtered more through authorial catalog than Elias's professional or personal priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.7)
    The resonance chamber is vividly anchored (circular, polished oak, amplifies sound) and returns at closure to house the final act. Sensory detail is purposeful—candlelight on inlay, vibrations from clock tower, hissing rust—and the chamber's acoustic properties pressure Elias's method (humming, tinkersong). The philosopher's stone chip and music box function as micro-setting objects that constrain his approach. However, spatial choreography within the chamber remains static; Elias's position and movement are not tracked, and the environment does not evolve or complicate his work.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered (obsidian surface, phosphorescent algae), and the limestone cliffs frame access post-closure. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the warm water and glowing algae do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she simply wades in and collects a vial. The compass grows hot and the needle spins, but these cues do not shape a pivot or cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archway and turbine-hum are anchored early and recur throughout, but function as postcard description rather than constraint. Wind, waves, and driftwood are mentioned repeatedly without affecting Elena's actions—she collects pieces "guided" by the slide, not shaped by material difficulty or environmental limits. The sculpture's placement "beneath the archway" at the end offers mild closure linkage, but the archway never pressured a choice. The body, tools, and spatial choreography remain generic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber pavilion and cathedral are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dust motes, cooling glass, etched patterns). Spatial choreography is clear across locations. However, neither environment constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara is granted access without friction, examines the glass freely, and departs. The glass functions thematically but does not pressure her actions; it's an illustration rather than a crucible. No tool, body, or recurring object forces a micro-decision that changes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vivid as images but function as postcard backdrops. Beach debris arrangement is described but doesn't constrain Ellara's choices—materials appear without scarcity or tool difficulty. The lagoon "accepts and transforms her offering" via unexplained magic rather than physical interaction that tests her agency. Spatial choreography is vague: does she kneel on the beach while the zeppelin hovers, or has it landed? The setting's charged potential never materializes as tactical constraint or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paper-lantern Cove is anchored early with the amber bottle, workshop bay window, and restored lampposts. The sensory detail (paper lanterns glowing softly in dawn light, moon rising over the bay) creates atmosphere but remains largely visual and decorative. The amber bottle constrains Elior's contemplation and charges the final walk to the town square, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test and earning passage into the 6-band. Spatial choreography (workshop → town square) is clear, though the environment does not materially narrow options during the conception sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard garden atop a skyscraper supplies vivid particulars (obsidian slab, apple trees above city clouds, unripened fruit), and the setting recurs at closure when Elias walks among the trees. The wax cylinder's physical coolness against his temple provides micro-setting texture. However, spatial choreography drifts—Elias moves from stone bench to pavilion archive without clear distances or transitions, and the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics under pressure. The foghorn's silence is mentioned but remains atmospheric rather than a plot lever.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound atrium, starlight, frost, and seed jars create a vivid, consistent atmosphere filtered through Anya's professional lens. The oak acorn cap functions as both tool and anchor, warming against her skin at the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear—spirals expanding outward from center—and the environment directly enables the vortex opening. The setting charges the final image with its accumulated details (ice walls pulsing, starlight responding), meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The windblown sanctuary is vividly anchored with thin air, stone refuge, and peaks meeting sky. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (eerie luminescence, creaking timbers, resonant hum), filtered through Elias's professional attention. The cathedral bell rope is handled twice (repair, then tightening), and the setting pressures his method—mountain microclimate variations drive his entire practice. The final image of the bell responding to atmospheric forces charges the setting with agency, though spatial choreography within the sanctuary remains general.

    The cosmic setting (outpost, observation dome, void) is vivid and establishes spatial coherence. However, the yellow lantern glass—the most recurring object—never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a passive lens for perception rather than a tool that shapes outcome. The "dark matter handle" and "otherworldly composition humming with residual energy" are decorative details that do not affect any on-page decision. Sensory detail is present but does not filter through urgency or POV-specific professional priorities in a way that guides choice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.6)
    The oasis anchors spatially (hives, acacia, root cellar, extractors) and the scorched wasteland frames isolation, but details are ornamental—no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters a tactic. The box's warmth during silence and the moonlight spill are atmospheric but do not pressure decisions. Spatial choreography is vague: we never learn the recluse's position relative to hives or cellar across beats. The cap from Q2's orientation debt (7.0) does not apply here because the penalty was under threshold, but micro-setting never engages the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald silo returns across beats and charges the final image through its glowing walls, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice or charging closure. However, spatial choreography remains vague (spiral staircase, "base," edge of settlements) and the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical constraint. "Washed-out sky," "long shadows that seemed to bend," and the silo's temporal energy are vivid but not filtered through urgent POV priorities—they read as tourist catalog rather than lived pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid, selective sensory detail throughout: "cobalt lagoon," "drake's tail feather...shifting from deep emerald to brilliant sapphire," "burnished hush." The feather functions as a recurring object across beats (holding it, dipping it, placing it as bookmark), and the lagoon-after-rain frame brackets the piece. However, neither environment nor object meaningfully constrains a choice or charges the final image with tactical consequence—they remain atmospheric rather than pressure-bearing, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    The living stone pillars and temple orchard anchor the setting early and return at closure (pillars glow, orchard transforms). Spatial choreography is clear; the copper wire and oak branches function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elias's work (arthritis, precise geometric patterns). However, much description is postcard-like ("otherworldly iridescence," "symphony of light") without sensory hierarchy filtered through Elias's professional or emotional priorities. The orchard does charge the final image (plants and stone breathing together), satisfying the 9+ gate partially, but the environment's pressure on choice remains light—Elias faces no environmental obstacles or resource scarcity that alter his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The rainwashed tower and spring setting supply vivid sensory anchors (bronze facade, petals, rain pattering) and the sculptures along the path add specificity. However, these details remain decorative; no environmental feature constrains Elian's choices or alters his tactics. The tower door "stood slightly ajar, as if expecting his arrival" exemplifies convenient staging rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting does not charge the final image or enable/disable any action.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "blooming jetty at twilight" and "gloom-hill" are evocative labels but remain postcard backdrops; no micro-setting detail (a plank, a tool, the texture of soil) constrains a choice or alters tactics. The seed pods are handled in summary ("scattered the first handful") without tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is vague—where exactly does the coachman stand, how far does he walk, what does he physically do with the pods at each site?

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scrapyard and cracked wasteland are signaled early and provide atmospheric grounding, but they do not constrain a choice or charge the closure. The phonograph cylinders and wax leaf function as tools rather than environmental elements that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, and sensory detail ("wild hush," "tarpaulins shifting") supports tone, but the setting remains postcard-level rather than a crucible that shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observation deck setting is named and described (dormant equipment, echoing silence) but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Spatial details remain generic: "worn jacket," "dim light," "pencil against paper." The temporally stretched perception is told as trait rather than shown through concrete sensory distortion that would ground her unique way of seeing. The gilded compass rose receives repeated visual mentions but is not handled, used, or spatially tracked in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    The icebound spire is anchored with vivid sensory detail (glowing blue ice, thinning air, crystalline pedestal), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly across chambers. The spire's ice-covered altar and hidden passages constrain Kael's path through the chess-piece mechanic. However, the opening lacks spatial grounding—where Kael begins his climb is never specified—and the final chamber's celestial engravings are described but do not alter his choice. The setting shapes navigation but not the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    The whispering gallery is anchored early with sensory particulars (circular path, chessboard, echo amplification) and the nomadic penumbra provides a recurring visual motif. However, the gallery functions mostly as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's movement or choices in a way that alters her tactics. The chessboard's missing pawns are observed twice but never manipulated or used as a tool that shapes her actions. The setting charges the final image moderately when the pawn appears, but spatial choreography remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore within a mountain is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (scent of aging paper and leather, dusty alcoves, silver moonlight through skylights). However, the setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop—Maven moves through it without spatial constraint shaping her choices or tactics. The "hidden corridors that hadn't existed moments before" moment gestures toward environment-as-pressure but the transformation occurs via feather-magic rather than through navigational challenge or physical obstacle that alters her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are vivid anchor points. The time-frozen village supplies a strong atmospheric constraint. However, the labyrinth's interior—where the prince waits—materializes only at closure without prior spatial grounding, and the four-minute lull never alters the tutor's movement or tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly sketched and recur across beats, but they remain atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. No choice depends on spatial access, acoustic properties, or resource scarcity; Elara climbs the highest tower without friction. The pale spire is sighted repeatedly but never touched or navigated, leaving it a symbolic marker rather than a pressure point. Micro-setting (body, tool, or recurring object) does not shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    The floating workshop and acid sea supply vivid, specific atmosphere and the key-ring charm returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is coherent: Marcel moves from observatory dome to center workbench to statue. The workshop's tilt in response to Marcel's emotional turbulence shows setting as pressure, and the acid sea's corrosive threat appears in both memory (apprentice lost, hull breach) and present frame (barque adrift). The statue constrains the final action by providing the pockmark map that structures his narration. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses appear sparingly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quay, cottage, cliffs, and cave network are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt breeze, tide pools, sea crystals, acoustics). The painted seashell functions as micro-setting/object that constrains the final choice: Elias places it "where only he could see it" while painting, anchoring his renewed purpose. Spatial choreography is clean across the wrong turn, trail, cave, and return to quay. The cave's transformation of his earlier work (barnacles, crystals forming a frame) subtly mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Occupational detail (mixing colors, easel positioning) is purposeful and brief.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt lighthouse at dawn, the neglected garden, and the night-blooming jasmine create vivid anchors. The jasmine's scent returns at closure to charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear (lighthouse edge, western side, garden). However, the "halfway around the world" location for the sister is generic placeholder setting without sensory grounding, and the vial cork's mechanics (symbols that hum, warmth) are asserted rather than filtered through tactile, lived-in handling under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The starlit station, console, transmitter, and censer foot anchor space adequately. Sensory detail is present but generic ("long shadows," "shrill tone") and filtered through tourist-catalog description rather than urgency. The censer foot is handled repeatedly, satisfying the micro-setting test, but the station itself does not constrain tactics or pressure a choice—ships arrive on the same channel regardless of configuration. Bronze warmth and glow describe state without altering options. The setting enables rather than challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The hanging orchard and storm provide vivid atmospheric anchors (arthritic branches, fractal patterns in the glass eye, rays through dispersed clouds). However, the ravine setting does not constrain Elara's choices—storms mask her workings narratively but do not force tactical shifts. The truffle fork and glass eye function as props handled on the page, but spatial choreography remains vague (kneeling, scanning, unearthing happen in generic sequence). The final image uses weather poetically but does not charge the closure with environment-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    Nautical twilight, opal dock, and mist are rendered with vivid specificity and consistent sensory detail. The Edelweiss glows at the dock's edge and returns to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. The lighthouse interior and town remain underdeveloped but the dock setting constrains Elias's investigation and the mist supplies the stranger's dissolution, shaping both middle and closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming cavern with phosphorescent flowers and rising creek provides vivid sensory anchoring and charges the final image. The matrix chip's glimmer and the ants' path offer micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices (he must follow, must time arrival). However, the cavern itself functions more as symbolic theater than as environment that alters tactics; Elias contemplates doorways but no physical constraint or resource forces trade-offs within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight provide vivid visuals, and the ridge climb offers spatial challenge. However, the grotto interior remains postcard-descriptive ("lacy menace," "otherworldly radiance") without constraining a specific choice. The final image of fireflies recurs with thematic weight but does not charge a tactical decision. Micro-setting allowance met, yet no environmental detail pressures the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ember nexus is sensorially specific (heat shimmer, geothermal warmth, pulsing fragments) and establishes atmosphere effectively. The nautilus shell and pocket-suns are handled as tactile objects. The setting does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics; it functions primarily as backdrop. The final image of the shell catching twilight is vivid but decorative rather than action-shaping, preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mountain cabin at 8,000 feet is anchored early with vivid details (birch bark scroll, pine scent, aurora borealis). Sensory selection supports the dreamlike atmosphere, though some details (snow drifting upward) are ornamental rather than constraining choice. The scroll returns at closure and ties the setting to Elias's ritual, narrowly passing the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    The water-clock shop and morning fog anchor setting early and modulate throughout; the fog lifts as connection forms, a purposeful atmospheric shift. The birthing clamp screw functions as micro-setting/object, handled across beats and charged at closure when returned. Sensory detail leans visual ("brass handle," "drip of water") with some proprioceptive work ("fingers traced"), though the broader shop interior remains lightly sketched. The screw constrains the interaction and charges the final image, lifting the score toward integration.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating platform, luminescent ink, and crow quill anchor the setting vividly and filter through Elara's ritual focus. The quill's trimmed tip constrains her precision work, and the platform's tilt introduces spatial pressure. However, the tea set and garden-shed memories receive ornamental treatment without altering on-page tactics, and the saturated hush remains a mood descriptor rather than a force that shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The attic archive is vividly anchored (amber resin, dusty spines, grand piano) and the perfume bottle recurs with sensory weight (jasmine and regret) that charges the summoning. The orchard outside provides temporal urgency (scheduled destruction, morning tremors) that frames the ritual window. Spatial choreography is clean: Eloise arranges copper wire on the floor, Beatrice materializes near the piano, energy arcs between them. The perfume bottle constrains the ritual—its scent is "the key that would unlock the pathway"—and the piano anchors both past duet and final gift, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The library setting provides vivid images (towering shelves, stone altar, resounding hush) and recurs throughout. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics; the witness paces and the shelves "rearrange themselves based on intention," removing spatial friction. The softcover dictionary appears in beats and charges the final moment, qualifying as micro-setting that elevates the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    The horizon measurement station and hydraulic clock mechanics are vivid and specific, grounding the early beats with clear spatial anchors (workshop, window, clock chambers). Sensory detail is selective—razor edges refracting light, fjord quiet deepening—and filtered through Arlo's professional lens. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains backdrop. The timepiece's reversed water is the story's most active setting element but functions more as spectacle than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rainwashed library and candle lantern create atmospheric texture, and the mica pane returns with tactile detail. However, the setting doesn't constrain Elena's choices—the library could be any quiet space. The subway seats are mentioned but never visited on the page, weakening spatial coherence. Sensory details (dust, certainty smell, candlelight) are present but don't pressure the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subway utility tunnel receives vivid, selective detail (pipes as "metallic intestines," condensation dripping "rhythmic punctuation") that establishes atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters the outcome—Elias could conduct the same conversation anywhere. The glass harmonica disc sits on a shelf and vibrates; spatial choreography (booth location, switchboard layout, distance to pipes) remains vague and does not pressure the protagonist's options. Under the micro-setting allowance, the booth and disc qualify for presence but not for 7.0+ necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming jetty is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: wildflowers pushing through weathered planks, twilight's fading light, the transition to proper night. Sensory details are filtered through the archivist's Naturalist perspective and reflect his priorities (observing patterns, mixing flower powders). The setting constrains his ritual by providing the raw materials (seven flower types) and charges the final image as he takes "one final look" before leaving. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment evolves causally (sunset to darkness) in step with his emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused railway station overgrown with ivy is established early and returns in multiple beats, anchoring Archie's operations. Ivy-choked windows and cracked mirror supply tactile detail. The setting functions as "neutral ground" and sanctuary, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric. The moon rock fragment (a body-scale object) is handled across beats and its fake nature charges the final realization, lifting the score slightly via micro-setting function.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly textured and distinctly perceived through Elion's touch-based sensorium (vibrations, pressure points, frequencies). The ring and the stillpoint circle function as micro-settings that anchor key beats. The forest hum subsiding into silence at the stillpoint constrains the final moment, and the sensory hierarchy reflects Elion's blindness. However, much description remains atmospheric rather than tactically decisive, and the constellations' "pause" is invoked repeatedly without altering a choice or tightening a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gravitational anomaly anchors early (twisted time, distorted moonlight) and returns at closure to frame Elara's stance, creating a purposeful reprise. Sensory detail is selective (quantum oscillators, star maps, moonlight patterns) and filtered through Elara's profession. Spatial choreography is clear within the workshop. The anomaly does not constrain a tactical choice during the pen sequence, preventing higher scoring; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The luminous harbor is vividly anchored early with selective sensory detail (moonlight, salt air, lapping water). The vintage camera appears in multiple beats but remains a static talisman—it points but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The micro-setting (dock, bench, boats) is clear but does not pressure Elias's actions; he could perform the same gestures anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archive remains a generic "dusty halls" placeholder without spatial choreography or sensory hierarchy. The tapestry fragment is handled across multiple beats and returns at closure, constraining the final choice to weave it into the entrance—this micro-object work lifts the score above pure ornament. However, the underground sanctuary and lending library lack tactile grounding; no tools, access constraints, or environmental pressure shapes Maya's restoration work.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with synesthetic specifics (notes as flowers of light, harmonies as trees), and the Resonance Tower provides spatial anchor for the climax. However, the garden functions primarily as backdrop; it responds to Elena's drumming but does not constrain her choices—doors unlock via rhythm, the garden pools into lagoon on cue. The "hush of the universe inhaling" timeframe is poetic but unmoored from scene pressure. Micro-setting (the railing, her bare feet on metal) charges the final beat slightly, lifting the score above pure postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shipping container labyrinth is vividly anchored with sensory detail (humming metal, howling wind, puddles, acoustic highways). The geomagnetic storm provides atmospheric pressure and blackouts that enable Marlo's plan. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the containers constrain Vance's movement but not Marlo's choices—he executes his plan without spatial friction. The zodiac coin's "strange warmth" and the key with no lock remain unexplained props rather than tools that shape on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt dock, rainwater, and shutters are vividly rendered and recur throughout, creating a coherent sensory frame. The dental mirror is handled physically (catching light, redirecting it) and the shutters constrain the guardian's method, pushing this toward the 7.0 threshold. However, the environment never forces a trade-off or alters a tactic in response to pressure; it remains a backdrop for the guardian's unopposed work. Spatial choreography is clean, and the micro-setting (dock, water, shutters) charges the final image without requiring broader occupational systems at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt library with mist and the magnetic grotto supply vivid anchors. The grotto's "starlight even though it was hundreds of feet underground" and magnetic field that amplifies Arthur's gift are specific and atmospheric. However, the library and grotto never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; they remain backdrops for reflection. The final image of "cobalt light of dawn" reprises the color motif but does not charge the closure with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sublittoral fringe is evoked with vivid sensory detail ("water the color of mercury," "fog lifted"), and the scrimshaw is handled across multiple beats (retrieved, studied, pressed to chest, detaches). However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint: the docks, nets, and water do not alter Mara's tactics or force a spatial choice. The scrimshaw's glowing fragments and the island's emergence charge the final image, lifting the score, but the body and tool do not pressure decisions in a way that would reach the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The wind turbines and farmhouse create a vivid, purposeful frame that recurs and charges the closure image ("turbines continued their eternal dance above… witnesses to the quiet revolution"). The dried flowers constrain emotional access and appear in multiple beats, shaping the protagonist's ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and sensory details (wood shavings, turbine moan, brittle petals) anchor the reader. Environment meaningfully supports the thematic work and final image without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are vividly described with purposeful mystical atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain choices or alter tactics—the poet approaches, touches, and transforms without spatial obstacles or resource limits. The setting functions as evocative backdrop rather than pressure; the frozen lake "responds" and shows "signs of thaw" but these changes are passive reflections of the poet's success, not elements that shaped the journey's cost or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glassblower's courtyard supplies vivid prismatic detail and the Fibonacci plant spiral, but spatial choreography is vague—we never see Elara move across the space or handle specific stems. The concertina reed tongue catches light memorably, qualifying as micro-setting object. However, the courtyard does not constrain Elara's choices; it passively receives her arrangement and then "inhales" in response, which reads as setting-as-effect rather than setting-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    The laboratory is described vividly (cavernous space, golden shadows, high windows, dust motes) and the carbide lamp lens functions as a micro-setting object. However, setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics—the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. The lens is placed on a resonator plate, but proximity and access are never in question. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, filtered through a generic elevated register rather than the protagonist's professional or personal priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory is described with vivid metaphoric texture ("dome revealed...pathways of souls," "curtains of intention"), but remains conceptual decoration rather than a constraint that shapes choice. No spatial choreography: Elena's movements through alcoves, workbench, and dome are told in habitual summary without concrete navigation. The phoenix stencil and origami are mentioned as objects but never handled or used to alter a present tactic. Sensory detail is generic ("soft, warm glow," "ancient, starlit walls").

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly rendered with specific textures (velvet cloth, worn leather case, brass measuring tape edges). Spatial choreography is clean: Elias at his cards, the visitor silhouetted at the door, then seated. The environment supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image—rain continues to fall, symmetrically, without evolution. The measuring tape is handled twice but its "unseen geometries" remain metaphorical rather than a tool that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    Archive and pagoda are described vividly but remain postcard backdrops—no spatial constraint alters Elara's choices. "Moving around the pagoda in deliberately random paths" is told summary without embodied choreography or tactical friction. Sensory detail is filtered through elevated diction ("amber silence," "captured sunset") rather than character-particular perception. The bronze surfaces and twilight recur but do not evolve causally or charge the closure image with spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming library above the clouds is vivid and present throughout, supplying atmosphere and recurring imagery (cloud-flowers, crystal dome, moonlight). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions primarily as a lyrical backdrop. The river stone returns at the closure beat and grows warm, charging the final image slightly, which lifts the score into mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    The misty workshop and skylight anchoring are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail (lantern light, condensation drip, foliage enclosure) is selective and filtered through Elara's priorities. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains postcard backdrop. The chameleon's branch and enclosure appear only in the final paragraphs without prior spatial setup, weakening choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tower, hourglass, and coffee cup anchor early, but spatial choreography is vague—wall texture, arrow-slit positions, and tunnel entrance lack coherent geometry. The frosted hourglass constrains one beat (it glows when gripped), meeting the 9+ gate minimally, but sensory selection is generic: "sharp chill of stone," "meteor hush," "ancient memories" recycle placeholder atmosphere without POV-specific filter. The Q2 orientation penalty caps this category at 7.0, preventing higher placement despite the hourglass's functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.1)
    The vintage projection booth is anchored early with vivid period detail (reel, celluloid, sprocket holes, red light, dusty beam), and the film strip functions as a tactile micro-setting Elena handles across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a static backdrop for her perceptions. The ending does not charge the booth or film with reweighted meaning—she threads the projector as intended from the start, so the setting supplies atmosphere but not story pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    Aurora-lit archway and astronomical instrument are vivid but remain postcard descriptions rather than constraints. The archway "pulse[s] in response" and "would stand guard" but never blocks a path or forces a tactical choice. The instrument is handled in two beats (adjusting dials, final glow) and its bronze mechanisms catch light, yet its function—aligning a shooting star—does not alter Elara's options or impose a felt tradeoff. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not pressure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    Glowing dunes, ash desert, and train are vivid and recurring. The chess clock on the podium stabilizes chaotic energy, a clear object-as-constraint moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("soft luminescence," "pulse with hidden life"). However, spatial choreography inside the archive and across the desert remains vague—no tactile navigation or micro-setting friction that alters a choice. The final seed image charges closure but the archive interior lacks grounding detail that would elevate it above atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly sketched (copper needles, solar-panel oak, rotating silver birch) and the description is filtered through Kaelen's philosophical lens. However, the environment remains decorative: none of the trees constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The gear's notch at the clearing's center is a plot convenience introduced without prior setup, and the forest's "shimmer and realign" serves as backdrop to theme rather than shaping the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting is lush but generic: "mist-locked passages," "veiled ridgeway," "liquid twilight" could describe any liminal fantasy realm. The ticket punch recurs and pulses, creating a small constraint (they follow its heat), lifting the score above ornamental. Spatial choreography is vague—boats form a circle, then pass through a waterfall into a chamber, but distances and transitions lack concrete anchors. The black sand shoreline and double-mooned sky are vivid but arrive late and do not shape choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt fortress, snowfall, leaded glass, and spiral staircase are vividly rendered and the setting pressures the choice by embodying the musicians' sacrifice in its walls. The piano bench bolt and discoloration function as micro-setting, constraining discovery and charging the final image when the bolt warms and the walls hum. Sensory detail is selective—blue light, cold, the bolt's smoothness—and filtered through the bellhop's numb fingers. Minor slip: "edge of the world" and "chaos beyond" remain abstract placeholders; the external threat never gains texture, reducing the stakes' concrete weight.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered with recurring concrete details: crystalline dome, marble floors cracking, dust motes in erratic patterns, shelves crumbling. The "graceful collapse" of the library constrains Elara's time and adds urgency to her ritual work, and the final image of "walls dissolving like sand" charges the closure. However, the library functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than a tool or obstacle that directly alters her tactical choices in a specific beat. Micro-setting qualifies (ink pellets, hand movements, book margins), but the space itself does not force a decision that changes her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    The monitoring station provides concrete anchors (concrete wall, railing, floorboards, computer screens) and the moored position at the continental shelf shapes Marina's observational role. Sensory detail is selective—saltwater tears, crashing waves, digital coastlines bleeding—but remains descriptive rather than constraining a choice. The torn atlas page and satellite data guide her research but do not alter tactics or charge the final image; the station functions as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    Spatial choreography is clear (repair bay, freighter, stone circle), and sensory details (dusty floor, fractured ceiling, humming stones) are vivid and consistent. However, the spaceport functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature narrows her choices or alters tactics. The stone circle's sudden appearance in a technological ruin is jarring and unearned by prior world logic, creating a genre collision without payoff. The "margin of daylight" timeframe is mentioned three times but never pressures a decision or creates urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.1)
    Volcanic rock, steam, obsidian chamber, and hot springs anchor the setting with sensory specificity. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Maya moves freely through caverns without navigating hazards, and the geothermal power remains thematic backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The kite and amber embryo are props without micro-setting function. Spatial choreography is clear but static; the reconstruction village exists only as mentioned context.

    The arboretum and cliffside provide concrete sensory anchors (salty air, cool earth, churning sea) filtered through Maya's gardening expertise. The oyster shell discovery that generates the "pearl of stillness" metaphor shows setting constraining conceptual development. The spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the final cliff-edge positioning charges the photograph release. The micro-setting of hands on earth during panic episodes demonstrates how environment enables coping tactics, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not fully integrating setting pressure into the central conflict's escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lighthouse library is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (dust motes, circular architecture, high window). The tarot box and threads function as micro-setting that constrains Eleanor's sorting process. The lighthouse's breathing walls mirror her emotional state, though this risks overt symbolism. The setting charges the final image (library walls as "gentle embrace"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but spatial choreography during the sorting sequence remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The wind-carved encampment is vividly rendered and its celestial-anomaly property is tied to the research premise. The hummingbird drone and disappearing ink supply tactical texture. However, the setting does not constrain the protagonist's key choice or alter the outcome—stepping into the ink could occur in any lab. The spatial choreography inside the shelter (worktable, stone slab, vial) is clear but does not pressure the disappearance action. Strong atmospheric specificity, but the environment functions as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cryogenic archive setting is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("thermal suit," "amber-light," "profound silence") and recurs throughout. The "echoing library under snow" phrase appears six times, creating a motif that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice—Elena's access to dormant networks and her ability to upload are frictionless. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the cold/silence atmosphere supports tone, but the environment does not alter tactics or shape the ending's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass dome, desert heat, and condensation are vivid and coherent. Spatial choreography (moving between rows, central bed) is clean. However, setting remains primarily atmospheric; the dome's humidity and heat don't constrain a choice or alter tactics. The micro-setting (airship scrap fabric) is handled but functions as symbolic vessel rather than a tool that pressures action, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound-wave garden is vividly described with "visible ripples" and "transparent flora," and the rail spike appears in multiple beats, but neither constrains a choice at closure. The setting remains ornamental: the fisher navigates it without friction, and the spike serves as anchor and receptacle but never forces a tactical compromise. Spatial choreography is clear, and sensory detail is purposeful, but the environment does not pressure the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    The echoing observatory is vividly sketched (curved walls, star-filled dome, clouds below) and anchors the setting early. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental detail constrains Eleanor's investigative choices or charges the final image. The rosewood pen nib is handled repeatedly but remains a symbolic token rather than a tool that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lab is anchored early with "otherworldly blue lights" and "ancient servers," and the amber is handled across multiple beats (staring, connecting, glowing, cooling). The insect's silhouette "growing more ominous" under shifting light is evocative. However, the lab's spatial layout and the amber's physical mechanics (how it connects to firmware) remain vague. The environment does not meaningfully constrain Elias's choices—he reorganizes, discovers letters, and connects equipment without friction. The amber charges the final image but does not alter tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto's mist and stone are mentioned but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—Silas works "with his back to the entrance," yet we never see how the crowd's position or the grotto's acoustics shape his sand-pattern work. The "whispering gallery tile flake" is handled twice (opening, closing) but remains a prop rather than a micro-setting element that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, cracked stones, and mosaic stepping stone are vividly rendered and anchor the story spatially. The minaret tessera functions as a recurring object that Elias handles twice (encounter, placement) and its blue-and-gold enamel charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong (dust, warm tessera, fractured light) and the environment subtly mirrors Elias's internal state. The mosaic's chipped patterns constrain his ritual method and the tessera's placement alters the visual field at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vividly rendered with synesthetic particulars (colors that sing, scents that paint memories), and the stone stage functions as a charged threshold. However, much of the setting operates as backdrop; the hedge walls and apple blossoms do not constrain Silas's choices or alter his tactics. The recurring tarot coin does charge the final image, but the orchard itself remains more symbolic than tactical. Spatial choreography is clear, and the moonlit atmosphere supports tone, but the environment does not pressure the protagonist's decisions in a way that would elevate the score into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.1)
    The light painting studio is named and its equipment described, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—none of Maya's choices are enabled or blocked by spatial access, tool availability, or the studio's properties. The muscovite geode's "fractally precise patterns" are vivid but remain visual decoration; they do not pressure a decision or charge the final image with cost. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through Maya's professional priorities or embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coastal cave network provides vivid spatial grounding—rope descent, seventh chamber, rock altar—and the darkness constrains movement. Thermal mapping equipment and the floating fossil charge the final chamber scene. However, sensory detail is unevenly distributed: the descent is vividly tactile, but the crucial discovery beat leans on the mystical phenomenon rather than embodied perception. The fossil's hover and the cave's role satisfy the micro-setting test by constraining access and shaping the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is signaled early and recurs throughout, providing atmospheric consistency. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—buttons could be cataloged anywhere, the cliff proximity never pressures choice, and spatial choreography remains generic. The amber light and canyon echo create mood but don't alter tactics or charge the final image with spatial specificity. Micro-setting (buttons, jar) comes closest to functional integration but still feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    The zephyr bluff, mist, and snow are vividly rendered with sensory detail filtered through Aleksandr's exile mindset. Spatial choreography is coherent (highest point, descent path). The snow as a medium for his codes does constrain his ritual and charges the final image when he leaves the patterns behind. However, setting detail occasionally stalls momentum with decorative layering ("silver hush" repeated four times, "windswept," "mist clinging") rather than integrating tightly into choice-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Fog, wet planks, rain gutters, and the tollhouse are rendered with vivid sensory detail and POV filter (the coachman's attentiveness to "shifts in wind, patterns in fog"). The rain gutters function as a live clock, shaping the ritual's window. Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it merely provides backdrop for an uncontested action. The final image does not charge through setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scorched wasteland, thriving wildflowers, dead hives, and stone cottage anchor the oasis vividly. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting: Kael holds it up, follows sun patterns through it, and uses it to witness fractured timelines—this constrains his choices and charges the final sequence. Sensory selection (shimmering heat, thrum in bones, smoke bending light) supports atmosphere without catalog excess. The micro-setting gate is met cleanly, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    The harbor and alcove provide atmospheric staging, and the bitting gauge tool's light-reflection mechanics constrain Mara's physical action in the final third. However, the fire escape and rosebush (opening anchors) vanish without spatial transition, creating a floating-room effect mid-story. The rowboat and alcove rock remain static backdrops; neither pressures a choice or alters tactics before the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal library is vividly rendered—shelves breathing, books flowing on currents—and the brass sundial and atomically reflective surfaces supply memorable visual anchors. However, none of these elements constrain a choice or charge the final image; they remain postcard descriptions. Spatial choreography is coherent (corridors, crystal window, stone circle foundation), but Elena never interacts with the environment in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a path, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are vivid and purposefully atmospheric, with rain-charged imagery that establishes tone. The thrush's nest is handled twice (initial observation, then traced with eyes), and the installation's invisible filament is noted. However, the temple functions primarily as a backdrop for Elara's reflection rather than constraining her choices—she could reach the same realization in many contemplative spaces. The micro-setting (nest, installation) charges the final image but does not alter tactics or options during the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The radio station setting is anchored early with "cramped studio," "vintage equipment," and "blinking monitor," and it constrains Elara's choice by providing the modified transmitter. The astronomical charts appear in multiple beats and are described as trembling during the interference, creating a tactile link to the stakes. However, the university campus and town divisions remain abstract; we see no bodies, distances, or spatial choreography that would ground the escalation. The subsonic waves and their physical effects (blue light, crackling air, static electricity) are vivid but lack specificity that ties them to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed nexus is anchored with concrete detail (starlight through ceiling cracks, geometric center, faded runes) and the compass point is handled tactilely (humming in her palm, spinning, hovering). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The starlight actively shapes the ritual (threads woven into a pattern), meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice, but the final portal's "impossible geometry and floating islands" reads as ornamental postcard description rather than a lived constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quarry anchors location early with vivid sensory detail ("granite face met the morning fog," "furrowed hush"). The ribbon fragment is handled twice (extraction, comparison) and the terrain's angles are measured, but neither the quarry's geography nor the ribbon's physical properties constrain Elena's choices in a peak beat. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure point. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The weather station setting is vivid (concrete walls, damp chill, blue-lit panels) and the coffin nail recurs across beats, anchoring the closure image. However, the environment does not constrain Eli's choices—tools and systems respond conveniently when needed. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting supports atmosphere but does not pressure tactics, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mountain scenic pullout, guardrail, and construction site are named but remain postcard backdrops—no spatial constraint affects Elias's walk or choice. The glass flake is handled (warmed, projects an image) and scaffold wrap flutters recur across beats, which lifts the score into functional range. However, the wrap's "secret map" is asserted rather than demonstrated through lived spatial pressure, and the final ascent occurs without altitude, scaffold geometry, or wind affecting his body or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly described with "scarlet and gold peeling paint" and the conference-room/server-room conversion, but these details remain postcard description rather than constraining choices or charging the final image. The foreign currency collection receives repeated mention but functions as exposition about Elias's curiosity rather than a tool or object that alters tactics. Spatial choreography within the train is unclear—Marcus "stands before him" but we never learn where Elias sits or how the office is configured. The ending location shift ("stepped away from the abandoned circus train") is clean but the train itself has not materially shaped any on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory's telescopes and celestial charts ground the opening, and the variable stars constrain Elara's method of decoding. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop during the collaboration beat; no environmental feature pressures the final choice or charges the closure image beyond general atmosphere. The daylily telegram introduces tactile detail but does not evolve causally with events.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vortex and cursed lake are vividly described with sensory detail (twisted trees, dark waters reflecting nothing, concentric rings). The flesh-eating plant seed gains tactile presence (grows warm, pulses, sprouts tendrils) and its carnivorous nature directly solves the ice problem, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the orchard itself remains a postcard backdrop; trees lean in "like curious fingers" without altering tactics or supplying resources beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt glade is vivid in color and light but remains static postcard description; "blue-tinted grass," "elongated blue shadows," and "cobalt light" recur without constraining choice or altering tactics. The miniature maze offers micro-setting potential but is navigated without spatial friction—no dead ends are encountered, no pathway choices dramatized. The body ("shrinking to match its scale") is asserted but not grounded in sensation or consequence. No object or environment element charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: roots snaking between bones, fruit trees growing from ancestral remains, half-lit corridors. Spatial choreography is clean—Elara moves from alcove to the oldest tree at the heart—and the setting's life-from-death duality charges the atmosphere. The setting participates in the final beat (the orchard "breathes," trees "rustle in agreement"), lending weight to the closure moment and satisfying the Q3 9+ gate partially, though the choice itself remains externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    The quarry trailer and scrap of cloth are concrete and purposeful, grounding Marcus's appraisal work. The magnifying glass and thread-count detail constrain one mid-scene choice (authentication), satisfying the micro-setting allowance. However, the setting does not charge the final image; Marcus's emotional turn could occur anywhere. Sensory detail is selective but occasionally generic ("dust and resignation," "summer heat").

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting elements (magnetic arbor, Pamir Mountains, upper atmosphere) remain abstract postcards without sensory grounding or spatial choreography. The study is cluttered but unanchored; no tool, body detail, or environmental constraint shapes a choice. The seed's "subtle vibration" and the arbor's "crackling static energy" are described but never interact with on-page action. Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the test.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered (crystalline ceiling, water rippling, transparent dome) and establishes contradiction (library floor that submerges texts). The titan-gear and water cycle provide sensory specificity, and the forge's "cold fire" offers a purposeful detail. However, the environment never constrains a choice or shapes the closure image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The bamboo creel is handled across beats but does not alter tactics or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    The crystal caves are vivid ("ethereal blue light," "pedestal of pure crystal") and anchor the middle sequence, constraining the inspector's approach to the pearl. However, spatial choreography above and below ground is vague—no transition detail between bunker and caves, no sense of distance or physical effort. The caves shape one key choice (approaching the pearl) but do not recur to charge the ending; the surface world remains generic. The seashell and pearl function as micro-setting objects in the cave, but their physical presence does not constrain later action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered—ivy, dust motes, peeling paint—and the underground cavern finale provides a charged spatial payoff. However, much of the setting functions as backdrop; the bathroom graffiti and tunnel descent are more plot devices than constraints that shape Elena's choices. The accordion (patched bellows, yellow tape) does return at closure and gains symbolic weight, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The forest mist and glowing library walls are vividly rendered and the watch recurs across beats, but none constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist simply observes and transcribes. Spatial choreography is clean (approach, entrance, interior, exit) and the mist functions as atmospheric anchor. However, the setting remains postcard description without pressuring the central conflict, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The velvet observatory at midsummer supplies a tactile, sensory anchor: mulberry drapes absorbing arctic light, heat-exhausted magnolias, moss on ancient stones. The ice violin's microscopic fractures and the desert rose's pot near the workbench constrain Elara's choices—she uses the audio array, the greenhouse plants' proximity, and the violin's resonant frequency. The setting participates directly in the closure: the plants lean in, the crystalline dust settles on thorns, and the new violin buds at the root.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline walls, shifting green-violet light, transparent walls with drifting clouds). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara's work would proceed identically in any sanctum. The emerald chip and the body function as micro-setting elements, but neither imposes friction on her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with specific images (clouds as solid ground, scallop-shell light patterns, umbral space), and the cedar tree provides spatial anchoring. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara moves through the space without friction, and the environment serves as backdrop rather than crucible. The hairpin and grotto touch the final image, but their properties do not shape the outcome. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental. Applying the 9+ gate failure: no constraint on choice, no charge to final image via environment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lighthouse and chimes are vivid and purposeful; the breezy setting creates sensory texture ("morning mist," "wind picked up") and the lantern room functions as workspace. Spatial choreography is clear: spiral stairs, lantern room, fire pit below. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the chimes are consulted but their mechanism does not test Elian or impose difficulty. The hollow mirror shard is handled repeatedly but remains inert; it does not charge the final image beyond metaphorical echo. Micro-setting qualifies (body, tool, object) but does not reach the 9+ gate because no tactile or spatial element forces a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    The floating rock platform and magnetic grotto are named repeatedly but their spatial relationship and physical properties remain unclear—does the platform drift on water, levitate magnetically, or float by other means? The sycamore leaves and starlight provide atmosphere but do not constrain any choice. The stone Maya throws and the pond's rings are central to the method (Q9F) but the pond's location relative to the platform is never anchored, creating spatial incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bone towers and canyon setting provide vivid initial anchoring and the arrowhead returns at closure, satisfying minimal constraint. However, spatial choreography remains vague—how far is the "deepest recess," what does the depression look like, how do the towers relate to Kael's position? The environment never forces a tactical choice; it serves as backdrop for mystical atmosphere. The arrowhead's placement in the circular depression offers one moment where setting detail (the "humming" match) matters to outcome, lifting the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The icebound spire and cloud-layer garden folly provide vivid visual anchors. Sensory detail leans heavily on sight ("crystalline window," "brilliant dimness") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding during the mist-walking journey. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment does not constrain a choice at closure; the keystone's location is convenient rather than costly to reach. The body and the regulation pack approach micro-setting status but are described rather than handled in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    The pier, lighthouse, and sunken library are vividly sketched with sensory detail (weathered boards, dancing shadows, leather-bound glowing books). However, the underwater library imposes no constraint—water "didn't touch him"—rendering the setting decorative rather than a crucible that shapes tactics. The sky lanterns frame the night but never pressure a choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ambered observatory deck and contracting cosmos provide vivid sensory anchors. Spatial choreography is clean (deck, obsidian slab, monitoring stations). However, the setting remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Loran's decision. The coins "hum with energy" at the end, but this is asserted effect rather than tactile constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory is vividly anchored early (crumbling stone, domed ceiling, brass mechanism, cracked glass) and sensory detail is filtered through the reaper's mournful attention (scattered light, dusty floor). The atlas page and prisms participate in the naming ritual, constraining the reaper's gesture at closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and the environment charges the final image without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sapphire viaduct and dawn light are vivid and return at closure, charging the final image. However, the viaduct functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain the mage's choices or supply tactical resources that alter his approach. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the dripping water serves as a recurring sensory anchor, but the setting remains postcard-picturesque rather than exerting pressure on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ridgeway, emerging town structures, and cabin anchor space effectively. Sensory details (violet/indigo twilight, mirrored hush, glinting label) are vivid and filtered through Thomas's reflective lens. The liqueur label and photographs function as micro-setting objects that constrain discovery and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography during the cabin scene (journals, photographs) lacks tactile specificity, and the ridgeway does not pressure a choice—it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard are vividly described but function as backdrop—neither constrains a choice nor charges the final image beyond mood. The blue flame is introduced as "essential" yet Elara simply places the crystal above it without spatial negotiation or environmental friction. Sensory detail is present (prismatic spray, violet flame shift) but filtered through generic lyricism rather than POV-specific perception shaped by alchemical priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    The arbor-above-clouds premise is evocative but remains postcard-level; we get "thin atmosphere," "hanging homes," and "cloud sea" without tactile constraints that alter the watcher's choices. The parachute buckle appears repeatedly but functions as symbol rather than tool—it never limits movement or enables a tactic under pressure. Spatial choreography within the observation nest is unclear (receiver, keypad, tether positions never cohere into a legible workspace). The setting charges the final image thematically but does not constrain the protagonist's agency in a way that would push this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock dojo and brain-in-jar are vivid images, but the dojo functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is weak: Maya "stood at the edge," then "approached the jar," with no legible distance or obstacle. The "shimmer in the sky" and "rewrite of history" remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy filters these through Maya's professional or personal priorities. The brain's glow is generic; the jar does not shape tactics or charge the final image beyond declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly realized and functionally essential: its acoustics amplify and warp the lullabies, enabling the ritual's effect. The pull cord, blower nozzle, and spatial choreography (tunnel mouth facing the house) constrain Silas's actions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, focused on sound and vibration. The tunnel's final "held breath" charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting shape tactics and the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "frozen garden in mist" and "stone cherub" provide visual anchors, and the pendant's warmth and the roses' color shifts offer sensory evolution tied to plot. However, spatial choreography remains vague (no clear layout, distances, or exits), and the garden never constrains a choice or charges the final image—the guardian simply "stepped forward" into undefined space. The library is mentioned only in the title "library guardian" without any stacks, books, or spatial detail on the page. Micro-setting elements (body, tool, recurring object) do not shape tactics or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.6)
    The ember nexus is vividly described ("glowing particles floated like trapped fireflies") but remains a backdrop—it does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources that alter his tactics. Spatial choreography is absent: we never learn how he manipulates tools or crozier within the space. The setting recurs in the final beat ("ember nexus at twilight had witnessed"), which provides a lyric frame, but the environment never pressures the transformation itself, functioning as atmosphere rather than micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.6)
    The suspended city over a gorge and the radio tower summit are vividly sketched with sensory detail (mist, wind, steel structures, moon's silvery glow). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply obstacles during the tuning. The shard of hush silences ambient noise but the text does not dramatize what competing sounds threatened her work, weakening the micro-setting role. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    Setting details (translucent hull, liquid starlight, frozen time stalactites) are vivid but ornamental—they never constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The grotto's "ancient chronal energy" and three moons exist as postcards, not pressure. Spatial choreography remains coherent (ferry to grotto, two vessels converging) but the micro-setting (radio, control panel patterns, hourglass) is handled without consequence. No environmental detail charges the final image or narrows Liam's options.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly sketched ("walls seemed to bend and shadows played tricks") and the sinew thread receives concrete handling in the weaving beats. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the eruption sequence—visitors gasp and reach out, but their positions and the gallery's layout dissolve into abstraction. The setting constrains one choice (Elias touching the tapestry triggers the transition), narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate requirement, but the final fever-dream landscape is generic ("ever-shifting landscape of possibility") without sensory anchors or body/tool detail that would charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    The benthic city setting is vivid and specific: bioluminescent algae, pressure seals, submerged ruins, three miles of ocean overhead. Sensory details are well-filtered through Kael's professional perspective (sonar-based navigation, viewport observations). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—no moment shows Kael navigating physical limits of the underwater city or using its spatial properties to solve a problem. The chain link and viewport are handled on the page, satisfying the micro-setting option, and the chain link charges the final image by representing connection. The setting contributes atmosphere and grounds the stakes but does not pressure a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mist-clad atrium and twilight setting anchor early and supply atmospheric specificity. The garden bench and adjoining archways provide clear spatial choreography. However, the hearing aid's physical mechanics remain vague ("faint pulses," "tiny light"), and the decades-old device constraining no meaningful choice in the peak beat. The photograph as setting object is mentioned but not handled or examined on the page during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The facility is vividly rendered (salt-stained concrete, rusted cabinet, concrete cylinder), and the tidal window constrains the mission clock. The Codex and the undersea cables anchor the ritual space. However, the setting does not alter Elara's tactics or constrain a choice—she moves through the space as planned, and no environmental friction forces adaptation. The final image (waves, cliffs, sacred silence) charges the ending but remains lyric backdrop rather than a micro-setting element that shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "opal observatory" is named repeatedly but never grounds spatial choreography—terminal station, tower, downstairs, observation plate, and chamber placements remain unclear. Sensory detail defaults to generic (iridescent walls, liquid darkness, faint light) without POV-specific selection or urgency filter. The porcelain shard and ink do not constrain a choice or pressure the protagonist's options; they are handled as symbolic props rather than physical tools with tactile consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    Towers of bone, canyon echoes, and the tunnel are vivid and consistently referenced. The birds and diamond interact with setting in the climax, constraining the method enough to lift mid-band. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment never blocks a choice or forces a tactical shift; it supplies resources without friction, keeping the score from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    The underground garden is vividly rendered with bioluminescent mushrooms, moon-petal flowers, and gremlins that metamorphose stone-to-flesh. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (the "distinctive scent of frostbitten hope," the "gravitationally playful" ceiling roots). The flint arrowhead returns with evolving detail (sharp facets, warmth, luminous patterns), charging the final image. However, the garden does not constrain a key choice—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The micro-setting (arrowhead on desk, herbalist's study) is mentioned but not leveraged to alter decision-making.

    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the metallic sky-bridge, copper sky, crystalline fruit, glowing roots. The orchard and living statues supply concrete obstacles that shape Elayn's tactics (playing to calm the guardians, asking the tree's permission). However, the sapling's integration into the bridge framework at the end is told rather than shown constraining a choice or charging the final image in a tactile way. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt arcade lights and "brittle hush" establish a vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Sensory details—neon blue, scarred plastic table, whirring arcade machines—ground the handoff and filter through Elias's professional vigilance. The bottle itself functions as micro-setting, its contained storm a tactile object that charges the exchange. The setting constrains the action (shift change timing, guard presence) and the arcade's artificial escape contrasts the divided territory outside, supporting the thematic work without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned train and secret garden are vivid and contrasted effectively, but they do not constrain choices or shape tactics. The "door that had never existed before" and "corridor that defied physics" appear as conveniences rather than setting pressures. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("misting hush," "whispering gleam," "fruits of impossible colors"), yet the oasis functions as backdrop for the carpenter's epiphany rather than a micro-setting that alters the final decision or charges the closure image with spatial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scientific poetry library setting is anchored and recurs across beats, providing atmosphere and framing the hyperbolic book arrangement. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—Margaret's actions are not meaningfully limited by the space, and patrons browsing (the timeframe element) never pressure her work. The hyperbolic configuration charges the final third, but the library itself does not alter tactics or supply resources that affect outcome; it remains a vivid container rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The whispering archipelago and library basement studio are vividly sketched, and the easternmost point gains specificity through repeated use. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the location does not constrain Elara's choices or enable tactics under pressure. The watercolor palette and camera are handled across multiple beats, qualifying as micro-setting objects, but their physical properties (weight, fragility, light requirements) do not alter action. Sensory detail is present but generic ("murmur secrets," "living, breathing images") rather than filtered through Elara's professional librarian lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    Twilight palette ("indigo and lavender"), the first star, and the stone at the crossroads supply atmospheric anchors. The nexus itself remains abstract—"shimmer at the edges of reality" and "space between heartbeats" describe effect without grounding spatial choreography or micro-setting that would constrain action. The compass spinning wildly is mentioned but not used. The lock of hair functions as a prop in two beats (forehead press, transformation to thread), satisfying the micro-setting allowance, but does not visibly alter tactics or charge the final image with concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and fairy ring create a vivid liminal space with strong sensory grounding ("vines that had claimed the space," "wooden hulls collapsed like skeletons"). The fairy ring pulses with light at a key moment, constraining Elara's movement and enabling her memory recovery, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the constellations themselves are described abstractly ("broken ones—stars that didn't align") without specific navigational or perceptual detail that would anchor how Elara uses them to decode the ring's pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    The library setting is anchored early with vivid particulars (Case of Slumbering Histories, Wall of Whispering Shadows, porcelain dish). The workspace—worktable, shelves, windows—constrains the demonstration and provides tactile tools (shard, leaves, dish). However, spatial choreography during the "reversible exile" becomes vague; the archivist's outline "wavered and split" but we lose track of his body's exact position. The afternoon shadow detaching and dancing across the table charges one beat but doesn't recur at closure to reweight the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall are vivid and named repeatedly, anchoring space adequately. Sensory detail leans visual and generic (moss, mist, silver hair, gold sunset) without POV-specific filter or constraint on choice. The setting remains postcard backdrop; the waterfall "whispers secrets" and "holds its breath" in stock metaphor without altering the pruner's tactics or shaping the seed transformation. No tool, body limit, or spatial friction pressures the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism sanctuary is vivid and consistent, with starlight and fractured rainbows creating a distinct atmosphere. The net functions as a micro-setting object that enables the climactic unraveling. However, the sanctuary itself doesn't constrain Elena's choices—she works unimpeded, and the space functions more as backdrop than pressure. The starlight's role in "grounding" the spirits is poetic but mechanically unclear, which limits its tactical function.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault supplies vivid atmosphere ("persistent drumming of water on ancient stone"), and the torn map functions as a micro-setting object that charges the closure image when Elara repairs it. Spatial choreography is clean; the vault, workspace, and surveillance footage cohere. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's discovery unfolds through passive observation rather than navigating access, proximity, or a world-rule obstacle. Scope-appropriate detail without occupational depth beyond generic "map framer" tasks.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken ship library is vividly sketched ("RMS Lyonesse," "reinforced windows," "ocean outside…pressed against the library walls") and the snow globe is handled with specificity (Japanese letters, plane position). However, the underwater environment doesn't constrain Elara's actions; she could conduct this investigation anywhere. The snow globe's micro-setting (object-as-setting) charges the final image when the plane vanishes, lifting the score, but the library itself remains postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.1)
    The misty courtyard and graffiti walls are vividly described, and the "between lightning and thunder" timeframe is poetic. However, the courtyard never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—it remains a static backdrop. The flower press bolt plate is mentioned as a tool but its mechanics (how botanical etchings translate thoughts into graffiti) are asserted, not demonstrated. Spatial choreography is unclear: how does one "press the plate against graffiti" to encode thoughts?

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.7)
    The icebound spire and crystalline elevator are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (floor markings, ice-crystal patterns on windows, observation deck). The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining the decryption method and charging the final revelation. However, spatial choreography within the elevator remains generic—no tactile interaction with controls or physical positioning that shapes her thoughts—and the observation deck at floor ten is described but does not constrain her final choice. The environment sets mood but does not narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sky gondola is named early and provides spatial grounding, but it functions as static backdrop rather than shaping choice or constraining action. The brass telescope returns across multiple beats yet remains a viewing tool without evolving use or friction. The "dusty starlight" and cloud descriptions lean atmospheric but do not alter Elena's options or charge the final image with setting-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The hollowed tree trunk, moonlight through carved leaf patterns, and the hidden floorboard depression all pressure Elara's discovery sequence. The coin's tactile indentations serve as micro-setting that enables her pattern recognition. Spatial choreography is clear (central chamber, floor, walls). The tree's imminent demolition provides temporal constraint, and the final wall impressions charge the closure image, lifting the setting into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The antique airship, observation deck, and hopscotch board provide spatial anchors and purposeful detail. The dusty board and dog-eared phrasebook are handled on the page and constrain Eli's investigation. However, the airship itself remains a postcard backdrop—its wood and brass gain metaphorical weight only in summary ("repository of ancient knowledge") without altering tactics or choices. The stranded luminance and starling murmurations are vividly described but function more as atmospheric objects than environmental pressures that shape Eli's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen library and hall of mirrors supply vivid sensory anchors ("ice crystallized on ancient bookshelves," "reflections multiplied infinitely"). Spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Elias's tactics or the final choice. The clockwork heart and tools are handled on the page, qualifying as micro-setting, but they enable rather than constrain.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Floating arches, violet sunsets, and the nebula of respite are vivid but ornamental; none constrains a choice or charges the final image. The watering bell's mechanics ("mist that carried symbiotic butterfly larvae") appear once without sensory grounding or tactile interaction. Spatial choreography is clean in the opening paragraphs, but the story abandons concrete setting for abstraction ("central orchard," "their walkways") as it progresses, never using proximity or access to shape a character decision.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse interior—spiraling iron stairs, circular chamber, starlight-and-shadow clock mechanism—is vividly rendered and the velvet pouch and puppet head are handled across multiple beats, meeting the micro-setting standard. The ocean's "bruised purple and bruised orange" and the "pane of hush" offer atmospheric specificity filtered through the stakes. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift; Elias moves through the space without spatial friction, and the final image (lighthouse beam sweeping) charges mood but does not alter options. The setting serves as vivid backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    The orchard and labyrinth are vividly described with concrete sensory detail (twisted trees, mechanical birds, night frost forming as glittering crystals). Spatial choreography through the labyrinth corridors is clear and the environment actively threatens via frost and mechanical patrols. However, the setting functions primarily as obstacle rather than constraining choice or charging the final image—Elias navigates it successfully without the environment forcing tactical compromise or appearing in the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    The braided ravine is vividly anchored (split channels, foam patterns, afternoon light) and the chrysalis and river structure are purposeful. However, the ravine functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining choice; Elara could gain the same insight in any reflective setting. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, kneeling, climbing out), but the setting does not alter tactics or pressure the phone-call decision.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass orchard library atop clouds is vivid and sustained, with specific recurring objects (bottled moonlight phases, memory shards, glass birds). However, spatial choreography floats: the vendor moves between shelves, counter, central tree, and floor without coherent blocking. The final door "pressed together" from shards offers a micro-setting constraint that charges the ending image, lifting the score above mid-band despite the earlier drift. "Floating library shifted" reminds us of the cloud-sea but does not alter a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    The coral icebound pavilion and tidal pool formations provide vivid, specific anchors. Sensory selection is purposeful: damp sand, icy sheen, mirror-pool surface. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Kael finds what he seeks without obstacle, and the pavilion's "brittle walls" threaten collapse but never do, leaving the detail ornamental rather than pressuring the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly introduced but functions primarily as backdrop; its celestial mechanisms never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The cuckoo clock weight is handled twice (discovery, final display), meeting basic integration, but the tower itself remains postcard description. Spatial choreography is clean, and the grain silos are mentioned but not used as physical setting elements that shape action.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon is established early with vivid imagery ("silver light," "ancient rock walls"), and the broken mirror's fractured surface is handled twice (adjustment, later activation). However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics—the mirror's "imperfections" enable rather than complicate, and the canyon functions as static backdrop. Spatial choreography is coherent but the setting does not pressure the stakes. Micro-setting allowance applies but the mirror does not force a tradeoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    The serpentine grotto and gravity-inversion premise are vivid in concept but underused in execution: the mist and stone walls are described, yet they do not constrain Elara's movement or complicate her choices. The manuscript margin doodle returns as a warm object in her pocket, a purposeful callback, but the grotto itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is legible, and the "clandestinely luminous" runes provide atmospheric detail, lifting the score slightly above purely ornamental setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: fog clinging "like whispered secrets," weak sun filtering through canopy, porcelain insulator scattering rainbows. The grove, insulator, and sculpture anchor the scene spatially. Yet the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no constraint (weather, tool limitation, root placement) forces a tactical choice or charges the final image. The insulator is handled in two beats (carrying it, positioning it beside the sculpture) but does not constrain action—it amplifies vibrations Elara already senses, so it remains assistive rather than restrictive.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.1)
    The magnetic nexus at twilight anchors location and atmosphere early, and the worry stone's dent functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory details—"air crackling with energy," "shimmering patterns across the sky"—are vivid but largely decorative; they don't constrain a choice or alter tactics. The notebooks arranged in a semicircle offer spatial grounding but serve symbolic staging more than functional pressure. The setting supports tone well but remains short of forcing a decision through proximity or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "shadowed workshop under stars" is named early and crystals/tuning forks populate the space, but setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. No object placement or spatial limit alters Elara's tactics; the workshop could be any room. Sensory detail (celestial light, ambient vibrations) is vivid but ornamental. The fireworks timeframe offers potential pressure but is invoked only as poetic frame, not a ticking clock that forces choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    The treetop village, rope bridges, and mists provide vivid spatial anchoring and the research perch functions as a micro-setting for observation. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("blue light," "wildflower hush") with minimal tactile or olfactory grounding despite Elara's olfactory sensitivity being a named trait. The seed's filaments and wrapping-paper doodles appear in the closure paragraph, lending the ending a concrete image, which lifts the score into mid-band. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—Elara climbs "higher than any villager dared" without consequence, and the village itself remains atmosphere rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    The floating arches, inverted rivers, and gravitational reversal create vivid sensory anchors and constrain navigation choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across the inversion sequence. The First Arch's embedded crystals and the "gathering of echoes" charge the final-third setting. However, the orchard planet itself remains somewhat generic; specific tree species, soil textures, or micro-climate details that would make Verdantis irreplaceable are absent, limiting the score's reach into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wind corridors, compression/expansion damage, distorted air). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though Elena's movements through the maze lack specificity about distances or landmarks that would anchor her position. The setting pressures her observations but never constrains a choice—she moves freely, and the environment supplies data without forcing trade-offs or altering her tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with synesthetic interplay of light, sound, and crystalline surfaces. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics during the performance. The amber music sheet glows and the bells refract, but these details amplify atmosphere rather than imposing logistical friction. Micro-setting (the sheet, the bells) charges the final image but does not shape a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Thunder-echo range supplies acoustic properties that enable the ritual ("the sound seemed to grow exponentially, bouncing back and forth"), and the driftwood markers anchor the spiral pattern, creating a purposeful micro-setting. Spatial choreography remains clear (edge of range, mountain stream, center of spiral, return to stream). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff; it merely provides a stage for meditation. The final image does not charge the mountains with new meaning—they "held his songs of regret and redemption" is metaphorical summary, not a concrete payoff that reweights prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The topaz workshop and skylight establish a vivid visual anchor, and the halo fragment's light is handled twice (drawing Thomas, then blazing during transfer). However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no spatial constraint or tool access alters Elara's tactics or Thomas's escape. The micro-setting quick test is not met: the fragment enables the power but does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and dragonfly-wing pendant supply vivid sensory anchors, and the ground responding to the pendant's vibration offers purposeful detail. However, the ridgeway itself does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear (ridge marker, valley, village gates) but the setting never pressures a decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The quartz arbor and frost-patterned car window provide vivid anchors; sensory details (mist, weak dawn light, frost swirls) are purposeful and consistent. However, setting remains decorative—it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The arbor "pulses" and pillars "glow" when the prism reveals memories, but this is atmospheric reaction rather than spatial pressure shaping the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bamboo forest and forgotten orchard establish a vivid lyric setting with "green-gold" light and "mossy forest floor," but spatial choreography is vague—Elara's exact location within the forest, the market's distance, and the final bamboo shoot's relation to her starting point remain unclear. The amber bead functions as a recurring object that charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. Sensory detail is selectively vivid (the bead's warmth, the forest's silence) but does not constrain a key choice; Elara's path is guided entirely by the bead's glow, not by environmental obstacles. The setting remains atmospheric rather than a tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating arches, orchards, and mine shafts are vividly evoked and the azure glow is consistent. The mine becomes a workspace, but the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond atmospheric description. Spatial choreography is clean and the sensory palette (glowing arches, dripping water, azure light) is purposeful, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than as a force that narrows options or supplies resources affecting outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    The repair bay is anchored early with "dust motes," "workbenches," "tools frozen in mid-project," establishing atmosphere. However, spatial choreography never coheres—objects and distances do not track across the protagonist's movements or between realities. The green shard is handled repeatedly and its warmth/heat modulates with story beats, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains one choice (preventing contact with the red shard). Sensory detail leans visual; the alternate timelines (hospital, art gallery) are told rather than shown through texture or choice-altering features.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse interior is vividly rendered ("salt, oil, and something like the pause between thunderclaps") and the sea glass functions as micro-setting object that charges the final act. Spatial choreography is coherent (dock, spiral staircase, lantern room, control panel, floorboard). The lantern room's "haunted" reputation sets tone but does not constrain a choice; the lamp's failure provides discovery access, not tactical pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency during the blackout. The recurring sea glass and stone stack anchor closure, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly, though the haunted element remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and aurora energy establish a vivid speculative setting with consistent internal rules. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the wick "pulsed," the beam "painted paths"), and spatial choreography (spiral stairs, mirrors, lenses) remains coherent. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint alters Elara's choices or charges the final image—she manipulates her tools without friction or cost, and the locale could be replaced with minor edits.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock tea house and valley-mist setting are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rope ladder, prisms, morning light). However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome; it remains postcard description. Spatial choreography is clean, and the blue morpho wing's iridescence is well-observed, but these details do not pressure Kaelen's decisions or charge the final image with micro-setting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight, and scarred oak floorboard are vivid and return meaningfully at closure. The sextant's alignment with the moonbeam on the specific board creates a micro-setting constraint that charges the final image. Sensory selection is adequate (moonlight slicing, storm raging, tin cup chime) and filtered through Samuel's maintenance-worker familiarity. However, the labyrinth's "dormant neural pathways" and "arboreal consciousness" remain abstract metaphors rather than tactile, lived-in spaces; spatial choreography of the "echoing observatory floor" versus "downstairs" tin cup is vague. The storm outside contrasts the silence within but does not pressure Samuel's choices directly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse, mica window, and phosphorescent flora are vividly rendered with specificity (starlight saplings, leaves of silver and jade). The mica window returns in paragraph 12 with reweighted meaning (reflecting sunrise patterns), constraining perception and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent across the orchard rows. However, the environment does not limit the keeper's choices or create friction; it remains a luminous backdrop rather than a tactical constraint that alters action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The library setting is vividly anchored (grandfather clock, aisles, hidden chamber beneath) and the recurring motif of books and spines reinforces Eleanor's isolation. The crumpled invitation and the note she writes are handled on the page, and the library's "hidden in plain sight" paradox is integrated into the thematic texture. However, setting does not materially constrain Eleanor's choices—she could have reached the same internal acceptance anywhere. The clock chimes signal midnight but do not tighten decisions; the environment supplies atmosphere rather than tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.1)
    The overgrown palace courtyard and tea house supply vivid sensory anchors (wisteria, tin roof, flagstones) and the guerrilla garden constrains Eliza's method across beats. However, spatial choreography inside the tea house remains generic ("low wooden table"), and the setting does not pressure the climactic choice—reading the letter could occur anywhere. The recurring bread object charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics at closure, keeping Q3 in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen library, quartz hush, and ice-encrusted windows establish vivid atmosphere and remain consistent. The magic lantern slide and frequency sampler are handled across beats, and the library "pulses in response" to Elias's work, lending modest constraint. Micro-setting (the slide, the sampler) charges the middle action but does not visibly alter tactics at closure—Elias simply repeats his measurement ritual. The final brightening of the library feels symbolic rather than a concrete resource or pressure that shapes the ending choice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rotting pier, rum barrels, tavern corner, and back room are present and spatially coherent; the watch fob recurs and charges the final image by capturing the sound. However, the environment remains backdrop—none of the physical details (creaking wood, damp air, barrels) constrain Eliza's movement or alter her tactics; she navigates freely without friction. The time constraint ("until sunrise") is declared but never tightens her choices on the page; the sky "showing signs" arrives as scene dressing rather than forcing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory details ("metallic taste," "ozone and copper") establish atmosphere, but the setting remains postcard-generic—lavender, aurora, and forest could be anywhere. The bluff does not constrain movement or choice; spatial choreography is absent (how far apart are the characters? what terrain must be crossed?). Micro-setting option unused; no tool or body-space limits action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly described with auroral glow, amethyst clusters, and moonstone patterns. The cave enables the climactic act (painting by crystal light reveals hidden blues) and the loose crystal panel functions as storage, but these are conveniences rather than constraints that shape Rhodes's choices under pressure. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is concrete but largely ornamental. The cave charges the atmosphere yet does not force a tactical trade-off or narrow options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse-city premise and toxic-sky framing are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the world's scarcity and Elara's isolation. Specific objects—gilded leaves, solar lamp, oilcloth wrapping, zinc plate—are named and handled with care. The final image of the "toxic sky glowing with uncertain light" provides atmospheric closure that mirrors her resolve. The postal-plate fragment "felt warm...as if imbued with sincerity" edges toward symbolic convenience but remains tied to her interpretive lens rather than overt magic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering bluff, bell tower, and iceberg fragment anchor the setting vividly. Sensory detail—"glowed with inner light when struck," "glisten with a thousand colors"—is selective and purposeful. The fragment and tower constrain Elara's work spatially, and the sculpture's position "catch[es] the light of dawn," charging the final image. Minimal occupational depth (bell-tuning mechanics) and no spatial choreography under pressure prevent higher scores, but micro-setting (tower, fragment, mirrors) does enable the central action and recurs at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and bio-luminescent petals anchor setting vividly. The dome's wavering protective field constrains Unit 734's options during the magnetic shift, pushing the miniaturization choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across the dome interior. The crystalline box and the roses function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, lifting the score above mere description.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courtyard at dawn is named repeatedly but functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Leo could gather these stories anywhere. "Vibrant" and "gold" paint atmosphere yet no spatial detail (bench proximity, fountain acoustics, garden layout) shapes a choice. The locket and mailbox are handled in minimal tactile language; their physical presence does not alter tactics. The "defunct post office" appears only at resolution, too late to pressure earlier moves.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken laboratory setting is established early with sensory details ("coral-encrusted corner," "dripping pipes," "filtered sunlight") and the environment does constrain the plot—the facility's structure contains the journals and systems. However, much of the spatial detail is decorative rather than tactically deployed; the laboratory's specific architecture doesn't force micro-choices during the key dance sequence. The hangman's dice as a recurring object does charge the closure moment when Elara releases them, qualifying as micro-setting that reweights meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The salt crystal growing chamber and dock-side lanterns provide vivid, purposeful anchors that support tone and world logic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("gleaming silence," "salt crystal...like frozen light"). The beach and lighthouse quarters remain spatially coherent. The crystal itself constrains the climactic beat by its physical presence and visual properties, charging the final image. Minor deduction: the "strange gravitational anomalies" are asserted rather than dramatized through observable effects that alter movement or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal haven and quiet brook are described vividly and anchor the scene spatially. Sensory detail trends visual and generic ("moonlight weaving silver," "stars reflecting in the brook") without POV-specific filtering or constraint on action. The origami wing glows and transforms, but these changes do not alter the summoner's tactical options or charge the closure image—props remain decorative. No environmental or tool detail constrains a choice or shapes the final beat, capping the score below the 9+ gate despite competent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower provide vivid sensory anchors ("meteors streaked across the darkness, ephemeral as forgotten words"), and the desk seal recurs with charged imagery ("glowing faintly in the meteoric light"). However, the setting does not constrain a choice: the rooftop could be any private space for the reveal. Spatial choreography is clean, and the historic district is seeded early but remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.1)
    The velvet garden and twilight timing provide atmospheric anchoring. The crystal resonance structures and seashell are present across beats, but their physical mechanics remain vague—no detail constrains Elara's choices or alters her approach. Spatial choreography is minimal (kneeling on moss, arranging crystals in a pattern) and the garden's transformation at dawn is described rather than shown through changed access or pressure. The setting frames the ritual but does not shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The marble sanctuary and aurora are vivid and recur throughout, establishing strong atmosphere. Stalactite dripping provides rhythmic texture but does not constrain a choice. The key's warmth and the stone dissolving are sensory and purposeful, supporting the unlock beat. However, spatial choreography inside the sanctuary remains vague—no clear layout or tactical constraint shapes Elias's movements. The setting charges the final image (aurora fading as he leaves) but does not force a single on-page decision, keeping it in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "serpentine nexus under starlight" functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint on choice or resource. Spatial choreography is vague—paths wind, stone appears—but no detail guides or restricts the singer's tactics. The seashell is placed on stone in one beat, but this action does not alter movement or options. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual abstraction ("webs of intrigue," "shimmering thread") without touch, sound, or odor that would ground the POV in lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glacier shrine and wreck setting are vivid in isolation but remain postcard backdrops; neither environment constrains a choice or alters tactics. The snow globe's "strangely warm" glass and later "soft inner light" are asserted qualities that do not pressure any decision. Sensory hierarchy by POV is absent—wreck-diver details (pressure, visibility, current) and ghost-whisperer perceptions (spirit presence) are told rather than filtered through embodied urgency. Spatial choreography within the shrine is clear but inert.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the whispering parapet's moss-coated stones, moon paths after rain, fireflies across marshes. The bamboo whisk and nets are handled with tactile specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop for contemplation rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that affect outcome. The spatial choreography is clear and the sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's philosophical priorities, but setting remains descriptive rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wasteland orchard supplies vivid sensory anchors (glowing soil, trees leaning toward center, radioactive dust storms) that establish atmosphere. However, spatial choreography is vague—Maya's physical position relative to the pedestal, box, and trees shifts without clear transitions. The orchard's details remain static description rather than constraining her choices or shaping tactics; she moves through the space without friction. The diamond and orchard do participate in the final image, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory, cobalt glass portico, and atmospheric storm imagery are vivid and specific, lending atmospheric texture. However, setting remains postcard description: no tool, environmental constraint, or micro-setting choice alters Elias's tactics or charges the final image. The "floatstone mountain" and airship access are mentioned but never pressure a decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.1)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes is vividly rendered with shifting sands, filtered light, and glass jars lining the wall. The music box and senior center are sketched but do not constrain choices—the poet moves freely, and the environment supplies atmosphere without altering tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, but remains mostly decorative rather than pressuring the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drift-ice marina, azure coat, and lighthouse foundation are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (crunch of frozen seaweed, blood-red horizon, dust motes). The tuning fork and crypt keeper's key function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual choice. Spatial choreography across marina, tower, and foundation chamber remains clear. The setting does not materially alter tactics—Elias has uncontested access and the intruders pose no spatial obstacle—so it stops short of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cracking lake sounds, humming viaduct, oil lamp shadows). The viaduct's magnetic anomaly constrains the mapper's method and charges the zenith moment when it hums, satisfying the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography within the sanctuary is vague—no specific tool handling or room-to-room movement pressures a choice—and the setting does not evolve causally to alter the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tunnel setting is anchored with concrete details: pooled water, damp earth, mildew, yellow tape, protruding pipe. The lantern's "greenish patina and intricate metalwork" and the "tarnished" quality supply texture. However, the environment does not constrain Maya's choices—she moves freely, examines evidence without obstacle, and the flooding serves only as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The setting stages the investigation but does not meaningfully alter her path or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The music box shop is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("soft ticking of unseen mechanisms," "scent of aged wood and metal polish," stained-glass transom) and the velvet case with the clockwork heart functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. The clockwork heart's intricate gears and copper veins are specific and purposeful, and the light breaking through storm clouds offers a visual cue that pivots the decision. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, meeting the requirement that setting constrain or charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The brass-and-steam workshop, floating above an acid sea with gears and corridors, is vividly established and referenced throughout. The kaleidoscope at the workshop's center becomes a concrete tool that the glider uses to decode the arrow tip. The acid sea "momentarily paused its roiling" in response to the bell—a micro-setting beat that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (corridors, alcove, floorboards) remains clear. The workshop as micro-setting constrains navigation and supplies the bell's hiding place, meeting the 9+ gate criteria at the lower threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting remains generic digital-archive abstraction without spatial choreography or tactile anchors. "Grayed out" interface sectors and "warning symbols that glowed like malevolent eyes" offer visual metaphor but no physical constraint that alters Elara's tactics. The archive functions as a data repository rather than an environment that pressures choice. The final image ("city's underground network") introduces a new location without grounding, and no object or micro-setting detail charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    The lighthouse, orchard, and ice floes are visually vivid but remain postcard elements: none constrain a choice or alter Elena's tactics. The crystal fragment's "sharp edges biting into her palm even through the leather" is concrete, yet the glove negates the physical cost and the fragment itself becomes passive once the reconstitution begins. Spatial choreography is coherent (orchard → lighthouse beam → ice below), but the setting does not pressure the outcome—Elena could perform the same magic in any location. The vintage shop mirrors are told-only ("she had been to the vintage shop three times") without on-page handling or sensory anchoring in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered ("jagged sheets of frozen water that cracked and moaned") and returns at closure to anchor the transformation metaphor. However, the setting never constrains a tactical choice—Elena stands, watches, and reflects without the environment altering her options. The parasol tip and thermos are handled but remain postcard props. Spatial choreography is clear and the ice-melting image charges the final beat, meeting the micro-setting allowance but not the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber pavilion and autumn vineyard are vividly established and filter perception through the sentinel's lens (falling leaves, harvest moon, chill deepening). The burned letter edge functions as a recurring micro-object that anchors reflection across beats. However, setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the pavilion and vacant station remain static backdrops rather than pressures that shape the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearing are named repeatedly but remain atmospheric labels without constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean (pavilion → mosaic floor → chamber center → outside). The "kinetic parapet beneath the dunes" appears in three beats but never alters a tactic; it "responds" and "resonates" without shaping the line walker's actions. No tool, object, or environmental feature charges the final image or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender field and factory ruins are vivid and evocative, establishing a clear mood. However, the setting remains largely postcard description: neither the vines, the lavender, nor the ruins constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The dove gray map case is handled twice (extracting photos, revealing tokens) but does not meaningfully pressure the action. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not charge the final image or enable a closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.2)
    The shadowed library is vividly anchored with sensory detail (dust motes, slanted light, scent of old paper), and the crystal's sonic properties provide a concrete tool. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a static backdrop. The "suspended hush" and dawn light recur but function as atmospheric motifs rather than pressuring the scholar's decisions, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.7)
    The fog sculpture garden provides atmospheric texture and spatial anchors (metal arch, driftwood, condensation), and the fog itself shapes navigation tactics via the directional markers. The videotape memory in paragraph nine briefly grounds the protagonist's past but remains largely ornamental—no tape is present in the scene to constrain or enable a choice. The arch's role as the key structure is signaled midway and used at closure, satisfying the constraint test for this length. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, though some passages lean toward generic poetic register ("ships in a misty harbor").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lunar observatory is vivid in opening anchors (clouds below, moon in viewport, observation deck), and the clock as micro-object recurs across beats. However, setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she could perform the same contemplation and adjustment in any high-tech facility. The clock's placement outside "away from artificial sounds" gestures toward environmental pressure but the method revelation is auditory metaphor ("sound of a leaf falling") rather than spatial or material constraint. Sensory detail is present but largely ornamental; the round moon and cloud-ocean are postcard images that do not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    Cloudcrest Hospice is vividly named and the "radiant haven above the clouds" frame is repeated, but remains a postcard backdrop without constraining a single choice or supplying a resource that alters tactics. Lavender lotion and cedar chest add sensory texture, yet the room itself is functionally generic. The vinyl fragment (a micro-object) does charge the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the larger setting does not apply pressure or enable meaningful action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly named and anchored early, with celestial telescope and rune stones providing spatial grounding. However, the environment remains decorative: stones vibrate "with anticipation," the isle "trembles slightly," but these do not constrain Elara's actions or alter her tactics. The shadows-at-noon premise is explained through projection rather than sensory pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (center dais, perimeter stones), but the setting does not participate in the closure image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The secret garden and hedge maze are vividly rendered (upside-down blooms, firefly light, moonpetals) and the garden's edges blur at closure, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the maze is vague—Eleanor "navigates" but no turns, distances, or obstacles constrain her path. The tooth and moonpetals serve as micro-setting objects that enable the ritual. Orientation debt (Q2) caps this category at 7.0; within that ceiling, vivid but non-constraining description lands mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vivid (moisture-shimmer, carved by ancient waters) and returns across beats, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. Sea glass fragments and the cliffside workshop supply tactile detail, and the grotto transforms from solitude to gathering place, charging the final image. Because the setting shift participates in the closure reconfiguration, Q3 reaches 7.1, meeting the "constrains a choice or charges the final image" gate for mid-7s entry.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (vines through circuit boards, moss on keyboards, sunlight through broken ceiling). The setting charges the final image and constrains the protagonist's movement through spatial anchors (collapsed server room, glass underfoot, keyboard cluster). The amber pendant functions as a micro-object that recurs across beats and is causally active at closure, elevating the setting's resonance. Minor: some descriptions (honeyed hush, golden ratio in icicles) drift toward ornamental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.1)
    The feral nexus and mist are described repeatedly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—postcard atmosphere only. Spatial choreography is vague (forest? ruins? no anchor of scale or position). The seashell fragment appears as a symbolic token placed on the manuscript without affecting action. No micro-setting (body, tool, proximity) shapes tactics; the environment remains decorative throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "verdant arbor" is named repeatedly but never constrains a choice or supplies tactical resources. Spatial choreography during the village gathering is generic—no proximity, access, or physical detail shapes the scene. The harvest moon functions as ambient lighting rather than environmental pressure. The vine tendril is described luminously but its physical properties (glow, spiral pattern) do not alter Elara's approach or the device's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    The withered orchard and subarctic crater are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (gnarled branches, frost-encased berries, skeletal fingers of bark). Setting description is filtered through a consistent atmospheric lens and integrated into the work through the arrangement of discarded items. However, environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—the alchemist moves freely, gathering materials without obstacle. The final image charges slightly when the "warm, golden glow...banished the shadows and brought new life to the withered orchard," but setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    The marble cavern's "polished white and gray veins" and reflection angles are described at length but never constrain a choice or alter Elara's tactics. The setting functions as a visual backdrop rather than a pressure source. Spatial choreography is vague—where she stands, how she moves tools, what she manipulates remain abstract. The cavern "growing warmer" is asserted sentiment without causal grounding. Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The bronze grotto is vividly textured with metallic reflections and starlight cracks, but it remains a backdrop rather than a constraint on choice. The kerosene lamp burner is handled in multiple beats, charging the space with atmosphere. However, the environment does not alter tactics or complicate the weaver's work—every burden calcifies smoothly without spatial friction. The setting supports tone but does not reach the constraint threshold for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rain-beaded skylight, ash wood grain, and loft-to-kitchen ladder create vivid micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy is clear: rain patterns shift from "fractured light" to "constellations," anchoring Clara's perceptual arc. The wood grain constrains her first cut ("tentative, then growing confident as she found the grain's direction"), charging the ending when the carving joins "its brothers" on the mantel. The kettle's whistle marks time but doesn't alter spatial choices. Strong work; the recurring skylight and wood texture both pressure and charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The kinetic lagoon and halted carousel establish a vivid fantastical frame, and the camera wheel functions as a tangible object that Cyrus fits into a harness and activates. However, spatial choreography is unclear: the lagoon "above the clouds" and the "bridge of words" lack coherent physical grounding, and the final image of currents aligning reads more metaphorical than embodied. The setting constrains one choice—Cyrus must approach the lagoon's center—but the environment's role in closure is decorative rather than causally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    The abandoned spaceport is anchored with selective detail (dusty console, ticket counter, power distribution center, transformers as "sleeping giants"). The sextant and lights function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the terminal never constrains Maya's choices—she moves freely, finds what she needs, and succeeds without spatial or resource friction. The lights "awakening in an evening sky" is vivid but the metaphor does not alter tactics or reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary setting—crystal columns, ancient stones, petrichor after rain—is vivid and consistent. The crystals constrain the timing (must be after rain, at sunrise) and the watch placement spatially anchors the pivotal beat. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's horological perspective. The setting participates in closure: the crystals' song intensifies as he offers the watch, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the body, the watch, the crystal surface) functions well to ground the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The twilight barge canal is vividly established with sensory detail (lapping water, weathered wood, broken window) and filtered through Elara's legend-seeker perspective. Spatial choreography remains clear as she moves from edge to interior. The setting provides atmosphere and frames the discovery but does not constrain a choice or materially alter tactics; the journal could have been found elsewhere with minor edits. The antique pocket sundial recurs as metaphor but does not function as a tool that shapes outcome, keeping Q3 in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor sounds anchor the setting early and recur to support tone. The fog's thickening and the "oceanic hush" modulate across beats. The fulgurite glass and knotted rope function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clear (dock, crate, end of dock). Deductions: sensory detail leans heavily visual ("golden," "soft white layer," "distant boats"); tactile and auditory cues are thin during the rope-decoding beat where touch and sound would sharpen immediacy. The "weathered planks" and "driftwood" voice are apt but border on postcard cliché without POV coloring.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shadowed autumn garden is vividly rendered with sensory detail (earth, decay, vanished blooms) and returns in the final third to anchor the closure image. The weft thread is handled across multiple beats, but neither element constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. Micro-setting (body, thread) is present but ornamental; the garden frames reflection without pressuring action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The suspended palace, crystalline corridors, and marble table anchor the setting vividly, and the swaying/quaking palace mirrors Elorian's internal state at key beats. The egg's glow triggers sensory transformation (stone to bark, metal to living tissue, scent of extinct flowers), which charges the middle escalation. However, the environment remains largely descriptive; spatial choreography is clear but the setting does not constrain a tactical choice—Elorian could assemble the device anywhere. The final sway and "dreaming of flight" image provides thematic resonance but not a constraint that alters the prince's options.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    The obsidian lagoon and volcanic black sand appear in multiple beats and charge the final image through reprise, meeting the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental (clouds, moonlight) rather than constraining choice. The botanical garden supplies the grafts but does not pressure Maya's decisions—she rescues them without spatial obstacles or resource trade-offs. Proper-noun economy is observed and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.4)
    The city is vividly named and described (Fountain of Weeping Angels, central plaza, dry basins), and sensory details (shimmering glints, moss arrows, bird song) are selective. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely, breadcrumbs appear on cue, and the stained-glass window becomes the box without spatial friction. The fountains return to life at the end, but this is consequence, not constraint. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment never forces a tactical adjustment or charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)
    The nebula garden supplies vivid abstraction ("colorful gases," "dying stars") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is unclear—distances, boundaries, and the mechanics of "transit between dimensions" remain vague. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure; removing it would not change the protagonist's path or the story's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse at dusk is vivid and recurring (ancient glass, rattling panes, dim light, butterflies), and the ribbon's tactile presence (unspooling, knotting, draped across stone) anchors several beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice: Elias moves freely between greenhouse and garden, and no spatial or material limit alters his tactics. The final image places the monument "in the greenhouse center" but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; other senses (temperature, stone texture under hands) are underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower are vivid anchors, and the pendulum bob's weight and the rake handle's texture provide tactile specificity. However, the ridge functions as scenic backdrop rather than constraining choice; Alaric kneels at the tower base and later climbs without spatial friction. The inscriptions on the rake handle do charge the closure by returning as internalized wisdom, which lifts the score. Sensory hierarchy is uneven—"obsidian-black wood" and "fiery hues" feel decorative where urgent repair work would narrow perception to tools and gears.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt silo is vividly established with selective detail (discarded metal sheets painted to absorb starlight, velveteen gloom, makeshift table) and the setting functions as both physical workspace and emotional cocoon. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (workbench, shelves, sovereign case, tapestry handling). The silo constrains the ritual by isolating Elias and absorbing sound, creating a "cocoon of silence" that supports his work; however, it does not pressure a choice or alter tactics at closure. The environment is well-rendered and consistent, but serves primarily as backdrop rather than active constraint at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly named and receive atmospheric detail, but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Cracks "already forming along what her calculations had predicted" could pressure a choice but remain observational. The spire "amplified her abilities somehow"—a told convenience without tactile mechanics. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is selective but never forces Elara to adapt tactics or pay a cost tied to environment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "ember alcove" carved into a hillside is vivid and the mist swirling in response to her voice offers one moment where environment reacts to action. However, the alcove contradicts the earlier "small apartment," spatial choreography is unclear (where is the radio? how does she "pack away" equipment in a carved hillside?), and the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The dust's behavior is described but not shown affecting her decisions in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vanishing point gallery is named and its illusory specialty sketched, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The rocking chair and porcelain mask receive attention, yet neither object forces a spatial or tactile choice. Sensory detail (fine dust settling, light catching shards) is vivid but does not alter Elena's actions. Micro-setting potential exists but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sewer tunnels, murky waters, sedimentary layers, and the sunken city are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (brass patina, dripping pipes, shifting passages). The chronometer cog itself is concretely described. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or charge the closure image—Milo moves through it without tactical friction. The recurring "sedimentary layers" motif is functional but ornamental, reappearing as thematic echo rather than spatial pressure that alters his tactics at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.1)
    The velvet library recurs as a frame and "planning space," but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters Eleanor's tactics. The zither rosette is handled on-page ("fingering the aged rosette") and appears in the final beat as a gift, earning modest micro-setting credit. Autumn and winter are mentioned but do not affect action. Spatial choreography is absent—no bodies move through defined space.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly sketched (cracked glass, groaning structure, decay coexisting with renewal). Sensory details anchor early and recur purposefully. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop and thematic mirror rather than pressure source. The celestial alignment remains atmospheric description without mechanical consequence. Micro-setting (soil, seed) touches the final image but does not force a trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lightning collection tower and its transformer room provide clear spatial grounding and the setting's infrastructure (conductors, beehives, surplus energy) directly explains the blackout's mechanics. "Nectar dusk" offers consistent atmospheric color but remains decorative—it doesn't constrain a choice or charge the final image. Spatial choreography (booth → staircase → transformer floor → lightning chamber) is coherent, but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressing tactics or enabling a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting detail is vivid and filtered through Aria's contemplative attention ("streetlights daydreamed," "dew-kissed streets"). The orris root shard and lighthouse cottage anchor the final beat, and spatial choreography remains clear. However, the bay town itself is generic—no idiom, regional specificity, or occupational detail grounds the locale. The shard constrains the final image by enabling her epiphany, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but the environment does not pressure choice; it supplies atmosphere only.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting is vivid and detailed (corals, bioluminescent light, crumbling buildings, tiny fish through archways), and the underwater garden is sustained throughout. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The ampoule and garden supply spectral memory-visions but these are passive observation, not resources the diver navigates or manipulates. Sensory selection is consistent but does not reflect urgency or shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.1)
    The infinite staircase supplies vivid spatial constraint and the chipped die appears across multiple beats, charging the final image when it "caught the light." Sensory detail is selective (worn boots echoing, stone steps, central void) and filtered through Elias's focus. However, the staircase itself never alters tactics mid-climb; he ascends, pauses, calculates, repeats—spatial pressure remains static until the deus ex machina rupture. The bar setting at closure is generic placeholder.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse, moon-tipped brush, and night-blooming jasmine are vividly named but function as static backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes a choice. Spatial choreography within the greenhouse remains vague—worktable, plants, and stained glass float without clear layout. The "smog-choked city" is asserted five times yet never affects the painter's access, air quality, or tactics. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall, bioluminescent fungi, and baker's hollow provide vivid sensory anchors. The emerald lens charges the final image by revealing "movement… like slow roots finding light" in the dough, and the thaw's "distant cracking" ties environment to closure. However, orientation debt (applied in Q2) caps this category at 7.0, preventing higher scores despite the lens's late functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rocky shore, lighthouse, and hunger stone are anchored early and returned to at closure. The yoyo embedded in the stone constrains Esme's task, and the tide window imposes a time pressure. However, setting detail remains largely ornamental—"ethereal light," "mysterious lighthouse"—without shaping tactical choices or micro-movements. The lighthouse "seemed less like a building and more like a bridge" is metaphorical decoration rather than a spatial constraint that alters action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The funhouse setting provides "decaying corridors," "crooked mirrors," and "heavy velvet curtain" but remains a backdrop—no spatial choreography constrains movement or choice. The "lingering luminance" recurs but never alters tactics; it glows, intensifies, spreads through veins, yet the protagonist's actions would be identical in any mystical locale. The opera cloak clasp is handled twice (touch, dissolve) but its materiality is inconsistent (solid, then light, then solid again). Micro-setting allowance applies, but the body and objects here are ornamental rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and blue-hour mercury ocean are vivid and consistently maintained. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The xylophone mallet and driftwood function as tools that shape the prophet's ritual, lending micro-setting weight. However, the environment never meaningfully constrains a choice or charges the final image—she retires to her hut without the setting imposing friction or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly specific and consistently referenced; the spiral grooves, reed whistle, and crack all function as tactile anchors. The spatial choreography (surface → chamber → re-emergence) remains clear. The setting constrains choice when the shell responds to the whistle and the chamber provides the revelation, pushing this into the 7+ range despite some ornamental description ("sunwashed sky") that doesn't alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly anchored—ivy, crumbling stone, Victorian arches, broken glass—and matches the illuminated letter's illustrations with precision. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop for discovery rather than constraining Eleanor's choices or shaping tactics under pressure. The ivy metaphor ("truth obscured—visible yet hidden") is explicit rather than allowing the environment to charge the final image through lived interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.7)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered (marble pillars as "silent sentinels," waterlogged timbers) and the antique inkwell recurs across beats, anchoring the surveyor's ritual. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the drawbridge's function (rising "at sunset each day" yet also "after...each day" and "tomorrow") introduces minor temporal ambiguity. The cold water plunge and foundation stones do constrain one action (wrestling the box free), giving the setting mild participatory weight, but it does not decisively shape the final choice or charge the closure image with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sunken library and emergency lighting create atmosphere, and the scrolls/stamp/shadows are described with care. However, setting remains postcard: the blackout does not constrain a choice (he adapts "quickly," works "tranquilly"), and no environmental feature blocks or enables a tactic at closure. The antique ink stamp is handled but does not alter access or cost in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating isle, tea garden, and glass basilica are vividly described and establish atmosphere. The workshop and gems anchor sensory detail (amber, gold, pulsing heart-shaped gem). However, setting remains largely postcard: the tea garden does not constrain a choice, and the basilica functions as a destination rather than a pressure. The heart-shaped gem does charge the final moment slightly, lifting the score above mid-band.

    The floating observatory and ruined amphitheater are vivid and purposeful, grounding the hunt. Sensory details (ozone, decay, mutated vegetation) filter through Elias's mission-focused lens. The geode's glow and the "liquid light" pool provide tactile atmosphere. The observatory's cooling circuit breakers create a time constraint, though it doesn't visibly narrow his window on the page. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ancient observatory at dusk is vividly anchored with "crumbling parapet," "copper dome," and "brilliant dimness," and the environment constrains Maya's tactical choices (she must launch the drone to trace star trails the structure can decode). Spatial choreography remains clean across moves. However, much of the setting detail serves atmospheric decoration rather than pressuring the final choice; the observatory's mechanisms respond without Maya needing to navigate physical obstacles or resource limits that alter her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vividly anchored with sensory detail (moonlight on carvings, cool metal, weathered stone steps). The watch hand and driftwood carvings function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and beach sequence. The setting constrains Martin's nightly ritual and the shore supplies the discovery that triggers closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    The storm-worn parapet in mist is signaled early and returns in the ending pooled moonlight, creating a purposeful frame. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent (parapet, ledge, moonlit circle). The "furrowed hush" recurs to set tone, and the moon phase constrains the timing of the meeting, charging the final image. However, the setting does not alter a tactic mid-scene or force a physical choice; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than a live constraint on movement or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.7)
    The coastal kayak launch and ocean setting provide sensory grounding (salt air, small waves, distant utility poles). The compass as micro-setting object returns with shifted meaning at closure and the utility poles frame her navigation method. However, neither environment nor tool constrains a choice in a way that alters tactics; the setting supports atmosphere more than it pressures the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent lake provides vivid sensory texture—"pulsing blues and greens"—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is loose: the protagonist moves from lake to tunnels to chamber to younger self without clear distances or physical logic. The baseball's warmth and the newspaper's coordinates are noted but do not alter tactics in the moment. Setting operates as atmosphere rather than pressure; the underground world does not resist or shape the protagonist's choices at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard under eternal moonlight is evocative and anchors early. Sensory details (moon-pepper, whispering cinnamon, visible glyphs) contribute texture, and the circle/mist staging is spatially coherent. However, the environment remains decorative: no choice hinges on orchard layout, and the "flowers bloomed brighter" response to the brother's name is ornamental rather than a constraint or resource. The spices enable the conjure but their mechanics (how scent forms glyphs, why roots in soil matter) are not grounded in tactile cause-effect that would elevate setting to active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The midnight glade above clouds is vividly established with purposeful sensory detail (onyx ink drinking moonlight, mist, clouds beneath). The dolls' tea set saucer crack functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning at closure (repaired with gold leaf). However, the glade itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it serves as backdrop for internal epiphany rather than pressuring the protagonist's options. Spatial choreography is clean, and the body-level interaction with the saucer grounds one key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    The recycled spaceship is vividly anchored (debris fields, bulkheads, meditation chamber, quantum rift) and the crystalline tear and photographs supply micro-setting texture. The ship "holding its breath" and final dissolution gesture toward constraint, but no environmental detail forces a tactical choice or narrows options during the stitching sequence. Spatial choreography is clear. The setting charges the final image (ship dissolves) but does not materially constrain the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The black sand beach and volcano are anchored early and return at closure, but they never constrain a choice or alter tactics—Ian could fulfill the prophecy anywhere. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual clichés ("vibrant hush," "whispering hush") without specificity that reflects Ian's decade of study or the urgency of the celestial moment. The observatory is mentioned but never used to ground his routine or the deviation from it. The beach functions as postcard rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bioluminescent walls and half-painted sundial are anchored early and provide concrete visual detail. However, the fort's spatial choreography remains vague—corridors and courtyard are named but not mapped, and the blackout's effect on movement is asserted rather than shown constraining Elias's navigation. The sundial serves as message board and recurs at closure, lending purposeful specificity, but environment does not force a tactical choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and painted stones establish vivid setting anchors early. However, the frictionless world—a major conceptual premise—functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters tactics or choices on the page. The stones and vial are handled, meeting the micro-setting test, but their mechanics (how they constrain or enable) remain vague, and the environment does not pressure the protagonist's decisions in ways that shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (spiral staircase, battered dome, lightning-illuminated lens) and constrains the poet's physical location above the regime. However, spatial choreography inside the observatory remains vague—notebook, envelope, timetable, and timer float without clear placement or tactile handling. The storm functions primarily as metaphor rather than environmental pressure that alters tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vividly described with sensory specificity (prismatic light, water murmur, gold numerals). However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the sundial constrains the decoding action but does not shape the encounter with the student or charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The recurring phrase "dignified chaos" labels the atmosphere without allowing environmental pressure to alter a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rusted library, open roof, and starlight are vivid and consistently anchored. Spatial choreography (aisles, shelves, collapsed sections) tracks cleanly. However, the setting remains scenic: books and shelves are described but do not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The micro-setting (coffee tin, seeds, pages) is handled but ornamental—props are never unavailable or limiting when needed, so they function as symbols rather than tactical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal arbor and Cloud Station Nine are vivid and specific, with atmospheric currents, crimson horizons, and swaying branches that shape the evening tide and system shutdown deadline. The film vault is temperature-controlled and filled with canisters, grounding the archive tactically. However, the "hidden sections between frames" and the liminal space remain abstract; no sensory anchor grounds the final step into projected light. The environment pressures the timeline but does not constrain the protagonist's choices—he navigates the lower levels from memory without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ridge, waterfall, and cave are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (orchids, thunderous roar, cool shadow, moss-covered stones). The seed's warmth and pulsing light recur and guide Elara's steps, constraining her path. However, the environment does not force a difficult choice or complicate her goal; she descends "carefully" and finds the cave "as dreamed" without friction. The final image does not charge setting details with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.1)
    The islet setting (petrichor, salt, post-rain foliage) and interior props (glass case, bonsai, lace, compass) are vividly rendered. The compass and lace constrain the ritual sequence, and the bonsai are positioned to "participate," but environment does not materially alter a tactical choice—the tutor follows the revealed pattern without friction. The breezy windows and prismatic dew charge the final image, lifting the score, but the setting functions more as atmospheric container than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and selective, with the luminous fort and blackout pressuring choices, and the sundial and quill holder constraining actions and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vividly specific and purposeful, with sensory details like the tidal bluff and aurora filtering through POV. The environment constrains choices (e.g., stones from pools) and charges the final image of harmony. Micro-setting elements (painted rocks, star dust) actively shape tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit observatory setting constrains choices by providing isolation, and it charges the final image with the star-sprinkled sky. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, reflecting Maia's POV and enhancing atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly specific, with the glass atrium and brook creating atmosphere that constrains choices, like the sundial for decoding. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Aris's POV, charging the final image. No generic or static elements harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and specific—broken glass, water-stained walls, cracked terracotta, chrysalis—and tightly tied to Elena’s perception. Environmental detail consistently mirrors the thematic concern with decay and renewal without slipping into confusion. The setting also functions as micro-world and “cathedral,” charging the final images of seedlings and butterflies. It does not quite reach 9-band because the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more symbolic and contemplative than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon, stars, and frost plates are sensorially vivid and consistently filtered through Lena’s artistic perception, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The environment supports the theme of quiet clarity and functions as a sanctuary that shapes her reflective mode. The frost specifically acts as a micro-setting/tool that participates in the investigative mechanics. While the canyon doesn’t materially constrain physical choices, it does charge the final image of her leaving with the “resonance of the stars” in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly evoked—transparent walls, crystalline structures, shimmering plants—and it directly interacts with the premise by amplifying heat patterns. Setting and tool (tuning fork) integrate well: the environment becomes a functional “symphony hall” in which visible sound occurs. The final image of her leaving the glass structure while its music “resonates forever” successfully charges the setting thematically. Some descriptive phrases recur without adding new texture, slightly dulling the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the funeral-study, the gray cliff, the descent through coral forests, and especially the “impossible spiral towers” and zero-gravity stacks of the underwater library. Details are generally filtered through Elias’s sensibility (undertaker attuned to rest and stillness) and support the solemn, uncanny mood. The broken lighthouse lens as a recurring object effectively charges the final image by becoming the library’s beacon. The environment shapes meaning more than tactics, but it’s strong enough to feel integral rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The terra-cotta arbor on the ridge, the amplified quiet, and the remoteness under sanctions are specific and recurring, giving the story a strong atmospheric spine. The bell, arbor, and ridge form an effective micro-setting that anchors councils, distributions, and the final declaration, with the bell especially charging the last image. Some descriptive choices are somewhat generic (“remote location,” “central square”) where a bit more sensory particularity or tactile interaction could heighten immediacy. Still, the environment consistently supports tone and theme rather than reading like a white room.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight viaduct, wisteria blooms, and mist are vividly drawn and recur, giving the piece a strong sense of place and atmosphere. The camera obscura and projected images integrate setting with action, charging the central revelation scene and the final photograph. Environmental detail is selective and thematically aligned with liminality and “foggy lucidity,” though it sometimes approaches postcard prettiness. The setting does help charge the final images but doesn’t significantly constrain choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The living bridge garden and its hyperbolic architecture are vivid and distinctive, with the breathing vines and impossible geometry doing real atmospheric work. The environment responds to Elara’s state and eventually absorbs her, so setting is tied to stakes and closure rather than mere backdrop. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and conceptual but remains clear and purposeful. A bit more tactile or constraining interaction with the space under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is vividly sketched (dust motes, empty shelves, overturned piano bench) and quickly orients us in place and mood. The environment contributes thematically—prizes versus seeds, ruin versus renewal—even if only lightly. Spatially, the room, wall, piano bench, and exits track cleanly and support the action. That said, in the peak pressure beats the setting functions more as backdrop than as a constraint actively shaping her options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, aurora lights, and peculiar water acoustics are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Kael’s sensory bias. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: submersion, jellyfish-lit wrecks, and color-amplifying water all tie directly into his method of capturing and transmitting the sound. The final image—prototype placed in the greenhouse, sound changing as it moves through water and orchard—feels charged by this setting. It falls just short of top-tier because the environment doesn’t quite constrain specific choices under pressure, but it very nearly does.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “emerald station,” golden sunset, and jar of moonbeams produce a vivid, coherent magical-realist atmosphere filtered through Lillian’s eye for light. Details like the marble counter, disordered desktop, and Kyoto flower codes feel chosen rather than generic, and the workshop full of golden-hour portraits meaningfully reframes earlier images. Still, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains choices—the station could be less specific without breaking the plot—so the environment charges mood more than it shapes action. The recurring light/emerald imagery does effectively charge the final tableau of portraits and moonbeams.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned control room and melting ice are richly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility; details like corroded panels, reclaimed copper, and dripping water anchor mood and action. The environment meaningfully contributes tools (copper, panels, windows) and a conceptual echo (a former command center turned sanctuary for inquiry). Weather and interior space evolve with the scene, culminating in the final globe catching light in the window. While constraints on choice are gentle rather than hard, the setting clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted, star-lit library is vividly evoked—the broken skylight, rusted shelves, and decaying books create a strong mood and clear sense of place. The environment does affect action somewhat (she hides behind shelves; the starlight helps her read the cast; the doors’ groan signals threat), and the recurring stars/skylight imagery supports the ethereal tone. That said, the setting often functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a fully active constraint on choices. The seashell as a recurring object does help charge the final image, adding a micro-setting dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly realized and tightly integrated: the storm-tossed ridge fort, highest tower, and single remaining star frame both the physical and metaphysical stakes. Environmental details (storm outside vs. “marbled hush” inside) mirror the thematic focus on silence and interiority. Objects-as-setting—the pebbles and gold leaf booklet—are tactile and return with reweighted meaning, especially when the booklet glows after the sky goes dark. The world’s rules are spare but consistent, and the environment charges the final image rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight, crystalline snow, and ancient stones are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the story’s contemplative mysticism. Setting details integrate with action—the cold seeping into joints, vibrating snowflakes, and bending light all participate in the music-becoming-transcendent beat. The environment mostly functions as mood and image rather than a hard constraint on choice, so its influence on tactics is limited. Still, the recurring courtyard imagery does charge the final image of warmed ground and awakened stones.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” and raindrops making a “soft melody” are vivid, evocative touches that support the hushed, contemplative tone. The setting feels more like a lyrical backdrop than an active constraint on choices: the hidden chamber could exist under many venues without major change. Still, the recurring image of the forecourt “whispering” and later “approving” does modestly charge the final sense of communal understanding. World rules around lenses and silence are consistent enough for this short form.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The garden maze is vivid and conceptually integrated: paths shift with emotional state, leaves seem to lean toward his touch, the cottage at the center anchors his life. Setting is consistently filtered through Elias’s professional and spiritual attention, from the night-blooming cereus to the soil where he embeds the marbles. The maze’s quasi-sentient behavior and the rumor of marbles glowing at night charge the atmosphere and final image even if they don’t force concrete tactical choices. Overall, the environment meaningfully colors every beat and directly underwrites the premise that “gardens know their gardeners.”

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    The xenobiology station, rotating light cycle, and extraterrestrial bird enclosure create a distinct, gently eerie atmosphere that suits the concept. The “magnetic nexus at twilight” is a strong recurring object/phenomenon that shapes the experiment’s logistics and the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or introduces friction—it’s more stage than pressure system. Sensory detail is largely visual and conceptual, with little evolution of the setting as events unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The flooded opera house, ankle-deep water, flickering lanterns, and preserved piano are vivid and coherent, with strong visual and textural specificity. Details are well integrated into action (wading through water, lantern light transforming stains into “notation”) rather than feeling like static backdrop. The environment supports the liminal, haunted tone and subtly mirrors the idea of time-damaged art becoming a new score. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain his choices, it does charge the final hush and the motif of water/time as co-composers.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain weather station, high altitude, and Alaskan wilderness are vividly rendered and feel lived-in (snow drifting onto the floor, half-circle of instruments, specific ranges named). The environment shapes both the premise (altitude amplifies prophecy, rare flower) and the stakes (isolation, auroras as active phenomena). The final image of Elias stepping into the cold under dancing auroras is strongly charged by this setting. World rules around the auroral sorrow remain consistent within the story’s metaphysical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned tunnel, damp air, and dawn sky provide a coherent, moody backdrop that supports the liminal, “ghost shift” atmosphere. The setting remains somewhat generic—“oppressive darkness,” “paint the sky in shades of pink and orange”—but is at least consistent and serviceable. The beaded valve wheel functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image, though the tunnel itself doesn’t sharply constrain choices beyond mood. Overall it’s vivid enough, but not deeply particular or inextricable.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is a major strength: the obsidian refuge, roaring river, and overgrown catacomb library feel vivid and texturally specific, and the pocket of “presence-filled void” is sensorially distinct. Environmental detail consistently supports tone and theme (entropy vs preservation), and the final return to the refuge meaningfully recharges earlier images. The world’s rules around the origami swan and the silence are clear enough without heavy exposition. The setting rarely constrains physical tactics, but it strongly shapes conceptual stakes and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sage Ridge, the children’s center, and the sagebrushed ridge are vividly sketched and recur as emotional and thematic mirrors (resilient sagebrush, windswept height, drifting fragrance). The eclipse atmosphere—the cooling air, dimming light, silenced animals—effectively charges the climax. Setting details are filtered through Maya’s sensibility as a music therapist attuned to sound and quiet. While the ridge doesn’t sharply constrain options, it meaningfully colors and heightens the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The reclaimed missile silo as library is vivid and consistently threaded—curved walls, metal bones, hearth, and “bronze quiet” all reinforce an atmosphere of repurposed apocalypse. Details are sensorially specific and POV-filtered enough to feel lived in, and the space thematically mirrors the work of preserving and re-arming stories. However, the environment rarely constrains options or forces concrete choices; it’s an evocative backdrop more than an active pressure. This keeps it short of the very top band despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, bay, and spiral staircase are clearly evoked and recur, giving the story a tangible physical envelope. The lighthouse as former warning beacon turned metaphoric “beacon of hidden truths” is thematically apt, if a bit on the nose. Spatially, the movement from lamp room to base and out toward the mainland via boat is clean and easy to track. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates his choices; it frames mood more than it generates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The church, dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and indigo paint all contribute to a distinctive, atmospheric setting that feels tailored to this conflict. Silence-as-environment is especially strong, functioning almost as a physical medium that presses on bodies and constrains tactics. World rules (frequency, color, and symbols interacting with a thin veil between dimensions) are consistent and learned through Father Michael’s actions. The setting directly shapes the ritual, though the physical choreography of bodies and space remains relatively simple and could be deepened further.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and dawn light are vivid and coherent, with the nautilus shell echoing the spiral motif to good effect. Setting details are sensorial and integrated into action—the refracted rainbows on the desk, the shell’s coldness mirroring the lake, vibrations in the spire and ice. The environment mostly mirrors internal states rather than constraining choices, but it does charge the final image of the “upturned hush” around him. Overall, it feels particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing viaduct, rain-slick stones, eclipse light, and bruised-purple sky create a vivid, specific atmosphere that fits the speculative premise. Setting is not just painted; it functions as a nexus with rules (after rain, during eclipse) and evolves when he steps into the altered timeline. The environment does constrain access (he can only reach deeper fractures under these conditions), though moment-to-moment navigation in the fracture is more abstractly rendered. Non-visual senses are underused, but the visual palette is strong and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drum maker’s cavern, stone floor, and seasonal hush are specific and thematically apt, especially the tactile resonance of vibrations through stone. Setting is filtered through Eleanor’s altered sensory world, which is a strength. However, the cavern remains somewhat impressionistic; spatial and textural details could more actively shape her choices moment to moment. Still, the environment clearly charges the final image of communal, felt “hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard at dusk with its fountain, cobblestones, and surrounding windows provides a clear, atmospheric micro-setting that feels lived-in. Details such as the fountain’s sound masking his movements and his lateral circling to avoid the windows show the environment constraining tactics. The larger “rogue quarantine zone” and weather systems are more told than felt, but they stay internally consistent. The final image of the night sky and pigeon flight ties setting back into the story’s stakes, though not at a transformative level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse of extinct plants, the ultraviolet lantern, the crystal vial, and the ghost orchid are all vividly rendered and recur in the final images, charging the atmosphere and the closing tableau. The environment is not just decorative—it shapes the premise (extinct things holding memory) and Elias’s options, making his sanctuary choice and the display of the vial feel inevitable. Sensory detail, especially around light and scent, is well integrated, though occasionally the prose leans into abstract reflection rather than deepening physical specificity. The final placement of the vial between two extinct ferns exemplifies the setting meaningfully inflecting theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is vividly and consistently evoked, with warm hues, breathing walls, and the rope pattern integrated into the physical space. Setting is filtered through the poet’s perceptions, so the environment feels like an active, quasi-sacred collaborator in the inquiry. While it doesn’t sharply constrain choices, it clearly frames and charges the ritual, especially in lines like “the grotto’s embrace” and the walls seeming to approve. The world detail around the altered night sky is intriguing but lightly sketched, more mood than system.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently charged: a “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by ancient shipwrecks” is memorable and threaded through the story. Physical elements (glass walls, wooden hulls, the burned rainforest, the greenhouse roof with stars) aren’t just backdrop; they shape acoustics, enable Kael’s bowl experiments, and charge the final music image. Details are filtered through sound and memory, matching his perceptual priorities. The environment meaningfully underwrites the premise and closure, though a touch more constraint or resistance from the setting could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The amber grotto, dusk light, and blotter petals establish a distinct and coherent atmosphere, with some sensory specificity and integration into Elias’s craft. The environment is tied conceptually to emotional resonance (“amber hues seemed to enhance”) and recurs at the ending as he locks away petals and leaves. Still, the setting rarely constrains action or meaningfully alters choices; it functions more as mood and aesthetic rationale than as a pressure source. Strongly evocative, but not yet structurally essential.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The seaside library under the stars, the breeze, and the seaside café are specific enough to feel like real places and support the gentle, contemplative tone. Maritime and archival details (regional shipping manifests, digitization) are plausibly integrated and filtered through professional perspectives. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or imposes pressure; it mostly provides an attractive backdrop rather than a functional setting. The locket and stars recur meaningfully, but the physical world could bear more weight in the story’s turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystalline orchard and luminescent crater are vividly drawn with specific, consistent imagery (transparent trees, gem-fruit, obsidian walls, luminescent fluid) and filtered through Elara’s artistic gaze. Environment meaningfully constrains action: the sheer crater walls and treacherous depths necessitate mapping wind, devising reed pulleys, and using obsidian outcrops and paths for the search. The arbor and crater light directly charge the final image, with the sigil pulsing in the volcanic pillar and the orchard “shimmering brighter” in response to their bond. Occasional density of description skirts purple but remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rooftop canal system, central tower, and sound-charged chamber are vivid and integrated into action: canals slow and crystallize under his time-sculpting, form a map, and later resume natural flow as proof of success. The environment constrains tactics (he must traverse rooftops following the interrupted cadence) and the pendant-symbol on the door links object and place. World rules for time manipulation and the giant’s presence are consistent enough for this length. There’s room for slightly richer sensory variety beyond the visual and auditory, but the setting is distinctive and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites and bioluminescent fruit is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated into the mood and premise. Environmental details (dripping mineral-rich drops, moonlight somehow penetrating the cavern) echo the thematic concern with sustained, subtle nourishment of emotion and memory. The mosaic stepping stone and its chipped patterns serve as a focal micro-setting that directly carries the divinatory mechanics and the final reconfiguration. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, it consistently shapes texture and the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library’s under-architecture, pipe chases, crawl spaces, and pre-dawn darkness are vivid and consistently filtered through a preservationist’s eye. Environmental details—cool pipes, access panels, the deeper dark caused by the outage—directly shape how the dweller moves and what they can do. The “sapphire hush” and infrastructure imagery charge the final sense of them as an embedded, almost infrastructural guardian. Setting serves both mood and practical constraints without feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nursery, greenhouse, and especially the mossy trellis in the rain are vivid, recurring anchors that feel lived-in and thematically aligned with growth under pressure. Weather and environment (storm season, rain, softened trellis wood) materially affect events, from the anomalous leaf’s appearance to the explosive linden growth. Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s professional eye, which adds plausibility. The setting charges the final image conceptually rather than constraining a last-minute choice, which is effective but not transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal island, treacherous waters, old lighthouse, and rain trails create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that feels lived-in and tied to Lena’s perception. The environment actively matters: isolation frames her refuge, the unusual rain pattern delivers the brooch, and the water-war ruin contextualizes the pigments’ rarity. Details are economical yet specific—“flickering solar lamps,” “continental gallery,” “dam broke”—conveying a post-collapse world without exposition bloat. The amber brooch as a charged central object effectively functions as micro-setting in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal cave is vivid and specific, with resonant details like the “melodic resonance,” “cave pearls,” and music evolving as shadows inhabit the crystals. Setting and atmosphere are tightly integrated with the core magical phenomenon and with the closing image, where the cave’s music and bright-dark crystals embody the new order. The environment constrains the story into a focused, luminous chamber that feels integral rather than decorative. A slightly broader sensory range beyond sight and sound could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harbor after rain is vividly evoked—ivory stones, glistening, briny air—and the “ivory” conceptually mirrors absence and later presence. Setting is more atmospheric than operative; the environment doesn’t materially constrain choices but does consistently frame the emotional and thematic stakes. The recurring harbor image in the opening and closing helps charge the final sense of communal homecoming. Still, the setting remains largely a beautiful backdrop rather than an active pressure on behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground tunnels, cracks forming arrows, and “starlit vault in mist” are vivid and consistent, with the environment clearly transitioning from mundane rail lines to liminal space. Setting is filtered through his mapping mind (paths, constellations, crystalline fortress), which helps atmosphere and coherence. The phantom punch as an object-tool effectively anchors the supernatural logic and charges the final image as it integrates with his hand. Still, the vault rarely constrains his choices beyond awe—he moves through it with little environmental resistance, so the world feels evocative more than tactically alive.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stargazer’s open tower, migrating whales, and the tile together create a strong, specific atmosphere that’s consistently threaded through the piece. Setting is not white-room; the vertical axis (sea → air → tower → stars) nicely mirrors the thematic concern with connection across spaces. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: whales moving below, stars above, the tower as conduit, and the tile as passage. However, the setting constrains few concrete choices—its role is more symbolic and tonal than tactical, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prismatic escondite, the solar storm, and the “space between dimensions” offer evocative, specific imagery that establishes a distinct cosmic atmosphere. Setting details like shifting walls of light becoming windows into other dimensions are conceptually strong and integrated with the premise. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices in concrete ways; the storm serves more as a plot enabler than a lived physical pressure. Despite that, the recurring interplay of light, magnetism, and dimensional vistas supports tone and theme effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funeral home prep room and its “deathly vitality” are vividly rendered through concrete detail (refrigeration hum, chemical scent, stainless tables), and they filter clearly through Maya’s professional eye. The setting meaningfully echoes the thematic preoccupation with transitions—between life and death, criminality and redemption, imprisonment and asylum. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain specific tactical choices, it does charge the final image of the ink pot and “new beginning.” The selective detail is purposeful and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountaintop bonsai labyrinth, the silent town below, and the fluorescent lamp create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Details like each bonsai “representing a different epoch” and the trees rustling as if acknowledging his work elegantly bind environment to theme. The setting mostly charges mood and concept rather than constraining tactics, but it’s specific, memorable, and consistently filtered through Elias’s craft. The recurrence of lamp and bonsai at the end gives the final image real charge.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The port and shipping-container labyrinth are vivid, specific, and consistently refracted through the narrator’s worldview (“stacked giants of commerce,” tides reshaping foundations). The environment meaningfully participates: tides dictate routine, containers offer shelter, and the industrial setting thematically mirrors erasure and overwriting. Sensory detail skews visual and conceptual, but is purposeful and not generic. The setting charges the final sense of purpose in this in-between space, though it could constrain concrete choices a bit more strongly to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The storm, cliff, abandoned observatory, dust “galaxies,” Lyra, and the seashell all create a rich, coherent atmosphere that supports the cosmic theme. Setting is well integrated into action (door, cello placement, telescope orientation) rather than functioning as a static backdrop. The observatory and storm influence mood more than they constrain concrete choices, but the final image of dawn and horizon is nicely charged by what came before. Overall specificity is strong and purposeful, if not yet fully indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The raft-city carnival, translator earpiece, salty air, and neon-fish graffiti create a vivid, specific world that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting meaningfully shapes tactics: the distributed rafts, walls, and carnival flows make graffiti a plausible communication network and frame the stakes of privatization. Recurring objects like the foundation stone and murals charge the final images with history and continuity. The environment supports tone and theme without slipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lunar setting is vivid enough—moonlit summit, crater valley, blue bioluminescent fireflies, encroaching sunrise—and stays spatially coherent. The environment does modestly shape action (the summit as vantage, the sunrise as external clock), and the mining operation gives the landscape narrative weight. Still, many phrases and images recur with minimal evolution (“moonlit summit,” “dawning hush”), and non-visual senses are almost absent. The setting supports theme and mood effectively but stops short of feeling fully lived-in or constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-coated rail depot, harbor sounds, and tucked-away workshop are vividly rendered and consistent, giving the story a strong, atmospheric sense of place. The environment reinforces tone and theme (distance, liminality, connection across spaces) and recurs through the mist/steam imagery. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or tactics beyond a soft time pressure from the departing ship. It’s evocative rather than structurally decisive, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, auroras, and “water mountain” are vivid and tonally coherent, with strong sensory selection (wind through metal, microscopic ice sounds, condensation as map). Setting is consistently filtered through Elmsley’s cartographic and hydrological obsessions, which sharpens specificity. The recurring interior micro-setting of the window and its condensation meaningfully charges the final image. The environment rarely constrains concrete choices, but it does shape mood and conceptual stakes very effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s standout strength: “dusk bled into the wild hush,” “star-choked sky,” and the skeletal town build a coherent, tactile world. Environment is directly wired into the premise: stones, cobblestones, windows, and beams literally respond to his method, so place is not decorative but causal. The archway and bell tower recur and meaningfully evolve as focal points of restoration. The final image of the town humming to itself is charged by all the prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater temple is vividly and economically rendered—columns that withstand pressure, mineral-preserved carvings, blue luminescence, and the crushing depth all feel tactile and specific. Setting is not mere backdrop; the temple’s architecture, mechanism, and sub-sea location constrain Elena’s choices (oxygen, pressure, sealed chamber) and enable the time-harnessing premise. The recurring vial and the chamber’s luminescent particles effectively function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. More culturally specific detail about the lost civilization could deepen uniqueness, but what’s here is coherent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and confessional lattice are vivid and recurring, creating a strong atmospheric container. Details like salt, copper light, scuffed doors, and the beam sweeping the sea are sensorial and thematically aligned with wreckage and confession. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects his actions; it mainly mirrors his inner state. The setting does charge the final image of the lattice as testament, but more tactical use of space would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse and winter-cracked fields are vividly rendered and conceptually integrated: timeless interior vs changing exterior directly underpins the story’s stakes and the final bloom. Recurring specifics—bioluminescent blossoms, lovingly venomous pollen, frost on the northern window, the spiral bloom—create a strong atmospheric unity. The environment constrains options (she’s bound to the greenhouse; the bead links to roots and to the field shoot) and charges the final image. This is near-publishable-level setting work with only minor room for more tactile, body-level interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The harbor workshop, misted water, red canyon walls, and luminous orchids all create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the mythic, lyric tone. The setting is more than a backdrop: the canyon and labyrinth directly receive the sewing and become the transformed site of pilgrimage and closure. Details are mostly visual, but they’re selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The world’s magic rules (plate, sleepwalking, sprouting thread) are consistent enough for this mode, even if they’re not explored in depth.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “catacomb orchard” with roots snaking through bones is vivid, specific, and atmospherically rich, and it’s tightly integrated with the themes of cyclical time and return. Setting details like trees “leaning in” and roots embracing the sundial charge the final image rather than feeling ornamental. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it continuously informs perception and tone and is inextricable from the story’s logic and closure. Overall, the world feels evocative and purposeful without bogging the narrative down.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The golden arcade, metallic structures, maglev, and surface-mail infrastructure are vivid, consistent, and tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting details (chalk on pavement, golden receptacle) recur and charge the final image, tying environment to theme. World rules around instant thought-transmission versus paper mail are conveyed efficiently through her habits and values rather than exposition dumps. The only ceiling comes from the fact that, while atmosphere is superb, the environment only lightly constrains her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn sky, and domed ceiling are vivid, and the recurring eternal candle functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges the tone and final image. Details are filtered through Elara’s work-focused perception, keeping the environment purposeful rather than touristic. Weather and architecture support atmosphere and theme (quiet vigilance amid looming upheaval) more than they exert concrete constraints on choice. Still, the physical and symbolic integration is strong and consistent across the story.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth, inky water, and slivers of moonlight create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly integrated with the magic. The window and shard function as charged micro-settings: moonlight and condensation literally shape how communication can occur, and the labyrinth’s disorientation is thematically tied to emotional confusion. Environmental details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting could pressure choices slightly more (e.g., real navigation or physical risk), but it already meaningfully charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight, tropical plants, and glass ceiling are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail that mirrors the liminal emotional space between war and healing, life and loss. Setting is consistently filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility (hospital as quiet conflict zone, mist as weeping), avoiding generic hospital atmospherics. The brain coral functions as a micro-setting/object that clearly charges the final image when placed back into Lina’s palm. While the physical environment doesn’t sharply constrain choices, it meaningfully saturates tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    The fog-choked orchard district, ruined observatory, and contrast between desolate streets and imagined orchards create a consistent, atmospheric world. Details like the mists, the Festival of Blossoms, and the observatory-turned-exhibition are vivid and thematically aligned with restoration and memory. That said, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; the fog and ruins are mostly mood rather than active pressures. The setting enriches tone and theme but stops short of being structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sound wave garden, mural, and wind sculptures form a vivid, coherent environment whose acoustic logic directly underpins the magic (reflected sound through the nickel) and charges the final image of the humming mural. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, though the atmosphere leans consistently luminous and could benefit from one or two contrasting, pressure-tinged notes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The world is vividly and specifically rendered: thought-monitors, gardens, mycelial networks, gourd seeds, and the entomologist’s insect-filled greenhouse all feel concrete and integrated with action. The setting meaningfully constrains and enables tactics (using community gardens, avoiding monitors in the greenhouse, exploiting insect-phobia), not just serving as backdrop. Professional detail around entomology and plant behavior is plausible enough to feel lived-in at this length. The final image of the greenhouse and soil-borne message neatly ties environment to the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gargantuan shell, pearlescent walls, bioluminescent blossoms, and galaxy postcard create a vivid, coherent, and atmospherically rich environment. Setting is tightly integrated with action: the shell’s walls respond to lullabies, blossoms cradle sleepers, and the postcard’s constellations imprint on the flora. The final image of the shell with the postcard pinned high and blossoms as living history is strongly charged by the established world rules. Spatial specifics within the shell remain hazy, but at this lyric scale that doesn’t impede comprehension or effect.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal library above clouds, glass orchids, transparent floors, and the museum of extinct feelings create a striking, immersive setting that is consistently filtered through Eleth’s work. Setting is not mere backdrop: the preservation room, phonograph, and crystalline chambers all directly support the core action of restoration. The final image of the cloud-mist below and orchids blooming meaningfully re-charges prior environmental details with thematic weight. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in places prevents this from pushing into the very top band, but the world feels distinct and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archive is sketched with a few strong images—dust motes, dim light, the enduring glass ink well—and it feels like an appropriate, lived-in space for her work. Details are mostly visual and somewhat repetitive, but they do track with her focus on texts and tools. The ink well as a recurring object modestly charges the final image by embodying the cost in time and effort. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects her choices; it’s more atmospheric than functionally shaping action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The breathing amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is vivid and recurrent, with light through cracks, moss, dust, and the rhythmic “breath” all creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting is well-filtered through Elara’s professional gaze as she traces water paths and imagines seasonal flooding. The environment conceptually shapes the solution (seasonal lake in the amphitheater basin), so it’s more than postcard description even if it doesn’t pose acute physical obstacles. The final image—her walking out under the building’s breath, chain on her shoulders—charges the setting thematically, though the volcano’s “breathing” never quite constrains an immediate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The vintage bookshop attic is sensorially rich and integrated into action—the smell of aging paper, the skylight beam, and dust motes all shape how Elara interacts with the meteorite and her thoughts. The micro-setting constrains the method of dust-mote mapping and also charges the final release of the pigeon through the same skylight. The meteorite-as-tool functions as an object-as-setting, altering how she uses the space. World rules are consistent and the environment mirrors her internal renewal/decay without feeling like blunt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drifting prism terrace, wooden structures flashing into being, and corn maze imagery create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that’s consistently filtered through Elara’s pattern-seeking mind. Setting motifs (light, thresholds, wood grain, corn) recur and evolve, culminating in the oak doorway and the final return to the maze. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—this specific doorway and corn maze matter, not just any portal or field. Some descriptive choices verge on abstract (“fractured hush,” “necessary distances”), but enough tactile detail keeps the world legible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater research facility and central dome are vividly realized, with selective, character-filtered detail (architecture mirroring constellations, bioluminescent organisms echoing galaxies). The environment meaningfully shapes what can happen: she’s separated by glass, lit only by helmet and moonlight, and the submerged dome makes the “living stars” image possible. The recurring objects (glass, feather, light) charge the final images of sunrise and the map. Occasional coined phrases (“shadowseam wonder”) edge toward ornament but do not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The iridescent geode cave, crater glass, and glowing seeds create a strong, unified atmosphere that’s specific and sensorially vivid. The environment is not just backdrop: she plants the seed into a geode crack and later watches the cave fill with glowing, emotion-made flowers, directly charging the final image. The “cheerful gloom” of the space consistently mirrors her emotional state and thematic balance of loss/understanding. It stops short of truly constraining choices, but it significantly enriches tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal arcade is vivid and memorable—flooded marble floors mirroring stars, harbor breeze, and acoustics all contribute to a distinct atmosphere that feels tailored to Leo’s art. Details are filtered through his priorities (acoustics, passerby flow), and the final image of stars “winking” pays off the setting motif. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or imposes practical pressure; it remains more evocative backdrop than active shaper of tactics or stakes. Strong scene painting, slightly short of using setting as a true narrative lever.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The twilight garden under stars, forbidden flowers, and scented air are vivid and consistent, and the environment clearly mirrors the thematic tension between banned nostalgia and secret preservation. The garden functions as more than backdrop: it is a sanctuary that enables her elective exile and houses the buried magic she taps. The cosmic setting (gaps between stars, moonlight, tides) is coherently tied to her abilities and the final image of her inscribed skin. At times the description leans toward generalized “forbidden beauty” rather than sharply particular, but the atmosphere remains strong and supportive of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bay, dawn light, spiderwebs, and workshop details are vivid and sensorially specific, and they’re consistently filtered through Mara’s eye for glass and light. The atmosphere of stillness before the town wakes is well-rendered and tonally supports the contemplative mode. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or imposes real pressures; it’s largely a beautiful backdrop rather than an active shaper of decisions. Some descriptive density (“a thousand colors Mara had names for but no words to describe”) edges toward ornament more than function.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge, ancient pines, and distant town lights are vivid and consistently filtered through his exhausted, professional body. The recurring object-as-setting—the cracked porcelain box—anchors the space and ultimately charges the closing image, with the ridge’s height and darkness echoing his isolation and vantage over indifferent stars. Environmental details are selective and purposeful; nothing feels like a catalog. The micro-setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, but it strongly shapes mood and the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered and recurrent: tides reveal new surfaces, light angles shift, and bioluminescent algae charge the final image. Setting details are purposeful and filtered through Elian’s work—surfaces to hang decorations, crevices for light, the grotto as “laboratory.” The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his options beyond being a naturally resonant space, but it does shape atmosphere and the sense of patient, geological time underpinning his hopeful experiments. The final kneeling gratitude to the grotto and algae-lit decorations meaningfully ties setting into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ivy-veiled corridor and post-climate-shift ruins are evocative, with tactile details like cold stone, ivy canopy, and partially burned papers giving the world texture. Elara’s profession colors what she notices (vibrations, echoes, frequencies), which is a solid POV filter. That said, the environment seldom constrains her choices or tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The setting supports mood and concept well but stops short of charging the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the echoing terrace, cathedral bells, morning mist, and especially the rain-slick prism parapet all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details directly shape the magic—water amplifies resonance, the terrace shares a heartbeat with her, mirrors across the city respond. The atmosphere supports the piece’s liminal, contemplative tone without slipping into generic imagery. The final separation from the terrace carries extra weight because the place has been so concretely established as her literal lifeline.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient terrace, three suns, stone canopy opening at midday, and celestial alignment all create a vivid, specific atmosphere that clearly belongs to this world. Details are well filtered through Elian’s attention (salt air, weathered stone, ritual space), and the environment mirrors the stakes in a restrained way. The ebony clipboard functions as a quasi-setting object, returning in the final image with reweighted meaning. Still, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; it largely supports tone rather than shaping action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The salt flat, cracks, overcast sky, and later rain are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Silas’s perception, tying landscape to his inner fracture without feeling purely symbolic. The environment meaningfully shapes the narrative: the ruined ecosystem is the physical proof of his actions and the stage for his secret ritual, and the rain on salt “like tiny bells” effectively charges the final beats. Weather and terrain evolve with the story (dry, tense lull → first drops → intensifying rain) in a coherent way. A slightly broader sensory range beyond visual and sound (e.g., smell, texture beyond “crystalline”) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “silver courtyard under snow” and winter starlight are recurrent and atmospheric, giving the piece a strong, unified visual palette. The environment aligns with tone—still, bright, numinous—and the condition that the sanctuary appears only in winter ties setting to plot. However, the courtyard and snow rarely constrain or complicate action; they are more ceremonial backdrop than active pressure. The sanctuary interior echoes the outer world nicely but similarly functions at a symbolic level rather than as a tactically lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The decommissioned radar dome and “seedy bar” are vivid, distinctive anchors and the recurring “meteor hush” and indigo light create a consistent, atmospheric quiet. Details like the dome’s history and the story stick’s carvings feel specific and thematically apt, repurposing surveillance space into a sanctuary. However, the environments mostly frame mood rather than constraining choices or tactics; Elias could almost do the same work from any studio and bar. Strong, publishable texture, but not yet fully weaponized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “verdant grotto above the clouds,” treetops that defy gravity, and mist-shrouded peak form a highly specific, sensorially rich environment that feels both magical and lived-in. Setting is filtered through Aris’s values (sanctuary, witness, memory), and recurring objects (moth wing, stone marker, cloudlight, moon-flowers) charge the final images, especially the dissolving structures catching starlight. The grotto’s altitude and isolation reinforce the stakes of “last witness” and give the closure image real conceptual weight. This is publishably strong scene-setting that meaningfully underwrites theme and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly rendered and recur in meaningful ways—the aurora literally descends, and the cold logically preserves the inscribed names. Setting details like the glowing rope, channels in the ice, and the mistaken “font” basin are integrated into the central action rather than sitting as backdrop. The environment does not strongly constrain tactical choices beyond necessitating technical gentleness and endurance of cold, but it richly charges the atmosphere and final image. Overall, the world feels coherent and specific, if more symbolic than obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest are vivid and thematically apt, and the storm and decaying concrete mirror her mental turbulence and the fading directive. Setting details—vines, dust motes, etched words—are well integrated into action and closure, especially the final sunlight through the vines reweighting the opening gloom. However, the environment mostly colors mood rather than constraining her options or tactics beyond the storm as a catalyst. Strong atmosphere, slightly shy of using setting as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ancient Babylonian observatory-palace is evocatively rendered, with celestial maps replacing war tapestries and twilight hues echoing his inner state. The magic square tile as a recurring object anchors the environment and charges the final image, and the equinox/eclipsing kingdoms context adds atmosphere. However, the setting more often decorates than constrains action—weather, architecture, and city layout rarely affect what Anu can or must do. The historical-mystical texture is strong but could shape choices more concretely to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Sanctuary is vividly rendered (soundless, infinite marble, breathing walls, starry bench) and its rules stay consistent, with silence and liminality thematically echoing inner stillness and transition. The environment matters: the absence of sound forces the music boxes’ “melody” to be felt internally, charging the final image where the sanctuary finally “fills with a melody only their hearts could hear.” Details are integrated with action rather than dumped. A bit more use of setting to constrain choice, not just mood, would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and textured: fogged ruined orchards, twilight frost, and the tactile workshop tools all feel specific and lived-in. Details are well-filtered through a craftsman’s eye and align with the story’s preoccupation with reflection and boundaries. However, the environment mostly supports mood rather than constraining choices; the orchard’s transformation is thematically charged but not tactically necessary. Strong atmosphere, slightly shy of using place as real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned cathedral with an orchard in its rafters is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s history with the place. Setting is not just decorative: the impossible apples and their height necessitate the bridge and charge the final images of seed and murmuring orchard. Details like moss-covered pews, stained glass light, and apples as suspended wisdom deepen mood without clutter. The environment meaningfully shapes both tactics (building the bridge) and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The astral orchard, lonely asteroid, dome habitat, and bathroom are vividly evoked, with luminous petals and phosphorescent leaves giving the piece a distinct, coherent atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Elias’s archivist/cosmic-curator lens, reinforcing the “between pages of history” conceit. While the environment rarely constrains choices in a practical sense, it does meaningfully charge the final images (orchard glowing brighter, artifact lying quiescent) with thematic weight. World rules (gravity-defying trees, resonance fields) stay consistent and are absorbed seamlessly into the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The labyrinthine bookstore, ink guardians, and botanical library are vivid, specific, and tonally coherent, with strong, image-rich choices like shelves twisting like vines and living books with stems and leaves. Setting is filtered through Elara’s vocational lens (languages, botany, text), which sharpens the sense of atmosphere. The environment does shape some options (restricted sections, guardians, access points), though it rarely constrains her in a way that forces hard tactical shifts. Still, for this length, the world feels unusually textured and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship, foggy bay, and ruined greenhouse with a single emerald tree are vivid, tonally unified, and strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting details (creaking metal, shifting murals, fog pressing at portholes) effectively mirror her blurred identity and the mutable nature of memory. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her physical options, it does charge the final image: the drifting ship and central tree as the locus of the “garden of forgotten names.” The recurring emerald motif (card, leaves, light) meaningfully binds space, object, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room, the pendulum, and the temporal door are vivid, specific, and nicely aligned with the story’s time-manipulation premise. Details like brass cogs, chains, and the glowing carved door feel filtered through an archivist’s eye, which reinforces voice and atmosphere. The rope and seal function as charged objects that meaningfully shape the magic system and the final image. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices beyond “this door appears now, here,” but it consistently supports tone and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The harmonic caves, ripple-marked walls, and Ice Sanctum with “ancient ice that had never melted” are vivid and tonally coherent, and the environment is not just scenic—it supplies the method (crack patterns in ice) and the convergence point for resonance. The echo chamber stone operates as a micro-setting object constraining action at the climax. World rules about resonance and vibration stay consistent, learned by watching the mapkeeper work rather than exposition. A touch more sensory variety (beyond sound/light) and physical constraint in the environment would push this toward the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass humming pavilion, wind-song walls, and broken prism create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Details like the panels vibrating with starlight and the pavilion “holding its breath” as the beacon rekindles effectively fuse environment with emotional charge. The setting recurs and evolves, culminating in the final harmony of pavilion and beacon, which clearly charges the closing image. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it does meaningfully frame and color every major beat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Worldbuilding is vivid and integrated: the stormlit observatory above the clouds, the crystal forecourt that stores whispers, and the solidified fog as a “living archive” all serve the memory theme and Elthion’s work. Details are not postcard-pretty; they shape how he acts—he must descend from sky to ground, kneel to listen to the crystals, and read history in monument shadows. The environment directly charges the final images as the crystals amplify his vow into the solid fog. Setting is a major strength and feels particular to this story.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is richly realized: the blooming fortress, mosaic pathways, and starless night are specific and sensorial, and they evolve with the action as flowers and tiles respond to the fireworks. Details are filtered through Elias’s craft-minded gaze (acoustics, chemicals, vantage from the tower), which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The fortress and its flora meaningfully charge the final image as the place transitions from isolation to beacon. A slightly tighter focus on how the fortress’s physical constraints shape his tactical choices could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto, stars, and tidal pools are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Maya’s scientific, reflective gaze, giving the piece a strong atmosphere. The pools and cicada recur and clearly charge the final image, with metamorphosis and tidal transition mapped onto her professional and personal shift. However, the environment mostly mirrors theme rather than constraining choices or tactics in a concrete way. Strong, purposeful specificity and motif work land this high, but not at the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The world-building is strikingly specific and sensorial: underground bunkers, atmospheric layers with distinct “tastes” of silence, and the xenial trellis’s soundless chiming flowers all feel fresh and integrated with Elara’s perception. The inversion of gravity and the vertical journey through different silences create a strong atmospheric arc from constriction to luminous openness. Environment meaningfully shapes options—only on this day and via vertical escape can she reach the trellis—and the final image of doll + vessel is charged by that spatial history. A slight tendency toward lush cataloging over lived, tactile interaction with the bunker prevents this from reaching the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drifting prism terrace, valley of colors, and storm glass are vividly and consistently rendered, with details like prisms casting rainbows that are clearly filtered through Elias’s professional focus. Setting is not just backdrop; it’s the apparatus he manipulates to create the silence-field that soothes passengers. The environment conceptually charges the final image (moving sanctuary under changing skies), even if it doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices. Overall, the atmosphere is memorable and integrated, though more functional constraint could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vividly imagined and specific—“holographic deserts,” “memory-formatted forests,” the “kaleidoscopic waterfall,” and the orchard of metallic trees all build a strong retro-futurist atmosphere. Details are largely filtered through Elara’s task-focused movement, so they don’t feel entirely like a static tour, and the waterfall/orchard physically gate access to the throne. World rules (mechanical sunrise, crystalline circuitry, holographic overlay) mostly cohere and reinforce the futuristic nostalgia tone. It stops short of 9-band because the environment rarely constrains her choices with real friction; it frames the quest more than it pressures it.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The charcoal sanctuary, ashen floor, and cold starlight are vivid and recurrent, and the threshold-as-space is clearly defined and visually memorable. Environment and object-as-setting constrain choice: leaving the sanctuary and activating the threshold are literally how she can respond, and the fading threshold raises the price of inaction. The setting’s mood (cold, static, dust/ash) mirrors her internal state without feeling like pure symbol. The final movement toward dawn reweights the earlier darkness effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and specific—blue-green pulses, thick spore-laden air, the rare purple terrace—and these details are integrated with action rather than isolated description. The environment supports tone and mood strongly, and the purple glow concretely guides her to the bolt. The final image of diamonds catching bioluminescent light meaningfully reprises and recharges the setting. Still, the space rarely constrains her tactics or choices beyond “go deeper,” so the setting shapes atmosphere more than concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sepia reading room, golden light, gaslamps, and ceiling carving create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular rather than generic. Setting is not merely decorative: the carved “map” and the hidden compartment in the floor directly matter to the tactic and payoff. Sensory detail is heavily visual but integrated into action (positioning the gramophone, the glow of the carving, the moving floorboards). The environment meaningfully frames and enables the climax, though it could press back more strongly to truly stand out at top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vivid and specific—the crystalline fruit that chime, phosphorescent vines, and shifting glass panes all create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are integrated into action and mood (plants “leaning closer,” fruit colors later “speaking a language he nearly understood”), and the environment’s perpetual night supports the thematic withdrawal from the world. However, the greenhouse mostly charges tone rather than constraining choice; Galen’s actions would be similar in many enclosed magical spaces. The world rules feel consistent for this short span, and the final image is nicely recharged by the setting, but not quite in a way that reshapes options.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The foster care file room, dust, and brass button are specific and consistent, with the dust patterns nicely filtered through Eleanor’s expertise. The environment meaningfully shapes her method—she literally reads the room to find Benjamin’s file—and the button charges the final image. Sensory range leans heavily visual, with limited tactile/olfactory grounding that could deepen atmosphere. Still, the institutional space and its bureaucratic detritus are thematically apt and never feel like a white room.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    There are vivid, appealing images—the bruised purple/orange sky, the auric lagoon like liquid gold, the tarnished TrueComm key—and they do orient us. The lagoon-as-archive concept is strong, and the environment participates via reflections revealing maps and histories. Still, most setting detail feels more decorative than constraining; the lagoon doesn’t significantly alter tactics beyond being the place with the vaults. World rules around reflections and archives are gestured at rather than made tactile in scene.

    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, mist, and dewdrops are vividly rendered and recur with evolving function—the acoustics matter to the plan, the mist and prisms visually echo the music’s work, and the final quiet grotto image feels charged. Details are filtered through Ethan’s purpose (walking to the atrium, assessing its acoustics) rather than as static tour guide description. The environment doesn’t brutally constrain his options, but it does shape his chosen method and charges the final image with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, mossy platform, specific seed types, and canopy light are vivid and consistent, creating a strong atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elara’s professional eye (sorting trays, bone tool, cultivation beds), which grounds the fantasy setting. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible—seed sorting in the suspended canopy, messages for dwellers below, the seasonal hush as a working window. Still, the arbor rarely constrains her choices under pressure; it’s more beautifully rendered stage than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The workshop of irregular clocks, the overgrown greenhouse, and the subterranean waterfall are vivid and sensorially grounded, especially the “scent of decay and rebirth” and light through broken glass. Environment use is purposeful when the waterfall and vines force Elias to improvise a descent. The natural, season-responsive clocks are a strong setting concept that ties directly to theme. A bit more tactile engagement or constraint from the environment could lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rain-washed foundry, furnaces, crucibles, and cooling metal are vividly evoked and tied to action—the environment isn’t a backdrop; he actively uses it to enact his choice. Weather and setting reinforce mood (“rain-washed,” steam like a “ghostly sigh”) and the foundry’s tools enable the kintsugi-like forging of the new coin. The recurring rain/foundry imagery charges the final image of the glowing disc in his palms. A slight overreliance on atmospheric adjectives edges toward lyric redundancy but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge, with its strange acoustics, the hidden sunrise, and the misaligned harp, is vividly drawn and integrated into the premise rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment concretely shapes the mechanics of soul-collecting (distorted notes, bouncing sound, cave, prior drowning) and gives the story its otherworldly texture. The crocodile’s tooth functions as a micro-setting tool, anchoring action and the final image. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the physical space doesn’t heavily constrain late-scene choices beyond enabling the tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is strikingly imagined and consistently filtered through Kai’s altered perception, with the UV light, glowing bark, and pulsing canopy all echoing his internal exposure. Crucially, the environment is not just decorative: its ultraviolet properties are required to activate the pewter strap’s hidden function and to “reveal unseen truths,” directly charging the climax. The body-as-micro-setting works too—his proprioceptive mapping and pain responses function like an internal landscape he navigates. A small deduction comes from the forest’s rules remaining mostly symbolic rather than concretely systematized, but at this length the atmosphere-work is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist’s market and the floating bazaar are vividly evoked with tactile and visual detail, and the painting and fragment work well as micro-settings/objects that anchor action. The world’s rules (between-worlds translation via art) stay internally consistent and are learned through her actions and memories rather than infodumps. The setting mostly supports tone and theme rather than constraining choice, but the final image of the now-solid lens as a bridge of legacy effectively charges the environment. A bit more use of the market as a functional constraint (danger, access, social dynamics) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered through smell, light, and debris, and details like grimy windows, flickering fluorescents, and ceiling dust are tightly bound to Marcus’s professional gaze. The environment and the fluorescent buzz timetable meaningfully shape the events, constraining when the supernatural contact can occur. The mainspring barrel, ceiling, and cracks in reality all interlock with the spatial and atmospheric frame, charging the final image with place-specific resonance. Description is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass orchard library above a cloud sea is vivid, specific, and consistently exploited as more than a backdrop; frost-branches, crystalline vials, and rustling glass leaves all feed atmosphere and concept. The environment charges the final image as the library cracks and reforms, and as new frost patterns appear, signaling a transformed order of knowledge. However, setting rarely constrains concrete choices—it shapes meaning rather than tactics. The world rules feel coherent for this mode and are learned largely through image rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, particular, and thematically aligned: baroque asteroid, visible Time, temporal storms, and covered mirrors all resonate with the story’s concern with history and perception. Environment doesn’t quite constrain tactical choices but it strongly charges images like the storm and the shard at the end. World rules (visible Time, superstition around mirrors) are consistent and learned organically. The density of evocative detail earns its space without feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The resonance chamber and oak walls, the city of silenced music boxes, and the philosopher’s stone are vivid and sensorial, particularly in their acoustic qualities. Setting is well-integrated with action—the chamber’s amplification and the stone’s glow/flicker actively shape how the ritual works rather than serving as backdrop. The atmosphere of hushed, almost sacred craft is consistent and supports the story’s tone. What keeps this shy of top-tier is that the environment rarely constrains choice under true pressure; it mainly facilitates the desired solution.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is a major strength: the decaying industrial town, limestone cliffs, and especially the subterranean lagoon are rendered with specific, tactile detail (“surface like polished obsidian,” phosphorescent algae) that shapes mood and possibilities. The environment constrains action in a literal way—she must descend, wade into warm water, operate by headlamp—and the non-reach of starlight becomes thematically charged. Objects-as-setting (vials, compass) are well integrated and return to charge the final image. A small deduction comes from the world’s mystical rules being more atmospheric than tested; the lagoon never quite pushes back.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The coastal setting, storm-tossed archway, and offshore turbines are vivid anchors and recur throughout, creating a consistent atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or materially alters tactics beyond supplying driftwood and the crevice for the slide. Much of the description repeats key phrases without adding new, character-filtered specificity. The setting feels more like a poetic backdrop than an active participant in the story’s turns.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the amber pavilion, autumn leaves, cathedral interior, and moonlit etched glass are sensorially vivid and tightly fused to the story’s meaning. The environment doesn’t just decorate; the glass and moonlight literally model the mechanism of her revelation and charge the final image of her new murals. Details are well-filtered through her artistic eye, keeping the description purposeful rather than touristic. The world feels cohesive and tonally aligned with the theme of hidden, nocturnal beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vivid, specific anchors, with tactile touches like “airship engines hummed beneath polished oak floors” and “waves lapped against her boots.” The environment does meaningful work: the lagoon is the temporal anomaly and medium of communication, and the zeppelin provides mobility and the suspended-archive atmosphere. Setting is filtered reasonably through Ellara’s sensibility. It could, however, constrain her choices more sharply rather than mostly serving as an evocative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Paper-lantern Cove, the bay window, and the lanterns at dawn give the story a distinct, coherent atmosphere, and the amber bottle functions as a recurring object that charges the final image conceptually. The setting is mostly painted in broad strokes, but the ghost-town + restored infrastructure + lantern motif create a strong tonal frame for the themes. Still, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it is more backdrop and metaphor than active setting. With a bit more tactile engagement—movement through specific streets, weather, sounds—the same material could feel much more inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The orchard atop the skyscraper, obsidian slab, wax cylinder, foghorn, and city below create a rich, cohesive atmosphere, and sensory details (cool wax, rustling leaves above the clouds) are well chosen and filtered through Elias’s vocation. The setting carries thematic weight—ancient trees over a fragile modern city—and the final image of the skyscraper “insignificant against the impending darkness” recharges that. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more stage and symbol than active pressure. Beautiful, purposeful description that stops just short of having the world decisively shape action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is richly realized and integrated into action—the freezing floor, crystalline ceiling, and pulsing ice walls all respond to her work and shape the mood. Setting details (frost on jars, starlight brightening, forest-in-a-hurricane image) mirror and intensify Anya’s inner state without feeling like mere decoration. The oak acorn cap and seed jars function as charged micro-setting objects that constrain tactically how she attempts to reopen the vortex. A slight tendency toward lush, almost unbroken visual description keeps this from absolute top-tier, but it’s still a strong, world-defining environment.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain-top sanctuary “above the clouds,” thin air, creaking timbers, and wind all feel specific and lived-in, filtered through a weather-obsessed professional’s gaze. The bell tower and rope, the barometers, and the gathering luminescent clouds integrate setting into both vocation and climax. The environment plausibly explains his isolation and sensitivity to microclimates, and the final image of the bell responding to the storm charges the space itself. It’s vivid and purposeful, though the physical environment rarely constrains immediate choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cosmic janitor’s station, the falling stars, and the interdimensional void are vividly and consistently rendered, with the yellow glass functioning as a charged micro-setting tool. Details like “a lonely outpost suspended between dimensions” and “observation dome” efficiently anchor place and mood. World rules are simple but stable, and the environment’s scale and hush effectively mirror the interior quest. Still, most description stays visual and conceptual; more tactile or sensory grounding under stress could deepen the atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly specific and thematically fused to the story: cracked glass domes, rusted honey extractors, and ghostly figures among acacia trees all reinforce the idea of a once-symbiotic system now haunted. The oasis isn’t postcard-background; its details (particular hives, barrels, hive markings) literally encode the contextual clues that guide the recluse’s understanding and choice. The stained glass box and the oldest hive as the ritual site charge the final image in a way that depends on this exact environment. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual could deepen immersion, but the integration and specificity are already strong enough to feel publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The emerald silo, spiral staircase, and pulsing walls give a strong atmospheric anchor and a clear sense of place tied to the story’s temporal concerns. The damaged capsule and leaking “moments” are vivid, charged images that integrate well with the premise. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; Elara doesn’t have to navigate physical or social constraints in ways that change her behavior. The final image of the silo as sanctuary and teacher is resonant, but it remains more symbolic than actively shaping the story’s turns.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lagoon after rain, cliffs, droplets, and sky reflection are vividly rendered and recur throughout, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through her poetic sensibility (e.g., “palimpsest of nature’s own making,” lagoon mirroring the sky) and support the liminal, in-between thematic focus. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does conceptually frame her role as a “bridge between realms” and charges the final walk-away. The specificity and consistency are excellent, though the setting serves more as lyrical backdrop than a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper-wrapped oak branches are vivid, coherent, and integrated with the premise; the final glowing-pillars image is strong. Setting is more visual than fully sensory, but it has a distinct, almost liturgical atmosphere that fits the tone. The environment conceptually shapes what’s possible (the pillars as conduits) but rarely constrains on-page choices beyond providing a stage. Even so, the place feels specific and memorable rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is the story’s standout strength: the rainwashed tower, bronze façade, overgrown sculpture path, and recurring weather are vivid and sensorially specific. The environment meaningfully charges the imagery of cleansing, convergence, and ritual, and the tower/pedestal physically stage the final offering. However, the setting mostly frames mood rather than constraining choices—nothing about the tower or spring conditions forces difficult tactics or trade-offs. It’s lush and purposeful, but still more backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bleak coast, dead reef, poisoned battlefield, and blooming jetty are vividly drawn and tonally coherent, and the environment is thematically apt to an ecological-rebirth story. Details like “windswept path,” “blooming jetty,” circling seabirds, and later wildflowers give a strong sense of place without losing clarity. That said, the setting rarely constrains action: wind, terrain, or poison do not significantly alter his tactics beyond broad guidance from the birds. The jetty and reef return effectively at the end, but mostly as symbolic backdrop rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scrapyard settlement, rusted mountains, cracked wasteland, and hidden valley are vivid and coherent, with details like “tarpaulins shifting in the morning breeze” and dismantled weapons of war grounding the world. Setting is consistently filtered through Silas’s senses and history, which keeps it from feeling like a neutral backdrop. The environment does shape tactics somewhat (following landmarks, the fallen drone, the valley’s concealment), though the landscape could pressure agency more directly. Overall, the atmosphere is strong and tonally aligned with the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observation deck, the dormant equipment, and the altered sky after the shutdown are evocative and clearly filtered through an astronomer’s gaze. The recurring compass rose, the star charts, and the hum of machinery all support the atmosphere of haunted scientific ruin. While the setting doesn’t materially constrain her choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of her as a lone “guardian” in this specific place. Detail is selective and thematically aligned, if a bit visually biased.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The icebound spire, wrong green sky, and impossible constellations are vivid and specific, and the chambers (pedestals, altars, library of unreadable books) give a concrete sense of place. Setting consistently shapes action: Kael must climb, endure cold and thin air, and navigate a sequence of spatially distinct rooms to progress. The wrong sky and the sundial’s celestial engravings directly charge the final image as environment and object converge. There’s room for deeper sensory embodiment (especially bodily strain and environmental hazard), but the world-building is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The whispering gallery, chessboard, and nomadic penumbra create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that shapes how memory is accessed and preserved. The space is not just decorative; it amplifies whispers, stores memories, and participates in the unbinding, and the chessboard anchors the final image. World details like the interregnum and the Crisis are sketched just enough to feel real without bogging down. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond echoes and shimmer) could deepen embodiment, but what’s here is purposeful and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bookstore-mountain is vivid, sensorially grounded (“scent of aging paper and leather,” labyrinthine corridors, skylights) and meaningfully entwined with her search for home. Environmental shifts (new corridors, trembling shelves, the dissolving mountain) are directly tied to her growing power and the climax. The mercury glass, stone, and feather all operate as charged objects rather than decorative props, especially as the mountain is re-revealed as the “doorway between all homes.” It stops short of showing the setting actively constraining a hard choice, but it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “time-frozen village,” “woven hush,” and “platinum labyrinth” create a vivid, coherent fantastical setting whose rules (frozen time, four-minute lull, silence) constrain what’s possible. Details like suspended villagers and liquid-metal walls are selective yet evocative, and the environment explicitly shapes his options and the story’s stakes. The atmosphere stays consistent—hushed, charged, penitential—and the lifting of the hush and thunder shifting from threat to applause effectively charge the final beats. More tactile, grounded sensory detail (temperature, physical strain, the feel of threads) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Canyon of Endless Echoes, bone towers, mist, and pale spire create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the central metaphor of refraction. Setting is strongly filtered through theme—the echoes literally refract language and the bone towers embody the cost of absolutism. However, the environment rarely constrains specific tactical choices; Elara doesn’t have to navigate physical danger or use the space in a problem-solving way. The final image of her words bouncing from bone tower to bone tower is charged and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The floating gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is vivid and memorable, with strong sensory and visual specificity (“corrosive emerald waters,” “interlocking gears and gleaming brass cogs”). Setting details are well filtered through Marcel’s attention to instruments and scars, and the environment echoes his precarious inner state (the tilt of the workshop mirroring turbulence). However, the setting rarely constrains immediate choices; it’s more atmospheric than functionally binding, which keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor and the cave are vividly and economically rendered—sunlight through cracks, tide pools, barnacles, and the aging quay all feel tactile and filtered through an artist’s eye. Setting is not just backdrop: the hidden cave physically enables the shell’s preservation and discovery, and the shell itself (placed near the easel) charges the final image. The marine environment subtly mirrors Elias’s internal state—erosion, memory, and preservation—without feeling heavy-handed. It stops short of using the physical environment to actively constrain on-page choices, which keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, heat-broken dawn, and withered garden with a lone jasmine create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors Elias’s emotional state. Details like the jasmine’s night scent at dawn and the sea’s calm after heat feel chosen rather than generic, and the lighthouse returns in the closing image as a kind of protective vessel. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does charge the final images and anchors the magic in a tactile world. Overall, setting and mood are strengths without quite becoming structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The starlit signal station, treacherous waters, and the moon-charged censer create a strong, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically aligned with isolation and fragile guidance. Details like “reverse migration,” failed hydraulics, and blinking ship lights situate us in a world with coherent if lightly sketched rules. The censer as object-setting does charge the final image, constraining how the navigator acts (using it as “anchor”). Still, environment exerts relatively little concrete pressure on decisions beyond mood and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine are vividly rendered (“branches swaying like arthritic fingers,” storms masking her illegal ritual) and clearly anchored in her practical movements as a forager. The environment meaningfully explains her isolation and the cover the weather gives her, charging the secrecy around the relic. However, the storm and geography rarely constrain her choices in the moment—she never has to adapt tactics because of the ravine or weather—so the setting is richly atmospheric but only moderately operative.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: “opal dock,” “moon-bleached bone,” and the mist’s behavior give a distinctive, tonally unified coastal world seen through Elias’s sensibility. The environment is not just pretty—it functions as a liminal stage for the stranger’s appearance/disappearance and returns in the final image to charge the Edelweiss and gesture with meaning. The lighthouse routines, fog, and small-town details feel lived-in without over-explaining. A slight overindulgence in iridescent/opal imagery keeps this just shy of the very top tier, but the setting clearly constrains and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cavern with phosphorescent flowers, crystals, and the rising creek is vividly realized and anchored, and the shop’s dusty atmosphere nicely frames his before/after state. The environment influences timing (“as the creek rose”) and mood more than it constrains action, so it feels slightly more like backdrop than an active pressure. Still, the recurring natural light against stone and water supports the story’s contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridge, ember grotto, and “cobalt grotto above clouds” are vividly rendered with strong visual specificity, and the bleeding starlight pool creates a memorable central image. Setting is generally integrated with action (the brutal climb, the cloud line, the glowing chamber) rather than dropped in as static description. That said, the environment rarely constrains choice beyond generic difficulty; the curse and physical peril are more stated than dramatized. The closing return to the grotto in memory helps charge the final image thematically, even if the landscape’s practical pressure could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ember nexus at twilight, the geothermal warmth, ember fragments, and pocket-suns create a vivid, coherent environment filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting supports tone and theme effectively, especially when the nexus seems to “recognize” the significance of the secret and hum in response. The nautilus and pocket-suns function as micro-settings/objects that charge the final images and the new art. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges the emotional and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain ranger cabin at 8,000 feet, the upside-down snow, and the aurora borealis create a vivid, consistent environment that suits his liminal mental state. Details stay filtered through Elias’s sensibility (pine, old leather, ancient language) rather than reading like a neutral tour, and the natural world echoes the theme of cyclic renewal. While the setting enhances atmosphere and the final image, it rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics. Still, as a lyric frame, it’s specific, lived-in, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the water clock shop between bakery and bookstore, the morning fog, and the dripping mechanisms all support the tone and theme of time marked in quiet, sensory ways. Details are filtered through Elara’s altered perception—touch and sound foregrounded over smell—which grounds us in her body and loss. The recurring water clocks and the clamp screw both charge the final image, linking timekeeping and birth. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it meaningfully inflects the story’s mood and conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock platform, misty void, magical storms, and tea-ritual space are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention and anxiety. The “breath between tempests” and the later tilting of the platform directly constrain timing and physical stability, so the environment meaningfully shapes action rather than serving as backdrop. Tools and micro-setting—the luminescent ink, crow quill, steaming tea—are tactile and participate in both mood and process. The worldbuilding is suggestive rather than exhaustive, but at this length it feels like economy, not thinness.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: attic sheet-music archive, orchard, and piano aren’t postcard details but extensions of the shared past and present constraints. The perfume bottle and equipment function as micro-setting tools that physically shape what’s possible in the ritual and charge the final image when she closes the bottle. Environmental change—the hush giving way to demolition sounds—directly affects the climax. Sensory detail (dust, scent, hum of the generator) is selective and POV-filtered, supporting the elegiac yet technical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ancient temple library and its rearranging shelves create a strong, consistent atmosphere that fits the mythic register. Details like the altar, glowing dictionary, and “resounding hush” are vivid and recur to charge the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains options or forces specific tactics; the library is more symbolic backdrop than active pressure. The world rules (intention-guided corridors, temporal hiccup) are stable and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The horizon measurement station, fjord, and hydraulic clocks are vividly and economically rendered, with concrete details like tubes, aqueducts, brass fittings, and reversed water flow. Setting is well filtered through Arlo’s professional eye, which gives it specificity and atmosphere rather than a tourist gloss. The environment echoes theme (tides, horizons, “fjord quiet”) and charges several images, though it rarely constrains his choices in a tactical way. Objects-as-setting—the key, razor edges, and clock—do strong work charging the mood and final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, with the glowing beds and responsive fungi giving the piece a distinctive atmosphere. Setting details are integrated into action—mushrooms brightening along the laser paths, dawn and birdsong framing the temporal arc. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than active pressure. The final brightening of the mushrooms does nicely charge the last image, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Moscow setting, rainwashed library, subway seats, and especially the candle lantern with its mica pane create a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elena’s professional and emotional lens—the way the lantern’s light makes numbers “dance” is both character-specific and thematic. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final image of her future subway “pilgrimage” with the lantern. Overall, the setting feels lived-in, purposeful, and tonally aligned with the story’s quiet stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subway utility tunnel is vividly realized (pipes “like metallic intestines,” sweating walls, distant hum of streetlamps) and consistently filters through Elias’s isolation. The glass harmonica disc functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and tracks his emotional state from haunting to hope. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully frames theme and mood and is more than decorative. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming jetty, flowers in the planks, twilight, journal, and vials are rendered with vivid, selective detail that is clearly filtered through a Naturalist archivist’s gaze. The setting isn’t just decorative: the flowers literally become ink components, and the jetty as “refuge, laboratory, church” charges the final image of him turning away. Environmental evolution (twilight to night) tracks the emotional transition without feeling forced. Description occasionally verges on lush, but it remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The disused, ivy-choked station is an evocative image that bookends the story and suits his liminal role, and the moon rock functions as a strong micro-setting object. Secondary locales (taxis, cafés, newsletter office) are sketched efficiently to support the rumor chain montage. However, the station does not materially constrain choices or tactics; it’s mood and metaphor more than functional environment. The ending returns us there for resonance, but the place hasn’t evolved or exerted pressure in a way that would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ultrasonic forest, the ancient tree, and the paused constellations create a distinctive, sensorially rich atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Elion’s tactile and acoustic perception. The environment meaningfully shapes the mode of navigation (vibrations, ultrasonic hum, musical trail) rather than serving as generic backdrop. The platinum ring and stillpoint function almost as micro-settings, charging the final image. Some details verge on repeated abstraction (“quiet blaze,” “energy field”) instead of sharpening into new, concrete facets, holding this just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The gravitational anomaly, star maps, chronopaper, and the pen together create a distinct, mildly surreal atmosphere that suits the concept. Details like moonlight “distorted…into dancing patterns” and stars blurring across the sky are vivid and thematically aligned. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; Elara could perform the same choice in a normal observatory with minimal change. The anomaly and cosmic setting charge the final image but remain mostly decorative rather than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.7)
    The harbor is vividly and consistently realized: moonlight, water, boats, salt air, city lights all recur and are filtered through Elias’s attentiveness. Setting and object interplay effectively—moonlight patterns, water shimmer, and the camera together create the final “visual symphony.” However, the environment mostly frames and echoes emotion rather than constraining choice or tactics. The specificity is strong, but the harbor rarely applies concrete pressure beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Archive of Aeridor and the woven-memory tapestries offer a strong conceptual setting that supports the themes of preservation and loss. Specifics like “dusty halls,” “underground sanctuary,” and the entrance tapestry give some tactile grounding, and the archive clearly shapes what is possible (she can rebuild a library there, hidden from the world). However, the atmosphere leans more mythic and abstract than sensorial, with little engagement of non-visual senses or spatial constraint in moments of choice. The environment charges the final images but could do more textural work along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is strikingly specific and integrated: the sound wave garden, Resonance Tower, and visible vibrations aren’t just backdrop; they are the medium of Elena’s escape and summoning. World rules around captured sound and pre-sound “hush” are consistent enough and revealed through her movement and drumming. The environment textures tone and character psychology very well, especially in the lagoon transformation. A slight limitation is that physical constraints (e.g., surveillance sightlines, distances) are more suggestive than precise, so the space feels poetic more than fully navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly and consistently rendered, with tactile detail like humming metal, puddles, and “acoustic highways” that feel particular to this world. Setting interacts with action—blackouts create shadows, container alignments carry whispers—rather than functioning as mere backdrop. The zodiac maps and coin help “micro-setting” the scene as ritualistic without drifting into heavy-handed symbolism. A slight limitation is that the port city beyond the maze never quite materializes, keeping the scope a bit narrower than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cobalt dock, rain, shutters, and canal atmosphere are vividly and consistently rendered, giving the piece a strong, unified physical texture. The setting is integrated with action through the shutter manipulations and reflections across the still water, rather than remaining pure backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains options or forces choices; it mirrors mood more than it pressures tactics. The recurring canal/dock imagery does charge the final image, but mostly at a tonal and symbolic level rather than through concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The cobalt library, misted streets, magnetic grotto, and starlight form a vivid, coherent atmosphere with good imagistic specificity. The recurring grotto and crystal give the setting some structural weight and thematic echo. Still, the environment rarely constrains Arthur’s choices—places feel like charged backdrops rather than active pressures. Strong mood and specificity, but not fully leveraged as a tactical constraint or in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The maritime setting and sublittoral fringe are vividly rendered with selective, sensorial detail (“golden light spilled across water the color of mercury”), and the emerging island and glowing scrimshaw effectively charge the atmosphere. Environment is integrated into action—Mara’s strength as a dock worker makes her swim plausible, and the rising island physically reconfigures the scene. World rules about the island and whale song remain consistent if lightly sketched. The broader post-violence world, however, is more evocative tag than functioning setting.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: turbines as “mechanical forest,” the farmhouse relic, and the dried bouquet all work as charged, recurring anchors. Environment and objects are filtered through the performer’s worldview and the mandate’s history, not as neutral description. The turbines and bouquet explicitly charge the final image—the “remade hush” and quiet revolution under their “eternal dance.” While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it deeply conditions tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly realized and recur throughout, giving the piece a strong visual and tonal coherence. Details like the stones “absorbing and reflecting the limited light” and the lake’s surface rippling despite the chill successfully integrate environment with the magical event. That said, the setting rarely constrains options or forces choices; it functions more as ornate backdrop and mirror than as an active pressure. Strong atmosphere, but not yet using environment as a structural lever in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glassblower’s courtyard is vividly realized—glass ornaments catching prismatic light, plants spiraling in Fibonacci patterns, the space itself “inhaling” to mark the awakening. Setting and atmosphere are tightly fused with the story’s premise: this courtyard is a known locus for these bartered awakenings, not a generic backdrop. Environmental details contribute to tone and closure, especially the prismatic reflections and shimmering air that mirror the story’s concern with perception. The setting could constrain tactics more overtly, but it already does notable thematic and imagistic work.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” and “golden shadows” are vivid, coherent anchors that saturate the piece with a strong, unified atmosphere. Details like dust motes “dancing like tiny spirits” and the resonator plate integrate setting with action rather than sitting as static backdrop. The miner’s lamp lens is well-charged by the space and history around it, especially when it “seemed to glow with an inner warmth.” The setting doesn’t much constrain choices, but it decisively charges the final image and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The timeless observatory is an evocative, specific environment—stars that whisper, “curtains of intention,” alcoves, and the great telescope all build a distinct atmosphere. Details are mostly visual and conceptual, but they’re thematically linked to grief and liminality, which prevents white-room syndrome. The setting shapes the kind of work she does but only loosely constrains concrete choices or tactics. Still, it’s memorable and integrated rather than a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylights, onyx-ink cards, and measuring tape are vividly drawn and recur in ways that create a cohesive, moody atmosphere. Details are selective and generally filtered through Elias’s vocation, reinforcing his attentiveness to patterns and spatial relationships. The rain and skylight motif earns its keep by returning in the final image, charging the sense of possibility. However, the setting rarely constrains action or choices; it is more backdrop and mood than an active participant in the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archive and bronze prism pagoda are vividly rendered and integral to the action—the environment isn’t backdrop but the mechanism by which the story’s premise operates. Twilight, shadows, and the glowing pagoda are woven into both mood and mechanics, culminating in the final charged image of darkness and inner light. The setting rules (lost-civilization archive, memory-preserving atoms in bronze) are consistent and thematically aligned. This is a major strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming library above the clouds, crystal dome, cloud-flowers, and moonlight form a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that feels specific to this story and POV. Setting is not mere backdrop: shadows, shelves, blossoms, and crystal dome all intersect with the central phenomenon and final transformation. The river stone functions as a micro-setting object, charging the closing image by becoming a “bridge between moments separated by decades.” While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it deeply charges perception and tone, especially at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “misty workshop under stars” is vividly rendered and recurs as a stable container for Elara’s crisis, with strong sensory and visual specificity (mist, condensation drip, lantern light, skylight). The chameleon and its enclosure function as micro-setting, and the described environment mirrors her internal state without feeling purely decorative. While the setting does not strongly constrain concrete choices, it does charge the final image—the mist lifting at dawn and the chameleon vanishing into foliage—with thematic weight. Overall, the atmosphere is textured, focused, and integrated with her emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quiet tower at dawn, arrow-slit windows, frosted hourglass, and whispering plants create a vivid, tonally unified environment that feels specific rather than generic. The setting meaningfully constrains action—the wall’s scar-like stones matching the coffee-ring pattern is how she accesses the tunnel, and the plants’ lack of sun shapes their plea. Environmental details evolve with events (hourglass cold then warm and emptied; dawn fully breaking as she returns). The piece avoids over-description, keeping detail purposeful and filtered through Elara’s scar-reading lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The projection booth, reel, dim red light, and dusty beam of the projector are vivid and repeatedly activated, not just named. The environment is tightly bound to the premise: the film’s physicality as celluloid, sprocket holes, and silver halide crystals carries the emotional archive. The final beam of light as “cathedral” space recharges earlier details effectively. A bit more sensory range beyond visual/abstract (sound, texture, smell) could deepen the atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    The aurora-lit archway, falling stars, and bronze instrument create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that clearly belongs to this story’s world. Setting is tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with celestial/weather/stone imagery mirroring her internal excess of input. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, it does charge the ritual and final image, making the threshold feel symbolically and texturally necessary. Detail is mostly purposeful rather than touristic, though it leans heavily on the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The desert, glowing dunes, and living data-archives are vividly realized and strongly filtered through the protagonist’s gaze, creating a cohesive, atmospheric world. Recurring setting elements—the dune in bloom and the archive within it—charge the final images and reinforce tone. The environment, however, rarely constrains tactics or behavior; it’s more stage and metaphor than obstacle or tool. Even so, the specificity and consistency of the world-building significantly elevate the piece’s texture.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and specific—copper needles, solar-panel leaves, rotating silver bark—and its atmosphere fits the speculative-introspective tone. The environment is thematically integrated as a projection of his mind and recurs at the end, giving the final image some charge. However, the setting rarely constrains his choices or creates dilemmas; it’s more a beautifully painted backdrop than an active pressure. Strong worldbuilding texture, but not yet fully weaponized as a narrative tool.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story’s strong suit: mist-locked passages, veiled ridgeway, liquid twilight, and black sand under double moons create a vivid, coherent secondary world. Details are filtered through the guides’ work and mission, so environment and tools (boats, ticket punch, waterfall) feel integrated rather than touristic. The recurring shoreline and water imagery charge the final return, though the world rarely constrains choice in a way that would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the cobalt fortress, leaded glass, and snow-lit corridors are not postcard details but create a sealed, insulated world that thematically mirrors enforced silence. The spiral staircase and the specific dusty step become functional micro-setting, directly enabling the discovery that drives the plot. The fortress’s construction by sacrificed musicians and the humming walls at the end meaningfully charge the final image. A slightly stronger sense of spatial constraint or physical peril from the environment during the climax could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient, time-lost library is vividly and consistently evoked, with the crystalline dome, marble cracks, and dust-mote patterns creating a coherent, atmospheric space. The environment does apply pressure: the reassertion of time and literal collapse of shelves narrow her window to act. The iron gall ink, rune of drift, and shadow-and-starlight text function as charged setting elements rather than mere props. Occasionally, description edges toward motif repetition (“pause of shifting constellations”) instead of fresh sensory specificity, but the world still feels particular and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sea level monitoring station, crashing waves, and the edge of the continental shelf are concrete, credible anchors that color Marina’s perceptions. Professional detail—the station’s alarms, maintenance manuals, satellite data—filters naturally through her expertise. Setting clearly mirrors the themes of mooring vs. drift and changing coastlines, and the atlas page fits seamlessly into this environment. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does charge the final image of logging data and folding the map.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay, broken viewports, debris from the uprising, and the incongruous stone circle all create a vivid, specific atmosphere. Details like dusty floors, dormant drones, and a crippled freighter are integrated into her movement rather than delivered as static exposition. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it functions more as evocative backdrop and symbolic contrast (tech ruin vs. ancient stones) than as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The volcanic hot springs, steam, obsidian chamber, and thriving mosses are vivid and sensorially grounded, and they’re consistently tied to Maya’s actions (geothermal reconstruction, hidden caves, steam parting as she descends). The environment meaningfully shapes the plot: without this specific terrain and its plant life, the telepathy and chamber access don’t cohere. Some details lean a bit generic (“reconstructed village”) rather than deeply particularized, but overall the atmosphere is strong and supports the story’s tone and stakes. The final image of Maya with the embryo amid humming plants is effectively charged by the established setting.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arboretum, cliff, and dark lighthouse are vivid and specific, with the sea and oyster shell functioning as charged objects that mirror her inner state. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the cliff and wind physically enable the key act of releasing the photograph, and the arboretum’s cycles of growth thematically frame her resilience. Details stay selective and character-filtered, avoiding tourist-list description. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of her standing at the cliff’s edge between darkness and light.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse library is vividly realized—the circular walls, dust motes, high window, and portraits all echo Eleanor’s interior constriction and ache. Environment interacts with mood (“walls…compressing her thoughts,” the lighthouse “breathing”) and the tarot box emerges organically from the shelves. While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain her choices, it strongly charges the tone and final image. Descriptive specificity is high without slipping into incomprehensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The wind-carved encampment, rock dwellings, and carved stone shelter are vivid and tonally aligned with the story’s eerie, liminal science. Details (wind corridors, scent of approaching rain, eclipse shadows) create a coherent atmosphere and feel filtered through the tracker’s priorities. The setting contributes conceptually (chosen for magnifying anomalies) more than tactically; it rarely constrains moment-to-moment action. Still, it frames the entire experiment and reinforces the liminal relationship to time.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Antarctic under-ice archive and “echoing library under snow” are vivid, consistent, and tonally aligned with secrecy and buried truth. Environmental details like thermal suits, amber-light data, and falling snow above meaningfully charge images of preservation vs. thawing. The setting mirrors her internal state and the thematic thaw of history without becoming heavy-handed. It rarely constrains tactics directly, but it strongly charges the final image and gives the story a distinctive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vivid and specific, with heat, condensation, and the surrounding harsh desert all clearly evoked. Setting and atmosphere are tightly linked to theme, contrasting cultivated tranquility with external chaos and reinforcing Rhiannon’s role as a maker of sanctuary. The dome’s breathing condensation and “tranquil blaze” roses are memorable, POV-filtered images. The environment influences tone and meaning more than concrete tactical choices, but it does charge the final sense of oasis versus wasteland.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, and rail spike create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this piece. Setting is not postcard-like: the vibrating blooms, pockets of silence, and timeframe of broken patterns directly shape his tactics (voicing silence, zigzagging, using the spike as anchor). World rules, though fantastical, feel internally consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition. The final images—the hum in the rail spike, the settling garden—are strongly charged by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory above the clouds, the star-filled dome, and the oak table create a vivid, coherent space with a pleasingly atmospheric echo motif. Details like celestial maps and the rosewood pen are integrated with her emotional state (legacy, regret, determination). The environment supports tone more than it constrains action; Eleanor could do nearly the same work in any quiet room. Still, for this length, the setting is specific, consistent, and thematically congruent.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid, with blue lights, haunted servers, and the “meteor hush” giving the piece a distinct acoustic-astral atmosphere. The amber and the lab equipment function as micro-setting constraints—plugging the amber into the system is the concrete means by which the experiment is possible, and the lab’s rules about preserved sounds frame the logic of the climax. Details are well-chosen and filtered through Elias’s sensibility (code as constellations, tattoos as galaxies). The worldbuilding remains suggestive rather than fully fleshed, but at this scale it feels like purposeful economy rather than thinness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The whispering grotto is vivid and specific—mist, acoustics, and “emergent hush” are not just backdrop but functional, since the mandala’s patterns literally interact with the space. The setting shapes tactics: Silas orients his sand work to the grotto’s acoustics, and the grotto becomes a “temple” only because of how people act within it. Recurring objects (sand, tile flake, mist) are well integrated into atmosphere and action. A slight overreliance on abstracted description in places keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky,” cracked stones, broken archways, and the central mosaic all feel tactile and visually strong. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with the tessera and stepping stone functioning as charged micro-settings rather than generic props. The environment mirrors and supports the thematic work of loss and potential without lapsing into mere catalog. While the plaza subtly frames choices, it doesn’t quite constrain tactics or force a particular course of action, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The hedge maze and mystic orchard are vividly realized, with strong multi-sensory detail and a consistent magical logic (time as colored ribbons, scents painting memories). Setting is deeply filtered through Silas’s synesthetic perception, making it feel both personal and enchanted rather than generic. The garden’s health is directly tied to the stakes and to the climax image of renewed vitality, so the environment meaningfully charges the ending. It doesn’t much constrain tactics, but it does serve as a convincing crucible and final image anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The light painting studio, cameras, choreographed red/blue lights, and projected neural-like patterns create a distinct, coherent environment. The muscovite geode as a recurring object is well-integrated into the setting and charges the final image as it rests against her heart. The setting does influence tactics somewhat (repurposed light-painting apparatus, special lens), though it could be swapped for a more generic lab with limited change in stakes. Sensory focus is heavily visual, but it suits the concept and maintains atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coastal cliff and cave network are clearly evoked and integrated with Maya’s descent, rope, and the sense of historical ritual use, giving a concrete environment for the discovery. The hovering fossil as an object-in-space has strong presence, and the temperature contrast between it and the cool cave air is a nice, specific touch. The setting could do more to actively constrain choice or create tangible risk (the “dangerous places” are asserted more than dramatized), but atmosphere and spatial orientation remain solid throughout. Overall, the environment feels purposeful and thematically apt rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “amber warehouse beneath the towering cliffs” is a strong, recurring anchor that gives the piece a recognizable atmosphere and visual palette. The canyon echo in a jar and the physicality of lost buttons provide tactile, specific touches that fit the speculative tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or behavior; it serves more as a resonant backdrop than an active pressure. The repetition of “amber” and the warehouse can feel slightly incantatory without evolving much across the story.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The zephyr bluff, mist, wind, and snow are vividly rendered and tightly bound to Aleksandr’s liminal state and ritual. Environmental details (snow codes, mist that will burn off, approaching spring) echo and support his internal arc without feeling like mere décor. The pillbox and snow function as quasi-micro-settings that charge the final images. The setting could exert a bit more concrete constraint on his options to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog-bound river crossing, ticking rain gutters, tollhouse, and mist all feel vivid and purposeful, shaping the liminal, otherworldly atmosphere. The environment is not just backdrop; it informs his profession, his ritual, and the notion of “crossing places” as between-world thresholds. The gutters specifically function as both clock and mood instrument, charging the final silence with a sense of vigil completed. Setting is one of the story’s most polished and integrated elements.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    The scorched wasteland against the tiny beekeeping oasis is vivid and tonally apt, and details like dead hives, wildflowers, flattened smoke, and the warm lantern glass are well integrated into action. Environmental rules (flowers phototropic to kindness, bees sensing intention, smoke bending light) stay internally consistent and define how the magic works. The setting actively participates in meaning: the oasis as a “loyal memory of love” is inseparable from its physical particulars. It stops short of 9-band only because the environment constrains choice lightly rather than forcing a specific costly tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor, alcove, and fire escape are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a gardener and inheritor of a lockmaster’s tools. The moonlit water and rock-darkened alcove aren’t decorative; they provide both the resource (moonlight) and the problem (deep shadow) that her tool and purpose address, and they charge the final image of the glowing cove. Details like the leaky rowboat, liquid-mercury water, and the metal fire escape give the piece a lived-in physicality. A slight tendency toward pretty-but-interchangeable moonlight phrasing is the only thing holding this just below the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “tidal library above the clouds,” brass sundial, crystal window, and atomically reflective surfaces are vivid, integrated images that strongly shape the piece’s atmosphere. World rules (tides of knowledge, chimes marking understanding instead of hours) are consistent and serve the thematic arc. While the environment doesn’t much constrain her physical options, it does conceptually frame her journey from control to coexistence, and recurring objects like the sundial and stone circle meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-rain atmosphere are vividly rendered and strongly integrated with tone and theme (“rising from muddy waters,” “prismatic quiet,” raindrops like prisms). The public art installation is a concrete spatial anchor that the character moves through, and the nest is placed within that environment in a tactile way. The setting mirrors her inner state (washed clean, floating, liminal) without feeling purely decorative. It rarely constrains her choices in a practical sense, so the place is more symbolic crucible than active obstacle, but it charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The university radio station is vividly evoked—vintage equipment, humming studio, blue light, trembling charts—and the atmosphere supports the eerie, secretive tone. The setting’s specifics materially enable the plot (old analog gear that can be modified for subsonic frequencies, late-night solitude). Cosmic alignments and off-world constellations broaden the world without derailing focus. Still, the environment rarely constrains her choices beyond “this is where the gear is,” so it charges mood more than tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean world, narrow tunnels, and the shadowed nexus under starlight are vividly rendered and strongly anchored in Elara’s body (tight spaces, breath, starlight cracks). The nexus meaningfully constrains action: it’s the one place where dimensions thin and starlight can be woven, and the ceiling cracks supply the literal “threads” used by the compass. The glimpse of the new realm (floating islands, two moons) gives a clear, charged contrast to her underground confinement. Some details (runes, “Before Times”) trend familiar rather than startlingly specific, but overall the setting strongly supports atmosphere and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “shadowed quarry in mist” is vividly realized and recurrent—the mist, granite face, and “furrowed hush” establish a mood that suits a long-buried crime. Setting is well-integrated with Elena’s tactile way of perceiving (tracing walls, imagining past light) and returns at the end when the hush lifts with the case’s resolution. Still, the quarry functions more as atmosphere than as a concrete constraint on tactics or choices, so it enriches tone more than it shapes plot.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The experimental weather station, ruined coastline, and humming equipment are specific and grounded, creating a plausible near-future climate context. The copper nail works as a micro-setting object that both carries history and physically interacts with the control panel. However, the wild weather and hostile environment feel more like backdrop than an active constraint on present choices. Still, atmosphere and place are vivid and consistent with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: mountain pullout, pine scent, construction site, and scaffold wrap all filter through Elias’s sensibility and matter to the plot. The scaffold wrap and glass flake become functional world-rules, literally mapping the path between dimensions and charging the final image of wing-like flutters. Sensory detail—light pixelating, winds, birds pausing—supports the uncanny atmosphere without losing spatial clarity. The environment meaningfully shapes his options (there is a specific place and structure he must climb to follow her).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned circus train is a vivid, specific setting whose faded spectacle nicely mirrors Elias’s arc from flash to substance, and details like animal cages turned server rooms are evocative. “Dusky harmony” as an atmospheric tag recurs and the final image of him leaving the train at evening gives the environment a gentle charge. Still, the train doesn’t much constrain choices or tactics; it functions more as metaphorical backdrop than as a pressure-bearing space. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses and physical navigation of the space are underused.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The celestial mapping observatory, glass dome, telescopes, and daylily-pressed telegram give the piece a pleasingly distinctive atmosphere. Setting details are specific enough to feel grounded and are integrated into action, especially when Elara works at the primary telescope and reads variable stars as glyphs. The environment supports the premise but rarely constrains choices or generates pressure—it’s more backdrop than active force. Still, the observatory and sky imagery form a coherent, tonally appropriate frame for the story’s thematic concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “swirling orchard vortex” above a cursed, reflectionless lake is vivid and memorable, with trees whispering secrets and the lake’s surface mirroring her inner search through concentric rings. Setting is not merely decorative: the lake’s lack of reflection ties thematically to “what mirrors don’t show,” and the vortex physically embodies the layered curse she must navigate. Environmental responses to her magic (trees leaning in, lake patterns shifting, vortex calming) keep the space dynamically engaged with the action. Still, the terrain rarely constrains her tactics in concrete, choice-altering ways beyond symbolic alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt glade, blue-tinted grass, and miniature maze create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this world. Blue/cobalt imagery recurs effectively, if somewhat repetitively, to unify the setting and the dreamlike tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or changes options; it mainly decorates and echoes theme. The best integration is the glowing clipping/maze as a liminal object between physical space and dreamscape.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The catacomb orchard of bones and roots is vivid, distinctive, and consistently filtered through Elara’s tactile engagement (tracing roots, kneeling at the First Dreamer). Setting and key object (the oldest tree’s roots cradling bones, the flat stone) directly host the ritual and charge the closing image of restored balance. The atmosphere of half-lit corridors and life-from-death imagery underpins the theme without feeling like a static backdrop. A minor glitch (“укрепed”) and a slight lack of concrete physical constraint keep this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quarry office trailer, heat, struggling AC, and the widening pit outside are vivid and thematically apt, mirroring Marcus’s hollowed-out state and the “echo valley” motif. The occupational and musical details (dump trucks, Marshall expansion period, aluminum threads) feel plausible and well-filtered through his expertise. The setting mostly deepens mood rather than constraining action, so it charges the final image conceptually more than tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic arbor, seed, study, and Pamir setting are vividly and specifically rendered, with details filtered through Elara’s scholarly and scientific mindset. The arbor and seed meaningfully charge the final image, giving the environment a conceptual and emotional weight rather than mere backdrop. However, the settings do more atmospheric than constraining work; the environment doesn’t yet limit tactics or force concrete decisions beyond defining the quest’s destination.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal atrium, titan-gear armor, crystalline ceiling, and cold story-fire are vivid, integrated images that define both world and mood. The water’s rise and fall, and the way books are submerged then return altered, meaningfully echo the identity theme. The environment does exert some pressure—necessitating armor and structuring the ritual—but mostly at a conceptual rather than tactical level. This is strong, atmospheric setting work that stops just short of being fully determinative of on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: concrete corridors, unauthorized passage, crystal caves, the seashell and pearl all form a vivid, coherent atmosphere. The environment is filtered through her professional eye at the start and then tilts into the numinous, nicely mirroring the thematic shift from fear-and-concrete to inner radiance. While the caves don’t strongly constrain her choices, they decisively charge the central images and the final vocation. The recurring hush/light/crystal textures feel purposeful rather than touristic description.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The disused, ivy-choked station, decaying bathroom, and hidden tunnels are vivid and consistently filtered through Elena’s river-obsessed sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the diverted river beneath the platforms and the bathroom walls as illicit archive directly enable her discovery and charge the final image. The object-as-setting function of the accordion on mossy stone alongside the buried river deepens atmosphere and theme. A touch more non-visual sensory texture (smell, temperature, tactility under stress) could push this into exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific, from mist-clad oaks to the organic, doorless library of condensed light, and these details are filtered through the dreamer’s sensibility. Environment and tools actively shape events: the fog’s density gates the library’s appearance, the mist-walls respond to the watch, and the mist clings to their cloak in the final image. World rules (fog threshold, watch as key, library temporality) are consistent and learned through action rather than dumped. The library and mist are not just backdrop but operative constraints, charging the final return to the “ordinary world.”

    The velvet observatory, arctic midsummer light, mulberry drapes, and greenhouse create a vivid, coherent micro-world with strong sensory texture. Environment is not mere backdrop: the arctic light, ice crystal, and greenhouse ecosystem all directly inform the stakes and tactics of propagation and concealment. The recurring objects—ice violin, coffee cup, desert rose—are tightly tied to both mood and plot, especially in the final crystalline-bloom image. Description occasionally leans lush, but it remains purposeful and filtered through Elara’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora borealis, crystalline walls, and drifting clouds are vivid and specific, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is well integrated into action—the aurora “strengthening” her work and refracting through crystals during the peak of the ritual. The sanctuary-like grotto underpins the “radiant hush” tone and charges the final image of a suspended, protective space. It doesn’t quite constrain choices or force tactics, but it clearly shapes mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cedar, the umbral grotto, cloud-floor, and “vineyard hush” create a distinct, consistent atmosphere that feels integral to the piece’s contemplative mode. Details like scallop-shell light, moonstone glow, and cloud pathways are vivid and filtered through Elara’s caretaker sensibility. The setting does more to charge the mood and theme than to constrain concrete options, but the grotto’s liminal nature clearly underpins the rebirth cycle and the final image. Overall, the specificity is strong and purposeful without slipping into incoherent excess.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse, dawn light, breeze, and elevated vantage are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Elian’s professional gaze. Setting and objects (chimes, shard, campfire remnants) are not postcard decor; they’re ritual tools and memory anchors that frame his work and philosophy. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, but it heavily charges mood and the final image of him in his sanctuary, ready to do it all again. World rules feel cohesive, and the space is easy to visualize without excess description.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The floating rock, sycamore hush, and magnetic grotto form a distinct, atmospheric setting that harmonizes with the meditative tone and theme of unseen layers. The environment is integrated into action (the pond, the grotto below, the starlight reveal) rather than offered as pure backdrop. That said, the setting rarely constrains choices or introduces real friction; it mainly decorates and echoes the lesson. Strongly evocative, but it stops short of being fully instrumental in shaping the narrative’s options and costs.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The canyon of endless echoes, bone towers, and dust is vividly realized and consistently filtered through Kael’s reverent perception. Setting is not mere backdrop: echoes, bone towers’ light, and the canyon’s “heart” all participate in the ritual logic and final image. The environment subtly constrains what’s possible—this is a place where sound, stone, and time interweave as a navigation medium. A bit more tactile interaction under pressure could push it higher, but what’s here is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire, crystalline cloud structures, and suspended garden folly are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a marginalized mage in a hyper-ordered world. Setting is not just backdrop: the altitude, cold, and crystalline sterility all echo the standardized magic he’s resisting, while the folly’s grown-not-built feel embodies the lost approach he’s seeking. The keystone’s “lingering luminance” and the spreading “brilliant dimness” at the end charge the environment with thematic weight. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way beyond necessitating mist walking and making unstrapping feel consequential; it’s more symbolic pressure than practical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the deserted pier, abandoned lighthouse, and underwater library all feel specific and atmospheric, with strong, selective sensory detail. The harbor lights, lanterns, and glowing books form a coherent visual system that directly charges the final image of multicolored lamppost flames. World rules for the magical transition (dry in water, portal door) are consistent within the fable-like frame. The environment shapes meaning more than it constrains physical choices, but it does so with memorable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ambered observatory deck, transparent alumina walls, obsidian slab, and coins create a coherent and vivid environment that fits the cosmic stakes. The contracting universe is not just a backdrop; it shapes urgency and provides the visible spectacle that frames every action. The recurring objects (coins, slab, amber light) return in the climax and final image, charging the ending with spatial and visual continuity. Some descriptions lean toward repetition, but overall the setting feels specific, purposeful, and integrated with the scene’s mood.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient observatory is vivid and specific—cracked glass, brass mechanisms, dust, and the damaged lens all interact with his actions and memories. “Scattered light” through the observatory’s optics becomes functionally central to the crystallizing of fears and the final image. The environment is not a backdrop but an active container of history and sacrifice that shapes what he can do (work with stars, maps, and light) and how closure looks. A slight tendency toward repeated atmospheric phrases is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sapphire viaduct, meteor-bell, and “liquid sky” atmosphere are vivid and give the story a strong, specific physical and tonal anchor. Crucially, the setting is not postcard-only: the dripping from the viaduct is the practical mechanism by which he reconstructs the bell. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action (following the dripping rates) rather than pure exposition. The only ceiling here is that beyond the dripping, the environment doesn’t further constrain choices or introduce new pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reservoir, ridgeway, emerging town, and “mirrored hush” create a specific, coherent atmosphere that suits the story’s thematic concerns with reflection and resurfacing history. Environmental details like the silent wind chime, exposed tavern sign, and first sunlight on rooftops recur and charge the final image. The setting is more atmospheric than tactical—Thomas’s options aren’t strongly constrained by space—but the environment clearly shapes perception and meaning. A slightly more tactile use of the landscape to affect his actions would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall are vividly rendered with strong visual specificity, and the environment feels coherent and sensorially rich. Setting details (the blue flame, prismatic spray, starlings overhead) are integrated into action rather than offered as static postcard description. While the place rarely constrains options, the orchard-waterfall axis and the hovering flock do charge the central ritual and final image in a way that feels particular to this world. This is strong atmospheric work, though not yet using environment as a meaningful obstacle or resource under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds, hanging homes, and thin atmosphere create an appealing and distinctive setting that feels coherent. Details like the parachute harness, observation nest, and “cloud sea” are well integrated into the character’s professional focus. However, the scene leans on a narrow band of visual and conceptual imagery, with relatively limited tactile or immediate environmental pressure on specific choices. The world is evocative and publishable-level, but not yet maximally exploited as a constraint or living system.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock dojo amid “clouds and fragments of reality” and the obsidian pedestal with the labeled brain create a vivid, specific atmosphere that suits the metaphysical stakes. The dojo as a pocket of stability within constant temporal flux is an effective conceptual setting choice, and the tremor during the rewrite ties environment to climax. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; it frames and mirrors the conflict more than it forces particular moves. Still, the jar/dojo imagery charges the final image of history rewriting itself with room for “both of them.”

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal haven, Moonshadow Brook, and “storm-born silence” are sensorially vivid and recur in a way that textures the piece. The environment is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, aligning quiet water, darkness, and creativity. However, the setting rarely constrains her options or forces choices; it decorates and echoes theme more than it drives action. The final image is atmospherically charged, but the brook’s role remains symbolic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel, the house on the ridge, the hourglass, and the modified leaf blower create a vivid, atmospheric micro-world that clearly exists to shape sound and memory. The tunnel’s acoustics and the blower as tool aren’t just described; they enable the central tactic and the uncanny echo, and the pull cord reappears in the final image as a cooled, inert anchor. Sensory focus is primarily auditory and tactile, appropriately so, though visual and other senses are more muted. A slight tendency toward abstract description (“thickening the air,” “true haunting”) occasionally blurs the concrete world, but the setting is still strongly realized.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen garden in mist, stone cherub, and crystalline roses under shifting light are vivid and specific, with images that evolve meaningfully as the magic intensifies. The environment mirrors the guardian’s liminal stasis and then participates in the climax (plants radiating light, boundaries of light becoming porous). The final departure explicitly reweights the garden as “another page in the infinite library,” using the setting to charge the closing image. Description is rich without losing spatial or tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ember nexus at twilight and the “frozen bloom” atmosphere are vivid, sensorially specific, and consistently threaded through the piece. Setting clearly mirrors Elias’s internal stasis and later thaw, and the crozier functions as a charged object that carries into the final image. However, the environment is more symbolic container than active constraint; it rarely shapes tactics or limits what he can do beyond mood. Despite that, the place feels distinctive and thematically aligned, supporting the story’s tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The suspended radio-tower city over a mist-filled gorge under lunar perigee is vivid and specific, and the details (rusted antennas, humming towers, gorge wind) create a clear atmosphere. The environment participates lightly in the action—the towers resonate and awaken—but it doesn’t strongly constrain what Elara can or must do. Nonetheless, the setting is visually memorable and thematically aligned with broadcast, reception, and suspended endings. The sense of place is a major strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor, vanishing ferry, and especially the spectral grotto (“stalactites of frozen time,” “waters below contained the memories”) are vivid and tonally coherent. Setting is not just backdrop: the grotto and its rule (“when clocks run sideways”) are the only place/condition where the merge is possible, so they meaningfully constrain events. The recurring hourglass functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Some details are more decorative than pressured, but overall atmosphere is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The optical illusion gallery and sinew thread are vividly sketched, with breathing walls, twisting illusions, and pulsing dream-material that establish a coherent, eerie environment. Setting and atmosphere are thematically apt—the space itself becomes a “living entity,” mirroring the story’s interest in shared consciousness. The environment does participate in the climax (illusions reflecting inner landscapes; the tapestry as literal bridge), though it still feels more like a wondrous backdrop than a constraint that forces hard choices. Sensory range leans heavily visual, but the specificity and integration are solid at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The benthic city and bioluminescent algae provide a vivid, specific atmosphere, and the three-mile depth meaningfully relates to the starlight-navigation problem. The anchor chain link works as a recurring micro-setting object that charges the final image. Still, much of the environment is described in generalized, lyrical terms rather than used tactically in scene, and the city’s physical constraints rarely force concrete choices on the page. The world feels intriguing and coherent, but a bit “postcard” in its lack of lived-in interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight garden, and stone bench are vivid and tonally consistent, giving the story a distinct atmospheric frame. The decades-old hearing aid functions as a key tool-object, shaping perception and charging the final image when its pulses finally calm. While the setting mostly serves mood rather than materially constraining tactics, it does reinforce the liminal, threshold quality of her work in a concrete way. The specificity is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: salt-stained concrete, humming overhead pipes, the access cylinder, and the undersea cables all create a strong atmospheric locus. The forgotten facility and shifting tide window do constrain what’s possible—she must operate underground within a narrow temporal corridor. Details are filtered effectively through Elara’s perspective as a practiced, uneasy spelunker, avoiding museum-tour description. The environment also charges the final image, with the reclaimed shoreline and “sacred silence between” waves echoing the liminal work below.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal observatory under snow, the cold storage chamber, and the ink-lit telescope plate create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that’s consistently filtered through the narrator’s awareness. The environment supports the liminal theme—snow globe isolation, aurora-like colors, the body chamber as reliquary—but it rarely constrains choices or alters tactics. The porcelain shard and ink plate function as micro-setting elements that do some charging of the final image. Strong, vivid atmosphere is present, though not fully weaponized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bone towers, canyon of endless echoes, and tunnel of echoes are vivid, memorable, and integrated into the core mechanics of the story. The environment isn’t just decorative; it enables his method and charges the final image when the bone towers “hum in harmony” with the reborn language. Sensory specificity is strong and consistent with the world’s strange logic. At this length, the setting’s integration into both process and closure is of publishable caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground herbalist’s garden is vivid and specific—moon-petal flowers, star-vine, ceiling roots with gremlins shifting from stone to flesh—and clearly filtered through Aris’s trained yet awed perception. World rules (gravity-playful gremlins, lunar influence, bioluminescent mushrooms) are consistent and discovered in-scene rather than dumped. The environment shapes the story’s logic and tone, even if it doesn’t quite force a tactical choice. The final comparison of hope to a hardy perennial roots the ending back into setting in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and thematically charged: the sky-bridge, copper-colored sky, crystalline fruit, and living statues all carry a coherent atmosphere of tarnished magic within machinery. Environment tactically shapes action—Elayn must move down from the bridge, pass statues, and negotiate the orchard to reach and remove the sapling. Details like “roots glowing with captured moonlight” and gears blooming into flowers strongly integrate world-building with thematic stakes. A bit more sensory variety and lived-in texture around the mechanical city could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt arcade, neon blue light, smuggling checkpoint, and rain-soaked streets create a vivid, specific world with strong atmospheric control. The bottled storm and shifting weather are integrated as environmental motifs that mirror and charge the emotional stakes, especially in the final image of the girl falling asleep to the thunderstorm. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s professional eye (routes, blind spots, guards’ uniforms), giving the space functional weight. The environment shapes tactics lightly rather than constraining a sharp, on-page choice, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the overgrown field, rusting circus train, and lush, impossible oasis create a strong atmospheric contrast that supports theme. Details like the carousel horses, broken windows, and fruit of “impossible colors” feel imagistically rich and integrated rather than touristic. The world’s magical rules (halo fragment → door → oasis; bells → animated light-creatures/carousel) stay consistent and unfold through action. The environment frames and colors the choice to sing but doesn’t sharply constrain it, which keeps this just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “scientific poetry library” is vividly and economically rendered, with concrete sensory anchors (old paper, dawn light, silent aisles) and a strong conceptual texture. Setting and object-as-setting (the scarf, the hyperbolic gateway of books) are integrated into action rather than appended description. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, as the entire library has been subtly rearranged by narrative resonance. A bit more tactile interaction with shelves/space under pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The whispering archipelago, the 3 a.m. library, and the dawn headland are vividly sketched and tonally integrated with the story’s preoccupation with liminal states and quiet communication. Details like the library basement studio and the islands “holding their breath” help embed setting in character experience. However, the environment rarely constrains or reconfigures choices; it’s more a beautifully painted backdrop than an active pressure. The world’s magic (whispering islands, alchemical light) is consistent but could influence tactics more directly to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crossroads/nexus under twilight and starlight is vivid and atmospherically strong, with details like the spinning compass and “space between heartbeats” giving the setting functional weight. The environment meaningfully frames and enables the ritual rather than serving as mere backdrop. The mental chamber with a “captured star” continues this spatial logic in the psychic realm, keeping the world’s rules consistent. It stops just short of greatness because the environment rarely constrains choices beyond providing an evocative stage.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks, the half-buried hulls, and the fairy ring under broken constellations are vivid, specific, and atmospherically strong. Setting is not just decorative: the fairy ring’s location and the visible sky above directly enable the constellation alignment, and the shipwrecks recur in the theft-vision and the closing “sigh” image. Environmental details stay coherent and charged through to the end, with the place clearly functioning as a liminal archive. The only limitation is that the environment rarely constrains her tactics beyond providing the magical configuration she needs.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The library is vivid and specific (“Case of Slumbering Histories,” “Wall of Whispering Shadows,” dust, arched windows), and the shard-mirrors and moving shadow are integrated into action rather than tacked-on description. The setting feels inherently tied to the occupation and mood: exile, fragmentation, and memory are all embodied in place. However, the environment rarely constrains choices; it colors and echoes the theme more than it forces tactics, which keeps the setting powerful atmospherically but not fully weaponized. The final image of lengthening shadows and sanctuary does nicely charge the space with emotional meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The waterfall, moss, mist, and “verdant parapet” are vividly rendered and recur throughout, with sensory integration that suits the lyric mode. Setting and atmosphere are closely tied to the ritual—the waterfall’s “persistence” is literally drawn into the seed, and the final image of sun behind the falls recharges prior imagery. That said, the environment rarely constrains choice or creates practical pressure; it is more altar than obstacle. Strong textural setting work, but not yet using place as a decisive lever on action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight, crystalline walls, and fractured rainbows are vividly rendered and recur in the final image (“patterns on the floor that looked like mended masks”), nicely charging the thematic arc of brokenness and repair. Setting is integrated into Elena’s perception rather than feeling like a tourist catalog, and the net’s placement in the corner reads spatially clean. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics; the same ritual could largely occur elsewhere, so its role is more atmospheric than determinative. Still, as micro-setting and charged backdrop, it is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault and the damaged ceiling create a strong, memorable atmosphere that thematically mirrors eroded and erased knowledge. The recurring rain and fresco imagery frame both opening and ending, charging the final act of repairing the map with symbolic weight. The wider landscape and celestial setting around the henge are sketched economically but clearly enough to support the cosmic turn. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain her choices in a practical sense, but it meaningfully colors the stakes and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library is vividly evoked, and details like pressure preserving history and water pressing against reinforced windows are thematically and atmospherically apt. The snow globe functions as a charged micro-setting, echoed in the macro sea, and directly powers the final image of the empty sky. Environmental elements (water as barrier, pressure, glass, preserved books) are tightly interwoven with the ideas of death and transition. This setting feels specific, textured, and meaningfully inseparable from the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The misty courtyard, lightning/thunder liminal window, and shifting graffiti walls are vivid, distinctive, and tonally cohesive with the piece’s lyric aims. The environment functions as more than a postcard: it is the exclusive site of their meeting and is bound to specific conditions (storms, the moment between lightning and thunder). However, beyond gating access, the setting rarely constrains tactics or generates additional pressure; it’s a beautiful stage rather than an active complicating force. Still, the specificity and recurrence give the final image genuine atmospheric charge.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, scattered light, elevator, and observation deck are vividly rendered and tied to the core mechanism of decoding through refracted light. The setting feels specific and integrated, especially the crystalline walls mirroring the coded text. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her physical options, it meaningfully charges the imagery and the final vantage point “above the clouds.” World rules are coherent enough for this length, and details stay focused rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the isolated sky gondola, vast atmosphere, and specific cloud types are filtered convincingly through an aviation meteorologist’s attention. Environmental details (twilight light, swaying gondola, creaks, brass telescope) consistently mirror her liminal emotional state between earth/sky, isolation/connection. The “dusty starlight” ambience coheres and culminates in the final image of twilight enveloping the gondola and flaring on the telescope, clearly charging the closure. The gondola’s precariousness could more concretely constrain her options, but as a micro-setting it still strongly shapes tone and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tree-trunk library and its carved leaf ceiling, moonlight constellations, and hidden floor compartment are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Elara’s pattern-focused gaze. The setting is not just decorative: the organic wood grain enables the hidden indentation, and the hollowed tree’s age and stillness thematically mirror her work with deep time and memory. Demolition preparations and the pre-dawn quiet charge the atmosphere and inflect the final moments. The environment does not radically constrain options mid-scene, but it strongly charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.0)
    The antique airship, hopscotch board, stranded luminance, and starlings create a distinctive, atmospheric tableau that feels unified. These elements recur and do charge the final image, especially the board-as-key and light-as-guide. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or imposes real limits—it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual, with little embodied, tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “frozen library above clouds” and “hall of mirrors” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s craft-focused gaze. Setting evolves with events—the ice on bookshelves melting and mirrors shivering in response to the clockwork heart’s repair makes the environment actively participate in closure. Tools and environment feel like an integrated micro-ecosystem, not a backdrop. The final image of the transformed hall of mirrors charged with ancestral faces is especially strong.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“orchard planet,” “floating rock arches,” and “nebula of respite” create a memorable atmosphere that fits the gentle, quasi-mythic tone. Worldbuilding remains consistent and is woven through the story rather than dumped, with nice touches like arches later becoming monuments. However, most environmental elements are scenic rather than constraining; aside from the bell-as-tool, the world rarely shapes tactics or limits options. The setting charges the final images symbolically but doesn’t quite become an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, ocean, and clock are vividly rendered with strong, specific sensory texture (“pane of hush,” bruised colors, threads of fractured starlight). Setting is not mere backdrop: the hush and architecture shape the method (whispers, vibrations) and charge the final image of the sweeping beam. The recurring objects (puppet head, spindle, beam) all bear increasing weight toward closure. World rules are consistent within the poetic frame and feel lived-in rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    The cursed orchard, cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and night frost are vivid enough to ground the world, and the environment constrains choices (maze paths, frost deadline, need for stealth). The orchard and the device-in-tree recur to charge the ending image. That said, description sometimes leans on familiar fantasy shorthand (“ancient stone walls,” “twisted trees”) rather than sharply particularized detail. The setting supports atmosphere and plot well, but lacks the textural singularity expected at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The braided ravine and river foam are well-realized and deeply integrated into Elara’s perception; the setting is not generic and is consistently filtered through her chemist/musical mind. Environmental elements (braided channels, foam patterns, chrysalis) strongly charge the thematic arc and final images. The lab is sketched more lightly but still functions as a meaningful counterpoint. The setting doesn’t physically constrain choices, but it does productively constrain her thinking and realization, which is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the standout strength: the glass orchard library, bottled moonlight, cloud-sea, and glass birds are vivid, specific, and repeatedly engaged through action. World rules—floating between worlds, access only for those who’ve lost something—are embedded in concrete details rather than exposition. Environment and recurring objects (bottles, shards, trees) directly shape what the vendor can do at the climax, and they charge the final image of “mindfully scattered pieces of countless narrative possibilities.” Description occasionally verges on lushness, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The desert after rain, tidal pools, and coral-ice pavilion are vivid, textured, and sensorially specific, with a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is integrated into the premise (rare rain enabling tidal pools and the pavilion’s rise) rather than feeling like detachable wallpaper. Spatial and environmental logic remain clear, and the coral icebound architecture complements the theme of crystallized remorse. The final emergence scene underuses the physical environment somewhat, leaning more on abstract emotional summary than charged setting detail.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The astronomical clock tower, library, and grain silos are clearly and attractively sketched, and the recurring image of the clock weight ties setting to theme at the end. Details like the “borrowed starlight” and refurbished meeting area create a coherent atmosphere that fits the story’s gentle earnestness. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more symbolic backdrop than active pressure. The final image of the tower and weight does charge the ending, but mostly at a conceptual rather than situational level.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit canyon and fractured mirror are vividly and consistently rendered, with strong visual motifs (silver light, shadows, refractions) that align with the entangled-memory premise. The setting is well integrated into the atmosphere and final image: the mirror’s fragmentation and the canyon’s liminal night-to-dawn transition echo the internal transformation. However, the environment rarely constrains physical choices or tactics—it’s more atmospheric than operative. That keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The “serpentine grotto in mist,” glowing runes, rainwater chamber, and moonlit aperture provide a distinct, coherent atmosphere that suits the premise. Details are mostly visual, with limited tactile or auditory specificity, and the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond serving as a corridor to the chamber. The mist and curving passages guide her but never meaningfully impede or endanger her, so the setting feels more like an evocative backdrop than an active pressure source. Still, the recurrence of mist and luminous markings does tie into the story’s conceptual fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The siskin alder grove, the fog, the statue half-swallowed by roots, and the insulator’s rainbows are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment reinforces the world’s Silence and her task, and the grove plus sculpture function as a micro-setting that literally contains the “memory” she must access. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does charge the final image of quiet redemption in a way that feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic nexus at twilight, the charged air, and the mountains are vivid and consistently present, not white-room abstractions. The environment meaningfully constrains events—the timing of the phase, the magnetic patterns used in the final act, the prison/sanctuary duality—rather than being mere backdrop. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual; more tactile or auditory specifics could deepen atmosphere. The recurring worry stone functions effectively as a micro-setting object charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The workshop under stars, crystals, tuning forks, and the impending fireworks create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting details are purposeful—tools are not mere backdrop but instruments in the central action, and the external fireworks parallel her internal “vibrational” work in the final image. However, the environment mostly colors and mirrors rather than constrains her choices; the workshop is a sanctuary, not a forcing ground. The result is rich and specific, but still a step below settings that actively pressure tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The treetop village, rope bridges, mists, and “wildflower hush” create a cohesive, sensory-rich atmosphere, with scent in particular tightly tied to both character and world. The environment suits the theme of hidden wisdom in living systems and gives a plausible context for a high, secluded research perch. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or forces different tactics; it functions more as evocative backdrop than as an active pressure. The final image of village lights like “stars brought to earth” nicely echoes the earlier elevated, canopy-focused imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific: inverted rivers as “aerial roads,” floating arches of differing sizes, and orchards lifting during gravity reversal all create a strong, coherent atmosphere. These details are integrated with action—he literally rides the Silvergard River and threads between drifting arches—rather than existing as static description. World rules around inversion stay consistent and are learned through observation and navigation. The environment does shape tactics, though it could impose more constraint or danger to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The port’s “towering labyrinth of shipping containers” is vivid and specific, and the way it channels wind and creates “metal canyons” is meaningfully tied to the core mystery. Spatial sense stays coherent as she moves, climbs, and surveys, and the silence of the town reinforces the uncanny mood. The environment actively underpins the investigative method by shaping airflow rather than serving as backdrop. While the setting doesn’t hard-constrain a specific final choice, it clearly structures what she can notice and infer.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glacial cathedral, crystalline ceiling, and aurora-fed light are vividly rendered and integrated with the action of ringing prism-bells. Setting details (ice walls, refracted light and sound) meaningfully shape the atmosphere and visual logic of the ritual and final hush. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or imposes risk; it mainly functions as exalted backdrop. The final image of the cavern “blossoming” into a new kind of sound is strong but still more decorative than determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Thunder-echo range is vividly realized—“avalanchingly quiet,” canyon hush, telluric energies, driftwood stream—and consistently filtered through Eldrin’s ritual purpose. Environment and object-as-setting (flute, driftwood) actively shape the magic system by explaining how sound and silence can thin reality. The final image of him carrying the canyon hush within him shows the setting reconfigured into an interior state, charging the ending. A slight excess of similar phrasing aside, the atmosphere is specific, coherent, and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The letterpress shop, topaz walls, skylight, and starfield are vivid and integrated, shaping the piece’s dreamy-scientific atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elara’s priorities (type cases, equations, the halo fragment), which keeps the description purposeful rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does charge the final image of the “topaz workshop suspended between stars.” Overall, the environment substantially enriches tone and theme even if its tactical impact is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, snow, and village lights create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the environment is nicely echoed in the pendant’s shimmer and the green shoots emerging in her wake. Setting details are well chosen and filtered through Ayla’s task and the pendant’s responses rather than reading like a static backdrop. The worldbuilding around “across the fade from memory to myth” and the solstice garden is evocative, though more atmospheric than constraining. The setting charges the final image conceptually but rarely forces concrete tactical choices beyond the shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and dawn light are vividly rendered and recur in ways that support mood and theme; the arbor’s “shifted hush” and the pillars’ glow during the climax are particularly effective. The environment is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a mystic-researcher. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it does charge the final image of her leaving the arbor with new purpose. Overall, atmosphere is rich and specific without lapsing into clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bamboo forest, forgotten orchard, and abandoned market are vivid and tonally coherent, with green-gold light and mossy floors providing a strong atmospheric through-line. Setting details integrate reasonably well into action—walking through groves, arranging puzzle pieces on moss, confronting a single ancient bamboo shoot. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (the etched bamboo taking the message and re-humming the world), though it rarely constrains tactics beyond being a mystical landscape. The world’s rules around silence and the bead feel internally consistent for the level of lyric compression used.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet and floating azure arches are vivid, economical, and consistently threaded through the story, from first paragraph to final image. Setting is not just decorative: falling asteroids create the central problem and the arch supports define the public test of Orion’s gift. The abandoned mine shafts serve as a concrete, atmospheric workspace that matches his marginal status and the “enter darkness to bring forth light” motif. A bit more sensory texturing beyond light and distance could elevate it further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly introduced—dust motes, frozen tools, shafts of light—giving a clear visual and tonal anchor. The alternate uses of the space (busy port, hospital, gallery) effectively widen the sense of multiversal history. The setting partially constrains choice via the impossible door that appears only in a dream timeline. Still, the environment mostly serves as atmosphere and frame rather than an active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, island, fog, and lantern room are evoked with vivid, selective sensory detail (“smelled of salt, oil, and something else—something like the pause between thunderclaps”), and the environment feels fully inhabited by a working skipper. Setting is not merely scenic: the tower’s isolation and vibration, the hollow beneath the floorboard, and the view of the shrinking tower on the horizon all charge the emotional stakes. Recurring environmental objects (lamp, stones, sea glass, vial of seawater) meaningfully color the final image. A slightly stronger interplay between weather/sea conditions and his tactical choices during the outage could raise the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The emerald lighthouse, aurora-fed glass wick, and emerald beam painting paths on the water are vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through Elara’s working attention. Setting is not just backdrop: the lighthouse’s height, optics, and manuscripts actively enable her tactics and frame the world’s post-collapse isolation. World rules (total internal reflection, aurora energy, manuscripts from before the Digital Age) are stable and legible even in their strangeness. The environment does constrain choice—her entire role and the way she helps refugees is bound to this place and its technology—which charges the final image of her at the wick.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock tea house, rope ladder, valley mists, prisms, and sun trails are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the protagonist’s methods and worldview. Setting is not just backdrop: altitude, light, and isolation are functionally necessary for tracking sun paths, collecting dew, and routing light through seven prisms to create the pivotal dye. The blue morpho wing as a recurring object charges both the laboratory atmosphere and the final image of transformation and truth. The environment consistently mirrors and supports the thematic concern with iridescence and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the stormlit astronomy tower, labyrinth, ancient oak floorboard, and moonlight are all sensorially concrete and filtered through Samuel’s occupational knowledge. Environment and tools—especially the tower acoustics and the specific moonbeam on a scarred board—directly shape the key event, not just the mood. The contrast between external storm and internal stillness reinforces the thematic sanctuary frame without feeling pasted-on. This integration of object, space, and final image is strong enough to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, phosphorescent flora, mica window, and mirror world are vividly rendered with strong visual atmosphere. Details like starlight fruit and silver-jade leaves build a coherent, distinctive environment. The setting supports theme and tone but rarely constrains concrete choices beyond being the locus where weaving occurs. The window’s reflective change at the end nicely charges the final image without quite becoming a decisive constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The secret society library is a strong conceptual setting with the “hidden in plain sight” detail aligning neatly with the theme of paradox. However, the atmosphere leans on abstractions (“extraordinary knowledge,” “enlarged tranquility”) rather than textured sensory specifics, so the place feels more symbolic than lived-in. Spatial and situational anchors are clear (between café and vacant storefront, chamber beneath). The setting supports the thematic frame, but it rarely constrains choice or action in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The overgrown palace courtyard, secret tea house, and guerrilla gardens are vividly rendered and sensorially specific, with details like wild sage, mint, and rain on the tin roof creating a strong atmosphere. Setting is tightly tied to character—Eliza’s noticing and caretaking are expressed through how she inhabits these spaces—and the garden and tea house recur meaningfully in the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it does charge the ending with a lived-in, reclaimed sacredness.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “frozen library above the clouds” and “quartz hush” are vivid, coherent, and recur in ways that clearly shape atmosphere. Setting details like ice-encrusted windows, brass-and-crystal devices, and crystalline prisons are filtered through Elias’s professional focus and support the ethereal, quiet tone. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of him working in this suspended sanctuary against oblivion. World rules around vows and tools are internally consistent and economically conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly sketched, with creaking wood, hush, and hidden commerce that all support the illicit, liminal atmosphere. Setting details like the “truce of hush” and the secret back room with Malachi are integrated into the action rather than standing as postcard description. The environment constrains choices somewhat (secret market, dawn deadline, no-blood truce) but is not pushed to its full tactical potential. Still, the space feels coherent and contributes meaningfully to tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and “forest elections” are vivid, idiosyncratic, and sensorially rich, with taste-based atmosphere giving the setting real texture. The convergence point is not just decorative; it’s where energies meet, the ring activates, and the storm man arrives, so place and sky concretely charge the turning point and final image. The repeated voting/election metaphors integrate environment with theme rather than reading as pasted-on. A bit of conceptual stacking skirts excess, but overall the world feels distinct and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid, sensorial, and tied tightly to Rhodes’s inner life—the “auroral sorrow,” amethyst clusters, and crystal veins mirror his buried creativity. The environment meaningfully affects the outcome by revealing the hidden blues in the charcoal under this specific mineral light, which charges both the theme and final image. Details are mostly well integrated into action and interiority rather than feeling like a catalogue. A bit of repetition in the cave’s emotional labeling slightly blunts its sharpness but doesn’t harm orientation or effect.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse city beneath a toxic sky is vivid and specific, from weak filtration hum to warped floorboards, and it’s all filtered convincingly through a plant-and-text-obsessed artisan. The environment meaningfully constrains options (failed air systems, avoided sectors) and charges the final image of her packing beneath the “toxic sky” glow. World rules (post-collapse, filtration, postal ruins) feel internally consistent and integrated rather than dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The whispering bluff above the clouds, the bell tower, and the glowing iceberg fragment together create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that strongly supports the story’s tone and premise. Details like colors corresponding to frequencies and the communities below reading the tower’s colors as language meaningfully embed world rules. The environment doesn’t so much constrain specific tactical choices as it frames the whole mode of life and communication. Still, the recurring image of the sculpture atop the bluff, visible across seasons, powerfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm and destabilized magnetosphere are vivid, specific, and tightly bound to the stakes: radiation threatens the roses, the dome shudders, petals dim, and the environment forces action. The world’s rules (protective field, bio-luminescent roses, electromagnetic sky) remain consistent and are learned through events rather than exposition dumps. The final images—miniature androids rooted in soil, revitalized roses, the glowing box—are strongly charged by the setting. A bit more non-visual sensory texture could have pushed this higher, but what’s here is efficient and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    The shop, courtyard at dawn, and defunct post office are sketched with a few effective images (“painted the benches and fountains in gold”) that establish a gentle, communal atmosphere. However, these places remain fairly generic and postcard-like; they rarely constrain action, expose character, or complicate choices. The locket functions more as a symbolic object than the settings do as lived environments. The final image in the shop window uses space decently but could lean more on concrete, sensory detail to deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sunken laboratory is sketched with evocative, selective details—coral-encrusted corners, dripping pipes, filtered sunlight—that create a tangible atmosphere. The environment feels lived-in and thematically apt for buried knowledge and isolation. However, the setting rarely constrains options or changes tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The hangman’s dice and consoles contribute as micro-setting objects, but again mainly symbolically.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor, lighthouse quarters, salt crystal chamber, and beached whale form a cohesive, atmospheric setting that’s both tactile and thematically loaded. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the chamber’s amplification of gravity pockets, the immovable whale, and the buried crystal all constrain and enable her choices. Details like “geometric crystals climbed the walls like frozen light” and the recurring dock lanterns effectively charge the opening and closing images. A slight reason for not going higher is that the physical resistance and danger of the anomalous zone remain relatively mild on the page, leaving some potential environmental pressure untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    The nocturnal brook, moonlight, and “haven” are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the piece a clear atmospheric container that suits the ritual. The water and stars participate in the action modestly (mirroring his heartbeat, carrying the crane away) and contribute to the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or creates friction; it primarily soothes and aestheticizes. Strong mood work lifts this, but the setting doesn’t quite become a decisive agent in the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    Settings are vivid and specific—the cluttered study, historic district, and rooftop garden under a meteor shower all carry clear images and a coherent mood. The skyline “like constellations on earth” and the faintly glowing seal under meteoric light are strong atmospheric touches. That said, the environments mostly frame the relationship rather than constraining choices or action; the rooftop meteor shower is thematically apt but not strictly necessary to the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet garden at twilight is vivid and sensorially suggestive (velvet moss, blooms bowing at dawn) and tonally aligned with the liminal, mystical mood. The seashell and crystals function almost as micro-settings/tools and are well integrated into the action of the ritual. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it’s more a stage of beauty and reverence than an active pressure. The transformation of the garden at dawn nicely charges the final image, but the same arc could mostly occur in any secluded magical space.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and stained glass create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that reflects Elias’s isolation and penitence. Setting details are purposeful: the “prison” sanctuary under shifting aurora becomes the charged backdrop for his moral reversal, and the outside world at dawn contrasts his long confinement. The heritage rose thorn and crystal, while technically objects, function as part of the environment and strongly charge the final image. The setting is more atmospheric than constraining, but it meaningfully frames and deepens his choices and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, starlight, and stone create a consistent, gently haunting atmosphere that pairs well with the echo conceit. The recurring physical details (canyon walls, shell on a flat stone, non-star/sun light) contribute to tone and give the ending image some charge. Still, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it functions mostly as lyrical backdrop rather than an active pressure. Sensory range leans heavily visual and metaphoric, missing chances to make the space feel truly inhabited and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater wreck, coral-encrusted beams, and the glacier-carved, candle-lit shrine create a distinct, atmospheric world with strong visual specificity. The melted snow globe functions as a charged object that anchors both setting and final image. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or choices beyond mood (Elara could do this work in many places), but it does color perception and tone effectively. Sensory detail leans heavily visual, yet the “voice like the sound of ice forming” hints at a richer, more embodied palette the story only partially exploits.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is richly realized: the river cabin, humid firefly nights, moss-covered parapet after rain, and moon paths all feel tactile and integrated with his perception. Environmental details (wet stones whispering, fireflies as fallen constellations, nets in moonlight) mirror and reinforce his thematic focus on hidden patterns. The parapet vantage and weather condition (after rain) lightly constrain his ritual, though they function more as charged atmosphere than hard logistical pressure. The final images—nets in dawn light, tea whisk, remembered moon paths—are strongly charged by place.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wasteland orchard, glowing soil, radioactive dust storms, and central pedestal with the flawed diamond are vivid and thematically apt, with the environment clearly tied to the story’s core mystery. The orchard’s impossible flourishing and the storm-charged barrier at the end charge the final image and directly relate to the stillpoint’s function. Still, the sensory palette leans heavily visual; further integration of bodily or non-visual detail under pressure could deepen atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stormlit observatory, floatstone mountain, and cobalt glass portico are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s technical-devotional gaze. Environment plausibly shapes his isolation and the difficulty of reaching him (airships, brief calms), and the portico meaningfully channels the storms into legible patterns. Weather and altitude are not mere backdrop; they’re bound to the core method of prophecy. Still, the setting seldom forces immediate tactical decisions in-scene, which keeps it from feeling fully indispensable at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes, jars of sound, and the tarnished music box create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the story’s gentle magic realism. Details like “dust motes dancing” and the abandoned amusement park lend tactile specificity filtered through the poet’s sensibility. The senior center is sketched more generically but still clear enough to hold the climax. Environment rarely constrains choice or tactics, though the jars and box do charge the final image, which keeps this solid but shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drift-ice marina, twilight, and lighthouse interior are vividly rendered, with concrete, atmospheric details (“frozen seaweed,” “cracked like distant bones,” dust motes, carved stone door). Setting is well filtered through Elias’s professional lens (sonar, vibrational frequencies, fog warning system) and underpins the sonic ritual’s plausibility. The environment does constrain the choice in that the lighthouse’s physical and acoustic properties matter for the ritual, though the marina itself is more atmospheric than functional. The final image of a serene marina under stars and the wandering intruders’ boat gives the place a charged calm after storm.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and sensorially grounded; images like the lake as “polished obsidian mirror” and the wind’s “haunting melodies” do real atmospheric work. Setting is not just backdrop: the frozen lake’s surface and the viaduct’s post-rain magnetism explicitly underpin the mapper’s method and the timing of the revolution. The environment charges the final images (lake as amplifier, viaduct as pilgrimage site) and coheres tonally. At the same time, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices under pressure, so its influence remains more conceptual than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is concretely evoked through dampness, pooled water, mildew, and the sense of enclosed space, and these conditions plausibly support the maintenance-failure premise. The lantern as object-setting is strongly integrated, both historically and in the final image, charging the last beat with layered meaning. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond basic navigation and observation; the tunnel’s physical hazards don’t significantly shape choices on the page. Overall, specificity is good and atmosphere fits the tone, but there’s room for the setting to bear more narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The repair shop is vivid and textured—the “dusty window,” “soft ticking of unseen mechanisms,” and “vibrant hush” all create a strong sense of place. The environment and objects (music boxes, ballerina, stained-glass light) aptly echo his internal state and charge the final image of departing into overlapping melodies. That said, the setting rarely constrains concrete options; it mainly supports theme and tone rather than shaping what he can or cannot do. Still, as micro-world and mood engine it’s effective and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The workshop above an acid sea, the brass and steam, and the kaleidoscope device are vivid and coherent, with strong visual specificity and a consistent aesthetic. Environmental details occasionally matter—acid fumes stiffening gears, the sea pausing at the bell’s note—so the world is not purely decorative. The setting strongly supports tone and theme, framing the glider’s quest as a tiny act in a vast, dangerous world. Some sensory range beyond the visual and mechanical would deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “social network archive” as a “digital necropolis” is a strong atmospheric frame, with restricted sectors and grayed-out interfaces that concretely shape Elara’s options and risks. The recurring Stellaris patch and the hidden coordinates give the setting a layered, investigative feel rather than a white-room abstraction. At times the diction leans generic-cyber-gothic (“ghosts in the machine,” “malevolent eyes”), which dilutes distinctiveness. Still, the environment meaningfully constrains choice (access levels, timers, alarms) and charges the final image of her escape.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse orchard above the ice floes is vivid and specific, with strong visual and textural details (gnarled trees, diamond-like branches, groaning ice) that create a memorable atmosphere. The vintage mirrors and their differing eras add layered worldbuilding filtered through Elena’s perspective. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her tactical options, it does charge the magic and final image of her holding the crystal against the stark seascape. Overall, setting feels purposeful and texturally rich without devolving into a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly and consistently rendered—cracking ice, trapped boats, frigid water—and it clearly mirrors the thematic concern with endings and thawing. The heirloom parasol tip as a recurring object anchors her physically and charges the final image. While the environment shapes mood more than literal choices, the ice’s early breakup and its sounds meaningfully color her evolving stance on death and change.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, autumn leaves, and vacant bus station are clearly evoked and threaded throughout, creating a consistent melancholic atmosphere. The recurring pavilion and station images do charge the solitude and end-of-day feeling that underpins the piece. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it mostly serves as backdrop and metaphor. A bit more tactile engagement or consequence from the setting would raise this for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vivid, specific, and integrated into action rather than mere backdrop. The environment meaningfully participates—the walls murmuring and then falling silent, the parapet resonating and storing wisdom, and the conjured clearing altering the space. Details are selective and tonally coherent, if leaning a bit on the abstract and visual. The setting feels like a real, rule-bound place in this world, though it rarely constrains choice in a sharp, tactical way.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vivid, specific, and recur throughout, with sensory detail that supports the decay/renewal theme. The environment mirrors the emotional project (“a blend of decay and renewal that mirrored her work in collective healing”) and reappears in the closing image of vines climbing and the factory seeming more resilient. However, the setting is largely atmospheric; it does not materially constrain choices or tactics in the scene. Still, as a charged backdrop it’s stronger than average and contributes to the story’s mood and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shadowed library, dawn light, dust, and the lone fallen chandelier crystal create a strong, cohesive atmosphere that aligns with the story’s meditative tone. The setting is filtered through the scholar’s priorities—books as “scriptures,” the library as “cathedral,” the hush as “potential.” The crystal functions as a tool/object-as-setting that directly mediates his work and charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t constrain his choices much, it powerfully frames and deepens them.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fog sculpture garden is vivid and coherent: fog, metal sculptures, driftwood, and the arch all work together atmospherically and conceptually. Environment does modestly constrain tactics—the fog motivates directional markers, the arch is a specific physical locus for the quest—but the scene never really tests those constraints under pressure. Recurring objects (driftwood, arch, fog) are well-integrated and color perception through a clear mood. The setting feels more like a beautifully rendered stage than an active adversary.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar observatory above the clouds, the observation deck, the clouds like “waves,” and the small golden clock together create a vivid, consistent environment. Setting is not mere backdrop: the elevation, silence, and external deck directly shape Elara’s tactic to isolate and hear the clock’s resonance. World rules (quantum chronometers, perception filters) feel coherent enough for this length and are learned through action. A touch more sensory breadth or environmental constraint during the peak tremors could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Cloudcrest Hospice “above the clouds,” the semi-circle of chairs, the lavender-and-cedar “scent of hope,” and the vinyl fragment create a vivid, coherent physical and emotional environment. Details stay firmly in the therapist’s sensory and professional frame, and the recurring aroma and the vinyl piece charge the final moments rather than serving as decoration. However, the fantastical “radiant haven above the clouds” remains largely atmospheric; it doesn’t actively constrain action beyond mood. The strength lies in integrated motifs rather than tactical use of space.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly realized and functionally integrated: rune stones, telescope, and the trembling isle all participate in the central action. Details like the telescope pointed at the midday sun in surrounding darkness and the isle vibrating under energy flows deepen atmosphere rather than feeling decorative. The setting constrains method (she must move between specific stones; the dais holds the key) and evolves with events (becoming a beacon between worlds). It could go a step further by exerting more direct pressure or hazard, but it already operates above mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly imagined—upside-down blooms, firefly-lit plants, perpetual twilight—and tightly aligned to tone. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the hidden, self-sustaining garden plausibly houses the liminal ritual space where realities can be aligned. The recurring objects (tooth, moonpetals) are embedded in this environment and charge key beats, especially the exchange moment. While the maze itself doesn’t significantly constrain tactics on the page, the garden as micro-world strongly shapes atmosphere and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, sea, and cliffside workshop are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s gaze, creating a cohesive, tactile atmosphere. Setting and recurring objects (sea glass, grotto walls) are not mere postcards: the grotto’s surfaces and the glass’s interaction with starlight are what enable the projections and define the sanctuary’s function. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of a transformed grotto as a “circle of connection.” A slight bias toward visual detail over other senses is the only modest limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid, specific, and threaded through nearly every paragraph, with servers, keyboards, vines, and glass all participating in the emotional texture. Setting actively charges choices: her careful movement over creaking glass, the mossy keyboard receiving the pendant, and the months-later moss-enveloped amber all bind environment to inner change. The tech-nature juxtaposition coheres thematically without turning into a mere museum tour. Sensory detail is mostly visual but selectively chosen and filtered through her scientific/artistic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “feral nexus in mist,” ruins, and breathing fog are evocative, and the environment is consistently present as more than a white room. The setting’s mood mirrors the protagonist’s interior oscillation between doubt and revelation, and the final image of mist embracing “the shapes of different hopes” gives the place thematic charge. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it’s a resonant backdrop rather than an active pressure. Vivid atmosphere lifts this category, but the integration stops short of transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The verdant arbor, ancient trees, glowing vine, and harvest moon create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically apt. Setting details like the workshop among the trees and the moonlit village square are selectively drawn and recur at the end, giving the final image resonance. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it frames and beautifies rather than exerts pressure. The vine comes closest to object-as-setting, but even it functions more as conduit than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly realized and specific, with frost-brittle leaves, bark scrolls, and frost-encased berries integrated into the ritual. Setting details are filtered through the alchemist’s use of materials, not just as backdrop, and the final starlight glow recharges those details in the closing image. Environmental pressure is more atmospheric than constraining—cold, stillness, and isolation shape tone more than choice—but they do meaningfully charge the final transformation. This is strong, publication-ready scene-building even if the crater’s physics and climate remain mostly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern and its reflective surfaces are vivid and central; the environment literally dictates her method by providing the mirrors necessary to understand the timer. Seasonal and light-specific details (“wound in summer,” shifting dawn/noon/twilight angles) deepen atmosphere without losing clarity. The setting’s rules stay consistent and are enacted through her actions rather than static description. The final image of reflections and echoes coalescing feels directly charged by the space.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, and metallic reflections are vivid, coherent, and tightly integrated with the ritual mechanics (calcification under specific light, altar of bronze and crystal). Setting is not mere backdrop: the environment and starlight directly govern how burdens are transformed and recorded, and the grotto’s “shingled hush” acts as an accumulating atmospheric pressure. The recurring tool-object (lamp burner) and altar both charge the final images. World rules feel consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the rain-beaded skylight, loft, mantel of carved lions, and kettle all work as lived-in, emotionally charged spaces rather than backdrop. Weather and light shape perception (fractured light, constellations of droplets) and clearly mirror Clara’s internal state without feeling over-schematic. The loft and skylight, plus the kettle, actively charge the final image, though they do not strongly constrain physical options. Line-by-line specificity is high and integrated with action, making the atmosphere memorable and tonally precise.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “kinetic lagoon above the clouds” and celestial carousel are vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through: debris, currents, the halted machinery, and finally the carousel powering the wheel and realigning time. Setting isn’t just wallpaper—the lagoon’s waters, stillness, and currents directly frame the bridge and the final transport of Cyrus and his ghost. Details mostly come through Cyrus’s purpose and perception rather than as static tour-guide description. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, even if we don’t see it physically constrain micro-choices in a granular way.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned spaceport is clearly and atmospherically established (silent concourse, dormant transformers, flickering lights like “stars awakening”), and the environment is used as she navigates to the power center and revives the concourse. The sextant as a recurring object charges the final image and ties setting, tool, and theme together. Still, sensory range and constraint could go further—there’s little tactile difficulty, danger, or specific spatial pressure from the industrial environment. The “after the carnival” detail is largely atmospheric and then dropped.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich: misted cobblestones, crystal columns after rain, petrichor, and the “soundless sanctuary” create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details are filtered through a time-obsessed craftsman, aligning the world with his interiority. The sanctuary and crystals do more than decorate; their properties (whispering after rain, mending what time has broken) are central to the premise and to his transformation. At times, repetition of key phrases edges toward motif-for-its-own-sake rather than new angles on the space, keeping this shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The twilight barge canal, abandoned barges, and humid air are vivid and specific, and they sustain a consistent, melancholic atmosphere. Setting details like the sagging hull, dust motes, and broken window are well filtered through Elara’s purposeful search rather than feeling like a catalog. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain her options—nothing in the physical canal forces a hard choice—but it does charge the final sense of salvaging truth from wreckage. Overall, setting is a strength, though more tactical interplay between space and action could lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The harbor, golden dock, snow, and fog create a strong, coherent atmosphere that supports the “oceanic hush” tone and philosophical mood. Details like nets, knotwork, and muffled harbor sounds are specific and sensorially grounded, clearly filtered through the collector’s attentive mind. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; the weather blankets and hushes rather than pressuring tactics. The dock and snow thus function more as elegant backdrop than active participant in the drama, which keeps this short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed autumn garden and its sensory palette (earth, decay, vanished blooms) are vivid and consistently filtered through his grief and vocation. The palace thread functions as a charged micro-setting object, reappearing to bridge past destruction and present healing, and explicitly “transforms into a compass” in the final movement. Environment doesn’t constrain physical options, but it heavily charges mood and the final image. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular: a suspended palace chained to stalactites, a mechanical world of gears and pistons, contrasted with scents of extinct flowers and bark-like stone when the device works. Details are filtered through Elorian’s longing for organic life, so atmosphere and theme reinforce each other. The palace and egg materially charge the transformation beat and the final image. This is strong, purposeful worldbuilding, just shy of exceptional because the environment rarely constrains specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and particular—smoke-choked streets, black volcanic sand, obsidian lagoon, and migrating clouds create a strong, unified atmosphere. Environmental factors (fire, smoke, shifting wind/clouds) do affect tactics and outcome, especially in the captain’s note about cloud migration weather. The lagoon and volcanic elements are consistently filtered through Maya’s history and worldview, not just catalogued. At times description leans toward ornamental repetition rather than new functional detail, which keeps this from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is vividly realized, with strong images (dry basins, breathing buildings, moss arrows, starlight patterns) and a consistent, melancholic magic. Setting is tightly bound to the story’s premise—its forgotten state is what’s at stake, and its reawakening forms the final image. That said, the environment rarely constrains Elara’s tactics or options; it serves more as poetic backdrop and symbolic mirror than as an active obstacle or tool. Even so, the atmosphere is rich and specific enough to feel memorable and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The nebula garden, falling stellar petals, and “liquid light” transit tunnel create a vivid, coherent cosmic environment with strong visual and tonal impact. Setting details are consistently filtered through the being’s mission and perception, maintaining an otherworldly but legible space. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly functions as atmosphere and metaphor rather than a pressure source. The recurring petals do help charge the final image, giving the setting some thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse, dusk light, granite, and butterflies are vividly rendered and recur in ways that charge the final image. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the rattling panes, contained calm, and migration through glass all mirror the tension between held and shared grief. The setting anchors time and mood and culminates in villagers standing around the monument in that same dusk-lit greenhouse, so it clearly charges closure. This is one of the story’s strongest dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian ridge, churning sea, and clock tower provide a vivid, atmospheric frame, and the recurring image of the ridge and reflection at the end nicely mirrors the restored balance. The setting is sensorially specific and tonally appropriate, but it rarely constrains choices or tactics; the ridge and sea are more backdrop than active pressure. The micro-setting around the pendulum and rake handle is more functionally integrated, especially in the tower repair sequence. Overall, the world feels coherent and textured but not yet indispensable to the story’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “cobalt silo under stars,” velveteen gloom, and cemetery artifacts are vivid, coherent, and strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, giving the piece a distinctive atmosphere. The setting reinforces the themes of quiet, contained transformation (sound absorbed, echoes released) and death-as-continuity. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics beyond providing a cocoon of silence; it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure. The recurring objects (case, tapestry, clock) are well-chosen and spatially consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and iridescent quill create a distinct, memorable visual world that’s consistent throughout. The frozen lake’s cracks link setting directly to the predictive stakes, and the spire’s amplifying effect, while told rather than shown, gives the place functional meaning beyond décor. The final image—map raised to early morning light with spire, lake, and quill converging—nicely charges the environment with thematic significance. Some sensory range beyond the visual (cold in her body, wind, sound of ice) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember alcove, mist-shrouded hillside, glowing radio dial, and drifting dust create a tangible, coherent atmosphere that fits the covert, post-famine world. Setting details are purposeful (the alcove as a hiding place, the dust-laden archive as discovery site) and filtered through her work. Environmental elements support theme and tone rather than functioning as generic backdrop. They rarely constrain choices directly, but they do charge the final image of dust shimmering in moonlight.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    The “vanishing point gallery,” the rocking chair, ash, and porcelain masks create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the story’s concerns about impermanence and perception. Details like dust settling into cracks and elongated shadows stretching toward an unreachable horizon effectively charge the final image. The environment feels particular to Elena’s world, though it mostly mirrors theme rather than actively constraining her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The submerged Poseidonis/sewer setting is vivid and specific—“sedimentary layers,” chest‑deep water, dripping pipes—and strongly filtered through Milo’s research habit and contrarian ideals. The environment meaningfully shapes his actions: the physical descent, shifting water passages, and hidden ruins legitimize his clandestine archive. The cog as small, tactile object-as-setting is well-used to charge atmosphere and the final image. Atmosphere is strong, though the worldbuilding’s ideological rules are more told than dramatized in practice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    The velvet library, autumn light, and rosette provide a stable, textured atmosphere and are re-invoked effectively to frame the beginning and ending. Setting feels consistent and pleasant, but largely as backdrop; seasons pass and the library is a “sanctuary” without materially constraining or redirecting choices. The rosette comes closest to functioning as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is mostly visual and somewhat generic, leaning on familiar “velvet/golden light/autumn” shorthand rather than sharper, idiosyncratic particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted greenhouse, cracked glass, and celestial glow create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the theme of beauty from decay. Sensory touches like “jasmine and rust” and dust motes in strange light feel specific and lived-in. The setting does modestly shape action—the isolation makes the rebellion possible and the decay reframes his purpose—but rarely constrains his options in a concrete way. Still, the environment meaningfully charges the final image of a small act of renewal in ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lightning collection tower, nectar dusk, and mechanical bees build an atmospheric, specific world that feels coherent and visually memorable. The ascent through the tower and the lightning chamber at the top provide a tangible spatial progression. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or imposes concrete risk; it’s evocative but mostly a backdrop rather than an active pressure on tactics. More tactile, non-visual detail or environmental obstruction at key beats could deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting—quiet bay town, predawn “streetlights daydreaming,” the dew, the old lighthouse keeper’s cottage—is vivid and consistently filtered through Aria’s sensibility, giving the story a strong atmospheric spine. The environment meaningfully charges the central images: tides deliver the shard, houses are the locus of her inquiry, and the cottage’s history with its keeper makes it the inevitable site of revelation. The recurring frame of the predawn walk and the streetlights fading at the end reinforces the temporal and spatial container without feeling touristic. While the bay itself doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it deeply textures the premise and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater city garden is vividly and consistently rendered—corals, bioluminescence, tiny fish, and ruins create a rich, tactile environment that never devolves into a mere catalog. Setting and object (the ampoule, the garden, the spectral inhabitants) are woven into action and theme, not just backdrop, and the final vision of the once-living city recharges earlier images. The environment subtly constrains what’s possible (telepathic statue bound to ruins, diver descending from surface), though it doesn’t overtly force tactical choices. Overall, the atmosphere is memorable and well-integrated with the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The infinite staircase is vividly sketched and tonally apt—central void, impossibly curving architecture, lack of sun all reinforce the sense of boundless confinement. It’s not just background; its infinite, self-sustaining nature is thematically tied to perpetual motion and Elias’s prison. The casino/bar setting at the end is thinner and more generic by comparison, serving more as a functional marker than a fully realized place. Overall, the staircase and the dice as recurring objects do meaningful atmospheric and structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, stained glass, and saffron quiet are vivid and specific, and they consistently filter through her sensibility as sanctuary vs. anonymous metropolis. Environmental details (seven flights up, smog muting dawn, golden and silvered light) support tone and theme without slipping into pure catalog. The brush and moonlight function as charged micro-setting objects that shape how she works and imagines. The setting doesn’t much constrain tactical choices, but it powerfully charges the final image of the mural over the waking city.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto city, waterfall, rosewater scent, bioluminescent fungi, and baker’s hollow are vivid and sensorially rich, clearly filtered through the guide’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the hidden city’s isolation, the ice in its core, and the hollow as a locus of resistance all shape what tactics are possible. The opera glass and dough function as micro-settings/tools that charge the final thaw image. A slight excess of decorative detail at times keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rocky shore, emergent hunger stone, and looming lighthouse create a strong, coherent atmosphere, with the low tide and ethereal radiance deepening the uncanny mood. Setting details are specific enough (stone emerging only at low tide, lighthouse beam interacting with the glow) to feel purposeful rather than generic. However, most description is visual and textural; the environment rarely constrains action beyond the abstract “narrow window” of the tide. The lighthouse becomes symbolically charged at the end, but more embodied interaction with the physical environment could sharpen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse, crooked mirrors, and lingering luminance create a strong, coherent atmosphere that supports the liminal, post-resuscitation premise. Setting details like the decaying corridors, opera cloak chamber, and final emergence at dawn are vivid and thematically matched. However, the environment mostly serves as symbolic backdrop rather than a constraint on choices—nothing in the geography forces tactics or dilemma. The recurring objects (mirrors, clasp, light) do charge the final image, which lifts the score.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating driftwood orchard, blue hour light, and fractal clouds are vivid and specific, giving the piece a strong, memorable atmosphere. Setting is integrated into action: driftwood becomes an instrument, roots conduct sound, and the open sea plus storms furnish real (if gently handled) pressure. The environment constrains tactics—she must read clouds and play the wood rather than shout—and charges the final image of the orchard drifting on. This is a major strength of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The turtle-shell city, spiral grooves, markets on smaller turtles, and endless ocean are vivid and feel coherently imagined, with details filtered through Kael’s cartographic sensibility. The setting isn’t mere backdrop: the shells encode history, conceal the chamber, and physically literalize the danger “beneath” the city, and the final turtle-turn image charges the ending. Constraints like the rusted gate and the city’s isolation derive directly from the environment and shape the premise. Some world rules (watchers’ nature, precise mechanics of pattern languages) are summarized rather than discovered through action, but they don’t break consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The disused, ivy-covered Victorian station is vividly evoked, with specific architectural echoes of the letter and a nice use of light and decay to set mood. The ivy and ruin-as-truth-obscured metaphor is effective, especially in the final line. However, the setting mostly supports theme and atmosphere rather than constraining choices or tactics in a concrete way, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion, marble pillars, shifting light, and water are vividly rendered and consistently integrated into action (kneeling at the edge, diving, objects wedged in stone). The environment clearly inflects mood and behavior, turning the space into a liminal sanctuary that mirrors the story’s concern with absence and memory. The recurring inkwell and drawbridge add a tactile micro-setting that charges the final image. Still, more varied sensory detail beyond sight and temperature could push the atmosphere from strong to immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    The underwater library, blackout, and emergency lighting create a distinct atmosphere, and details like waterproof chambers and towering shelves give a sense of place. The blackout removing digital tools does shape his method, but overall the environment is more aesthetic backdrop than active constraint. Recurring images (“dappled” light, water, phoenix) support tone but start to feel reiterated rather than deepened. The setting is vivid enough for publication but could more sharply influence his choices or the stakes of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and cohesive—the floating isle, tea garden, and glass basilica are strongly imaged and filtered through his grief and craft. The environment and tools (gems, paper, basilica as vault) charge the final image of the lantern ascending and him walking back through the isle. World rules about dream-recording gems and floating lanterns feel consistent and are shown through use, not exposition dumps. The setting does more atmospheric than constraining work, but it’s memorably particular.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    The floating observatory, ruined city, and overgrown garden with mutated vegetation provide a coherent SF-dystopian backdrop with a few vivid touches (“twisted metal structures,” “scent of ozone and decay”). The geode as a recurring object helps charge the atmosphere and final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or choices; Elias just moves through it as planned, so the setting feels observed rather than actively shaping events. Much of the description leans on familiar genre shorthand instead of idiosyncratic, character-filtered specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient observatory at dusk, the copper dome, and the “brilliant dimness” create a strong, coherent atmosphere that suits the cosmic-mystical frame. Environmental elements matter to action—the observatory’s mechanisms, dome, and sky access are integral to Maya’s tactics, not just backdrop. Details are selective and mostly filtered through a technical/mystical gaze, which helps avoid white-room syndrome. Some diction drifts toward generalized lyricism rather than sharply embodied specifics, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt terrace, stone steps, and forgotten shore with driftwood carvings create a distinct, atmospheric micro-world that feels specific to this story. The carvings function as a kind of archive that he must physically sift through, and the final image of placing the two watch hands in the sand is spatially and symbolically grounded. Sensory detail is mostly visual and auditory but purposeful, with the environment mirroring his interior state without becoming labored allegory. The setting could exert a bit more practical constraint on his actions, but it already does strong thematic and imagistic work.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and distant waves provide a strong atmospheric frame that’s integrated throughout, not just as an opening flourish. The moonlight physically shaping a pool where they place the drawer pull gives the environment a ritual function that charges the final image. Sensory detail leans visual and auditory but feels selective and purposeful, matching the solemn tone. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain options, but it clearly supports neutrality, isolation, and the quasi-mystical mood.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal launch, weather, small waves, utility poles, and dolphins create a vivid, coherent maritime environment that clearly channels Elena’s attention and professional bias. The sea and shore details are filtered through her navigator’s sensibility, which strengthens both atmosphere and character. The compass as object-as-setting is effective in the final repricing, constraining how she conceptualizes herself. A bit more tactile engagement with the environment under strain could further deepen the sense of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    The underground bioluminescent lake and tunnels are vivid and tonally apt, with strong visual texture and a consistent SF-tinged atmosphere. The recurring objects (baseball, newspaper) function almost as a micro-setting and do charge the story’s logic and ending image. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains action; the lake’s properties don’t significantly alter tactics or risk. World rules around time travel and the society remain suggestive but thinly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is vivid, coherent, and used throughout—moonlight, trees, blossoms, and soil are tightly integrated with the magic and her transformation. The environment actively participates when her feet root into the soil and she drinks moonlight; the blooming flowers respond to her brother’s name, charging the moment. World rules around spices, phoenix, and orchard are sketched lyrically but consistently. The setting supports theme and tone strongly, though it could constrain concrete choices even more to reach top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “midnight glade above the clouds” and onyx-ink cards create a distinct, atmospheric setting that aligns with the story’s contemplative mood. Details like moonlight being “drunk” by the ink and mist veiling a sacred place are vivid, though more visual than multisensory. The environment mostly frames the ritual rather than constraining options or tactics, so it reads as lyrical backdrop rather than active pressure. The later domestic scene (birthday tablecloth, gold-repaired saucer) grounds the theme effectively but remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The recycled spaceship is a vivid, tonally apt environment—“salvaged from debris fields of the Great War,” echoing with ghosts—and the locked dimension’s imagery adds a strong contrast at the end. Details like the meditation chamber, portal, and wall of photographs are integrated into the action rather than feeling like a catalog. The world’s broader temporal and physical context stays sketched rather than textured in depth, but that suits the focused, lyric scope. The ship’s dissolution in the final line nicely charges the setting with thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and celestial alignment create a distinct, coherent atmosphere, and recurring environmental details (the rumbling volcano, cosmic dance, bug-light syncing with the heavens) effectively charge the final images. The setting is well anchored and tonally consistent with the “vibrant hush” motif. That said, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices—it’s more a poetic backdrop than an active pressure. The volcano’s “sleep another century” feels thematically apt but lightly earned in terms of concrete cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The luminous fort, bioluminescent walls, and half-painted sundial create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that feels integral to both mood and method. The blackout and faint glow directly shape tactics (working in semi-darkness, avoiding surveillance) rather than serving as postcard description. The bronze quill holder as tool-object and the sundial function nearly as micro-settings, charged in the final image. Some sensory channels beyond sight could have deepened embodiment, but what’s present is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless stone, and eel-filled tidal pools create a vivid, distinctive atmosphere, and details like smooth rock and eels aligning with sequences are well integrated into the action. The “world without friction” concept is intriguing, though it’s more told than used to constrain choices beyond a few gestures. The setting does charge the final image (her returning to this bluff under auroras) with a sense of ritual site. Strong, publishable-level imagery, just shy of using environment as a true tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vivid and consistent, with weather, altitude, and technology (telescope, dome, lens) all integrated into mood and metaphor. Details like the bus timetable, abandoned archives, and “Ministry of Cultural Integrity” locate us in a specific repressive world without clunky exposition. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the height, clouds, and rarefied air embody the theme of words seeping down through oppressive atmospheres. It stops just short of 9-band because the physical setting constrains mood and symbolism more than it constrains concrete choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass atrium, crystalline ceiling, brook, and half-painted sundial are vivid, sensorially rich, and consistently filtered through Aris’s philosophic, precise gaze. Setting images (light fracturing, water’s “endless question,” dignified chaos) mirror the thematic preoccupation with questions and destinations. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices, but it does charge the decoding and mentoring scenes with atmosphere. The recurring sundial and atrium space give the ending a coherent spatial and tonal return.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted, roofless library under the moon and stars is vivid and specific, with details like decaying books, mangled metal, and open sky richly rendered. The coffee tin, shelves, seeds, and missing ceiling all integrate into the atmosphere and recurring imagery. While the environment strongly charges the tone and final image, it doesn’t significantly constrain physical choices beyond allowing starlight and planting. The world feels lived-in and coherent, but pressure from the setting stays more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal arbor, Cloud Station Nine, atmospheric currents, and film archive are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the pianist’s perspective. Environmental features (arbor’s dipping branches, cloud-horizon, failing compasses, shutdown) meaningfully shape urgency and options. The archive and projector are tactile, lived-in extensions of the world rather than generic props. Setting and recurring objects (piano, clock, film) clearly charge the final image, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ridge, orchids, rainforest canopy, waterfall, and cave are vividly rendered with concrete, sensory detail that sustains a lush atmosphere. The setting is integrated with stakes via the impending monsoon and the ridge becoming impassable, and the cave/stone circles materially shape the ritual actions. At times the description leans toward touristic prettiness (“every flower in bloom as if celebrating the coming monsoon”) rather than pressure, but it remains grounded in Elara’s movement and task. Environment and recurring objects (seed, stones, waterfall) all help charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich: petrichor, salt air, the breezy islet, glass case, bonsai, antique lace, and compass all interlock to form a coherent ritual space. Key objects (especially the lace and compass) don’t just decorate; they actively shape what is possible and charge the final image when the compass points at his heart and the lace shimmers. Weather and sea imagery are thematically apt, mirroring tides of memory and regret without feeling purely ornamental. Density sometimes flirts with over-description, but the environment clearly constrains and inflects the action.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is described with generic sensory details ("damp earth," "broken glass") that do not constrain the character's choices or generate specific obstacles. The greenhouse serves as a static backdrop for reflection rather than an active environment that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with generic, cliché phrases ("vast tapestry," "profound silence") that fail to create a specific, sensory environment. While the glass plates are a specific detail, the canyon itself functions as a static backdrop rather than an interactive space that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with generic adjectives ("frozen beauty," "crystalline") that do not constrain choices or offer resources that alter tactics. The conservatory serves as a static backdrop rather than an integrated environment that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.2)
    Settings are described with generic abstractions ("impossible spaces," "gray waters," "coral forests") rather than concrete, sensory-grounded particulars. The underwater library lacks tactile reality, relying on told phrases like "occupying impossible spaces that physics shouldn't allow" instead of specific environmental constraints that affect the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on the repetition of specific prompt phrases ("terra-cotta arbor," "ridge") rather than organic sensory detail. While the arbor is mentioned three times, it remains a static backdrop that does not constrain action or deepen the atmosphere. The "amplified quiet" is told rather than evoked through sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with functional imagery ("wisteria blooms," "ancient stones"), though it leans on somewhat cliché descriptions like "purple waterfalls." While the viaduct serves as a stage, the environment does not exert pressure or constrain the character's choices; it remains a static backdrop. The atmosphere aims for the requested "foggy lucidity" but achieves it through direct labeling rather than sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.0)
    The concept of a hyperbolic living garden is imaginative, but the execution relies on generic descriptors ("vibrant green," "pulsing," "impossible shapes") rather than specific sensory evidence. The setting functions largely as a static backdrop for the magical realism rather than a tactile environment that constrains movement.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic dystopian signifiers ("dust motes," "broken windows") that do not uniquely constrain the action. The specific spatial layout remains vague, particularly regarding how the character moves between the counter and piano while chained.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting of the sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong visual anchor. The specific detail of water pressure distorting the glass effectively reinforces the theme of perception.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "emerald station" and "golden sunset" provide a cohesive visual palette, though the imagery becomes repetitive ("melted gold," "silver light," "luminous"). The setting is largely atmospheric and does not constrain Lillian's choices; the "stationmaster's office" functions as a generic container for the objective rather than a specific place with distinct rules or physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The juxtaposition of the industrial control room and the fragile glasswork is a strong foundational image. However, the atmosphere is weakened by reliance on pathetic fallacy (melting ice mirroring the heart exactly) and overwritten sensory details ("electrons once danced") that feel ornamental rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting contains generic "ruined library" tropes ("rusted shelves," "broken skylight") without specific sensory anchoring that constrains the character's choices. While the environment is present, it functions as a static backdrop rather than an active element in the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting of the ridge fort and the sensory details of the stones are vivid and grounding. However, the atmosphere is marred by the excessive repetition of specific descriptors ("marbled hush," "ambered hush"), which renders the environment formulaic rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "frozen courtyard" and "transparent violin" provide some pleasant visual aesthetics, but the descriptions rely heavily on adjectives ("crystalline," "reverent") rather than tactile engagement. The setting functions as a static stage backdrop rather than applying pressure or constraining the protagonist's choices. Sensory details are often filtered through abstract conclusions ("almost spiritual") rather than raw input.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of ethereal adjectives ("crystal," "whispering," "glistening") that create a generic backdrop rather than constraining action or offering specific tactile resistance. The environment does not pressure the protagonist's choices, serving only as a passive stage for the fable.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The garden and the marbles are described with some vividness, establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the setting details (pathways shifting based on emotion) are summarized as general rules rather than shown affecting the protagonist's immediate navigation or choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting relies on abstract technobabble ("temporal ripples," "holographic matrix") rather than grounded sensory specifics. While "violet skies" hints at a wider world, the environment largely feels like a generic white-room laboratory.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    Heavy reliance on generic atmospheric descriptors ("gilded walls," "shimmering stars," "dancing shadows"). The physical logic is weak; the "untouched" piano in ankle-deep water contradicts the established decay essential to the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is integral to the premise; altitude functions as a necessary amplifier for the protagonist's abilities, not just backdrop. Specific sensory details (the compromised window seal, the biting cold) anchor the abstract concepts in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "beaded valve wheel" is a solid micro-setting detail that grounds the scene, but the tunnel itself is rendered with generic descriptors like "oppressive darkness." Spatial clarity is functional, but the sensory environment does not actively pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmospheric and vivid; the sensory contrast between the "cascading murk" of the river and the "ozone and ancient paper" of the silence effectively grounds the abstract concepts in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with clear sensory details (sage, wind, light), but descriptions often tilt into purple prose ("aromatic sentinels," "symphony of healing"). The environment serves as a backdrop rather than exerting causal pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the "reclaimed silo" is established, the inclusion of a "hearth" and "fireplace" within a missile silo breaks world logic and immersion without explanation. The atmosphere relies heavily on the repeated phrase "bronze quiet" rather than diverse sensory details, rendering the setting static.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.9)
    Setting details are generic ("mysterious lighthouse," "rocky island," "treacherous shores") and function as a static backdrop rather than constraining action. The environment does not exert pressure or force the character to adapt his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    Specific details like the "indigo" paint and "dimensional anchor" add flavor, but the setting largely feels like a white room for the ritual. The atmosphere attempts an eldritch tone but relies on abstract descriptors ("unraveled stillness") rather than grounded sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but operates as a static backdrop; the "glass spire" and "frozen lake" are repeated frequently without gaining texture or constraining the protagonist's physical choices. The sensory details ("rainbows," "pink and orange hues") are pleasant but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually distinct ("glowing viaduct," "bruised purple sky") and anchors the scene adequately. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop for the magic system rather than offering resistance or constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is generic ("stone walls," "shadowed alcove") and lacks sensory specificity beyond the abstract "vibrations." The "audibly muted" descriptor is repeated mechanically. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance; it serves merely as a backdrop for the summary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is functional and anchors the scene, but the atmosphere is flattened by the repetition of the phrase "layered tranquility" (three times). While the courtyard provides a stage, it feels generic—a "stone fountain" and "cobblestones"—rather than a specific, pressure-filled environment that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.5)
    The greenhouse setting creates a functional atmosphere ("tropical warmth," "extinct ferns"), though it serves more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker for the character's choices. The connection between the ghost orchid's bloom and the scent revelation feels coincidental rather than causally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    Specific details are present ("terra-cotta," "silver wash"), but the repetition of "terra-cotta" (4 times) and "starlight" (4 times) makes the setting feel static. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of a "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by ancient shipwrecks" is vivid, creative, and specific, providing the strongest element of the piece. However, the atmospheric description remains somewhat static, serving as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "amber grotto" provides a consistent visual tint, but the setting remains largely atmospheric. It does not constrain the protagonist's tactics or force a trade-off, serving mostly as a backdrop for the procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details like the "retracted roof panels" and "canopy of stars" provide a visual backdrop but do not constrain action or force choices. The environment feels romanticized and static, serving as a stage for the moral rather than a source of pressure or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is rendered through dense, abstract description ("luminescent fluid," "restless, aching glow") that creates a visual backdrop but lacks tactile reality. The environment serves as ornamentation rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    Setting details are often abstract ("unique urban ecosystem," "ethereal light") rather than grounded in specific sensory textures. The spatial relationship between the rooftop canals and the giant is asserted but never clearly visualized or felt.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting description ("dripping stalactites," "bioluminescent fruits") creates a functional fantasy backdrop but remains largely decorative. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or pressure the action; the cavern is merely a stage for the ritual rather than an active participant in the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the physical spaces (pipe chases, crawl spaces) are established, the descriptions rely on repeated purple phrases ("sapphire hush") rather than distinct sensory particulars. The setting does not exert pressure; the character moves through it with "grace" rather than struggling against the constraints of a thirty-year confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.8)
    The nursery and trellis are functionally established, but the setting often leans on generic adjectives ("unusual vitality," "extraordinary resilience") rather than sensory specificity. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the moral rather than an active constraint that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric details like "flickering solar lamps" and "rain trails" establish a competent mood, but the setting remains a static backdrop. The environment does not exert active pressure or force constraints on the protagonist's choices beyond the initial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The musical/visual synesthesia is a promising concept, but descriptions remain abstract ("unseen forces," "complex harmonies") and list-like. The setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than forcing constraints or offering specific tools for the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.1)
    While sensory adjectives are present ("glistening stones," "briny scent"), the setting remains a generic backdrop that never constrains the protagonist's options. The environment is described ornamentally rather than interacting with the character's goals or physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.3)
    The "starlit vault in mist" relies on generic ethereal descriptors that fail to constrain the character's actions. While visual, the setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure cooker; the "mist coalescing into emotions" is a familiar trope that adds little specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is generic and abstract ("distant waters," "weathered marble") with no sensory specificity to ground the reader. The tower serves as a backdrop rather than a constraining environment. The description relies on generalized summaries of time passing rather than immediate, tactile details.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic abstract descriptors ("walls of light," "dimensional pocket," "energy") that lack sensory texture or grounding. The term "escondite" functions as a label rather than a lived-in space, and the "spatial mutiny" is visualized through vague "glimpses" rather than concrete, specific imagery that would anchor the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funeral home setting is the piece's strongest asset, offering distinct sensory details ("chemical scent," "stainless steel") that ground the action. The juxtaposition of preparing bodies and forging papers effectively supports the "deathly vitality" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of a mountaintop bonsai sanctuary with a fluorescent lamp offers a vivid, surreal atmosphere. While distinct, the environment acts primarily as a backdrop and does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is rendered through generic lists ("towering labyrinth," "distant lands") rather than specific sensory interactions that constrain the protagonist's movement. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for reflection rather than an active force pressuring tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on standard atmospheric markers ("rain-slicked," "rusty hinges") without creating specific constraints that shape the character's choices. The observatory serves as a generic backdrop for the props rather than a pressure cooker, and the storm outside does not meaningfully impact the interior action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details effectively ground the setting, such as "fried funnel cakes mingled with saltwater" and "neon constellations." The floating raft city is visualized well, though the description sometimes lists attributes rather than weaving them into action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with functional visual descriptors ("moonlit summit," "blue light"), but the environment lacks tactile grit or scientific grounding (fireflies in a lunar vacuum). The atmosphere relies on repeated assertions of the "dawning hush" rather than organic sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    While atmospheric, the description relies heavily on visual cues ("iridescent," "rainbow fractures," "dancing patterns") that are inaccessible to the POV character. This disconnect breaks the immersion of the blindness constraint, reducing the setting to generic window dressing rather than a lived environment.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established with generic descriptors ("rusted outpost," "frozen lake") that lack sensory specificity or atmospheric pressure. The "singular convergence" is described through abstract concepts ("mathematics of flow") rather than concrete, grounded imagery that would anchor the fantastical element.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is vivid and atmospheric ("bruised sky," "rust flaked away like dried tears"), creating a strong sense of place. However, the setting remains passive, functioning as a canvas for the protagonist's skills rather than an active force that constrains his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with heavy adjectival description ("magnificent," "splendor," "otherworldly") that creates a distance from the immediate physical reality. While the spatial constraints are clear, elements like the "gathered hush" absorbing water currents strain physical credibility without establishing a distinct magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the "lighthouse prison" provides a clear backdrop, the setting details are repetitive and rely on purple prose ("copperlight repose") rather than tactile interaction. The "lattice from confessional" feels forced into the environment without a logical spatial integration. Specificity is lost to the rhythmic churning of the same few descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like the "bioluminescent life" and "frost perpetually danced." The greenhouse feels tangible and atmospheric, effectively grounding the supernatural elements.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting descriptions are generic ("morning mist," "red canyon walls") and rely on standard fantasy tropes without specific sensory grounding. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the magical action rather than a source of constraint or pressure. There is no specific "now" or anchored atmosphere, as the timeline blurs across days and years.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "catacomb orchard" with roots intertwining with bones provides a strong central image, but the setting remains static and atmospheric rather than active. The environment describes the scene but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adjustments under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is vivid and the "golden arcade" provides a solid visual anchor, though the setting functions more as a mood board than a source of constraints. The sensory details ("ethereal warmth," "ghostly traces") are pleasant but lean toward standard sci-fi tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing the "cobalt observatory" effectively, though descriptions occasionally veer into "purple" territory (e.g., "prismatic tears"). The sensory details are present but largely decorative; they do not significantly constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is a collection of generic atmospheric markers ("twisted roots," "inky surface") lacking sensory specificity. The central prop—a window in a swamp—is physically implausible and ungrounded, appearing as a video-game-like asset rather than an integrated part of the environment. The atmosphere is told through adjectives rather than evoked through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "mist-clad atrium" provides a consistent atmospheric backdrop, though descriptions lean toward purple prose ("weep mist") without materially constraining the protagonist's tactics or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is rendered through generic fantasy tropes ("fog-choked ruins," "impossible colors") rather than concrete, grounded details. The environment feels like a painted backdrop for a fable rather than a lived-in space that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "sound wave garden" provides a distinct backdrop, and the interaction with the mural offers some grounded sensory detail. However, description often slips into abstract summation ("acoustic resonance") rather than remaining anchored in concrete, immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    Ecological details (mycelial network, carnivorous plants, frequencies) are imaginative and specific. However, the setting is presented as a list of locations visited over time rather than an immersive environment constraining immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "gargantuan shell" provides a distinct atmospheric container, but the setting lacks physical solidity or constraints that shape the poet's choices. The imagery is often abstract ("swirling nebulae," "sleeping world") or synesthetic ("reef-shadow joy") without grounding the reader in the concrete mechanics of the space. The lack of sensory friction makes the world feel dream-like and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "floating opal library" and "glass orchids" provide a vivid, albeit standard high-fantasy backdrop. However, the setting functions largely as scenery; it provides the tools for the solution conveniently but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic library tropes ("dust motes," "dim light") that do not constrain the character's actions. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist's choices. The "glass ink well" is used repeatedly as a prop but fails to function as a tool that alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "breathing" volcano is a strong initial image, but it is repeated to the point of distraction (used five times). The juxtaposition of ancient ruins with CSI-style chemical forensics creates a jarring atmospheric inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic tropes ("dusty attic," "lonely beam," "aging paper") without specific constraints that pressure the character. Sensory details are present but lean toward cliché rather than lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    While visually colorful, the setting remains abstract and untethered ("drifting prism terrace," "crystalline archway"), lacking the tactile friction of a real environment. The "butterfly effect" is treated as a vague magical backdrop rather than a system with rules that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the descriptions are lush, the spatial geometry is confusing; the "collapsed roof" implies a flooded dome, yet she interacts with the glass as if separated from the water, then removes a glove. The setting functions more as a backdrop for prompts than a pressure cooker for choices. "Shadowseam wonder" is used as a generic atmospheric label.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vividly described with specific elements like "crater glass" and "geode walls," establishing a consistent fantasy atmosphere. However, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the "sea-foam" aspect of the title is disconnected from the cave setting.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "tidal arcade" is an evocative concept with some strong sensory details like the "liquid mirror," but it functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The setting does not constrain the protagonist’s choices or force a tactical shift, leaving the potential of the environment largely underutilized.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the setting is established, descriptions rely on abstract "telling" ("forbidden beauty," "ancient magic") rather than sensory immediacies that constrain the character. The "moonstone cabochon dust speck" is a visually confusing and clunky object description that disrupts the imagery rather than grounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    While descriptive, the setting relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("shimmered like scattered pearls") rather than concrete, grounding details. The use of "prism atrium" to describe mist is disorienting and feels forced to fit a prompt. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for reflection rather than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details rely on stock phrasing ("velvet darkness," "ancient pines") that fails to constrain the character's choices or generate atmosphere beyond a generic backdrop. The environment is observed passively, serving as a container for thought rather than an active force of resistance or discovery. Sensory specificity is replaced by adjectival stacking that slows the reading speed.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto is the story's strongest element, grounded in specific sensory details ("glimmering like a soap bubble," "tide-polished") that anchor the abstract concepts. The setting actively constrains the action (tides revealing surfaces), though the "parallel timelines" aspect remains largely expositional.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with standard atmospheric descriptors ("practiced silence," "cascading vines") but feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the imagery is consistent, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Imagery like the "prism parapet" and "glistening" rain is vivid but remains decorative. The setting facilitates the magic perfectly rather than providing constraints or friction to drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but leans on generic "ancient" descriptors until the "three suns" detail adds needed specificity. The terrace serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint on the character's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "crystalline surface" biting into knees and the sound of rain like "tiny bells." The environment is distinct and successfully mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the mirroring is sometimes over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with clear atmospheric markers, but the imagery suffers from the verbatim repetition of the phrase "silver courtyard under snow," which flattens the sensory experience into a static backdrop. While the visual of the snow and starlight is consistent, the environment functions more as a stage set than an interactive space that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "decommissioned radar dome" is an intriguing concept but remains a static backdrop, lacking sensory interaction that constrains choice. The "seedy bar" is generic, and the descriptions rely on visual adjectives ("indigo," "dimming") rather than a lived-in, tactical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively anchoring the reader in the "verdant grotto." However, the description occasionally drifts into purple prose ("floating garden," "divine chorus") that feels ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually established with appropriate fantasy elements (ice, aurora, rope), providing a clear backdrop. However, the environment functions mostly as a stage rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the "perfect cold" and "ancient chill" are atmospheric but do not force specific tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("vine-draped bunker," "rewilded forest") without specific, tactile grounding that shapes the action. The descriptor "ethereal grit" reads as a confusing oxymoron that fails to establish a coherent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    While the observatory setting is established with some sensory detail, immersion is broken by the baffling use of the word "dato" ("The dato felt like cooled honey"), which reads as a hallucination or typo. The atmosphere relies on the forced insertion of the phrase "dusky harmony" rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is a generic ethereal "white room" defined by abstract metaphors ("walls breathing," "metallic despair") rather than grounded sensory details. The "soundlessness" is inconsistent with the spoken dialogue and vibrating music, creating confusion rather than atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is a strong point; the fog, ancient trees, and twilight create a cohesive, dreamlike mood that supports the magical realism genre. The setting actively participates in the climax, as the sextant reveals the "impossible fruits." Specificity is high, though the verbatim repetition of "ruined orchard district" diminishes the immersive effect slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cathedral orchard is a compelling visual that grounds the piece, though it remains largely static. While the sensory details (scent of apples, moss) are vivid, the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting suffers from a catastrophic text artifact—the unexplained inclusion of the Cyrillic word "санузл" (bathroom)—which shatters immersion. Beyond this, the environment is sketched with generic "cosmic" adjectives ("luminous," "ancient") rather than concrete, tactile details that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established clearly with some evocative imagery ("shelves twisted like climbing vines"), though it relies heavily on standard magical library tropes. The environment serves as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting creates a functional atmospheric backdrop with details like "rusty hull" and "faded murals," but it lacks the specificity to constrain choice. The environment feels like a passive museum exhibit rather than a pressure cooker; the "fog" and "shifting mist" remain ornamental rather than affecting navigation or tactics. The "garden" being a greenhouse is a nice touch, but the interaction remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting consists of generic steampunk tropes ("brass cogs," "gears gleaming") without sensory specificity that constrains the character's choices. The environment feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker; the "clock tower" aesthetic provides atmosphere but does not mechanically force trade-offs in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.2)
    The concept of harmonic caves and ripple maps is imaginative, but the execution remains abstract and visual rather than tactile or immersive. The "Ice Sanctum" and "energy beings" function as generic fantasy tropes without the sensory specificity needed to ground the scene in a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "glass humming pavilion" and its sympathetic resonance provide a vivid, atmospheric setting that anchors the scene well. The sensory details ("walls sang with the wind") establish a distinct mood, though the setting supports rather than constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting details ("solidified fog," "crystal whispering forecourt") are vivid and imaginative, providing a strong atmospheric grounding. The environment creates legible constraints (shadows acting as time-markers, crystals releasing sound), which effectively anchor the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and lush, particularly regarding the flora, but the setting offers no resistance or constraint (e.g., the gates standing ajar). The environment cooperates too fully with the protagonist, functioning as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are functional but generic ("ancient grotto," "countless tides"), serving as a static backdrop for reflection rather than a source of pressure. The sensory imagery ("pulsing," "warm") repeats frequently without deepening the specific atmosphere of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sensory details regarding the "flavors of silence" are evocative and specific, grounding the abstract concept in tangible experience. The contrast between the metallic, claustrophobic bunker and the luminous, airy trellis creates a strong atmospheric polarity. The environment of the trellis is vividly rendered, though the gravity inversion itself could have impacted the physical body more distinctly beyond the initial lift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "prism terrace" is a creative concept, the setting operates on dream logic where the physical world (glass, sound) obeys the protagonist perfectly without constraint. The descriptions ("valley of colors," "sonic landscape") rely on generic abstraction rather than sensory specificity that would ground the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.7)
    The setting relies on abstract buzzwords ("memory-formatted," "digital fruits," "solidified light") rather than grounded sensory details. The world feels like a collection of prompt terms rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on abstractions ("substance of starlight and sorrow") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. While the "sanctuary" is established, it feels like a metaphorical "white room" lacking the tactile details that would create immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent setting is described with reasonable vividness ("spores that sparkled," "purplpurple glow"), creating a coherent atmosphere. However, the environment functions largely as a backdrop rather than a source of friction; the "dangerous instability" is mentioned but never impedes the protagonist's progress or forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.0)
    Setting details are generic ("ancient tomes," "intricate carving") and rely heavily on repetitive, adjectival phrases ("sepia reading room," "golden shadows") that appear three or more times. The atmosphere is asserted through these repeated tags rather than built through specific, multisensory interaction. The space feels like a static backdrop that poses no physical constraints on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    The alchemical greenhouse is anchored well, providing a distinct atmospheric container that supports the mystical tone. While "fruit of impossible colors" is a weak descriptor that bypasses sensory specificity, the marionette program and the "phosphorescent vines" offer concrete, tactile details that ground the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "accumulated dust patterns" provide a specific, if slightly implausible, sensory anchor that grounds the archival work. However, the broader setting details (apartment overlooking park) feel like generic filler unrelated to the central pressure. The environment functions as a container for the prop rather than a source of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "auric lagoon" offers a distinct visual anchor, but descriptions often lean into cliché ("bruised purples") or pathetic fallacy ("nature itself conspiring"). While the setting is vivid, it functions primarily as a backdrop rather than an environmental constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic "fantasy" adjectives ("radiant," "crystalline," "prism") that provide a visual backdrop but do not constrain the character's choices. The environment feels static and decorative; while the "dewdrops" attempt to mark time, the setting functions more as a stage set than an integrated, pressure-inducing element.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established through heavy adjective-noun pairings ("ashen skyborne arbor," "Whispering Willow") that feel decorative rather than constraining. While vivid, the descriptions rely on generic high-fantasy tropes and do not force the character into difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.6)
    Settings are sketched with generic descriptors ("strange symbols," "rich soil") rather than specific, grounding sensory details. The central image of clocks running on "natural rhythms" remains conceptually vague and lacks the mechanical specificity needed to make the environment tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.6)
    The specific descriptor "rain-washed" is repeated five times in a short text, becoming a distraction that breaks immersion. While the foundry is established, the setting does not actively constrain the character's choices or tactics; it merely serves as a backdrop for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting of Echo Gorge and the "misaligned harp" provides strong, surreal imagery that integrates well with the mechanics of the hunt (sound reflection). However, the atmosphere relies on repetitive, static descriptors ("ethereal glow," "hidden sunrise") rather than evolving sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting lacks concrete grounding, functioning only as a pathetic fallacy for the protagonist's trauma. The word "ultraviolet" appears eight times in a short space, becoming a repetitive tic that dulls the sensory imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.7)
    While the concept of an alchemist's market is vivid, the execution relies on generic fantasy markers ("glowing potions," "colorful fabrics") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain action. The setting functions as a painted backdrop; the "floating" nature of the market is mentioned but does not physically affect the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.1)
    The specific focus on ceiling dust patterns offers a unique sensory detail that grounds the supernatural premise. However, other details (smell of popcorn, flickering lights) feel generic, and the setting imposes no physical obstacles to the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass orchard is a vivid, imaginative setting that actively shapes the narrative, from the "dendritic frost" input method to the warping walls that signal escalation. The environment integrates tightly with the plot, providing both the container and the debris for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the baroque asteroid and visible time is visually distinct and imaginative ("shimmering curtains," "gold filigree"). However, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop; the "visible time" and "temporal storm" do not exert specific causal pressure on the protagonist's choices or tactics beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    The resonance chamber is established with adequate sensory detail (polished oak, amplification) and serves the plot functionally. However, the setting feels like a static stage rather than a pressure cooker; it supports the protagonist's success without offering resistance or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on standard genre descriptors ("polished obsidian," "ethereal blue light," "primordial darkness"). While the geography is clear, the environment is frictionless; the water is "surprisingly warm" and the path yields easily, failing to act as a constraint on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is established through adjectives ("storm-tossed") and abstract noun phrases ("turbine-hum reverie") rather than grounded sensory detail. The environment functions as a static backdrop that fails to constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmosphere is established through vivid, albeit "purple," description ("amber pavilion," "suspended stars"), but the setting remains decorative rather than restrictive. The environment facilitates the protagonist's goal without imposing constraints or shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting elements (zeppelin, obsidian lagoon) are vivid concepts but exist only as a list of visual descriptors ("polished oak," "inky surface") without constraining action. The environment functions as a passive backdrop; the zeppelin offers no physical resistance, and the lagoon operates as a magical vending machine for answers.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting of Paper-lantern Cove provides some evocative visuals (lanterns, bay window), but description often slides into abstract commentary about the town's condition ("life support without actual life") rather than grounding the reader in sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting strikes a strong, specific chord with the "ancient orchard atop a skyscraper," grounding the high-concept premise effectively. The atmosphere is vivid, though occasionally marred by repetitive descriptors ("ancient" appears four times in short order).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.0)
    While visual details like "starlight" and "captured fireflies" are vivid, the setting fails to exert pressure; the "subzero temperature" is a visual backdrop that ignores the physiological reality of a barefoot character, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "windblown sanctuary" and "cathedral bell rope" provide decent grounding, but the setting often dissolves into generic descriptors ("eerie luminescence," "highest accessible summit"). The environment serves as a backdrop rather than a source of frictional constraints that shape the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on high-concept abstractions ("cosmic tapestry," "ancient rivers") rather than concrete, sensory grounding that would make the outpost feel real. Details like a "handle made from dark matter" strain credibility by treating complex astrophysical concepts as simple raw materials without establishing the necessary internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.0)
    The contrast between the "scorched wasteland" and the "beekeeping oasis" provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop. However, the setting remains largely ornamental; the wasteland's danger never actively constrains the protagonist's choices or threatens the sanctuary in a way that forces a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.4)
    The emerald silo and washed-out sky provide a visual aesthetic but do not exert pressure on the protagonist or constrain her choices. The setting details, while descriptive ("emerald-veined walls"), remain ornamental and static rather than integrated into the conflict or the mechanism of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details like the "drake's tail feather" and "cobalt lagoon" create a vivid visual texture, but the setting remains a static backdrop for contemplation. The environment does not exert pressure, constrain the protagonist's choices, or force a tactical adaptation beyond providing the scenery for the poem.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting descriptions rely on vague, high-fantasy abstractions ("otherworldly iridescence," "architectural secrets") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the montage rather than a source of friction or tactical resources.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting contains significant logic errors: "dusty footprints, undisturbed by recent rains" on an outdoor path is a physical contradiction, and the "rainwashed interior" confuses the shelter logic established later by the windows. Descriptive phrases like "rainwashed tower" and "bronze quiet" are repeated verbatim three to four times, reducing the setting to a set of recurring keywords rather than a tangible space.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic descriptors ("dying sun," "weathered hands") rather than sharp, interactive detail. While the "blooming jetty" is visualized, the environment functions largely as a passive canvas for the character's actions rather than applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("cracked wasteland," "rusted metal") without specific, tactile grounding. Sensory details are summarized ("smell her on the wind") rather than creating an immersive, constrained environment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is generic ("wastelands," "dormant equipment") and fails to utilize the "time dilation" concept for sensory or causal pressure. The environment feels like a backdrop for internal monologue rather than a physical space constraining the character.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy furniture ("icebound spire," "crystalline pedestal") that lacks sensory specificity or friction. The environment serves only as a passive container for the chess-piece locks rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere of the whispering gallery is established well with sensory details like "fragmented murmurs" and the "nomadic penumbra." However, the setting feels largely like a stage set for the character's internal monologue rather than a tangible space that constrains her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("labyrinthine corridors," "aging paper," "ancient mountain") without specific, grounding sensory details that constrain the character. The environment functions as a passive backdrop that rearranges itself to help the protagonist rather than providing resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    The imagery of the "platinum labyrinth" and "woven hush" creates a vivid, surreal atmosphere. However, the setting functions largely as a magical convenience (walls shimmering to "sincere intentions") rather than a grounded environment that exerts physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "towers of bone" and "pale spire" offer a distinct visual palette, but the setting feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The "forged hush" is described but not felt in the acoustics of the scene, which seems readily open to the protagonist's loud defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details like the "roiling acid sea" and "corrosive emerald waters" establishing the "dire enchantment" effectively. The workshop reflects the protagonist's precarious internal state well. The imagery is occasionally decorative rather than strictly constraining, but the physical tilt of the workshop provides a nice moment of integration between world and character.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like "anemones and crabs" and "mother-of-pearl" provide a functional backdrop, though descriptions often lean toward the generic. The "hidden oasis" in a lifelong hometown feels convenient, lacking the specific grounding that would make the discovery believable. The setting serves the plot mechanically rather than constraining the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but leans on generic descriptors ("peach and lavender," "withered plants") that lack distinct specificity. While the "cobalt lighthouse" is a nice anchor, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "starlit signal station" provides a basic atmospheric container, but the world-building logic (hydraulics controlling navigation) remains vague. The setting offers mood but lacks the concrete constraints or specific details needed to pressure the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "hanging orchard" and storm providing a strong backdrop for the internal state. The sensory details ("arthritic fingers," "gray light") effectively ground the scene, though they occasionally veer into slightly overwrought description.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vivid, though descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("dreamscape of opalescence," "moon-bleached"). The specific imagery of the dock and mist supports the tone well, though the sensory details remain largely visual.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.3)
    The antique shop is established with evocative details like &quot;parchment ghosts,&quot; but the woods and cavern lean on generic fantasy descriptors (&quot;phosphorescent flowers,&quot; &quot;blooming cavern&quot;). The matrix chip is a tangible, specific object that anchors the fantasy elements well.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is described with generic high-fantasy adjectives ("visceral," "otherworldly," "liquid sapphire") that offer little sensory grounding. The environment is treated as a backdrop for the epiphany rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the "brutal" climb is glossed over in a single sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "ember nexus" provides atmospheric visuals ("fragments of ancient fires"), but the setting functions largely as a mood ring that pulses in sympathy rather than a source of constraints or resources. It decorates the scene rather than pressuring the choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "upside down snow" is a strong, surreal specific that effectively grounds the dream-logic atmosphere. However, other descriptors ("rustic desk," "ancient and unborn," "impossible colors") lean on generic abstractions that fail to constrain the character's choices or deepen the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the water clock shop is distinct and provides good textural details ("rhythmic drip," "brass handle"). However, the atmosphere feels somewhat static and cozy, serving as a backdrop for the theme rather than pressuring the characters' choices or constraining the action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established, but relies on stock fantasy imagery ("parchment blank as newly fallen snow," "misty void") that lacks unique sensory texture. The environmental pressure (tilting platform) is functional, but the descriptions often lean on general descriptors rather than specific, grounding details.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting of the dusty sheet music archive is atmospheric, and the copper wire setup adds specificity. However, sensory details often slip into abstraction ("smelled of... time," "jasmine and regret"), which dilutes the physical grounding of the scene. The orchard's destruction frames the scene but doesn't pressure the action inside.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting suffers from "white-room syndrome," utilizing generic signifiers like "towering shelves" and "stone altar" without specific sensory texture. Abstract descriptions ("spaces between words where pure meaning resided") replace concrete, grounding details. The environment acts as a static backdrop for concepts rather than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details—brass fittings, refractions, water flow—are vivid and ground the "eminently peculiar" concept well. However, the physical reality of the "horizon measurement" itself remains abstract, serving more as a backdrop for the theme than a tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies on generic light descriptors ("glowing," "pulsing," "bioluminescent") without tactile grounding. The "permeable barrier" and "frequencies" function as abstract plot devices rather than physical constraints in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the "rainwashed library" is established, the central prop—a lit candle lantern in a public research library—breaks verisimilitude significantly. The setting serves as atmospheric window-dressing rather than a source of constraints or resources that pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like "metallic intestines" effectively ground the scene in the underground setting. However, the rote repetition of full phrases ("subway utility tunnel," "between the hum of streetlamps") creates a droning artifact that detracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established early, but details veer into generic romantic imagery ("wildflowers of violet and crimson," "weathered wooden planks"). The repeated full-phrase invocation of the "blooming jetty" flattens the atmosphere, making the location feel like a backdrop rather than a pressuring force.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the railway station provides an initial anchor, the setting dissolves into a montage of generic locations (taxi, café) that lack sensory distinctness. The environment functions as a static backdrop for the summary rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.1)
    The concept of an "ultrasonic forest" is promising, but the setting remains abstract and ungrounded, relying on labels like "vibrations" and "energy fields" rather than concrete sensory detail. The environment functions as a passive container for the protagonist's journey rather than a source of friction or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting relies on generic sci-fi/fantasy descriptors ("twisted ribbons," "dancing patterns," "exotic nib") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain action. The "gravitational anomaly" serves as a backdrop for the magic system but does not exert specific physical or temporal pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic "poetic" descriptors ("scattered diamonds," "salt-tinged air") rather than specific details that constrain the character. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop for the metaphor rather than an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is generic ("dusty halls," "off-grid") and fails to constrain the character's choices or generate atmosphere. Sensory details are sparse and clichéd ("more precious than gold"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the summary rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The concept of the "sound wave garden" with visible vibrations and "notes becoming flowers" is imaginative and creates a distinct atmosphere. However, the sensory details skew heavily toward the visual and ethereal ("liquid light"), lacking the tactile grit or temperature that would ground the sci-fi elements in a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of a humming container labyrinth during a geomagnetic storm is atmospheric and specific, providing the story's strongest element. Sensory details like the "eerie resonance" and "acoustic highways" ground the reader, though the "zodiac" and "key" elements drift into vague magical realism that clashes slightly with the industrial grit.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "cobalt dock" provides a basic anchor, but the use of a dental mirror as a light-weaving tool struggles with scale and plausibility in this mythic context, feeling forced. Sensory details often drift into abstraction ("quiet the very air," "stories older than time") rather than grounding the scene in specific, tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric details are consistent but repetitive, particularly the overuse of "cobalt" to describe multiple elements. The magical "magnetic grotto" feels tonally disjointed from the grounded setting of a town chess club.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting contains evocative phrases ("water the color of mercury"), but the "sublittoral fringe" feels largely decorative rather than a source of constraints. The intriguing premise that "violence became impossible" is mentioned as background color but does not impact the physics or choices within the scene. The environment is a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The contrast between the industrial "mechanical forest" and the intimate, organic whittling creates a strong, specific atmosphere. The setting details—particularly the turbines creating the "remade hush"—effectively ground the story's mood and thematic constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is visually described with adjectives ("cobalt," "crystalline") but functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force. The environment does not constrain the character’s movement or choices; instead, it perfectly facilitates the ritual. The details are ornamental, lacking the tactile specificity that would ground the magical elements in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established through generic descriptors ("vibrant," "shimmering," "golden") rather than specific, grounded sensory details that constrain the characters. While the glassblower's courtyard is a functional backdrop, the "plant language" mechanics remain abstract and decorative, lacking the specificity needed to make the communication feel real.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on clichéd markers like "dust motes" and "golden shadows." While the "laboratory of lost sounds" is an evocative concept, the description remains static and does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "timeless observatory" is conceptually distinct but remains an abstract backdrop because there is no specific scene to ground it in sensory immediacies. The setting does not constrain a specific choice or create tactical friction, functioning instead as a passive container for the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with vivid but slightly purple descriptors ("incessant dance," "trembling shadows"). While atmospheric, the environment remains a static backdrop that does not constrain the characters' choices or influence the scene's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting relies on purple abstraction ("amber silence," "captured sunset") rather than concrete, tactile detail. The environment fails to constrain the character's choices or provide specific interaction beyond the central magical object.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "blooming library" is evocative and establishes a clear atmosphere, though it leans toward generic high-fantasy tropes ("crystal dome," "petal-soft leaves"). The setting provides a backdrop but does not strictly constrain Elara's choices or force tactical trade-offs. The physical environment is visualized well, but the specific mechanics of the "dusk noticer" role in this setting remain slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with clear anchors but relies on generic, "soft" sensory details that set a mood rather than constraining action. The mist and starlight function as a passive atmospheric backdrop rather than an integrated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting features generic descriptors ("quiet tower," "ancient stone") that lack sensory specificity or distinct atmosphere. While the tower is established early, it functions as a passive container for the plot rather than an active pressure on the character. The spatial relationship between the coffee cup, the hourglass, and the wall is functional but clinically described.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting details are functional but generic ("dusty beam," "dim red light," "heavy reel"). While the booth is integral to the action, the description relies on standard vintage tropes without specific, sensory surprises that would ground the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the descriptions are consistent with a fantasy tone, they rely heavily on generic ethereal adjectives ("celestial," "ethereal," "aurora-lit") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character. The setting functions as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than an environment that forces choices or creates obstacles. Sensory details are largely visual and abstract, missing the grit of a lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting details rely on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "surreal," "divergent") rather than concrete sensory grounding. The "glowing dune" is described repeatedly but lacks textural specificity or interaction beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.2)
    The mechanical rainforest is described with some specific imagery (copper needles, solar-panel leaves) that grounds the aesthetic. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for the puzzle rather than an environment that pressures the character or constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting consists of high-fantasy staples (mist, liquid twilight, double moons) that provide atmosphere but do not constrain action or force tactical decisions. While the "water that seemed neither liquid nor vapor" attempts distinctness, the environment largely functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "cobalt fortress" and "ethereal blue light" establish a distinct visual atmosphere. However, the external threat of "chaos" remains abstract, failing to ground the sanctuary's protective value in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("forgotten knowledge," "crystalline dome," "dust motes") that lack specific, tactile grounding. The "graceful collapse" is described but doesn't force tactical changes until the very end. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the isolation of the monitoring station is palpable and constrains Marina's perspective effectively. Sensory details like the "crashing waves" and "digital coastlines" ground the abstract data in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting contains generic sci-fi elements ("repair drones," "crippled freighter") that feel like set dressing rather than constraints. The juxtaposition of the stone circle within the repair bay is jarring and unintegrated. Sensory details are often filtered through abstract interpretation ("hands that understood the language of the universe").

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting description leans on generic markers ("ancient energy," "steamy environment") rather than specific, sensory details that constrain the character. The volcanic context is a backdrop that does not pressure the action or force tactile engagement beyond the initial touch.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on romanticized generics ("churning sea," "exotic flowers") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The arboretum and cliff serve as a static backdrop for the internal monologue rather than an active environment that forces tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on standard literary tropes (dust motes, high window, candlelight) without constraining choices or providing unique interaction. While atmospheric, the descriptions remain decorative and do not substantively pressure the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established but relies on generic descriptors ("uniquely formed," "meticulously carved") rather than specific details that constrain action. The wind-carved shelter provides atmosphere but acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.0)
    The specific setting phrase "echoing library under snow" is repeated verbatim four times in a short text, breaking immersion and signaling mechanical insertion. While the "amber-light" image is nice, the environment does not constrain the character's choices or offer tactical resources beyond generic isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with clear visual markers ("glass-domed," "desert heat"), but the environment functions only as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. Sensory details are often filtered through abstract assertions rather than immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "sound wave garden" is an imaginative concept, but the execution relies heavily on abstract, synesthetic descriptions ("visible ripples," "dancing, transparent flora") that lack concrete, tactile grounding. While the imagery is consistent, the setting functions as a passive backdrop for the character's success rather than an environment that exerts pressure or constraints on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting is established through the verbatim repetition of the phrase "echoing observatory above the clouds" rather than concrete sensory details or spatial constraints. The environment does not pressure the character's choices or reflect her internal state; it serves merely as a static backdrop. Specificity is replaced by generic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmosphere of the "laboratory of lost sounds" is evocative, blending techno-mysticism with sensory detail. However, the fusion of "constellation tattooist" and "firmware engineer" feels disjointed, as the setting doesn't organically support the dual occupation beyond aesthetic cues.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details ("mist-shrouded," "crescent of stone"), but remains a generic fantasy backdrop. The "unlearning" is an abstract concept that never manifests as a concrete physical reality or constraint within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("shattered sky," "cracked stones," "broken archways") rather than specific, lived-in details. While the mosaic is a focal point, the surrounding world feels abstract and atmospheric rather than tangible. The sensory details often drift into sentiment ("chilling silence") rather than grounding the reader in the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the setting is established, the descriptions rely heavily on generic fantasy tropes ("mystic orchard," "enchanted trees") and abstract sensory mismatches ("scent of starlight"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the performance rather than a source of constraint or resources. The "moonlit hedge maze" lacks spatial specificity or navigational challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is functionally established, but the descriptions are marred by excessive repetition of prompt phrases ("fractally precise," "static shock") that flatten the imagery. While the visual of the light painting studio is present, it serves as a passive backdrop rather than a constraining environment that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.3)
    Orientation and spatial anchoring are clear, and the coastal cave setting is established early. However, sensory details often rely on generic descriptors ("bright reds," "cool stone") rather than specific, immersive textures that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is descriptively vivid ("amber grains," "towering cliffs") but functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The warehouse does not pressure Elara's choices; the buttons are convenient props rather than environmental necessities that force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.2)
    Semantic contradiction undermines the setting: a &quot;zephyr&quot; is a gentle breeze, yet the text describes &quot;bitter wind&quot; and &quot;miniature tornadoes.&quot; Additionally, clichés like &quot;mist clinging... like a second skin&quot; weaken the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The atmospheric elements (fog, wet planks) are competent but rely on standard "gloom" tropes without specific, constraining details. While the setting is cohesive, it functions as a backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.7)
    Setting details like "scorched wasteland" and "stone cottage" remain generic placeholders. While "phototropic to kindness" is a striking concept, it functions as an abstract assertion rather than a grounded, sensory reality that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the atmosphere is lyrical, the physical reality breaks suspension of disbelief. Reflecting moonlight with a small metal gauge to "fill the space" with light functions on cartoon physics rather than grounded reality. The harbor setting lacks specific, tactile grounding, feeling more like a stage set for the required phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "tidal library" and "breathing lungs" offer vivid imagery, but the setting largely serves as window dressing for internal monologue. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts; it merely reflects her mood.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting is established through the verbatim repetition of the prompt phrase ("lotus temple rising from a massive lily pond") rather than sensory exploration. While the visual of the rain is mentioned, the environment acts as a static backdrop for the epiphany rather than a source of constraints or friction. The repetition of "prismatic quiet" flattens the atmosphere into a single note rather than a developing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    Setting details are functional but lean on generic tropes ("vintage equipment," "blinking monitor") without creating distinct atmospheric pressure. While the radio station anchors the action, the environment does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    Setting details are functional but lean on generic fantasy tropes ("ancient walls," "faded runes," "stone pillars"). The environment provides a backdrop but rarely constrains choice or offers specific, non-visual sensory friction.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is generic ("shadowed," "mist"), and the physical reality is ignored (preservation of silk outdoors). The phrase "furrowed hush" is repeated verbatim, breaking immersion. The environment does not offer resistance; it merely holds the clues waiting to be picked up.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.7)
    Specifics like "mudflats" and "shipwrecked journals" offer grounding, but "blue light" and "soft chime" are generic sci-fi defaults. The environment functions largely as a backdrop for exposition rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting functions as a psychedelic backdrop rather than a physical space with constraints; the construction site and scaffold wrap act as convenient magical tools rather than grounded reality. The sensory details are filtered through heavy abstraction ("cosmic language"), distancing the reader from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The circus train setting is visually distinct and conceptually aligned, but the description leans on overt meta-commentary ("a metaphor perhaps"). The atmosphere is flattened by the verbatim repetition of "dusky harmony" rather than sensory evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is a generic "white room" filled with abstract nouns ("solace," "understanding") rather than concrete sensory details. While the observatory is established, the descriptions are clichéd ("glass dome," "complex array") and do not constrain the characters' choices. The environment feels like a stage set rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details are abstract and generic ("ancient magic," "chaotic energy") rather than sensory. The environment functions as a backdrop but rarely constrains the character's physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "miniature maze" is a strong image, the setting description is repetitive, using "cobalt" and "blue" four times each. The environment functions largely as a static backdrop until the shrinking sequence, lacking tactile interaction in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "catacomb orchard" concept—roots growing from bones—is vivid and effectively anchors the fantasy setting. However, the physical reality is occasionally undermined by abstract descriptions like "feathers of resolve" that blur the sensory experience. The atmosphere is consistent but leans heavily on adjectival telling.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The technical details regarding the speaker cloth (120 thread count, aluminum vs. silver) are excellent, grounding the story in specific expertise. The quarry setting serves as a functional mirror for the protagonist's internal "hollowed" state, though the description "smelled of dust and resignation" is a cliché opener.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    Specific details like "VAT 9529," "Uruk period," and the visual of the "magnetic arbor" successfully ground the speculative elements in a tangible texture. The setting descriptions are vivid, though the lack of a concrete scene limits the environment's ability to constrain the character's immediate physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The tidal atrium is a vivid, specific setting with strong sensory details like the "crystalline ceiling" and "liquid story-silver." However, the interaction between the water and the books is resolved through magical convenience ("slightly altered yet more complete") rather than physical logic or tension. The setting is atmospheric but lacks the grit to act as a true pressure cooker for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting descriptions rely on generic tropes ("concrete corridors," "ethereal blue light") rather than specific, lived-in sensory details that constrain the character. While the crystal cave and bunker provide a backdrop, they function as static sets rather than active environments that pressure choices or reflect the narrative's thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with standard "abandoned place" tropes (ivy clawing, dust motes dancing) that lack fresh sensory specificity. While the station provides a backdrop, the transition to the "service tunnels" and the underground river feels spatially vague and convenient. The atmosphere leans into melodrama rather than grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the atmosphere is coherent, it relies heavily on generic fantasy abstraction ("spectral garments," "ethereal glow," "impenetrable density") rather than grounding specificity. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker; the "mist" and "library" offer no physical resistance to the character's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific sensory details like "mulberry-hued drapes" and "microscopic fractures" that ground the magical elements. The heat of the conservatory and the "arctic light" effectively create an atmosphere that pressures the biological elements of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("crystalline walls," "velvet of night") that lack specific, tactile grounding. The environment is ornamental, serving as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the setting of the umbral grotto is established, the description relies on abstract, flowery metaphors ("patterns like scallop shells," "vineyard hush") rather than tactile grounding. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for introspection rather than a constraining force that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lighthouse setting is functional, providing the wind for the chimes, but relies on stock imagery like "dying embers" and "wisps of smoke." The environment serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure that shapes the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "floating rock" and "magnetic grotto" are established early but remain visual backdrops rather than tactile environments that constrain choices. The "sycamore hush" sets a mood but essentially pauses the world rather than interacting with the characters' physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "towers of bleached bone" provide a striking visual anchor, but the setting operates as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The phrase "energy signature" creates a jarring register slip against the established mythic/archaic tone of the canyon.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The visual of the garden folly suspended between cloud layers is distinct and imaginative. However, the mechanics of the world feel convenient—specifically "mist walking" accommodating physics breaks—rather than grounded in a consistent rule set that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details are vivid ("oil lamp," "indigo waves," "threads of starlight"), anchoring the fantasy effectively. The sunken library setting is distinct, though the imagery leans toward standard genre tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established with basic sensory details ("ambered," "transparent alumina"), but the descriptions suffer from repetition and lack interactional depth. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker; the "obsidian slab" and "coins" are present but don't constrain the protagonist's movement or tactics in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.2)
    The observatory setting provides a functional backdrop with consistent, albeit generic, gothic atmosphere (dust, crumbling walls). While the "scattered light" and "central mechanism" interact with the plot, the details feel decorative rather than constraining the protagonist's options in a tangible way.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually distinct, and the specific mechanic of "dripping rates" effectively integrates the environment into the plot's resolution. However, the descriptions tilt toward decorative fantasy imagery ("liquid sky") rather than sensory details that ground the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details lean on "literary" stock phrases ("muted shades of violet," "weathered hands," "miraculously preserved") rather than specific, grounding constraints. The setting functions as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of physical pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting descriptions are ornamental and abstract ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic") rather than concrete or constraining. The environment functions as a passive, pretty backdrop that exerts no pressure on the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting of a "nocturnal arbor" above the "cloud sea" is the story's strongest element, establishing a clear and interesting vertical geography. However, the description remains static; the environment doesn't evolve or pressure the character in new ways as the crisis mounts, merely serving as a backdrop for the repetitive action loops.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "floating dojo" and "obsidian pedestal" provide visual interest, but the setting remains a static backdrop that doesn't constrain the character's choices. Descriptions like "fragments of reality" remain abstract concepts rather than sensory details that ground the reader in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit purple, descriptions ("flow with silver," "hush of possibility"). While the atmosphere is consistent, the "haven" functions primarily as a static backdrop for contemplation rather than an environment that constrains action or forces adaptation. The sensory details tend toward the ornamental rather than the functional.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The auditory landscape is vivid and specific, effectively grounding the "symphony" concept. However, the physical setting feels somewhat generic—a "household" and "tunnel" that exist primarily as stage sets for the prompt's metaphorical requirements rather than lived-in spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting provides a functional atmospheric backdrop with "frozen roses" and "indigo" light, but the description often relies on standard fantasy tropes ("cities of glass," "liquid starlight"). While the environment reacts to the magic, it functions more as a static stage for the light show than a source of constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists largely of generic fantasy signifiers ("glowing particles", "twilight dew", "ancient wisdom") that lack tactile specificity or grounding. While the "ember nexus" is established, it functions as a passive backdrop rather than an environment that constrains the character's choices or provides specific tools that shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The suspended city is conceptually striking but functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of tactical constraint or resource. While atmospheric details like "silvery glow" and "rusted antennas" are present, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices or interact physically with the tuning process beyond providing altitude.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.1)
    Descriptions rely on abstract, "purple" adjectives ("ethereal," "spectral," "chronal") rather than grounding sensory details. While the visual of the grotto is established, it feels like a generic fantasy backdrop that does not constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting details are generic and abstract ("walls seemed to bend," "colors... vibrant") rather than specific and grounded; the "optical illusion" aspect is told rather than shown through spatial confusion or sensory conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    The benthic setting provides some vivid imagery ("bioluminescent algae"), but it functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The environment does not force Kael's hand or complicate his physical reality during the critical moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric elements ("ethereal fog," "twilight") effectively support the supernatural premise. However, the specific setting tag "mist-clad atrium" is repeated verbatim, and the environment feels slightly generic outside the immediate sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric imagery ("salt-stained concrete," "fibrous veins") creates a coherent mood, though the setting functions more as a static backdrop than a source of pressure. Some descriptions lean toward generic "abandoned facility" tropes rather than specific, lived-in details.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    The opal observatory offers vivid aesthetic details ("iridescent walls," "captured auroras"), but the setting functions only as a static backdrop rather than exerting pressure on the protagonist. The "digital limbo" physics are established but do not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the underground garden concept is clear, details rely on generic tropes ("bioluminescent mushrooms") and abstract category errors ("scent of frostbitten hope") rather than concrete sensory grounding that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting contains evocative visual markers ("sky the color of aged copper"), but the "gap between knowing and understanding" is treated as a vague geographical label rather than a felt reality. The environment feels like a static backdrop for the fetch-quest plot rather than a pressure-cooker that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "cobalt" lighting and "thunderstorm in a bottle" create a distinct visual atmosphere that anchors the scene well. Specific sensory details like the "brittle hush" and "scarred plastic table" effectively ground the exchange in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the contrast between the rusted train and the oasis is legible, the description relies on generic intensifiers ("ethereal light," "impossible colors") rather than grounding particulars. The spatial logic is dismissed with the phrase "defied physics," preventing the setting from acting as a concrete constraint on the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on abstract descriptors ("impossible curves," "defied Euclidean understanding") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character. A logic friction exists between the "quiet at three in the morning" opening and the subsequent description of multiple "patrons" moving past her, which disrupts the specific solitude established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    Setting details rely on generic atmospheric descriptors ("whispering," "murmuring") rather than concrete elements that constrain action or choice. The library and archipelago function as passive backdrops for the magic system rather than pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    Orientation is clear, but the setting relies on generic "cosmic" abstractions ("hush of cosmic possibility") rather than specific, grounding details. The environment provides atmosphere but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" offering distinct, atmospheric imagery. The integration of the environment into the narrative logic is solid, though the description occasionally leans into list-like structures.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "forgotten library" is atmospheric, though names like "Wall of Whispering Shadows" lean into generic fantasy tropes. The "playground swing" simile acts as a jarring anachronism that disrupts the high-fantasy tone established by royal archives and tea rituals.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting relies on high-abstraction descriptors ("verdant," "ancient," "budding hope") rather than concrete sensory particulars that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "prism sanctuary" is established with vivid, if slightly generic, crystalline imagery ("fractured rainbows," "starlight"). The setting supports the magical realism tone but serves more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "rain-scoured fresco vault" offers atmospheric visuals, but the setting remains largely static and decorative. While the environment provides a backdrop for the protagonist's thoughts, it does not constrain her choices or exert pressure on the narrative outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the sunken library is evocative and atmospheric, effectively mirroring the themes of pressure and preservation. However, the physical reality of the space is somewhat thin; the "books touched by no human eyes" in a wet environment requires suspension of disbelief that isn't fully supported by the text's established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting relies on vague, high-concept descriptors ("ethereal realm," "between lightning and thunder") that lack sensory specificity or tactile grounding. While the "flower press bolt plate" offers a moment of concrete detail, the environment functions as a generic backdrop for the premise rather than a constraining physical space. There is no sensory hierarchy; details are listed rather than experienced through a POV.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is functional but generic, relying on standard steampunk/fantasy descriptors like "crystalline walls" and "icebound spire." While the verticality is established, the sensory details are often clichés ("cold against her skin") that fail to deepen the atmosphere or constrain the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting of the gondola and the cloud formations is visually distinct and anchors the scene effectively. However, the sensory experience of high-altitude exposure is muted by poetic abstractions ("cirrus wisps danced"), reducing the visceral impact of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The hollowed tree library is established with vivid, tactile details ("spiraling grain," "carved leaf patterns") that ground the scene, though technical descriptors like "fractally precise" clash with the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are present but generic to the steampunk genre ("brass," "wood," "antique airship"), functioning as set dressing rather than constraining choice. The "stranded luminance" remains abstract and visual-only, lacking sensory texture or physical rules that would ground the discovery in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting provides standard fantasy imagery ("crystalline walls," "suspended animation") that serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint. While visually distinct, the "frozen library" never forces a specific tactical choice or hinders the protagonist's progress in a way that matters to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.2)
    Setting details ("floating rock arches," "violet sunsets") remain distant, postcard-like visuals that do not constrain character tactics or shape the narrative path. The environment is a passive backdrop rather than an active force pressuring choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Imagery is vivid and specific (ceramic cheekbone, threads of starlight), effectively framing the ritual. However, the required phrase "pane of hush" is used awkwardly as a physical medium, slightly disrupting the atmospheric consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy markers ("twisted trees," "ancient stone") without sensory specificity or spatial logic. The "labyrinth" functions as a flat backdrop rather than a tactical environment that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    The ravine and river function primarily as a metaphor generator rather than a physical space that constrains choice. While the visual of the braided channel is clear, the setting elements exist solely to mirror the protagonist's internal state, lacking independent existence or sensory grit beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, cohesive imagery ("glass trees," "crystalline fruits") that fits the ethereal tone. However, the descriptions feel slightly generic for the "magical shop" trope and largely ornamental, providing atmosphere without offering constraints or tools that strictly dictate the character's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.3)
    The central image of a coral icebound pavilion in the desert is imaginative and vivid. However, the description is marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt keywords ("sturdy," "brittle") which flattens the atmosphere into a checklist exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established but remains generic ("vast shadows," "dusty box"), functioning as a backdrop rather than a constraint on action. While the clock tower is central, the details (like minerals in silo paint) feel contrived to force plot points rather than organic to the world. The environment does not create friction or limit the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric tropes ("silver light," "ancient rock walls") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character's actions. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the internal monologue rather than an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting of the gravity-inverted grotto offers potential, but the atmosphere is thinned by the verbatim repetition of descriptors ("clandestinely luminous," "serpentine grotto"). While the visual of floating water is clear, the sensory details often feel like checklist insertions rather than organic observations filtered through a specific POV. The environment serves as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with specific details like the "siskin alder grove" and the "porcelain insulator," creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the environment feels static and does not actively constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics beyond providing the raw material for her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "polished basalt" offers some texture, the "magnetic nexus" remains abstract and vague ("energies visible to no one"). The setting functions more as a backdrop for exposition than an interactive environment that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the "vibrational" imagery has potential, the atmosphere is undermined by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "shadowed workshop under stars" three times. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the canopy setting is established, it functions as a generic backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources. The phrase "olfactorily sensitive senses" is a tautology that disrupts immersion, and the sensory details often feel like list-checking.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.4)
    Imagery is vivid ("silver serpents," "latticed shadows"), but the setting functions largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces tactical trade-offs. The physics of the inversion are described but do not impede the pilot's "practiced precision," leaving the environment feeling decorative rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "towering labyrinth of shipping containers" provides a coherent visual anchor and atmosphere consistent with the premise. While the setting is visually distinct, it functions primarily as a backdrop rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist's tactical options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The glacial cathedral and synesthetic effects are described with vivid sensory detail, though the imagery relies heavily on generic "ethereal" descriptors. The setting facilitates the ritual but doesn't provide gritty, specific constraints that force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("telluric energies," "pearlescence") and lacks tactile grounding beyond the driftwood. The repeated, awkward phrasing of "avalanchingly quiet" (appearing three times) distracts from immersion, and the landscape feels like a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting imagery is vivid ("topaz-laden walls," "lead type pieces"), establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, the environment remains largely ornamental; the vanishing stars and workshop tools provide mood but do not constrain Elara's choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic visual descriptors ("aurora-lit," "fireflies") that serve as a backdrop rather than forcing tactical decisions. The phrase "across the fade from memory to myth" is inserted ornamentally without grounding the world's physical rules or geography. The environment feels disconnected from the character's physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)
    The juxtaposition of a high-fantasy "quartz arbor" and a mundane "car window" creates a jarring, unaddressed tonal clash. While visually specific, the setting details function primarily to validate the magic system rather than offering constraints or atmosphere that shapes the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "rummage sale box" creates a jarring tonal anachronism against the mythic "ancient bamboo" backdrop, shattering the established fable atmosphere. While the description of "raveling silence" is evocative, the specific physical environment becomes disjointed by these forced elements.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the visual concepts (azure glow, floating arches) are imaginative, they remain static backdrops rather than tactile environments that constrain choice. The setting is described in broad strokes ("masterpiece of suspended stone") suitable for a legend but lacks the sensory specificity required for a literary scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the setting is established, reliance on exhausted clichés ("dust motes danced," "time itself had paused") flattens the atmosphere. The alternate timelines are presented as a museum list rather than inhabited spaces with sensory distinctness. The "sensory" aspect of the protagonist's role is claimed but not demonstrated through unique perceptual details.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.3)
    Atmospheric details like the smell of oil and salt work well, but the logic of a stone stack balanced with "impossible precision" inside a tower defined by "constant vibration" creates an unaddressed physical contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    The lighthouse and "swirling nebulas" are described vividly, but the setting largely serves as a backdrop rather than constraining action. The specific mechanics of the "glass lantern wick" and "emerald beams" provide some grounding, though they feel slightly list-like.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The floating tea house is a visually distinct concept, but the setting functions largely as a decorative backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices. The sensory details are vivid but often lean into abstraction rather than grounding the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmospheric detailing of the stormlit tower and the specific history of the floorboard grounds the mystical elements effectively. The setting actively participates in the ritual, though some descriptors lean toward purple prose ("slicing through," "knitted his skin").

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like "cold mica" and "phosphorescent flora" establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, descriptors like "endless night" and "mirror world" lean on generic fantasy tropes without specific, tangible constraints that force character adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described through generic tropes ("ancient texts," "spines of books") and abstract phrases ("nestled paradoxes") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. The "hidden in plain sight" aspect is stated but not utilized to create pressure or tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.7)
    Atmospheric details like the "wild sages" and rain on the "tin roof" establish a solid mood. However, the immersion is broken by the awkward insertion of abstract prompt phrasing ("heuristically gentle approach") into physical description, and the "vanished bakery" remains a told concept rather than a felt absence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "frozen library" setting provides a basic visual frame, but the atmosphere is flattened by the verbatim repetition of "quartz hush" and abstract adjectives like "ethereal." The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that influence the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting consists of generic pirate tropes (parrots, rum barrels, rotting piers) that lack sensory specificity or freshness. The atmosphere is described with told labels ("comforting unease") rather than evoked through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    Specific imagery like "voting algorithms being counted in real-time" offers a flash of originality, but the setting largely relies on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "luminous"). The environment is described rather than interacted with; the "lavender bluff" feels like a stage set rather than a pressure cooker for the scene's events.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is rendered through high-flown adjectives ("auroral," "luminous," "subterranean") rather than grounded sensory details, making the cave feel like a generic fantasy backdrop. The description focuses on ornamental phrases ("melodies of discovery") that stall momentum rather than specific interactions with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of Xylosa is vividly described with sensory details like the "weakly humming" filtration and "liquid gold" ink. However, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop; the toxic atmosphere is a constant condition rather than a pressure that forces a specific, difficult choice in this window. The workshop feels grounded, but the world outside remains a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is abstract and ethereal ("ether," "whispering bluff") without the concrete sensory details needed to ground the reader. Time and place are generalized ("generations ago," "winter months"), creating a distance that prevents immersion. The environment acts as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glass dome environment provides solid constraints and vivid imagery ("bioluminescent petals"). However, descriptors like "colors that shouldn't exist" lean on generic shorthand rather than specific sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("vibrant courtyard," "steaming cups of coffee," "rising sun") that fail to ground the story in a specific, sensory reality. While the "sanctuary" concept is present, the environment lacks the gritty, specific details needed to make the "outside intrusion" feel like a genuine threat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "sunken laboratory" is established with standard descriptors ("dripping pipes," "coral-encrusted"), but the setting rarely constrains the action. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the dance rather than an active force that complicates the protagonist's goal. Spatial choreography is vague beyond the general idea of moving between instruments.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "salt crystal growing chamber" and "frozen light" offer vivid, specific imagery that grounds the magical elements. However, the "gleaming silence" refrain feels slightly forced, and the physical reality of the "gravity pockets" remains abstract (described only as resistance) rather than sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.8)
    Setting details are generic ("quiet brook," "smooth stones") and repeated verbatim, failing to ground the magical elements in concrete reality. The atmosphere relies on abstract synesthesia ("silver," "whispered secrets") rather than specific sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting details are atmospheric ("stones settled," "glittering below") but do not constrain the characters' choices or exert pressure on the scene. The rooftop garden serves as a passive backdrop for dialogue rather than an active environmental force that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is a generic "white room" draped in a single descriptor ("velvet") that is repeated to the point of semantic satiation. There is no spatial geometry, sensory hierarchy, or interaction with the environment beyond placing crystals on moss. The "velvet garden" feels like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the "pearl twilight" provides some atmosphere, the setting feels generic and functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The phrase "wisely enduring home" is a grammatically awkward insertion that disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting ("serpentine nexus," "canyon") remains a generic, abstract backdrop that never constrains the protagonist’s choices or exerts pressure. Sensory details are repetitive and cliché ("silent as falling dust"), failing to ground the reader in a specific, tangible physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.5)
    Settings like the "glacier shrine" and "frigid waters" are presented as generic backdrops without sensory specificity or constraints that shape character choice. The environment feels like a white room decorated with adjectives rather than a lived-in space that exerts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmosphere is consistent but leans heavily on abstract pairings ("moss and mystery") rather than concrete sensory grounding. The "moon paths" and "whispering parapet" operate as vague fantasy elements that decorate the setting without constraining the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.2)
    Setting details are generic ("gnarled bark," "ancient stone pedestal," "toxic soil") and lack sensory specificity beyond the visual. The environment is described in broad strokes rather than interacting with the character to constrain choices or create atmosphere. The "wasteland" serves as a backdrop, not a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting concepts (floatstone mountain, cobalt glass) are imaginative but function as a static backdrop for exposition rather than interacting with the character in a specific moment. The description is generalized ("frequented," "stormlit") and lacks the sensory specificity of a unique, time-bound event.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "feral loft" is an intriguing concept, the spatial logic is muddled (a "natural ceiling" of sand vs. a "wooden ceiling" with cracks). Sensory details lean toward clichés ("gentle tinkle," "mournful warble," "dust motes dancing") rather than fresh, specific observation that constrains character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details like "frozen seaweed" and the "low hum" provide a competent visual and tactile baseline. However, the setting acts largely as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the environment does not force trade-offs or shape the protagonist's tactics significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake provide a vivid backdrop, but the descriptions often lean into ornamentation ("polished obsidian mirror") rather than constraining choice. While the setting is visually clear, it functions more as a stage for internal monologue than an active pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sensory details of the tunnel (damp earth, mildew, pooled water) are functional and ground the scene early. However, the setting operates mostly as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or complication; the environment does not constrain Maya’s choices or impede her investigation significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details ("dusty window," "scent of aged wood") that support the atmosphere. However, the descriptions rely on standard antique shop tropes rather than specific, novel observation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic steampunk tropes ("brass and steam," "gears") without specific, tactile details that constrain the character's choices. The "acid sea" is a backdrop that pauses for a pathetic fallacy moment but exerts no physical pressure on the scene. Descriptions like "magnificent device" are abstract placeholders.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies almost exclusively on digital metaphors ("digital necropolis," "labyrinth") rather than concrete physical grounding. We lack a sense of the immediate environment—the room, the light, the hardware—until the alarms sound at the very end. The "archive" feels like a concept rather than a place that constrains the character's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting provides some distinct visual anchors ("gnarled apple trees," "shifting ice floes") that establish a clear atmosphere. However, the description leans toward the ornamental ("diamond-like facets," "ethereal brilliance") and does not materially constrain the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    The drift-ice marina provides a vivid atmospheric backdrop, but the cold and ice function more as metaphors than physical obstacles affecting the character's movement or choices. The setting details are competent but feel like window dressing for the internal monologue rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting details are generic ("amber pavilion," "autumn leaves," "harvest moon") and lack sensory specificity or interaction. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "kinetic parapet" and "murmuring pavilion" offer a reactive, living environment that enriches the scene. The setting details actively respond to the protagonist’s ritual, grounding the magical elements in the physical architecture effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established but relies heavily on clichés ("silent testament to time," "nature reclaiming") rather than specific, lived-in sensory details that constrain choice. The environment functions as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than an active pressure on the characters. Orientation is clear, but the texture remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on "shadowed library" clichés (dancing dust motes, slanted light) without specific, constraining details that would force the character's hand. While the crystal is focused upon, the wider environment is generic and fails to exert pressure on the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the "fog sculpture garden" provides a functional backdrop, the descriptions often rely on abstract similes ("like ships in a misty harbor") rather than concrete, tactile details that pressure the character. The specific sculptures are described vaguely ("spirals and lines"), failing to ground the fantastical elements in a vivid physical reality. The setting serves as a container for the plot rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting logic is incoherent; "above the clouds" implies high-altitude wind/weather, yet the deck is "silent," and "putting the clock outside" treats the stratosphere like a garden patio. Abstract descriptors ("ephemeral," "luminous") replace concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established through repeated abstract labels ("radiant haven," "above the clouds") rather than sensory interaction that constrains choice. "Sterile room" and "radiant haven" clash without resolving into a specific, grounded sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional and establishes a clear visual, but relies on generic high-fantasy tropes (glowing symbols, floating isle) without specific sensory grounding. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance; it serves merely as a backdrop for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting contains vivid visual details (upside-down blooms, firefly light), though some descriptions feel list-like. The "moonpetals" integrate well into the ritual action, but the "Victorian-era botanical engineering" reads more as backstory flavor than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is described with vivid, if somewhat flowery, imagery ("shimmering with moisture," "serpent carved by ancient waters"). However, it functions primarily as a passive backdrop and does not constrain the character's choices or exert pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting of the moss-reclaimed data center is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid solarpunk imagery. However, the environment functions more as a static backdrop for the protagonist's projections than as a source of pressure or distinct sensory friction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is a collection of generic signifiers ("ancient trees," "crumbling stone ruins") overlaid with heavy abstraction ("suggesting a new thread"). The "feral nexus" is never concretely realized as a physical space with distinct geography or sensory texture. The environment fails to constrain the character or offer resources for action, serving only as a passive screen for projection.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.3)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("verdant arbor," "ancient trees," "golden light") that fail to constrain action or choice. Sensory details are cliché-ridden and vague ("soft luminescence," "curious objects"), functioning as a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Specific sensory details like "frost-encased berries" and "peeling bark" ground the scene effectively. However, the setting primarily serves as a resource for props rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is well-integrated; the cavern's physical properties (marble veins, reflective surfaces) actively constrain and enable the solution. While the "wounded season" concept is atmospheric, the specific use of the environment as a tool elevates this category.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting contains vivid visual details ("bronze depths," "metallic reflections"), but the environment feels static and does not force significant tactical choices. The atmosphere is weakened by the rote repetition of descriptive tags like "shingled hush," which begin to feel like labels rather than immersive sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is competently established with "fractured light" and "rain-beaded" glass, creating a consistent visual mood. However, the setting remains largely static and ornamental, serving as a backdrop rather than exerting causal pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "kinetic lagoon" is an evocative concept, but the description relies on abstract, flowery modifiers ("iridescent debris," "crystallized moon fruit") rather than tactile grounding. The setting functions as a static, symbolic backdrop rather than a physical environment that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established but relies on generic descriptors ("dusty console," "gleaming," "sleeping giants") that lack sensory specificity or unique texture. The spaceport feels like a skin over a generic abandoned building rather than a place with specific, constrained geography.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "soundless sanctuary" is established, the prompt-mandated phrasing ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain") is inserted verbatim three times, disrupting immersion. The setting feels like a static container for these keywords rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("rotted floorboards," "fading orange sky"), functioning as a passive backdrop rather than forcing adaptation. While the location is established, it does not constrain the character's movement or choices in a specific, tangible way.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric markers ("fog," "snow," "weathered planks") without specific, tactile grounding that constrains action. The "golden dock" is a striking visual label that remains unexplained and unconnected to the plot logic.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies heavily on the repeated phrase "shadowed garden" (appearing five times), which flattens the atmosphere into a label rather than a sensory reality. While the autumn imagery is consistent, the lack of specific, non-repetitive detail limits immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The vertical geography of the "suspended palace" anchored to "stone teeth" provides a strong, specific visual anchor. The sensory details of the transformation (scent, texture) effectively ground the abstract conflict in the physical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established through the repetition of specific phrases ("obsidian lagoon," "black sand") rather than sensory exploration, making the world feel like a static stage set. While the volcanic elements are present, they function more as symbolic tokens than as a lived-in environment that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting provides a generic atmospheric backdrop that yields passively to the protagonist's needs rather than exerting pressure. While visually consistent, the environment relies on the repetitive "defiant hush" tag, and the "breadcrumbs" mechanic reduces the city to a simple instructional pathway.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic, abstract cosmic imagery ("stardust," "liquid light") that provides backdrop but does not constrain action. There is no tactile grounding; the environment functions as a passive stage rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the greenhouse at dusk with dust motes and butterflies is visually distinct and effectively establishes atmosphere. While vivid, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop; it does not impose physical constraints or force trade-offs that alter Elias's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting details ("tidal obsidian ridge") serve as backdrop rather than constraint, failing to pressure the protagonist's choices. The "pause in a pendulum's swing" operates on fairy-tale logic that sits awkwardly beside the mechanical repair plot.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    Descriptive phrases are repetitive ("cobalt silo" appears four times; "velveteen gloom" three times), creating a stagnant atmosphere. Sensory details rely on abstract similes ("water over stones") rather than concrete, grounded interaction. The setting feels like a disconnected stage for the prompt elements rather than a cohesive environment.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic descriptors ("dark tooth," "iridescent blues") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The "obsidian spire" acts as a magical amplifier ("natural conductor") to facilitate the plot rather than a physical space the character must navigate or endure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.8)
    Spatial geography is incoherent due to the conflicting locations (apartment vs. hillside alcove) introduced without movement between them. The setting details are generic ("mist-shrouded," "faint shimmer") and functional rather than sensory or constraining. The "ember alcove" feels like a detached concept rather than an inhabited space that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the "Vanishing Point Gallery" is an evocative concept, the description relies too heavily on abstract qualities ("recede into infinity") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character's actions. The setting serves as a thematic backdrop rather than an active environment that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting of the submerged city and sewers is established with some sensory detail ("murky waters," "glinted in lantern light"), but the description is somewhat generic. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint, and the repeated phrase "sedimentary layers" distracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.8)
    Setting details like the "velvet library" and "autumn shadows" are repetitive, static backdrops that do not constrain specific choices or evolve with the narrative. The lack of a concrete scene prevents the environment from interacting with the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting details are functional but lean on atmospheric clichés ("dust motes dancing," "cracked glass") rather than specific constraints that shape the action. The environment provides a backdrop but does not pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.8)
    The tower setting is established with functional but generic descriptors ("gleaming," "charred") that do not constrain the characters' tactics or movement. The "nectar dusk" atmosphere feels like a cosmetic label applied to the scene rather than a sensory reality that influences the mood or action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmosphere is cohesive, and the "orris root" is a specific, grounding detail. However, descriptive phrasing becomes repetitive ("streetlights daydreamed" appears in three separate paragraphs), and the setting feels more decorative than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    The underwater imagery is vivid ("delicate corals," "bioluminescent light"), establishing a serene atmosphere. However, the setting acts only as a backdrop; the physical constraints of the deep ocean (pressure, oxygen, cold) do not pressure the characters or influence their tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is a generic "white room" infinite staircase with standard sensory details (stone, void, silence). The environment functions as a container but does not pressure choices or offer specific, gritty textures that ground the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details rely on generic descriptors ("bustling city," "lost to time") and repetitive tags ("smog-choked") without constraining action. The environment provides static atmosphere rather than shaping the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.8)
    The grotto setting is visually distinct, but the atmosphere relies heavily on repetitive adjectives ("rosewater dread" appears three times). The sensory details are vivid but feel decorative rather than constraining the characters' tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tide serves effectively as a ticking clock, firmly anchoring the scene in time and pressure. However, descriptors like "mysterious lighthouse" remain generic labels, and the setting acts more as a static stage for the puzzle than a source of textural friction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    The funhouse setting provides standard genre furniture (mirrors, velvet, dust) but fails to constrain choices or create specific atmospheric pressure. The "lingering luminance" is a functional visual motif, but the environment remains a static backdrop rather than an active force shaping the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the floating driftwood orchard is imaginative and visually established with some clear sensory details ("blue hour," "mercury"). However, the environment feels somewhat static; the setting serves as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of physical constraints that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the turtle-city concept is established, the sensory details remain generic ("ancient patterns," "salt air") and fail to constrain action. The sudden appearance of a secret chamber feels like a geometric convenience rather than a tangible part of a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details ("ivy," "crumbling stone," "Victorian architecture") are generic and function as a static visual backdrop rather than a constraint. The environment offers no tactile resistance or atmospheric pressure to shape the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is visually clear but feels like a static stage set; the "preservation cubes" introduce a sci-fi element that clashes with the "antique inkwell" aesthetic without grounding. The drawbridge mechanic isolates him but does not pressure the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is functional but generic ("ancient books," "towering shelves"), lacking sensory specificity beyond the lighting effects. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or force tactical shifts; the waterproof nature of the library is mentioned but not utilized.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy markers ("ethereal place," "symphony of blossoms") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character. The "architectural paradox" is stated conceptually but not visualized clearly enough to ground the reader in the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a collection of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("mutated vegetation," "twisted metal") that fails to exert specific pressure on the protagonist. The "floating observatory" is a compelling concept rendered as a static starting point; neither the ruins nor the sanctuary constrain the action in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.8)
    The inclusion of a "type foundry matrix chip" in a cosmic sci-fi setting creates a jarring terminological clash that breaks immersion, feeling like an unassimilated prompt constraint. The oxymoronic "brilliant dimness," while atmospheric in intent, is confusing visually and repeated to the point of semantic satiation. Sensory details are largely generic ("weathered stone," "twilight blue") and fail to ground the "cosmic" elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "cobalt terrace" offers a distinct visual anchor, but the "forgotten shore" and "upper world" remain generic and underdeveloped. Sensory details are frequently filtered through distant narration ("he recalled," "he knew") rather than presented as immediate, tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on atmospheric clichés ("mist swirled like forgotten ghosts," "storm-worn parapet") that create a generic mood rather than specific, grounded pressure. The "moon phase tracker" is a concrete detail, but the environment generally serves as a backdrop rather than a constraint on the characters' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "utility poles" detail is a strong, specific grounding element that reflects the character's degradation. However, atmospheric descriptors ("clouds gathered," "mist rolling") act as generic placeholders rather than vivid sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting relies on generic sci-fi tropes (bioluminescent algae, underground caverns) that provide atmosphere but do not constrain tactics or choice. The "labyrinth" is described but functions merely as a hallway with a matching symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies on generic high-fantasy abstractions ("silver radiance," "forgotten realms," "cosmic dust") rather than specific, grounded details that constrain the character's choices. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with vague, high-level adjectives ("ethereal beauty," "midnight glade") rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. The environment does not pressure the character or constrain her movement; it serves merely as a passive backdrop for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is established via generic descriptors ("sterile universe," "dim memory") and suffers from the distracted repetition of the phrase "recycled spaceship." Sensory details are largely visual and abstract ("quantum energies," "shimmer patterns") rather than tactile or grounding. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance, serving merely as a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.7)
    The setting is established but rendered through repetitive, abstract phrases ("whispering hush," "vibrant hush") rather than concrete, sensory particulars. The "black sand beach" and "volcano" function as generic theatrical backdrops for the philosophical monologue rather than tactile environments that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "bioluminescent walls" establish a decent visual baseline, but the mechanics of the central action (painting a shadow-dependent sundial in pitch darkness) are under-imagined. The setting serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints that force tactical innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting details actively contradict the core speculative premise; describing a character &quot;gripping&quot; smooth stone in a world where &quot;friction had long since disappeared&quot; shatters credibility immediately. The sensory environment is generic fantasy (shimmering aurora, impossible colors) rather than a specific, lived-in frictionless reality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on standard dystopian tropes (oppressive regime below, storms above) without unique sensory specificity. The "Ministry of Cultural Integrity" and "uncensored stars" feel like genre placeholders rather than a specific, lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.4)
    Sensory details like the "fractured" sun and "crystalline roof" establish a visual scene, but the environment feels decorative rather than constraining. The mechanics of the needle card and sundial alignment are vague, operating on dream logic rather than physical necessity, and the setting does not force any difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.2)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("cerebral cathedral," "mangled metal") rather than concrete sensory grounding. The setting functions more as a metaphorical stage set for the theme than a physical space that constrains the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Greenhouse micro-setting functions as crucible: cracked pots, rotted stems, and dust films physically constrain where she steps and what she sees; the butterfly-wing shard literally charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her scientist bias—she catalogs decay patterns like data sets—keeping POV-filter tight. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating glass or impossible reaches. The environment’s state evolves causally (flood → rot → seedlings → butterfly), mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Canyon microclimate is specific—temperature drop, frost chemistry, starlight refracting off treated plates—each detail services the cipher method. Glass plates double as setting-objects that physically constrain her next move (they must be read at dawn). Spatial choreography is crisp: camp perimeter, rock walls, return route implied. The “drifting resonance” is evoked through echo and starlight rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered—transparent walls, ironwork, refracted light—and the tuning fork supplies a micro-setting object that charges multiple beats. Sensory selection skews repetitive (return to “frozen beauty,” “crystalline silence”) and never narrows under higher pressure; description loops rather than evolves. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment never materially constrains Elena’s tactics; the plants shimmer but do not resist or complicate. Setting supports atmosphere yet misses the 9+ gate because it does not shape the final choice or image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Submarine descent and impossible architecture are rendered through Elias’s mortician eye—“weight of the ocean pressed in, a chased stillness that mimicked his own inner landscape.” Sensory hierarchy favors pressure and light, matching his professional fixation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor re-appears as council site and launch point, its clay resonance carrying ancestral history; the silver bell micro-setting constrains timing and ritual, charging the final declaration. Sensory selection is urgent—night air “amplified quiet,” moonlit path—filtered through Elias’s tactical attention. Spatial choreography is clean: three figures emerge, packs leave, Mira returns; no floating bodies. The environment never forces a physical trade-off (no checkpoint encounter), so it stops shy of 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    Wisteria-as-waterfall and misted stones create a coherent twilight pocket that filters Elara’s soft-focus attention. Camera obscura acts as micro-setting, constraining what can be seen and when; its projection wall is the literal surface on which the past appears. The scent/temperature shifts are tied to breath cycles, so atmosphere tracks the internal cadence. However, spatial grounding inside the viaduct is vague—no sense of how far she can move or where the tripod sits relative to the drop.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The living bridge garden is vividly tactile—bridges “pulse,” vines “breathe”—and hyperbolic geometry is repeatedly named, giving the setting a memorably alien physics. Spatial anchors hold across the surreal transitions, and the final image of Elara dissolving into the structure reconfigures the garden from backdrop to agent, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Carnival redemption center provides tactile props—dust motes, overturned piano bench, empty shelves—each filtered through Elara’s furtive gaze. Micro-setting works: bench lid hides keys that unlock wall; setting steers action. Final fields image mirrors renewal, but environment does not visibly constrain escape route or tactics. Iridescent arrow feathers satisfy sensory hook yet lack causal grounding in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    “Glass panes distorted by water pressure” and “phosphorescent jellyfish in shipwrecks” are tactile, POV-filtered details that constrain every move; the cooling crystalline matrix itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Emerald tiles, marble counter, swirling silver light are selective, tactile, atmosphere-first. The station’s spatial layout stays coherent across the lift. Environment does not physically constrain her escape (no locked doors, alarms), so the 9-gate isn’t met, yet the glowing tiles mirror and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the jar) does constrain choice—its glow must be hidden—so full 8-band earned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned control room’s corroded panels, slanted dust-light, and dripping eaves function as micro-setting that supplies reclaimed copper and a metronome of drips, directly constraining Elias’s material choices and pacing his breath.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rusted shelves, broken skylight constellations, and phosphorescent glow on plaster ridges create tactile, selective density; the library’s decay doubles as emotional corollary. The seashell half functions as micro-setting, warming under palm to signal decryption climax—an object that constrains her grip and focuses attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: crouch → trace cast → stand at doors; no impossible moves. Environment never becomes mere postcard; every visual is filtered through panic-sharpened perception.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory detail—“flaking gold leaf,” “marbled hush,” “pebbles warm as living flesh”—anchors the tower room as crucible. Environment constrains choice: storm outside isolates, darkness inside becomes medium. Micro-setting (booklet, pebbles) functions as tactile map tools. Weather and spatial choreography stay stable; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystalline violin itself functions as micro-setting: its cold physically slows the robot’s joints, constraining the decision to keep playing. Twilight snowflakes levitating under sonic vibration give a tactile, luminous image that mirrors the rising interior shift. “Frozen courtyard” risks seasonal cliché, but the violin’s transparent lattice and the metallic echo of treads keep the space particular. The setting evolves—snow defies gravity, violin dissolves into light—so environment participates in closure rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Crystal forecourt after rain is evoked through echoing steps, moonlit glass, soft droplet melody—selective, POV-filtered, and thematically resonant. Micro-setting (the hidden chamber of lenses) functions as both plot pivot and symbolic repricing of “seeing.” Spatial choreography stays crisp; no floating rooms. Weather affects footing and mood, never over-described. Meets 9+ gate: the recurring “crystal whispering” recharges the final communal silence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden maze functions as micro-setting: its shifting paths deny Institute scientists quantifiable data, thereby constraining Elias’s tactics to symbolic, non-quant acts. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (leaves “seemed to lean toward his touch,” dusk light caught in glass cracks). Spatial choreography stays coherent—marble placement sites are tracked across years without drift. Weather is used sparingly but purposively: “no wind blew” during the final rustle, sharpening the uncanny charge of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    The xenobiology station is sketched with tactile selectivity: rotating light cycle, violet-skied specimen, holographic console. The magnetic nexus is both setting-piece and pivot-object, constraining Aris’s every lever choice. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy follows Aris’s mechanic lens: she notices calibration tools, magnetic distortion, and the hush of sleeping wings before ambient color. Weather is irrelevant but the twilight light-cycle is leveraged as a timing resource, not décor. No exposition dumps; world rules arrive through lever-action. The final image of the now-invisible nexus recharges the setting as a lived workspace rather than a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Flooded opera house is not backdrop; the ankle-deep water drags each footstep, dictates the piano’s shallow island, and supplies the lantern-star reflections that cue the climax. The antique program is micro-setting-as-tool: its buoyant debris and water-stained notation are tactile and choice-forcing. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The environment literally constrains how he can reach the piano and how the music is physically transmitted through water-laden air.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    11,200-foot station, blown-in snow on the cot, and the compromised window seal anchor immediacy; spectrograph arrays and barometers texture the science-oracle fusion. The botanical illustration serves as micro-setting—its marginalia literally re-configures geography. Spatial choreography is clean: cot → floor → observation room → margins of texts → night exterior. One minor slip: “an inch of snow had somehow blown through” needs earlier window damage cue to feel causal, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tunnel atmosphere is filtered through explorer POV—headlamp beam, damp breath, beaded brass—yet the valve wheel’s micro-setting supersedes geography: it constrains the climax when its warmth/pulse guides the vision. Spatial choreography clean; environment mirrored in internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Obsidian refuge and paper-swan “micro-setting” constrain every move: the refuge’s acoustics frame witness stance, the swan’s folds gate the burrow and return. Library catacombs evolve from atmospheric backdrop to active void that halts decay; the ozone scent and unblemished manuscript are tactile consequences of the silence rule. Spatial choreography is exact—no drift in body or object positions. Details are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final image (river roar vs. silence imprint), meeting the 9+ “environment charges final image” test.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sage ridge and wind-borne scent anchor early and return in the final image, constraining the duo’s open-air session and supplying the aromatic hush that frames the drumbeat. The micro-setting of the locket against Maya’s skin acts as a charged object-setting hybrid. Sensory balance is purposeful; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reclaimed missile silo is viscerally anchored—curved walls, missile bones, hearth ash—each detail filtering through the historian’s hushed attention. The tapestry fragment and scorched diaries act as micro-settings that constrain handling choices (fragile pages, flaking thread). Spatial choreography is clean; the descent to “deepest chamber” and return to upper hearth is tracked without drift. The environment’s metal memory hum charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lighthouse, bay, and restaurant are sketched with atmospheric strokes; spatial anchoring is clear by ~100 words. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual metaphors), but the setting suffuses the mood. It never constrains any on-page choice, so it remains backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Micro-setting works: loop pedal, indigo palette, and the altar-formed anchor constrain every tactical move. Sensory economy favors sound and color density over visual panorama; silence itself is rendered as weight and pressure. Texture is specific—indigo that “absorbs light,” pedal layers that “build sonic architecture.” No geography drift; spatial choreography stays clean as the priest circles the altar.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glass spire and frozen lake double as instrument and score, constraining his stance; the mirrored horizon literally refracts his desk at climax. Shell micro-setting handled in motion, circled back to press against forehead—tactile constraint under exhaustion. Sensory hierarchy favors light-sound-touch, filtered through synesthetic composer-perception. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glowing viaduct stones, the warm clay tablet, and bruised-purple sky are filtered through Elias’s sensory hierarchy—sound of humming rock, phosphorescent after-rain shimmer—guiding each hover-step. Micro-setting (his hovering body) literally constrains locomotion, forcing procedural path creation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: edge → central stone → chamber → return, no impossible positions. Weather (eclipse rainfall) modulates luminescence and time-window, integrated into action rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern’s stone floor becomes a tactile instrument that literally channels vibration into bodies, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining how music is received. Seasonal “rustle” outside vs. “winter’s hush” inside is handled economically, mirroring internal thaw. Sensory selection stays deaf-accurate: touch and sight dominate, never a phantom “sound.” Spatial choreography stays clean despite group entrance; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Courtyard fountain, dusk light, and pigeon tube are sketched with selective sensory detail that stays inside Elias’s weather-recorder bias. Spatial choreography is coherent; the perimeter creep keeps threat present. Setting never actively constrains choice—no beat requires the fountain or dusk—so it decorates rather than charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but memory engine: extinct ferns flank the vial at the end, literalizing “lost things still flourish.” Ultraviolet lantern and ghost orchid are micro-settings that force the reveal and re-charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s aromatic priorities—every visual note is scent-triggered. Spatial choreography is immaculate: vial, lantern beam, orchid, display case track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Terra-cotta walls, frayed hemp fibres, and silver starlight are filtered through a poet’s tactile bias; every sensory pick serves the texture quest. Micro-setting (rope-body-grotto) constrains gesture—kneeling, looping, coiling—so environment shapes tactic. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible distances. Final image of coiled rope against warming wall satisfies 9+ test: setting charges the closing frame.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Greenhouse/shipwreck mash-up is sketched with selective sensory strokes (sunlight through cracked glass, hollow hull whispers) that mirror Kael’s eavesdropping on loss. Spatial choreography stays clean; bowl placement and echo sources track. Environment does not directly block/enable a final tactical choice, so capped below 8.8. Micro-setting—the clay bowl as resonator—functions as extension of place and charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ partial gate.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Amber grotto and dusk light are returned to as a filtering lens that subtly warms every beat; the blotter petals function as micro-setting tools that constrain Elias’s choreography. Sensory selection stays tight—static tingle, amber glow—never drifting into catalog. The environment does not merely mirror mood; its optical hue is sold as part of the emotional forgery, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Retractable roof, starlight, sea breeze, and rare-document ink stains are filtered through POV priorities (shipping, human detail). Library is more postcard than tactical—only the envelope and later locket act as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final locket image recharges the star-sea frame, meeting the 9+ gate weakly. Compact, selective detail throughout; no exposition stall.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystalline orchard, crater glow, and reed lattice are not postcard backdrop: the glowing path dictates climbing tactics, the arbor’s obsidian strands absorb/reflect light that guides night descents. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s sculptor eye—she notes pliancy of reeds before smell of sap—keeping POV bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible distances during rappel. The crater’s “luminescent ache” returns in the closing image, recharged by sigil, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop canal system is insistently specific—water-crystal map, stone troughs, tower canyons—and directly steers the chase. Micro-setting (pendant, sketchbook) is handled, but only the canals constrain the final approach; the cage room is vivid yet generic, keeping it below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cavern orchard is not backdrop but hydraulic clock: drip-rate modulates tension and literally feeds the light-fruit that fuels the magic. The chipped mosaic stepping stone is handled thrice—setup, mid-trace, final re-pattern—each touch altering tactical options. Spatial choreography is clean; body crouch, knee pressure on stone, eye-level sightlines track without drift. The bioluminescent fruit dimming supplies a living light meter, charging the final image when the stone, not the fruit, becomes the last light source.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is the story’s strength: crawl-space copper pipe, sapphire hush, and ferromagnetic tape all filter through a bibliophile’s idiom. Spatial choreography is clean—every squeeze and panel click tracks. Environment constrains motion and supplies the crucial object; the library’s dawn-shadowed infrastructure charges the final cache image. Detail stays selective, never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moss-slick trellis constrains movement (she must brace a hand to climb, post softened) and returns charged in the last image as proof of concept. Rain and storm timeline stay coherent; soil, leaf-vein, greenhouse vent mechanics are specific and accurate. Sensory economy favors touch and scent over sightseeing. Environment becomes character partner, not backdrop; final shot would lose weight without this exact trellis texture.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal island is not backdrop but tactical partner: treacherous waters swallowed villages, so isolation pressures her art; rain trails literally guide her to the brooch and then to the exchange. Micro-setting objects—amber brooch, solar lamps, rare pigments—constrain choices (keep vs. trade, old palette vs. new). Weather is causal: storm scars create the trail map; cool morning air makes the brooch’s warmth uncanny, charging the final image when that warmth is relinquished. Spatial choreography is clean: half-buried find, palm-imprint warmth, canvas-wrapped exchange tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal cave is not backdrop but co-protagonist: its “melodic resonance” and “luminous walls” constrain every beat, and the final image of crystalline flowers blooming in bright darkness recharges the setting itself. Micro-setting is satisfied: the cave-pearl’s heartbeat-synced pulse functions as a tool that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is crystal-clear—pilgrim shuffles in, exits into twilight; shadows stretch from floor to crystal. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s seer priorities: sound and light dominate, touch arrives only at the climax, tightening focus.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ivory harbor’s wet stones, briny air, and hollow crates are filtered through Elina’s archivist eye; setting guides her tactile cataloguing and quietly mirrors the community’s shift from absence to presence. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Copper box, semi-transparent punch, and starlit vault are rendered with concise sensory triangulation; the punch’s warming vibration is tactile and purpose-driven. Selective detail—cracks resolving into “increasingly intricate pathways”—mirrors Ethan’s mindset without cataloguing the tunnel. The vault’s mist coalescing into stasis-emotions is a fresh, micro-setting image that charges the final fortress reveal. Spatial choreography holds: the punch beams outward to translate fortress walls, anchoring the setting as active translator rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tower and tile function as micro-setting: access to night sky and migrating whales directly enables the tile’s harmonic revelations. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and celestial motion constrain when meetings happen. Detail is filtered through Elara’s astronomy lineage, anchoring mood without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prismatic escondite is recurrent, active micro-setting: light walls first distract, then become the actual portal that collapses after transit. Sensory economy favors shifting color and magnetic tension over visual cataloguing. Spatial choreography holds; the fragment’s location “deepest corner” is tracked, and the storm’s intrusion is relayed through Alistair’s bodily awareness of fields “reaching tendrils.” The environment literally constrains the exit, charging the final image when he steps through and the sanctuary implodes—meets 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    The funeral prep room is more than wallpaper: the chemical scent, stainless tables, and 2:17 security clock constrain her stealth tactics and supply the asylum seal. The ink pot operates as micro-setting—its silver rim and impossible swirls directly guide her decision-making, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fluorescent lamp functions as micro-setting: its vibration spectrum literally constrains Elias’s only possible action and charges the final image when the gold seals the note. Bonsai labyrinth is sketched with two swift, sense-filtered strokes (“impossible ways,” “tangled paths”) that mirror the nonlinear history concept without cataloguing. Selective sensory economy privileges touch and hearing—the stationer’s professional bias—over visual excess. Spatial choreography is immaculate: body, desk, lamp, window, labyrinth track cleanly across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The container labyrinth is not backdrop but tactical constraint—alleys dead-end, rain forces shelter inside a single unit, proximity decides which voices can be overheard. Micro-setting (poison label) is handled twice and charges the final self-definition. Sensory hierarchy obeys the POV’s scavenger filter: rust flakes, lullaby cadences, salt-skin textures take precedence over visual panorama. Environment literally forecloses the option of reclaiming a paper self.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory is more than postcard: the telescope’s fixed angle on Lyra and the storm’s gusts literally guide where she stands and what she can hear. Dust motes become “miniature galaxies,” marrying scale to theme, while the half-finished cello functions as micro-setting that constrains her retrieval method. Weather subsiding at dawn is causally tied to her internal shift, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is more than postcard: salt-fried air, clashing float-music, neon fish murals that double as nautical charts—details filter through Maya’s pattern-seeking gaze. The perpetual carnival physically constrains tactics (noise hides meetings, crowd conceals painters). Micro-setting objects—earpiece, stone chip, spray-can—are handled, traded, relinquished with changing emotional weight. Final painted spiral inside circle reuses earlier motif, now re-weighted as secret archive key.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting: slope, crater valley, and camera tripod constrain every physical move; the dissolved grain and cooling suit create tactile immediacy. Sensory selection favors lunar-specific cold, low-gravel crunch, and bioluminescent blue—never a tourist catalog. Environment directly guides framing choices; the final sun-blasted rock reconfigures the earlier summit hush into bright loss, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mist, steam, and harbor clangor are filtered through Elias’s hearing/touch, keeping atmosphere inside POV. The crystal bowl becomes micro-setting that literally refracts stakes onto the page. Spatial choreography is flawless—tools placed by memory, drone held above water, anchor chain audible distance. Minor slip: “magnetic calm” is repeated twice without evolving, slightly diluting freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Environment is vivid and selective: metal contracting, auroras, indigenous lexical layer. Micro-setting (condensation on glass) becomes the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Cold-weather physics feel accurate; falcon choreography tracked. One minor slip—“water mountain collapsed” oral myth floats unanchored in physical logic, but it doesn’t alter on-page choice, so waived.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silverwood’s skeletal architecture, the archway’s moss-whisper, and the cobblestones’ shifting resonance are filtered through Silas’s tuner-ear; the ebony fork itself acts as micro-setting that constrains every step. Sensory economy is high—sound and touch dominate—anchoring the revival without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crushed-temple atmosphere is filtered through a diver’s kinetic sensorium: muted light, mineral haze, pressure on joints. The vial graduates from prop to constraint—warming against thigh, lightening impossibly—thereby charging the final image; the temple’s “lonesome splendor” re-enters as Charged Poise in the last line. Spatial choreography stays watertight across door rumble and particle swirl.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse-prison and jagged reef are not postcard backdrop: the reef claims ships, the lantern beam sweeps his cell, the salt scent permeates his breath; the lattice functions as micro-setting that absorbs his whispered words and later bears his new story, directly constraining the final choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse’s glass distortions, bioluminescent pollen, and perpetual frost function as micro-setting that constrains the ghost’s tether and charges the final bloom; the winter-cracked fields supply the necessary outside pressure that winter can still penetrate. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices soil warmth she cannot feel—and the spiral etching on the bead mirrors the bloom’s center, creating a taught pattern that reconfigures at closure. Spatial choreography is clean across the shard transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The red canyon walls function as both setting and tool: their ridges physically guide the needle and later bloom, directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—orchid glow, dragon-spine silhouette—filtered through Elara’s textile gaze. Spatial choreography stays coherent across night walks; the environment’s transformation is causal under the accumulative lens rather than decorative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    The catacomb orchard is sensuously specific—roots tightening around bones, morning light through canopy—and constrains the final image: tree roots literally embrace the sundial, mirroring Kaelen’s embrace of home. Selective sensory hierarchy (tactile bark, old tongue on lips) filters through Kaelen’s bias rather than tourist catalog. No spatial drift; choreography stays clean as he moves between graves and dig sites. The setting earns its 8+ by charging the closure image with undeniable metaphoric cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    The golden arcade and dawn light are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered; the clipboard’s dark wood and chalk dust supply tactile micro-setting that returns to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the crouch-rise-mail drop sequence. Weather (yesterday’s rain) is causally linked to faded code but stays background; no world-rule contradiction. The environment does not constrain a tactical choice—she could mail the letter anywhere—so the 9+ gate is missed; cap 8.8 waived because closure still uses the arcade’s glow as emotional repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt walls, prismatic windows, and the eternal candle’s moving flame create a tactile, lived–in observatory that doubles as micro-setting; the candle’s flare length-changes mark beat-shifts. Autumn leaves and “echoed silence” supply atmospheric counter-point, but environment never actively constrains her tactical choices—she could have worked in any quiet room. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies track across the hall. Meets 9-band gate only weakly: candle images charge the final line but do not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mangrove labyrinth, moon-shaft light, and singing spirits are filtered through Elara’s body and tool; the gargoyle shard literally charges the final image on the windowsill. Sensory economy favors the tactile (shard warmth, condensation under fingertip) over visual catalog. Environment constrains movement—roots twist choices, moon phase gates the magic. Specificity is high enough that relocation would break the spell logic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The atrium’s weeping tropical plants and dusk-caught mist are filtered through Kaelen’s war-trained attention to detail; every sense note (damp bench, fading light) doubles as emotional barometer. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final gesture—its labyrinthine grooves guide finger placement and symbol re-pricing. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies, cast, coral, and mist track cleanly across the single bench. Only the hospital’s proper name is absent, but at this length the omission is purposeful economy, not vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory’s dome, the fragment’s grit under fingertips, and the fog that “swallowed” sound all constrain action: only a sealed dark space can make the colors visible. Sensory hierarchy obeys Amelia’s painter priorities—she notices wavelength before temperature, stone texture before smell. Spatial choreography is pristine: studio lamps click, cables trip visitors, children lean so close their breath fogs the glass. Micro-setting of the shard itself functions as pivot-object, charging the final image when its dancers bloom across the curved wall.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sound-wave garden is sketched with selective synesthesia—“sound waves pulsed,” “patterns she could almost see rippling”—and the mural crevice that yields the nickel functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the next discovery; spatial anchors arrive early and track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse humidity, tomato leaf stickiness, butterfly wing-scale dust—every sensory pick is filtered through Kaelen’s rogue-scholar gaze and doubles as camouflage toolkit. The gourd seed’s rattle frequency, the cereus bloom timing, the insect-lure rhythm—all serve as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across seven gardens and one glasshouse; no floating rooms. Could nudge 9+ if one plant species had physically thwarted a raid on-page instead of operating as pure code.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shell-as-setting is never static: it curves, whispers, blooms, sings, and finally pulses light, each evolution causally tied to the poet’s verses. Micro-setting triumphs: the galaxy postcard pinned at the apex becomes the literal fulcrum of the final image. Sensory economy favors sound and bioluminescence, matching the insomnia motif. Specificity is high enough that removing any spatial detail would break the bloom sequence; this satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Floating opal library, glass-orchid chambers, and ivory frame are selective, sensory, and mirrored in transparent floors; each detail feeds the central tension—fragile preservation above oblivion. Micro-setting qualifies: the cracked bamboo tube itself acts as environment that constrains the only possible repair tactic. Spatial choreography is clean; no surplus world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: its dwindling ink tracks elapsed time and its glow mirrors Elena’s rising hope. Archive dust motes and dim light are filtered through her scholarly gaze, but broader geography (continent, era) is withheld—acceptable at this length. Spatial choreography is clean; the ink well stays within reach and its final near-emptiness charges the closure image. However, the environment never physically constrains her next move—doors never lock, candles never gutter—so the 9+ gate is not met; cap 8.8 remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Volcanic amphitheater breathes, chain glints, moss under knees—selective, POV-filtered, and the inscription physically redirects the design. Micro-setting (chain) becomes the final talisman; environment constrains water paths. Missing 9+ gate: no single detail alters a tactical choice in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Attic is economically anchored—skylight beam, dust column, parchment stacks—and filters through Elara’s pigeon-trained attention to air currents. Micro-setting (meteorite as paperweight) functions as tool-as-setting, guiding her mapping ritual; however, the space never actively resists or endangers her, so constraint is mild. Sensory selection favors paper, ink, and feather imagery; other senses under-used. Strong specificity, but environment remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting rule satisfied: the logbook’s shifting symbols and the oak-grain pattern physically constrain Elara’s final step and charge the image. Prismatic light, violet pillars, and corn-snap breeze are selectively sensory, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean across a reality that dissolves and re-forms. The terrace’s “fractured hush” mirrors her bereft attention and pays off when silence breaks into remembered wind.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The inverted-star architecture of flooded corridors, the helmet’s blade of light carving rusted equipment, and the collapsing dome’s moon-lattice give the environment immediate agency: it channels her body toward the dome and later supplies the star-canvas for the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to visual wonder, appropriate to an astrologer, but touch is activated at the climax (glove-off, palm to glass), letting the setting physically constrain her risk. No description stalls momentum; each detail is filtered through her chart-making gaze. The underwater city is irreplaceable—only this pressure-glass void could let living constellations answer her longing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    Geode/cave is textured through prismatic light and seed-germination; micro-setting (crater glass) handled in motion. Place governs her transliterating gift, but spatial choreography is static—no shift in access or exit to pressure final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal arcade is evoked through acoustic and reflective specifics—flooded marble mirroring stars—that directly enable Leo’s tactics (sound, visual misdirection). Weather and spatial layout are tracked without drift; the bishop’s small scale substitutes for macro geography. Setting subtly guides choice: the flooded floor hides the drop, the glass ceiling amplifies music. The environment does not charge the final image (the woman’s tear-stained exit), so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden is rendered through motion—dancing feet, pulsing stone, scent of forbidden blooms—so setting constrains and enables. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting/object that charges the final image; its dissolution reweights the entire transformation. Spatial choreography is clean: soil, stars, collarbone track believably. No drift into tourist-catalog; every detail is filtered through Lira’s tide-tuned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Selective glass-worker sensory filter—light through panes, calloused palms—threads every paragraph; Pearl Bay is sketched in pearl-metaphor and dew-web refractions that mirror internal shift. The prism-atrium is micro-setting-as-object, returning in the final line to charge CR. Spatial choreography stays clean; no credibility errors. Environment could more directly constrain a tool-choice, but refracted light is purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    Body-as-setting and cracked box-as-micro-setting constrain every choice; moonlight silvering the fracture is final image charge. Sensory triage fits crisis-aftermath: narrowed to footfall, porcelain cool, star wheel. Spatial choreography clean: ridge apex → world falls away → descent. Selector word “velvet darkness” risks soft cliché but immediately re-specified by “pricked by distant lights.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly sensory—prismatic reflections, rhythmic algae glow—and functions as micro-setting: retreating water reveals new surfaces that literally allow the next adjustment, so environment constrains action. The altitude gauge as recurring object charges the final image when it points outward, re-weighting earlier readings. Spatial choreography stays clean despite dense props.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ivy-veiled passage is rendered through touch, sound, and temperature; the fireplace micro-setting gives tactile access to lost time. Spatial choreography is clean from corridor to chamber to lab bench. The environment does not yet force a tactical trade-off, so it charges atmosphere more than choice, capping access to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism parapet is not backdrop but instrument: rain-slick surface fractures her image into actionable futures, then reseals, enacting the story’s central tension. Micro-setting (the railing she strokes) doubles as tool and mirror, constraining her stance and charging the final image. Sensory economy is sharp—droplet prisms, stone chill, bell vibration—filtered through her practiced eye. No world-rule inconsistency; spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient terrace, salt air, and tripartite suns are sketched with selective sensory economy; weather and stone guide pacing and mood without tourist clutter. The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting: its weight, polish, and final absence constrain Elian’s gestures and charge the closing image. Environment never becomes a tactical obstacle, so it supports but does not shape the treaty terms; hence 7.8, not 9.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt-flat micro-setting is treated as a tactile antagonist: crystals “bite into his knees,” cracks “converge like spokes,” raindrops ring “tiny bells.” These details constrain the literal placement of the egg and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound—corporate drone notices satellite geometry, secret sentimentalist hears phantom birdsong. No exposition dumps; world-rules (manufactured drought) are learned through the visible white wasteland and the unscheduled storm.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silver courtyard is evoked through selective snow, moonlight, and breath-fog; bodies remain spatially coherent. Micro-setting succeeds: the snowflake “diamante witnesses” and frozen breath act as tactile props that mirror her poise. Weather affects action—snow muffles sound, hides footprints—yet the courtyard never constrains her tactics; it is backdrop, not obstacle. Thus capped just under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The radar dome acts as both sanctuary and portable stage storage; its brutalist hush shapes Elias’s calm and supplies literal space for the performance. Micro-setting also lives in the handled stick, whose carved grooves guide nightly choices. One sharper beat—e.g., a splinter or dropped puppet—would have pushed it past 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fewer than 800 words, yet the floating moss-and-orchid aerie is tactile: silken threads harvested from moon-flowers snag on gnarled cloud-touched bark, forcing Aris to work around dew-slick branches. Micro-setting succeeds: the moth-wing artifact pinned to a knot constrains the butterfly’s attention and charges the final image. Sensory filter is POV-specific—esoteric realist notices mineral veins in weathered stone before unreadable carvings. No world-rule inconsistency; gravity-defiant trees are accepted as given.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The aurora-lit ice sanctum is rendered through breath-clouds, lantern shadows, and the rope’s internal glow; every sense item is filtered through Elara’s caster-eye for pattern. Space is coherent: stairway → walls → basin → rope, each distance tracked without drift. The cold actively narrows her dexterity, making “technically gentle” a tactile constraint that charges the climax. Environment and tool (rope + card) jointly constrain the final reconfiguration—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bunker’s vine-veined breathing walls, grit in bone, and seal-as-tool constrain every motion; environment literally guides finger placement and ritual positioning. Storm electricity functions as causal catalyst, not backdrop, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or object shifts. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through Elara’s synesthetic perception, avoiding catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is the observatory chamber and the tile itself; both constrain every move—ink shortage, star sight-lines, tile’s temperature shift. Sensory triage (cool tile vs. warming room) mirrors internal tension. Palace-to-observatory conversion implied in one line but suffices for 750-word scope. Final image projects unknown constellations onto ceiling—setting becomes cosmic interface, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sanctuary rules (soundless, architecture breathes, objects reappear) are taught through action and govern choice—Elara plucks a second box from nowhere, Marcus senses unheard vibrations. Starlight bench and transparent walls supply micro-setting that mirrors internal shift. Spatial logic holds; we track the two boxes cleanly. Setting never constrains the final choice, so capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fog-bound orchard functions as both metaphor and micro-setting: thick air literally limits visibility, forcing reliance on sextant and breath; impossible star-fruit charges the final image. Spatial anchoring is clean; ancient trees track across beats. Weather constrains choice—mirror-maker must work indoors, intensifying focus on sextant.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Gravity-defying orchard, resonance field, bathroom acoustics—each setting micro-zone is filtered through Elias’s astronomer-curator bias and ultimately charges the final epiphany; spatial choreography stays clean, and the luminous orchard reweights the closing lens, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but tactical space: “shelves twisted like climbing vines,” “books whispered their contents,” and the ink-guardians’ “garden of paper” all constrain movement and re-negotiation. Sensory economy favors sound and touch (“echoes of unheard symphony,” “traced her fingers over the worn leather”) aligned to linguist POV. Micro-setting of the diary itself—glowing green, pulsing with heartbeat—charges the final image and literally lights the path, meeting the 9-band gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across single continuous scene; no floating bodies or lost anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Derelict carnival ship is vividly rendered through Elara’s biased eye—faded murals that “move in the corner of vision,” rusty hull echoing. The unnamed emerald tree finally charges the image, but earlier spatial anchors (deck / ballroom / corridor) blur together; a single distance or layout cue would have cemented choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clock-tower brass, lantern glare, and shifting-braid rope micro-setting are tightly filtered through archivist senses; the rope’s pattern-change literally constrains the final action. Spatial choreography stays crisp—no floating props. Early anchor (who/where/when) arrives by word 30, satisfying orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting specificity is the story’s strength: ripple-mark walls, never-melted ice, echo chamber stone, and distorted light are vivid and purposeful. The harmonic caves function as both environment and tool, constraining the mapkeeper’s sonic tactics and charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent through a single continuous traverse. The ice-crack method, however, is described rather than shown in action, so the critical beat feels abstract.

    Glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its sympathetic resonance with starlight literally enables the prism rekindling. Sensory economy is tight—wind-song, starlight on glass, “spiraling stairs” give spatial legs without catalog. Post-collapse world rules stay consistent, learned through action (no exposition dump). Environment directly affects choice: pavilion’s hum guides her to climb and align the prism.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory and rain-slick crystal forecourt are sensuously particular: “remnants of rain” release centuries-old voices, a tactile rule that constrains Elthion’s method and final decision. Micro-setting succeeds—the largest crystal acts as both tool and archive, charging the ending when he plants his feet on it to write. Light angle and evaporative acoustics evolve causally, never repeating adjectives. Only the phrase “like frozen thoughts given form” drifts toward abstraction; a concrete simile would secure 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fortress-as-instrument is tactile: creepers lean toward light, tiles glow back new stories, the tower edge gives bodily risk. Sensory triage favors sound and color over textbook five-sense cycling. Micro-setting—the rag’s treated sections—functions as both tool and timer, constraining the ignition sequence. Environment directly charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: starlit pools act as both observatory and oracle, constraining her epistemology—she can only think in tidal rhythms. Jade cicada functions as portable grotto, linking body to geological time. Sensory triangulation—salt-air taste, stone seep, pendant warmth—filters through her naturalist bias. Final image of faintly glowing pendant against starlight recharges earlier motif and crystallizes new funding model, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.7)
    Bunker corridors, inverted sky, and xenial trellis are sketched with selective, sense-driven detail. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (she must leave it as sentinel). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The “silver-vined flowers” image reappears in the final line, charging the closure; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its glass facets literally refract silence into乘客 bodies, constraining Elias’s every adjustment. Sensory hierarchy is biased to sound/silence rather than visual catalogues. Spatial choreography is impeccable—no impossible body or prop shifts across the single continuous scene. Weather (gathering clouds) enters only to reinforce temporariness of peace, keeping exposition spare.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective, POV-filtered detail—“digital trees whisper nostalgia in binary code”—anchors retro-futurist texture without catalogue sprawl. The monolith’s paint flakes and the elevator shaft crystallize the past/future fusion and directly enable the final map; this charges the closure image under the Accumulative lens, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    The charcoal sanctuary is not backdrop but tool: ash under fingernails, starlight as mortar for the threshold. The doorknocker’s carvings and pulsating temperature are tactile constraints that decide her stance. Spatial choreography is clean—north wall, mat, threshold line—guiding her three-knock ritual. Micro-setting (ring, ash, starlight) charges the final image and would break if swapped.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bioluminescent farm is vividly sensory (“spores that sparkled,” “purple glows brightest”) and actively guides Maya’s footing and attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from terrace to hidden chamber. The submarine-bolt micro-setting object charges the final image by converting pressure into diamonds, meeting the 9+ gate. A hairline slip: the facility’s “different purpose” history is hinted but never specified, leaving the bolt’s backstory slightly floating.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sepia reading room, gramophone, ceiling carving, and hidden compartment are tightly cross-indexed; the carving-as-map and floor resonance are exploited for the final reveal. Golden-shadow light is reiterated to the point of near overkill, yet it does charge the closure image. Micro-setting (crank handle warming) constrains the tactile beat. Economy is good; no exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse is rendered through motion—phosphorescent vines, crystalline fruit that chimes—so setting constrains the unsnapping gesture itself. Spatial choreography remains coherent as Galen stands rooted while realities overlap. The final image of “impossible fruits now seemed less foreign” recharges the initial description, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Foster-care file room as micro-setting constrains choices—Eleanor must read dust, not people; Benjamin returns because only here his paper self exists. Brass button operates as portable setting/object hybrid: states change from lost→found→paired, charging final image. Sensory selection favors visual dust & tactile paper, appropriate to archivist’s profession; smell of old carbon ink could have tightened further. Spatial choreography clean—drawer seven, lamp adjust, folder removal track across body without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Auric lagoon under starlight is vividly anchored and repeatedly filters choices: golden surface hides vaults, reflection delivers map, shimmer hosts projection. The TrueComm key’s tarnish and slot placement satisfy micro-setting object constraint. Sensory economy is strong—bruised sky, liquid gold—without checklist excess. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across marsh approach and shoreline pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Radiant grotto, prism atrium, and dew-micro-stars are rendered through Ethan’s sonic priorities—light refracts for acoustics, dew becomes metronome—so setting actively shapes tactics rather than postcarding. Spatial choreography is clean: path → atrium → crystalline walls → mist swirl. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and sound; other senses under-used but credible for the occupation. The prism returns at closure as the resonant chamber that hosts the new silence, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment and tool interlace tightly: the mossy platform, bone prod, and moonstone monument constrain every micro-choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s profession—she reads embryos and petal veins, never tourist vistas. The arbor’s ashen light is reused as both atmosphere and closure mirror, meeting the 9+ gate. Only the brief “skyward realms” placeholder keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory triage—oil smell, arrhythmic ticks, wet hum of waterfall—mirrors Elias’s narrowing attention from metal to organic motion. Broken-glass greenhouse and vine-gear ladder constrain improvisation beats; compass surface reprises in the glowing mist to charge closure. No extraneous weather clichés; spatial choreography remains coherent. Micro-setting (compass face, vine ladder) functions as setting extensions that directly shape tactics, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Foundry heat, steam ghosts, and rain-slick cobbles pervade every beat and literally shape the forging act; environment constrains the metallurgic choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s alchemical gaze—temperature over sound, metallic scent over color. Spatial choreography is tight: furnaces, crucibles, and cooling plate track cleanly. Weather is not backdrop; downpour rinses away false hope and cools the new coin, sealing the kintsugi metaphor on the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge is sketched economically yet actively: sound-bending rules constrain tracking tactics; the misaligned harp’s dissonance literally hides Thomas. The cave micro-setting serves as the crucible where tooth, bell, and laugh converge, charging the final release image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices acoustic texture before visual—keeping description lean for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    UV forest is neither backdrop nor symbol alone; its light exposes hidden bark patterns that Kai uses to align the strap, making setting an active tool. Micro-setting (the pewter strap) likewise constrains the final decryption. Sensory triage is POV-true: anesthesia aftertaste, glass-shard breath, glowing bark—never a checklist. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions. The 9+ gate is met: environment directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Floating market is sketched with swift, sense-driven strokes; swaying stalls, rope bridges, glowing potions crystallize a dreamscape that is also a workspace—the painting is here, the fragment warms. Selective detail skips encyclopedic tour and keeps POV filter tight. Micro-setting (lens fragment) doubles as tool and constraint, charging the final image. One slip: city rooftops mentioned once then vanish, leaving the market unmoored in space.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ticket-office ceiling becomes micro-setting that constrains tactics: dust spirals map the ghost breach and guide the barrel placement. Fluorescent buzz taught as temporal anchor early; its final absence tightens the silence that lets the crack widen. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and auditory, matching an elevator tech’s bias toward vibration and vertical space. Specific noun economy—“mainspring barrel,” “plaster and debris”—grounds the fantastical device in mundane rubble.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Glass orchard, cloud sea, frost-branches, and the letterpress itself are all tactile, specific, and filter through Eldon’s professional eye. Micro-setting triumph: the press’s shifting symbols and the dew-words on skin literally charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The baroque asteroid is evoked through kinetic detail (“spiraling gold filigree obscured cave-like dwellings”, “floating libraries”) that guides Elias’s clandestine movements; the crystal shard functions as micro-setting, constraining his posture at the desk and charging the final image when it passes between factions. Temporal storms mirror internal pressure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The circular oak chamber is more than postcard; its acoustic properties literally amplify Elias’s tactic, letting the lullaby become the tether. Spatial choreography is clean—stone at chest, box at center, candlelight tracking time. Sensory detail favors sound over other senses, but that selectivity mirrors a tuner’s bias and charges the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Limestone crevice, obsidian lagoon, and phosphorescent algae are tactile constraints—she wades because the walls demand it. Compass-as-micro-setting constrains direction; its brass heat charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors scent/touch, POV-biased to earth-after-rain cognition. Early anchor clears by word 80; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Storm-tossed archway, turbine hum, and salt-stung stone are sensuously layered, each detail filtered through Elena’s sculptor gaze that notices grain and wear. Micro-setting works: the crevice that hides the slide directly enables the inciting beat, while the turbine hum supplies a metronome for her later rhythm. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible body shifts. Weather and turbine persist as environmental antagonists, tightening the final image. At 8.8 gate: the environment does not actively constrain her final choice (she could still take the sculpture); it charges the atmosphere more than the tactic, capping just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Amber pavilion” and “etched glass” are concrete, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final image; the glass literally refracts the stake. Seasonal markers (autumn leaves, melting snow) evolve across the montage without lapsing into catalogue. Spatial choreography is implicit but clean—no impossible moves. Environment does not constrain a tactical choice, so capped at 8.2 under 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Obsidian lagoon reappears as charged micro-setting: its black surface accepts then rearranges her debris-questions, literally constraining tactics. Zeppelin library supplies off-stage resource (diaries) without cluttering present space. Sensory hierarchy tight—salt-air sting, engine hum under oak—mirrors internal urgency. Spatial choreography clean: descent, kneel, water edge, sunset shift violet.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paper-lantern light on empty lampposts, the bay window’s amber glow, and the square’s dawn bulletin board are sketched with cinematic economy; the lanterns double as emotional gauge, charging the last image when townsfolk arrive, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must constrain or crystallize the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Obsidian slab, wax shaving, and orchard branches are tactile, selective, and return charged in the final image; the skyscraper-top garden constrains access and isolates Elias, literally elevating his task. Details feed POV bias—he fingers history, hears leaves louder after foghorn hush—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography holds as he walks to the pavilion; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound atrium is not backdrop but tactical constraint: frost demands bare-foot choreography, starlight provides the only working illumination, and the spiral layout physically guides her final placement. Micro-setting rules—containers slide, frost pulses—directly enable the vortex formation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Anya notices temperature second to seed weight, reflecting professional priorities. The oak acorn cap functions as mobile setting, its worn ridges tracking time in her palm. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating vases or impossible reaches.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Windblown sanctuary functions as micro-setting: thin air, cathedral timbers, and the bell-rope’s fibers constrain every move. The glue’s 3-day cure and rope’s tension evolve across beats, charging the final autonomic toll. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over vista tourism; altitude narrows perception to what Elias must test. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible rope positions or weather-prop teleportation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lonely station, vacuum void, and meteor streaks are sketched with economical cosmic imagery that stays filtered through Elion’s professional gaze. The yellow lantern glass earns micro-setting status: its captured-sunbeam gleam and dark-matter handle are re-invoked at the climax, focusing the final perception. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual), but selection fits the POV’s job and keeps momentum. Spatial anchors hold; no choreography issues.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Scorched wasteland beyond cracked hive glass, wax that refuses to harden, moon-bleached air—each tactile detail is filtered through the POV’s apiarist gaze and constrains the final ritual placement. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that literally warms in hand, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is flawless; distances from apiary house to root cellar to oldest hive track cleanly. Slight over-reliance on visual prism keeps this from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Emerald-veined walls that “pulse with temporal energy” and a capsule leaking “moments like water” give the silo a tactile, paradoxical body; the micro-setting doubles as clock and crucible. Garage-sale detritus—lamp, bicycle, kitchen scale—supplies nostalgic specificity that contrasts the alien chronology, anchoring theme without catalog bloat. Spatial logic is pristine: descent, base, staircase return, all tracked without drift. The final image of “shadows that seemed to bend in impossible ways” lets environment echo the newly bent rule-set, satisfying the 9+ constraint test even if the beat is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cobalt lagoon, drake feather, and weathered journal are specific, body-scale objects that constrain action: feather becomes pen and bookmark, lagoon mirror collapses horizon to charge the final suspended stance. Sensory hierarchy obeys poet’s bias—she notices color shifts, salt-softened leather, child’s cry absorbed—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (feather) participates directly in closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor lapse: “jagged rocks and smooth sand” leans proverbial, but line is brief and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Copper wire singing against wood and breathing stone pillars supply tactile specificity; the setting guides the choreography of wire-wrapping and is recharged in the final glow, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rainwashed tower, spring petals, bronze façade—vivid visual layering anchors the walk. Micro-setting succeeds: the fly amber’s weight in his palm functions as a portable “room.” However, no environmental detail ever constrains his choices; the sculptures are decorative, the door yields without resistance, so the setting never pressures outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment is evoked through selective, POV-filtered detail—dying sun, salt-stained wind, bird-cries as soil-telemetry. The seed pods function as micro-setting: their rattling sound becomes the “soft language of hope” that rewrites the battlefield. Twilight remains the dominant sensory spine, compressing color to ambers and blacks so the eventual wildflower burst feels internally bright. One minor slip: barren/blooming toggles risk postcard shorthand, but the coachman’s sensorial labor (touching earth, tasting wind) keeps it lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Wasteland and scrapyard are filtered through Silas’s tracker gaze—smell of rust as “mechanical breathing,” distance measured in scent-days. The waxed leaf functions as micro-setting: handled in three distinct beats, its surface refracts light to reveal text, literally constraining navigation. Spatial choreography is clean: he crosses seven markers, skeleton-drone landmark tracked without drift. Final valley emerges as inverse mirror of scrapyard—life hidden inside discarded war shells—charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observation deck is sketched via functional micro-detail—“dim light,” “dormant equipment longing”—that mirrors her exile. The compass rose is handled twice (warmth at end), charging the final image and satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are clear by line 4; no orientation debt. Sensory economy favors the visual, but the narrowed spectrum fits the solitary, star-lit scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Icebound spire and impossible constellations are sketched with crisp sensory economy; cold, thin air, and shifting stone texture choices underfoot. Spatial choreography is flawless—pedestal, altar, apex—each new chamber re-orients reader cleanly. The sky’s green vastness returns as the charged closure mirror once constellations realign, meeting the 9+ gate. Minor generic tint—“otherworldly blue light”—but the environment directly shapes the staircase reveal and final star-fix, so earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering gallery’s acoustic loop and the nomadic penumbra’s light-eating edge are rendered through Elara’s footfall-echo synesthesia; the chessboard’s pawn void literally guides her next walking pattern, charging the final image when the pawn reappears.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mercury glass, raven feather, and shifting shelves are handled, weighed, and stroked; these micro-settings constrain every beat and charge the final image when the feather’s plume becomes the map she now carries inside her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen village is not backdrop but active constraint: every non-suspended object—tapestry threads, labyrinth walls—responds only during the four-minute thunder-lull, forcing tactical timing. Platinum labyrinth literally reflects his altered face, micro-setting as mirror and judge. Spatial choreography is clean: fingers move from tapestry to door to prince’s hand without drift; the bell’s sound propagates through previously soundless air, environmental state change logged on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Bone towers and twilight mist are vividly sensory, return twice, and charge the final echo image; they constrain Elara’s movements and supply the acoustic canvas for her art. Selective detail—“wind whistling through skeletal architecture”—keeps the description lean while maintaining otherworldly tone. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she climbs the highest tower. The setting never stalls momentum; each reference advances stakes or metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating brass cog-workshop and acid sea are not postcard backdrops; the physical tilt under emotional pressure makes the setting an active constraint. Micro-setting succeeds: the charm, statue, and amber pool function as handled objects that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—cold glass, corrosive emerald, brass tick—never tourist catalog. 9+ gate missed only because no environment shapes tactics beyond the single tilt, but that is hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Quay, cave, and body-as-setting all filter through Elias’s painterly eye: barnacles frame the shell, sunlight sifts like brush-dabs. Selective sensory triangulation—salt, gull cry, mother-of-pearl—mirrors internal state without tourist-catalog overload. The shell-micro-setting literally constrains the final choice: its weight on the palette table charges the last image. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible cliff positions.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is never a postcard: its western wall neglects a garden whose single night-blooming jasmine constrains Elias’s method and perfumes the whisper. Glass, cork, and flower are tactile tools whose states change (uncorking, plucking, warming) and directly enable the climax. The scent’s impossible arrival overseas recharges the setting as micro-setting. One minor slip—no sensory narrowing under stress—but the environment is inseparable from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Starlit signal station, patina bronze, and gibbous moon are not backdrop—they constrain every move: darkness forces manual charting, moon phase dictates censer potency, station’s radio gear must be reconfigured nightly. Micro-setting (bronze foot) functions as setting-proxy: its temperature controls when navigator can transmit and ultimately brands skin at climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—vision narrows to blinking ship lights, touch scorched, ancient bronze melody “only the navigator could hear.” No static catalog; each detail is filtered through occupational priority—signal pulse, silver thread coordinates, transmitter warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hanging orchard is tactile—arthritic branches, storm updrafts, cliffside soil—and directly enables the fork-strike discovery; weather masks ritual from enforcers, so setting shapes tactics. The velvet pouch, truffle-fork, and glass eyes function as micro-setting objects that constrain handling time and social risk. Sensory hierarchy filters through forager priorities: soil texture over visual panorama. Final image of sunlit broken/beautiful orchard reconfigures the earlier storm-battered tone, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Opal-hued mist, brass spyglass, lantern, and preserved flower act as micro-settings that literally charge the culminating gesture; their iridescent return in the final image constrains Elias to answer with his own hand. Sensory hierarchy follows keeper’s vocation: visual sheen, damp soak, star-light. Dock geography remains coherent; no impossible positions. Idiom stays restrained, coastal, period-neutral. Environmental detail mirrors interior shift from bleak bone-light to shared luminescence without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: tool (spyglass) and recurring object (Edelweiss) directly shape final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Phosphorescent flowers as star-fields, the matrix chip projecting living glyphs—details are selective, POV-filtered, and motile. The blooming cavern constrains the final stance: light patterns literally paint his alternative lives. Spatial choreography is flawless; the creek’s swell is tracked in inches and heartbeats. One less stock phrase (“like stars”) would have reached 8.6.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-settings—razor-sharp holds, liquid-sapphire pool—constrain the climb and the vision; the cobalt grotto’s glow guides each hand placement and the final reflection. Fireflies echo as charged object, bridging childhood memory to grotto radiance. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: touch and sight dominate ascent; at climax, mirrored light reconfigures identity. Setting charges the final image: sunrise ignites embers at the entrance, sealing the secret.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ember nexus is not backdrop but active crucible: geothermal warmth warms the stone table, fragments rise like fireflies to acknowledge the secret’s gravity. Twilight’s color shift mirrors Elara’s before/after stance. Shell, pocket-suns, and glowing ground form a micro-setting triad that constrains her next artistic move. Sensory hierarchy obeys her POV—heat, spiral geometry, refracted light—never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and aurora are not backdrop but perceptual filters: upside-down snow physics constrains reality rules, scroll texture guides finger-choice, aurora recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s dream chronicler gaze—he smells pine and “something wilder,” hears prior selves whisper. Micro-setting (scroll) literally enables the soar; environment dissolves only after scroll glow, proving constraint-to-release arc. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the dissolve/return.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shop, fog, and dripping clocks create a tactile micro-setting; water droplets replace scent as temporal heartbeat. Spatial choreography is tight—workbench, brass handle, pocket—anchoring every gesture. The screw as micro-setting constrains the final handshake and is charged by closure; satisfies 9- gate but not quite indispensable to tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock, inkwell glow, and tea steam are sharply sensed and filter through Elara’s scholar gaze—she notices quill trim and ink viscosity. Spatial choreography is clean: knees, parchment, cylinder track across the tilting stone. The “saturated hush” functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. No environment or tool constrains a late tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails, but the selective detail keeps atmosphere alive.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The attic’s dust-and-amber texture is vivid and purposeful, mirroring the dormant melodies. The orchard’s “hush before chainsaws” acts as a living clock, tightening the scene. Spatially, the copper-wire circle and piano are tracked cleanly. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting that constrains the séance; its silver filigree is re-emphasized at sealing, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the story’s protagonist: shelves rearrange by intention, dust vibrates with pre-creation memory, hush is tactile. Sensory hierarchy is narrowed to the witness’s translucence—sight and proprioception dominate, sound is absent by decree. The library’s stone altar and glowing dictionary constrain the final gesture; micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate. Selective, rhythmic detail keeps atmosphere ahead of geography, but spatial choreography stays legible within dream rules.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Brass fittings, clear water chambers, and fjord quiet are filtered through Arlo’s professional eye; sensory economy is tight. The horizon station acts as micro-setting that constrains choice—its measurements become meaningless once time is re-conceptualized, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is invisible but safe; no impossible moves. The “razor edges” function as both tactile hazard and metaphor for the divide between measured and lived time, repurposed in the final image of aging brass patterns, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop; its light pulses constrain visibility and supply the visible feedback loop for the laser experiment. “Soft blue-green illumination” is filtered through Elara’s spatial bias—she notices photon contours, not tourist color. The mushrooms’ intensifying glow where beams pass functions as micro-setting that alters tactics in real time. Final image of “mushrooms brightened in approval” literalizes the setting’s participatory agency, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rainwashed Moscow streets, mica-lit library desk, and the subway’s scratched seat 47 are sharply filtered through Elena’s probability gaze; each locale steers her next move. The candle lantern re-appears at pack-up, charging the final image by literalizing “soft illumination” on her new stance. Weather and season (midsummer twilight) externalize the “moving toward diminishment” mood without overt symbol. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object hops.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    The tunnel’s sweat-slick walls, third-rail danger, and “metallic intestines” provide tactile specificity that keeps the body under threat; the glass disc later doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory filtering matches a lonely night-shift worker—he hears drips, feels disc chill, sees only glints. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible shifts. Environment never actively constrains choice (he could leave the booth), so it supports mood more than tactic, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Jetty planks, violet-crimson petals, amber ink, and the cooling twilight air are filtered through the archivist’s conservationist gaze; every sensory pick is tethered to his ritual. Micro-setting (the locket, the vial) literally becomes the final archive, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is quiet but coherent—knees creak as he stands, satchel secured, no floating props. Weather shift (sunset → night) is tracked and synchronizes the emotional cadence rather than merely decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ivied station works as micro-setting: it offers concealment for clandestine meets and its derelict grandeur mirrors Archie’s own obsolete cheerfulness. Sensory cues are selective (cracked mirror, dawn through broken panes) and keyed to mood rather than catalogued. Spatial logic is tracked cleanly through the taxi/café chain; no floating geography. Environment does not directly constrain the final image, so it stops just short of 9-band gating.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument: its frequencies map terrain, transmit melody, and finally fall silent to mark the stillpoint. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting—warmth, weight, and eventual saturation constrain every dowsing gesture. Constellation-pause acts as celestial clock, tightening the window of opportunity. Only the absence of body-scale spatial cues during the final kneel prevents 9-band; a single line of bark under his knees would have completed the proprioceptive loop.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active mirror: twisted moonlight dances approval, distorted ribbons literalize her time-edits. The workshop’s chronopaper and quantum oscillators are handled, not catalogued, anchoring the speculative rule-set early. The pen itself functions as micro-setting—its swan-neck nib constrains the exact physical gesture of writing history, charging the final image when it glows and is laid away.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moonlit water, salt air, and dock planks filter through Elias’s selective attention; camera-as-compass constrains his path and charges the final image when it “points nowhere and everywhere.” Sensory hierarchy favors audition-by-proxy (signing) over tourist visuals, meeting micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography stays coherent as bodies gather and disperse; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tapestry fragment is micro-setting that constrains choice: its threads guide her route, its completeness dictates the restoration task, and its final embedding marks the library’s threshold. Dusty archive halls are sketched with economy (“echoing footsteps”) but remain spatially coherent. Sensory detail is selective—touch of thread, smell of ash—filtered through guilt-sharpened attention. The fragment’s evolution from clue to threshold to symbolic bridge satisfies the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sound-wave garden is not backdrop; its vibrating surfaces, visible ripples, and Resonance tower actively enable the climax by translating Elena’s drumming into the lagoon. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—auditory/kinesthetic first, visual second—mirroring her musician-twitch POV. Spatial choreography holds as she taps from cell→corridor→tower→water’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Container labyrinth is rendered through motion—boots splashing, welded seams vibrating—so setting constrains acoustics and stealth paths. The humming metal and blackout zones evolve with the storm, directly enabling the climax. Micro-setting objects (coin, key, maps) are palpably handled and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating corridors or impossible sight-lines.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt dock, rain-slick shutters, and dental-mirror reflections form a micro-setting that actively constrains every gesture. Light-angle mechanics are tracked shot-by-shot; spatial choreography never drifts. Mirror’s final blackout charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The magnetic grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its field literally lets Arthur hear the stakes. Starlight underground recharges the crystal and the final image. “Cobalt library,” “narrow streets,” and “dissolving mist” are reused with precision, anchoring choreography. One near-slip: “windows glowing with an otherworldly blue hue” skirts cliché, but the color recurs as cobalt dawn, earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Sublittoral fringe,” “water the color of mercury,” and the nets/docks provide tactile, occupational specificity that seeds later freedom; the whale-bone itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the ritual. Sensory selectivity mirrors emotional narrowing: golden light, salt-sugar dissolution. One vivid anchor—the scrimshaw’s smoothness against calloused hands—charges the final dissolution image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked mason jar of dried petals functions as micro-setting: it constrains his daily ritual and is handled in four distinct beats, charging the final image when flakes fall “like snow.” Wind-turbine moan supplies sonic pressure that sharpens the hush. Spatial choreography is immaculate—table, knife, cup, jar—across one continuous scene. Weather (turbine drone) directly shapes his coinage “remade hush,” qualifying for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cobalt stones and frozen lake create a vivid, consistent palette; the quartz colonnade functions as micro-setting that constrains the transcendence beat. Spatial choreography is clean—single figure moving toward center—though body-as-setting is underused. Weather (winter mirror) mirrors internal stasis and later thaw, supporting theme without overt symbolism. Sensory economy is strong: limited light, hum felt in bones, glare of quartz—details selected by an aesthete eye. The 9+ gate is missed because no environmental feature alters tactics after the touch; the lake’s thaw is observed, not interacted with.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glassblower’s courtyard is anchored early: prismatic ornaments, molten glow, fibrous plant scents. The hanging glass tools act as micro-setting, refracting light onto the reed tongue for the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean: Elara kneels, Gideon accepts, glassblowers pause in a single legible sweep. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s tone-perception bias, and the environment directly guides the trade ritual—meeting the 9+ gate for constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Golden shadows” and “dust motes like tiny spirits” give the lab a tactile glow; the carbide lens micro-setting acts as both tool and relic, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays steady; no world-rule inconsistency. For 9+ gate, the lens needed to constrain a physical choice—here it only prompts reflection—so capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory’s star-paths, shifting architecture, and thin curtains create a textured micro-setting that does constrain access to the dead. Sensory detail is selective—star-whispers, vellum texture—but occasionally drifts into catalogue listings of alcoves. The final image of glowing origami reuses the setting’s light motif to crystallize Elena’s stance, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    Skylight rain, onyx cards, brass tape, velvet cloth—selective, tactile, bias-filtered. Loft acts as micro-setting that constrains exposure & acoustics, charges final image (raindrop universes). Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Weather mirrors emotion without overt symbolism. Tape is handled twice, evolves from tool to legacy symbol—meets 9+ gate for object-use.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its shifting facets “reflecting the twilight” dictate Elara’s random path and final dissolution. Sensory triangulation—saffron against bronze, low hum in bones—anchors texture. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she orbits. Archive remains slightly generic—“labyrinth of forgotten knowledge” is placeholder—costing the top band, but the pagoda’s evolving glow compensates by charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cloud-library is sketched with scent of petals, floating seeds, crystal dome—sparse, sensorily selective, and never static. River stone’s cool weight against palm functions as micro-setting that constrains her grip and later heats to anchor the spectral contact. Spatial choreography stays clean across desk → shelf → dome → moonbeam axis. Setting details evolve (shadows stretch, stone warms), charging the final image without ornamental overload.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Misty workshop and lantern-light scales create a micro-setting that quietly guides Elara’s attention; the chameleon branch functions as a charged object in the final beat, constraining her gaze and recharging the adaptation motif—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Tower and tunnel are sketched in chilly, tactile strokes (“sharp chill of stone,” “earth that hummed”); selective detail keeps the space legible. The hourglass and coffee cup serve as micro-settings that constrain the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate. Larger world-rules (how miracles get displaced, how time-tunnels obey physics) remain unestablished, but at this length economy is favored over exposition. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions—so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The projection booth is rendered through tactile, lived-in detail—sprocket holes, red safelight, dust motes in the beam—each detail filtered through Elena’s synesthetic gaze. The booth simultaneously expands into a “cathedral” and contracts to the width of a frame, so the micro-setting (film strip as spatial corridor) literally constrains her movement and charging of the final image. No geographic drift or white-room syndrome; every object is handled and re-handled. Atmospheric specificity is the story’s strongest suit.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Aurora-lit archway + instrument + remembered stardust form a coherent micro-setting trio that actively constrains every beat: the sky supplies data, the tool supplies focus, the body supplies receptivity. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions across kneeling, dial-turning, arm-reaching moves. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s painterly bias: color > sound > touch; green-blue lights refract off bronze, never checklist sensory filler. Final image recycles the archway as threshold now recharged with new meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glowing dune functions as micro-setting: its luminescence guides the guard to the archive entrance and later mirrors the emergent seed, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is tight—visual radiance and pulsing light carry both wonder and utility. Spatial choreography is coherent across the train-to-sand transition, anchored by the handled chess clock. The ash-versus-bloom contrast is overt but justified by the closure’s reseeding image, giving the world a necessary mythic lift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mechanical rainforest is rendered with machined specificity—copper needles, solar-panel oak leaves—each detail filtering through Kaelen’s philosopher-perceiver bias. Micro-setting (the gear, the converging clearing) constrains the final placement and reconfigures meaning. Spatial logic is clean; no floating rooms. One more non-visual sense at climax would nudge 9-.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is the story’s spine: the veiled ridgeway’s ever-thickening mist literally steers the boats away from straight paths, enforcing the “indirect routes” mandate. The black-sand double-moon shore and waterfall of liquid twilight are tactile waypoints that gate the dragon chamber; removal would collapse the quest. Sensory selection mirrors Maris’s hush—sound of wave-licked stone, cool silver, star-glow heat—anchoring wonder without tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cobalt walls, leaded glass, snow-glitter, and the spiral staircase are selectively filtered through the bellhop’s tactile attention; the bolt, a micro-setting object, literally charges the ending as it warms in his palm. Spatial choreography is crisp: descending → crouch → pry → trace melody. Snow shifts from oppressive to rhythmic, mirroring internal change. Fortress rules (silence = shield) are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystalline dome, iron gall scent, dust motes in “increasingly erratic patterns” deliver sensory specificity; the library’s escalating decay physically constrains her ritual pace, charging the climax. Micro-setting works: the ink-stained margins become the battlefield where lineage and identity destabilize. Only minor over-syllabic flourish (“pause of shifting constellations” repeated) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station’s metal skin, floorboard dust, and the moored-adrift duality are tactiley anchored and return in the final image. The torn atlas sheet acts as micro-setting: its bleeding ink literalizes rising seas and forces her to re-calculate coastlines on the page. Sensory selection stays narrow—salt, rust, screen glow—matching an engineer’s gaze. Environment directly constrains her only tool (the atlas) and thus charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Spaceport debris, fractured ceiling, and settling metal create tactile specificity; the barefoot soles act as micro-setting that constrains path and amplifies vulnerability. The stone circle’s sudden appearance is the one credibility stretch, yet it is internally consistent as a discovered liminal zone, and its hum directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hot-spring steam, obsidian chamber, and volcanic rock are tactile and selective; geothermal power links directly to community stakes. The kite-tail script functions as micro-setting object that constrains the final action—no script, no open—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent from surface to crevice to chamber; only the abandoned kite’s exact prior location is fuzzy, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Arboretum cliff, salty air, oyster shell micro-settings constrain tactics—she must garden, breathe earth, find shell. Visual/ tactile balance mirrors breath pacing; no static catalogue. Final image of wind over cliff reuses setting as active agent that literally carries the photo seaward, satisfying 9+ gate. Only micro-slip: “seaside cliff” repeated twice early, a tiny echo.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The circular library-window-light axis is economically anchored and mirrored in her tightening spiral of thought. Dust motes as “tiny stars,” charcoal smudges into “gray oblivion”—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through an artist’s eye. The lighthouse setting never actively constrains her choices or charges the final image; it remains atmospheric rather than tactical, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Wind-carved stone and hummingbird drone are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain tactics (drone perimeter scan, ink slab carved from same wind-sculpted rock). Sensory hierarchy favors immediacies: eclipse shadow, ink shimmer, vitals hologram. Micro-setting (stone slab as lab bench) functions as setting-object that enables the final experiment; environment physically guides the disappearance beat. No static postcarding; each detail either magnifies anomaly or supplies tool.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cryo-library is tactile: amber-light frozen data, thermal suit hiss, archaic keyboard clatter. Cold is used as a constraint—fingers fly before frost slows them—so setting actively shapes tactics. The “echoing library under snow” refrain risks poetic over-repeat but is reweighted at the end when the same hush now “fills with revolutionary potential,” earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass dome’s condensation breathes with Rhiannon’s rhythm, micro-climate details guiding her pacing and pruning choices. Desert heat versus engineered coolness is returned in the final image, charging the “tranquil blaze” paradox. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating roses. The airship scrap’s texture (canvas, twine) is tactile and re-used, satisfying the micro-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden is not backdrop but tactical terrain: sound-blooms force the fisher to voice silence, to zig-zag, to weave longing-lonely-hope into net-fiber. Spatial choreography is meticulous—spike grounds, ripples spread, constellations drift—so every move is legible. The rail spike re-enters twice, its final transformed state charging the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The echoing observatory is vividly sketched—curved walls, star dome, childhood desk—and filters through Eleanor’s nostalgic lens. Rosewood nib and celestial maps supply tactile micro-setting that guides her document spread. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no white-room gaps. Setting never actively constrains her choices or charges the final image, capping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Laboratory blue glow, phonograph cabinet, and amber as micro-setting constrain the procedural choices; insect wing-shadow under circuit light mirrors his frozen cry. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual/tactile) filters through tattooist gaze. “Meteor hush” reappears to reconfigure final stillness, charging the image. Spatial choreography tracks amber hand-off and floor vibration cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grotto-as-micro-setting tightly constrains acoustics and sand placement; mist, tide, and stone guide every tactical choice. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—chalk dust memory, ceramic flake vibration—rather than tourist catalog. Final image of thickening mist charges the reconfiguration, giving the hush a new tonal weight. No visible cost attaches to Silas’s body or tools, keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting moves from generic ruin to specific body-scale map: chipped lines become “language,” stepping stone becomes ritual stage. Shattered sky and ash wind are filtered through Elias’s retrocognitive bias—he sees laughter-ghosts while others see rubble. Spatial choreography is clean: sandaled foot → bend → knee → center stone; crowd remains at respectful periphery. Weather (cold wind) contrasts the “warmth” he generates, charging the final image; environment actively mirrors internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moonlit maze, mossy stone stage, and synesthetic orchard are vividly filtered through Silas’s singer-performer bias: scents “taste,” applause lingers as perfume. Spatial choreography stays clean across translucent drift and echo-bounce. Final image—the garden glowing more vibrantly—uses setting as micro-setting that recharges the closure. Meets 9+ gate: the garden’s charged state is inseparable from the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The light-painting studio functions as both crucible and instrument: every camera angle, sweep of red/blue light, and geode glint is tethered to Maya’s attempt to “map the hidden pathways,” so environment directly constrains tactics. Sensory economy is good—sound is mostly absent, touch (static shock, chill skin) and sight (fractal lattice on the wall) carry the beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; lens, geode, and her body remain trackable. The studio never evolves beyond its initial state, so it supports but does not deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Coastal cave network is sharply sketched through Maya’s rope descent, cool stone, and thermal-color overlays; environment constrains pace and supplies the altar-like stage for the floating fossil. Selective sensory hierarchy (touch, temperature, limited light) stays anchored to her mapping priorities, feeding the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber warehouse, cliff-shadows, and shifting grains create a tactile, enclosed mood; micro-setting works—the buttons function as tactile “text” that constrains decoding choices. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s curator eye; the canyon echo’s jar reappears to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bluff's wind-carved topography, the overnight ice crystals, and the spring tilt all filter through a spy's sensory hierarchy—temperature read as threat, terrain as cipher. Weather actively narrows choice: mist cloaks him from observers while the thaw deadline drives the dawn ritual. The engraved pillbox serves as micro-setting; its weight in pocket constrains every stance shift. Final image—the silver hush whispering approval—re-weights the whole lattice of meteorological detail into a sanction rather than mere mood.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fog-bound crossing, droplet metronome, and worn wooden planks are filtered through the coachman’s professional prioritization of sound and silence, creating a tactile micro-setting that constrains his ritual timing. The yarn needle functions as portable setting-as-tool, its crimson fray absorbing mist, thus charging the final image when the last droplet falls and the needle flashes—meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The wasteland/floral contrast is economically sketched in four strokes (“scorched wasteland… inexplicably thriving wildflowers”) yet immediately guides Kael’s investigation. The lantern glass is a micro-setting star: its temperature, fracture map, and refracted timelines constrain every tactic he tries. Spatial choreography is spotless—he kneels, palms the glass, lifts it to sun, works soil; no impossible leaps. Final image of smoke bending light into portals re-weights the whole environment; setting literally supplies the exit window for meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor rock alcove is micro-setting as crucible: its darkness forces the gauge’s repurposing and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—fire-escape pots, leaky rowboat, rock seat, moon angle all tracked. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara attends to scent of earth, metallic water, creak of oarlock, never generic tourist catalog. Tool-as-setting (gauge) constrains tactics and shines the final beam—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tidal library breathes on the page—books “flowing in and out,” brass sundial hovering, stone hum traveling up her arm—each image filtering through Elena’s alienated longevity. Micro-setting (mirror wall, hum conduit) constrains her stance and literally conducts the final fusion. While cosmology is sketched, the sensory triangulation of brass, crystal, and vibration grounds the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is POV-driven: Elara notices petals “like crystal prisms,” raindrops still “clung,” twig spiral “gleaming with recent moisture”—all tactile and filtered through her whimsical attention. The floating temple and lily pond constrain movement, forcing slow foot-traffic that heightens reverence; the nest-as-micro-setting becomes the tactile pivot of the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Enough specificity to reach high-band gate, but the nest does not physically constrain a later choice, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Radio-station micro-setting is concrete—vintage dials, antenna, blue pulse—yet campus outside stays a vague “town” without proximity or social texture that could tighten stakes. The station tools constrain action (circuit mods risk rupture), satisfying 9+ gate, but wider geography is sketched not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cracked-ceiling starlight and viscous air are visceral, selective, and directly enable the star-threading mechanism. The compass as micro-setting constrains her grip and later her relinquishment. Sensory detail narrows to touch and sight under duress, matching claustrophobic attention. One minor slip: “ancient walls covered in faded runes” is static filler that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Quarry mist and granite textures are filtered through Elena’s tactile bias; spatial layout remains coherent. Weather thickens to isolate, mirroring theme of forgotten memory. Setting never constrains the investigation—no tactical use of ledges, water, or fog to hide or reveal. Strong sensory specificity lacks a final environmental charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The station’s damp concrete, humming equipment, and hidden copper-indent panel are tactile and specific; the copper nail itself serves as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Coastal mudflats and chaotic jet stream are sketched efficiently, but the larger world beyond the room stays generic; no sensory detail is wasted. Environment affects choice—the chill mirrors dread—yet the exterior storm never physically presses on the moment of activation, so the final image isn’t environmentally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mountain pull-out, guard-rail glass, and wind-mapped scaffold are filtered through musician perception (vibration, pitch, echo), giving sensory hierarchy. The scaffold’s evolving geometry supplies the micro-setting that literally channels Elias’s final step, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Only minor drift: “construction site below” stays visually vague, but spatial logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Abandoned circus train is not backdrop but micro-setting-as-tool: server-cages from lion cages and peeling big-top paint steer both mood and literal start-up space. The dusky palette evolves with business decay, constraining the final walk-away image; a hairline slip of orienting distance late in one shard keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    The observatory dome, telescope lens, and pressed daylilies are tactile, POV-filtered, and return to charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clean: clipboard set down, lens adjusted, telegram placed between them. Environment guides choice—only the dome’s telescopes allow the star-pattern discovery. What keeps this from 8.8 is that the setting never *constrains* Elara; access is never threatened or limited, so the final image is charged but not shaped by a physical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Swirling orchard vortex and cursed lake are kinetic, sensuous, and filter through druidic perception (“branches heavy with fruit that whispered secrets”). Spatial choreography holds; the lake’s black water and the seed’s warmth tether choice. Environment directly supplies the rescue tool (seed roots devour magical ice), qualifying for 9+ micro-setting gate. Occasional atmospheric filler (“impossible spirals”) slightly dilutes selectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt glade, dusk light, and the topiary-as-micro-setting are rendered with selective, sensory economy; color motif threads through every beat and constrains visibility inside the maze. Spatial logic is clean; scale shift to miniature is accepted fantasy cue. While world-rules of “Dreamers/Watchers” remain abstract, environment is concretely leveraged to guide choice and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but tool: roots dictate her path, bones supply the memory’s hiding place, the oldest tree anchors climax. Sensory triangulation (glow, cold, hum) tracks with emotional pressure. Micro-setting—tarot card as flat stone altar—directly enables closure. No description excess; every detail is filtered through her map-making perception.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Quarry trailer, dust, slow trucks, failing A/C, and micro-tool (magnifier) constrain attention and echo interior hollowing; final image of sealed scrap is recharged by setting’s grit. Sensory hierarchy filters through ex-roadie bias—sound memory, aluminum thread knowledge, dumpster relics. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room risk. Weather detail minimal but suffices for single-scene scope.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is built through select, POV-filtered detail—cuneiform indentations, magnetic stones, VAT 9529—each feeding the analogical engine. The Pamir peaks arrive only at the end, but the tablet-and-study micro-setting constrains her tools and choices throughout; the seed-as-micro-setting charges the final image by vibrating against her skin in the cold air, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting: the rising water physically halts movement and dictates the armor/forge interaction, so environment constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy is biased by the POV—mechanical gleam, cold fire hiss, wintersun hue—anchoring a lived-in library. Spatial choreography is clean; water level tracked across beats. Setting charges the final image: the last shimmer of water on the shelves literalizes the “layer” motif, earning its thematic keep.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bunker and crystal caves function as macro-setting, but the pearl-as-micro-setting is what constrains choice and literally reshapes on her head. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: inspector notices schematics, concrete dust, then the breathing light of pearl—professional gaze escalates to wonder. Spatial choreography is flawless; flashlight beam, footsteps swallowed, pedestal center all track cleanly. The final image of crown-light reflecting off every cave surface anchors the Charged Poise, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor withholding: we never learn city/season, but disorientation serves the liminal payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-choked station is rendered through decay textures: cracked tile, dust motes, moss-slick tunnel, each detail filtering Elena’s bereaved alertness. Spatial choreo tracks cleanly from waiting room → women’s bathroom → service stair → cavern; no impossible moves. Object-setting fusion: accordion tape, graffiti strata, and subterranean river all physically constrain or enable her final tribute. One micro-slip: river sound heard “in darkness” before any visual cue of water risks momentary float, but river immediacy is restored next line.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength: condensed-mist walls, spectral garments, hovering manuscripts deliver sensory specificity and tonal unity. The forest-to-library transition is cleanly choreographed; spatial anchors hold. Micro-setting (watch crystal as lens) usefully constrains reading the cipher, qualifying for 9+ gate. Still, some descriptors drift toward purple ("diaphanous covering," "ethereal glow") without pressure justification.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Velvet observatory functions as micro-setting: drapes absorb light and literally swallow sound, forcing Elara to weaponize resonance rather than volume. Ice-crystal violin and desert rose act as twin “bodies” whose spatial choreography (pollen drift, root uptake) is tracked without slip. Final image recharges both: tiny violin blooms from rose, reconfiguring the space into a clandestine nursery. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Skyborne grotto, crystalline walls, and aurora are more than postcard: the shifting light literally amplifies the frequencies Elara harvests, integrating setting into tactic. Emerald chip as micro-setting constrains every hand movement and charges the closing shelf image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices cold crystal, scent of apples, vibration of stone, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is tight: body on table, pouch at neck, shelf of vials—no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cedar, hairpin, and cloud-floor function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image. Scallop-shell light and “vineyard hush” are selective, sensory, character-filtered. Weathered bark and moonstone warmth are tactile, lived-in; no geographic drift. Setting evolution (tree→cloud→grotto) tracks cleanly with emotional altitude.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse micro-setting is lived-in: spiral stairs, lantern room, rafter chimes, all filtered through Elian’s professional eye for frequency and material. Smoke from the dead campfire and dawn mist provide tactile transitions that mirror his attenuated emotional state. Space stays coherent; no object teleportation. The chimes function as both tool and atmosphere, constraining his interpretive act and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    The magnetic grotto, initially unseen, becomes the charged mirror of the lesson, its starlit glow re-pricing the stakes at the exact beat Maya understands. Platform, pond, and sycamore leaves are filtered through meditative attention, not tourist catalog; the body itself (tightening skin) functions as micro-setting that constrains Elien’s choices. Spatial choreography is immaculate—blindfolded reach, stone drop, ripple sight—all tracked. Only the grotto’s physical rules (why magnetism equals revelation) remain abstract, a hairline slip that keeps the 9+ gate closed.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The canyon is not backdrop but instrument: bone towers refract light onto the arrowhead, dust transmits ancestral footfalls, the circular depression literally shapes the final placement. Micro-setting (arrowhead, stones, flock) constrains every tactical move; even Kael’s bare feet read as tactile antennae. Sensory economy is tight—sound and vibration dominate vision, matching the harmonic premise. The towers’ “whispering surfaces” reverb in the ending pulse, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ice-spire, cloud-deck, and folly are sketched with chilly economy; “crystalline window,” “clouds beneath his feet solidified into mist” give quick spatial grip. The keystone itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its glow literally prevents automated spellwork—meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual chill) but matches the POV’s aesthetic hunger. One minor loose thread: we never learn how the folly stays aloft, but the story teaches early that impossibilities are accepted, so credibility holds.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Harbor, pier, and Victorian lighthouse are sketched with selector’s economy; the sunken library is tactile—mahogany door, starlight robes, salt-woven pages—yet never stalls momentum. The key tag and oil lamp function as micro-settings that constrain hand and choice. Final polychrome lamppost flame recharges every prior glow, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ambered observatory deck is evoked through light fractures, alumina walls, and static crackle; these details stay in motion rather than cataloguing. The obsidian slab and foreign coins supply micro-setting that physically anchors the coin-toss ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects remain trackable. Light and materiality echo the contraction theme, giving the final image a charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory brass mechanism, cracked lens, and scattered light prisms constrain the naming ritual—each beam must hit page for magic to work. Dust motes, dusk angle, and echo acoustics filter through reaper’s bone-perception, keeping detail selective. Micro-setting of atlas page doubles as setting object, charging final crystallization. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sapphire viaduct and dawn light are vividly, selectively rendered; the meteor-bronze bell and dripping water serve as micro-setting that constrains the mage’s ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean, but the cosmic-scale oceanic rules are announced late and never integrated into the physical environment, so the setting cannot charge the final image at 9-level.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridge-way body-as-setting steers every vantage; the sapphire label and the emerging rooftops act as micro-setting props that literally constrain what can be seen or retrieved. Sensory selection (violet/indigo twilight, mirrored hush) is POV-true and echoes interior stillness. One nit: no tactile detail of mud or smell of silt on the exposed town—minor but keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard are vividly sensory—prismatic spray, copper hair catching refracted light—and the blue flame that “burns without consuming” is a concrete tool that constrains the ritual. Spatial choreography is clear: she enters, centers, lights, lifts, settles. Yet the world rule (“burns without consuming”) is told, not demonstrated through hazard or limitation, so environment never truly endangers or tests her.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Canopy-hum in thin air, moonlit metal click, ciphered keypad—three tactile anchors that constrain every next move. The arbor functions as micro-setting: height equals exposure; cold wind equals countdown. Buckle reflections and rustling leaves mirror internal vigilance without overt symbolism, charging the final image where polished metal equals revised survival algorithm.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock dojo, nutrient jar, and shimmer of historical rewrite are sketched with economical specificity; the obsidian pedestal and non-dissolving adhesive ground the macro-weird in tactile detail. Micro-setting (the jar itself) becomes the crucible that constrains every choice. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible body or object positions—allowing the brain to pulse as the literal heart of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moonshadow Brook, silver-flowing darkness, and storm-washed air are sensuously filtered through Elara’s puzzle-designer eye; each detail is selective and mood-driven. The brook’s murmur recurs as an auditory heartbeat that paces thought, charging the final planting beat. Spatial grounding is stable; weather affects light and mood without slipping into postcard cliché. Micro-setting (seed envelope, magnifier, custom planter) constrains the tactile action and is re-handled on page, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: its stone curvature dictates the modulation tactics and literally returns the transformed lullaby. The leaf blower’s weight, vibration, and fuel scent are filtered through Silas’s grip, making tool-as-setting constrain every choice. The final giggle is located in the tunnel depths, so environment charges the closure image. One hairline slip: “household perched on the ridge” is visually evocative yet never re-anchored after the first mention, leaving exterior spatial relations slightly floating.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Frozen garden, mist, and light-bent roses are vividly particularized; the “weathered-smooth cherub” and “oceans of liquid starlight” give tactile and visual hooks. Micro-setting succeeds: the pendant against scaled chest functions as portable anchor and later constraint. Spatial choreography is cinematic—guardian perched, then steps off—but no environment or object ever threatens or limits action; hence the 9+ gate (constraint charging final image) is not quite met.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember nexus is not backdrop but heat-source that constrains ritual timing and supplies the “dormant power” he taps for the final dissolve. Micro-setting includes his own body (weathered hands, bare feet) and the evolving staff whose changing temperature and weight alter his grip choices. Selective sensory hierarchy—glowing particles, pulsing heat, crystallized starlight—mirrors alchemical priorities. Only reason it misses 9.0 is that spatial choreography (distance to ember core, exact perimeter) stays slightly fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted antennas, humming fragment, and wind-whipped gorge create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her balancing stance atop the tower; every sensory pick is filtered through her signal-hunter bias. Spatial choreography stays clean across her climb-place-tune sequence. The “blue-white field” at closure re-uses the sky/steel palette, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    The spectral grotto’s liquid-starlight water and triple moons are vividly etched, supply the magical rule-set, and charge the final merger image. Micro-setting (hourglass, ferry console) doubles as tool and talisman, constraining Liam’s actions via touch-glow cues. Selective sensory detail favors luminous visuals; other senses are under-used, keeping it just shy of top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery-as-body constrains every beat—walls breathe, illusions mirror gazers, thread responds to touch—charging the final image where the space becomes co-author. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (Elias notices pulse, shimmer, mist). Spatial choreography is clean; no prop teleporting. Micro-setting (sinew thread) functions as setting and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Benthic pressure, viewport algae, and refracted starlight are woven through Kael’s perceptual filter; the city feels lived-in rather than toured. The chain link micro-setting charges the final image and constrains his tactile calculations. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—other senses appear only briefly—but the selective detail supports tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mist-clad atrium and twilight fog are filtered through Elena’s ritual attention, constraining visibility and guiding her steps to the garden bench—setting actively shapes movement. Sound and temperature are left out, but selective visual haze mirrors the liminal premise without overwriting. Micro-setting (decades-old hearing aid) doubles as prop and emotional anchor, qualifying for 9+ object-as-setting test. Spatial choreography holds across archways → garden → bench.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Facility, cylinder, Codex, and salt-rot concrete are not backdrop but equipment: the cylinder is the portal, the Codex the key, the narrowing stairwell presses against her phobia. Gold flecks respond to cable EM fields, marrying tech to occult. Sensory hierarchy—damp air licking skin, humming pipes inside bones—filters through her spelunker senses. Setting constrains the final image: only this cliff, this tide, this door licenses her ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Opal walls, snow-blur, and telescope light are filtered through digital perception; sensory hierarchy favors shimmer and hush that mirror ghostly limbo. The porcelain shard and inkwell serve as micro-setting that guides the ritual hand; weather halts exactly at closure, charging the final silence. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift. For 9+ gate the shard would need to alter the final image—here it merely returns to rest.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bone towers, copper veins, and echo tunnel are tactile, selective, and return in the final harmonic image, charging the closure. The canyon’s acoustic property literally enables the recording tactic, so setting constrains choice. Sensory economy is strong; no tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the diamond against the sternum) doubles as body and tool—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Underground garden is vividly textured: moon-petal flowers, upside-down gremlins, star-vine watered by hand. Selective sensory focus (scent of frostbitten hope, gravitational play) mirrors Aris’s shifting awe. The flint arrowhead’s evolving luminescence tracks environmental rules without exposition dump, charging the final constellation image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Sky-bridge,” “metallic divide,” “iridescent locust shell,” and “crystalline fruit” give tactile specificity; the bridge’s metal becomes the final trellis, so environment charges closure. Selective sensory focus (sound of violin, pulse of shell) mirrors POV priorities. Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and return. One cap: the orchard’s rules (living statues, heart-rhythm pacification) are asserted more than discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt arcade light, flickering against twilight, constrains visibility and tones the unease; the bottle’s glass walls become micro-setting that literally cages choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elias notices scanner angles, not décor. Weather outside evolves causally from contained storm to real rain, mirroring release. Spatial choreography is clean: booth-back-shadow, door flare, exit into puddles—no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is both pressure and tool: the train’s rusted decay vs. eternal garden directly enables the final choice (carpenter can only sing inside the chime-lit oasis). Sensory selection is POV-driven—carpenter notes “broken music box,” “wooden hooves,” not tourist visuals. Spatial choreography stays clean across the impossible corridor; weather is internalized as “misting hush.” The wind-bell micro-setting constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “scientific poetry library” is evoked through smells, shelf-logic, and the impossible glow of seven book-spines; it never needs exposition. Micro-setting works via the scarf—its frayed threads, warmth, and final dissolution ground every shift. Spatial choreography stays clean: patrons circle unaware while the impossible configuration forms in her cleared aisle. The environment directly constrains the climax: only here, at 3 a.m., with these books, can the hyperbolic gateway hold.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archipelago is sketched through predawn breath and library murmurs; light itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory economy favors sound and luminosity over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—easternmost point → basement studio → northern island—with no impossible jumps. Environment charges the final image: light as communicative medium.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crossroads and ribbon function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical move; starlight and indigo sky aren’t decorative but gate conditions for the ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean through three circumambulations. The fading ribbon in dawn’s first silver provides final image charge per 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sunken greenhouse, broken glass, dew-capped mushrooms, and shipwreck skeletons are rendered through tactile verbs (“traced,” “palmed,” “kneeled”) that constrain every positional choice. Constellations function as micro-setting, their misalignment guiding Elara’s charting action and final key-shape realization. Spatial choreography is flawless; distances between ring, ships, and horizon remain trackable across beats, allowing the final image to glow with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Waterfall, parapet, and moss function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual stance; mist and rainbow re-weight the final image. Sensory triangulation is deliberate—sound of falls, shimmer of seed, press of moss under knees—never catalogued, always filtered through the pruner’s painterly eye. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible props. The seed’s evolving optics supply the required “tool that charges closure,” clearing 9-entry gate.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting: crystalline walls refract light that guides Elena’s needle angle and supplies the “multicolored shards” that mirror her psyche. Starlight above becomes a narrative clock—spirits settle “like snowflakes finding earth,” recharging the opening image. The net’s fiber age and salt-stiffness constrain how each knot can be unraveled, determining pace. Sensory economy is tight; no visual overdose, tactile priority fits restorer POV.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-scoured vault itself functions as micro-setting: its dripping ceiling stains the frescoes and rhythms Elara’s attention, guiding her to seek what is erased rather than what remains. The torn map edge is handled twice—first as artifact, finally as threshold—charging the closure image. Celestial alignment is rendered through concrete photographic data, not cosmic purple prose. Spatial choreography is clean as Elara layers transparencies and realigns the map under the vault’s skylight.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure-blind ocean outside the window and the “massive oak table” under miles of seawater create a tactile, impossible space that is credibly lived-in: Elara sets the globe on that table, wipes water from the glass, hears her footfalls echo. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices exact angles and miniature kanji, not tourist décor. However, the environment never physically constrains her (she could as easily be in a dry vault), so it supports atmosphere more than choice; that caps the score below 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard’s shifting graffiti functions as both setting and tool, constraining choices by serving as the sole interface to the ghost. Sensory detail is selective—mist, spray-paint smell, metallic etchings—filtered through Elara’s synesthetic bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The micro-setting (plate as translator) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Icebound spire is not backdrop but constraint: elevator mechanism, fracturing light, and cold leather directly enable the decryption tactic. Micro-setting (goggles, diary, crystalline window) functions as interactive tools rather than scenic decoration. Spatial choreography inside the moving car is impeccable; no floating props. Final image—deck windows showing “endless sky” she can now see through two lenses—recharges the motif and would collapse if relocated.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gondola itself functions as micro-setting: creaks dictate when she pauses pen-strokes, brass scope’s weight steadies her wrist, altitude thins air and sharpens perceptions. Selective sensory hierarchy (meteorologist’s eye, then grieving daughter’s) filters every detail; tourist-catalog filler is absent. Cloud edges, color shift, and gondola sway are braided into interior beats so setting never stalls motion; instead it charges the final image of dusty starlight that reweights “spooled wholeness.” Environmental plausibility holds—gondola physics, telescope optics, cloud nomenclature all accurate and choice-relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tree-trunk library is not backdrop but tool: its spiraling grain guides Elara’s fingers to the loose board, its carved leaf-holes become the very projector screen for her sky-map. Micro-setting (coin, clay, plaster) constrains the final craft action. Sensory economy is biased to touch and shadow, matching her non-visual gift. The “heightened stillness” is sustained through selective auditory absence until the first mechanical growl, a cadence shift that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Airship deck, hopscotch board, and trapped beam are sketched with selective sensory strokes (dusty squares, flicker against birds). Micro-setting works: the board’s physical sequence literally constrains Eli’s decoding movements. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible shifts. Environment could bite harder—wind, altitude risk, or social stakes—to push the 9 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Frozen library above clouds” is immediately tactile—ice on shelves, breath-clouds, groaning hinges—and the mirror-hall later reconfigures the same space into infinite recursion, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining navigation and charging the final ancestral panorama. Gear assortment and clockwork heart serve as micro-setting that dictates every beat of the uncapping sequence. Sensory economy is strong; sight and sound dominate, matching the cold, hushed palette. Spatial choreography holds as Elias moves from doors → mirrors → pedestal, with mirrors tracking his body angle beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Floating rock arches and violet sunsets are vivid but decorative; only the watering bell actively constrains choice, earning its keep in two beats. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual—and the orchard’s spatial layout is never tested under pressure; we never feel a body navigating rows or heights. The nebula’s shimmer is repeated like a screensaver rather than evolving with stakes. Still, the bell’s tactile detail (seed-pod shape, larval mist) supplies enough specificity to anchor the miracle moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse is more than postcard: its pane-of-hush walls literally absorb sound, forcing Elias to fight silence with whispered song. The cracked puppet cheek is micro-setting-as-tool; only that flaw lets the lullaby seep in. Spatial choreography is immaculate—iron stairs, clock chamber, spindle contact—every move tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory picks are selective—shimmering nut, razor wings, violet twilight—and filtered through Elias’s practiced eye. Micro-setting works: the hollow tree stores both blueprint and spent device, giving the orchard tactile continuity. The labyrinth’s geography stays vague; distances and junction logic are glossed, so spatial pressure never mounts.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Micro-setting triumph: the ravine’s braided channels physically mirror polymer/relationship logic and directly inspire the lab notebook sketch at the end, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is disciplined—foam, chrysalis, river song—each filtered through Elara’s chemistry ear. Spatial choreography stays crisp during descent and eddy tracing. The environment literally constrains her insight path and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass orchard, floating library, bottled moonlight—details are vivid, selective, and filtered through the vendor’s cataloguing gaze. The micro-setting (the blank slate in hand) literally becomes the door, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. One minor slip: “swirling sea of clouds” stays postcard until the library shift tremor ties it to visitor denial, but this arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Selective sensory detail—brittle walls, coral ice gleaming in desert heat—keeps the impossible pavilion tactile. The tidal pools function as both micro-setting and oracle, literally guiding Kael’s feet; removing them would break the entry beat. Weather (unseasonable rain) enables the entire plot and is felt on skin, not declared. One minor over-description: “glistening remnants” repeats the rain idea within two lines, a small slackening.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clock-tower interior is tactile: dusty box, polished brass, resonant bell. The tower’s vertical space and shared acoustics are used to stage the multilingual meetings, so setting constrains logistics. Micro-setting (the weight in Elena’s palm) reappears at closure, charging the final image. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual and auditory—but selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit canyon is more than backdrop—its silver light literally enables the mirror’s refraction and supplies the story’s dominant visual motif; the same Sheen reappears in the final image, recharging the theme. Sensory layering is selective: moonlight on fractured glass, ancient rock echoing whispered voice, circuit boards painted ethereal blue—each tied to the POV’s helix mindset. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object moves. Micro-setting (the broken mirror as lens) constrains the climax and qualifies for 9+ gate; however, the canyon itself never threatens or limits the engineer’s actions, so stays just below elite band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rain-water chamber, moonlit aperture, and mist-walled grotto are sketched with economical sensory triangulation. Spatial choreography stays coherent; body position tracks as she floats up and exits. No environmental constraint actually frustrates her plan; the grotto supplies exactly the three pedestals promised, so setting decorates rather than complicates. Micro-setting (crystal pendant) charges entry but not the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting: its cool surface, rainbow scatter, and vibration conduit constrain every tactile decision Elara makes. Alder roots embracing the statue supply spatial choreography that determines where she can kneel and carve. Fog, light, and wood grain are filtered through her synesthetic bias—she “hears” cracks as music—so environment and body merge. Final image of the insulator “already beginning the next translation” charges the closing beat, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    The magnetic nexus is both macro-setting and instrument: pulses meter tension, twilight color encodes rules, and the central stone becomes a micro-stage for the final act. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s chess-tuned perception—patterns first, temperature second, sound of silence last. Spatial choreography is clean: notebooks radiate in semicircle, stone lifted to sky, body within crackling field. Missing only a kinesthetic beat under extreme field stress to hit 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Workshop’s starlit crystals, tuning forks, and spatial layout are filtered through Elara’s vocational gaze; tools constrain tactics—only the exact fork-crystal pair will do. Sensory economy favors tactile & auditory immediacy; visual fireworks outside mirror inner crescendo without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the diary clasp) acts as final charged object; environment plus tool jointly unlock closure, meeting 9+ gate. No credibility errors; anchoring complete by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The treetop canopy is rendered through tacticle rope bridges, swirling mists, and seed-filament bioluminescence—details that constrain movement and later charge the final image. Micro-setting objects (wrapping paper, seed, pouch) are handled repeatedly and evolve: paper from archive to language, seed from morbid specimen to guardian. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s nose: every beat is filtered through scent. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the vertical climb. One slip: “the turning of the tide’s thought” is repeated without concrete environmental tether, keeping it just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating arches and inverted rivers are rendered through sensory motion—latticed shadows, silver serpents—anchoring navigation stakes. The arrow-tip doubles as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Only the “orchard planet” macro-setting stays postcard-level, but the river-road and crystal-embedded First Arch charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Container canyon as micro-setting is vivid and specific: wind corridors, compression scars, distorted metal—each detail is filtered through Elena’s investigative eye and directs her next survey move. The port’s scale is implied rather than catalogued, keeping economy. The only missed opportunity is letting the environment physically corner or wound her, which would have lifted it to 9 territory.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ice cavern is no postcard; refractive geometry dictates where Eira can stand, which bell she must strike next. The amber sheet’s warmth against sub-zero flesh is a micro-setting that constrains grip and tempo. Spatial choreography is flawless—bells suspended, observers at mouth, aurora overhead—tracked across every gesture. One slip: “frozen valleys below” is the only exterior anchor; had it returned in the hush’s aftermath, the image would have charged even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thunder-echo range is not backdrop; its avalanch hush and telluric fissures literally shape where Eldrin can place each marker and how sound propagates—environment as constraint. The gilded reed flute itself functions as micro-setting: its gold etchings, weight change, and sonic physics are handled on-page and charge the final image. Sensory economy is perfect—cold stone, swift stream, pale light—each detail mirrors or contrasts his internal freeze/thaw. No setting detail exceeds the scene’s needs; world rules stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    The topaz walls and halo fragment are tactile, refract light onto ceiling planes, and constrain her optics bench; spatial choreography stays clean as Thomas crosses the room. Sensory economy is good—starlight, lead dust, press clank—but the exterior city/era remains blank, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ridgeway, auroras, and pendant-as-micro-setting are vivid and selective; snow underfoot becomes a living calendar of her passage. The environment never blocks or wounds her, so constraint is aesthetic rather than tactical, capping the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors visual shimmer; other senses appear but stay subordinate. Spatial choreography is clean; village distance and ridge descent track logically.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Quartz arbor, mist, and frost form a single micro-setting that refracts light and emotion, mirroring the stakes. Water droplets on pillars and shifting frost give tactile, visual specificity without catalogue. The car-window frost is the active interface that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bamboo forest, orchard, mossy stall floor, and amber bead are all tactile, odor-rich, and filtered through Elara’s spinner-attuned fingers; the green-gold light refracts through stalks and resin alike, binding setting to theme. Spatial geography stays coherent—three days’ walk, final towering shoot—and the bead functions as micro-setting that constrains her path. Weather is silent yet palpable, mirroring the hush. The loom’s idle presence bookends the tale, turning environment into instrument, a lovely final image that recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating rock arches and orchard scale are signaled early and return as the charged final image. The mine shaft micro-setting constrains every forge beat; dust motes catch magical flame, welding place to action. Sensory economy is high—no tourist catalogue, only blacksmith-noticed details. The arches’ glow reweights the ending, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dust motes, green glass warmth, and frozen tools create a tactile micro-setting that doubles as emotional barometer; the repair bay’s shifting incarnations constrain what the protagonist can attempt. Sensory selection skews visual, but glass temperature and murmur texture keep it multi-sensory. The final image of dim glass in slanted light recharges the opening, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Salt-oil-“pause between thunderclaps” is selective synesthesia that filters through Elias’s professional priorities. The locked lantern room functions as micro-setting: its trapped vibrations make the impossible stone-stack credible and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral climb, floorboard lift, and stone placement. Weather and tool details (oil reservoir, lens) are accurate and tied to maintenance action, never tour-list.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    Emerald lighthouse, glass lantern, and aurora-wick are tactile, light-bending tools that constrain how she steers ships; the “total internal reflection” mechanic is shown twice, charging the final image. Sky and sea narrow to a channel only the beam reveals, so setting actively shapes tactics. The “last newspaper” anchor is economical, dating the world without exposition. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral stairs, mirror arrays, and water-level paths.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment is inseparable from action: the swaying rope ladder, refracting prisms, and rock-bound tea-house dictate access, pacing, and light experiments. The morpho-wing box and sun-patch floor function as micro-settings that constrain dye mixing; their gleams decide ingredient timing. Sensory hierarchy is dyed to Kaelen’s gaze—color temperature, refraction angles, valley mist—each filtered through cardiac otherness. Final image of valley mist absorbing dyed narratives recharges every prior visual, meeting the 9- gate for setting-driven closure despite minor over-description flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stormlit tower, brass gears, and scarred oak plank are vividly filtered through Samuel’s practiced eye; the sextant’s “liquid mercury” swirl charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive within 120 words; micro-setting (floorboard-of-oak) literally directs the moonbeam that unlocks the vision, meeting the 9+ constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Greenhouse+mica window function as micro-setting: window reflects progress, greenhouse supplies the only actionable resource (starlight saplings). Sensory triage—cold mica, glowing leaves, gossamer threads—tracks attention under urgency. Spatial choreography stays clean as keeper moves row to row. Final image of window showing “sunrise existing elsewhere” is inseparable from closure; environment literally reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library’s nested architecture (hidden-in-plain-sight doorways, grandfather clock as time-tool) constrains every move; sensory economy favors smell of paper and hush that mirrors Eleanor’s internal quiet; spatial choreography tight as she moves “through the aisles” to final sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Secret tea house and guerrilla garden function as micro-setting: mint through flagstones constrains foot placement, wisteria curtain hides the entrance, altering Eliza’s stealth tactics. Sensory selection skews olfactory (yeast, sage, rain on tin) matching her “noticer” bias. Weather (autumn storm) is not backdrop—rain determines when she reads the letter and charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds: bread wrapper, kettle, letter are tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The library’s frozen silence is not backdrop but “a physical presence against his skin,” constraining movement and attention; the brass-crystal sampler’s hum is the only warmth, guiding tactile choice. Spatial anchors track cleanly—velvet cushion, ice-encrusted windows, workstation—without tourist excess. The setting’s cold literally slows action (gloved hands, crystallized time), making meticulous care mandatory; environment shapes tactics. While no single object reconfigures the final image, the cumulative quartz hush charges the Charged Poise, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-influenced closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pier market is sketched with selective sensory economy: creaking wood, hushed negotiations, barrels of rum. These details double as social map—proximity to Malachi’s coin-counting back room dictates risk—so environment steers tactic. The watch fob serves as micro-setting whose gear-clicks mesh with surrounding whispers, constraining her timing for the final lie. No 9+ because weather and salt-air are generic; still, the marketplace is lived-in and spatially trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lavender bluff, aurora overhead, and vibrating tin ring function as micro-setting that literally steers choice (ring glow charts energy, lavender blooms react). Sensory triangulation—metallic, ozone, salt, honey—maps proximity to convergence; environment governs attention and decision. Specificity is high yet economical; no exposition dump. Could edge higher if bluff terrain (drop-off, wind shear) physically threatened stance during the handshake.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal cave functions as active pressure: reflective surfaces literalize self-confrontation; loosened panel provides literal hiding place that now enables reclamation. Amescent light reframes palette—hidden blues in charcoal become visible, guiding final repaint. Micro-setting: the damp handrail receives ghostly prints, externalizing stain of past cowardice. Setting constrains choice—only this cave offers both secrecy and spectral light; removing it would break hiding/revelation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse city is sketched with selective, sensory economy: “glass-domed workshop,” “air filtration system hummed weakly,” “warped by humidity.” These details double as pressure gauges—failed filtration equals bodily peril—so environment actively constrains choice. The zinc plate’s warmth and the floorboard’s concealment give micro-setting tactile life, charging the final image when both objects reappear in the satchel.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    The whispering bluff above the clouds is evoked through sonic and optic detail—vibrations, overtones, refracted dawns—rather than postcard vistas. The tower’s interior is sketched only as needed: crystal strings, mirrors, the fragment’s thousand-color spectrum, all filtered through Elara’s tuner senses. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; bodies never teleport. The setting’s micro-climate (silence, altitude, light) directly shapes the invention of the sculpture, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining her materials and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glass dome, bio-luminescent petals, and android chest cavity function as micro-settings that constrain action: the dome’s failing field forces the miniaturization choice, and the chest-panel cache is the literal escape hatch. Selective detail (electromagnetic colors that shouldn’t exist) paints instant atmosphere without checklist overload.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    The courtyard at dawn is sketched with selective sensory strokes—steaming cups, gold light, benches—enough to anchor communal ritual but never constraining choice. The locket and the locked mailbox serve as micro-settings that charge closure; without them the reconfiguration fails. Spatial choreography stays loose (we never see Leo travel to the post office), so the environment informs rather than impedes. Detail is purposeful, but no weather or physical obstacle alters tactics; hence stays functional, not pivotal.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken lab is evocatively anchored—coral-encrusted corners, dripping pipes, filtered sunlight—each detail filtered through Elara’s practiced body. Spatial choreography stays clean as she dances among consoles. The hangman’s dice function as micro-setting, warming in palm and charging the final release; this object-as-setting meets the 9+ gate but the world rules (how dance maps to code) remain vague, preventing higher.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective, urgent sensory filtering—“salt crystal facets catching lantern light”—anchors every move; the lighthouse chamber and tidal sand constrain shovel angle and visibility. The whale corpse functions as micro-setting, dictating where she can dig. Final image re-uses lantern-light on buried crystal, recharging the visual motif.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The brook, moonlit water, and paper wing function as micro-setting: water’s rhythm paces breath, paper’s translucence signals interface with the unseen, and moonlight teaches the textural palette. Spatial choreography stays clean—kneeling, palm-cradling, air-tracing, releasing—each gesture grounded in the immediate circle of power. Sensory selection is biased to the summoner's priorities: hush, flow, silver light. The environment constrains the ritual’s tempo and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The historic district is sketched via selective, POV-filtered details—symbols on windowsills, creaking timbers—never catalogued. Rooftop garden space is economically anchored: cushions, potted plants, city glitter below, all narrowing to the seal’s brass gleam. Weather (meteor shower) is integrated into the closure image, charging rather than decorating. No object or environment constrains a tactical choice enough to reach the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Garden, shell, and crystals are textured through Elara’s skeptic-perceptual filter; the moss under her knees and the warming shell anchor micro-setting and constrain her geometric ritual, charging the final illuminated stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marble/aurora pair is not postcard scenery: the shifting light times Elias’s pen strokes and mirrors moral transition from cold blue to forgiving purple. Stalactite drip supplies audible metronome, tightening his final night. Heritage thorn and crystal vial act as micro-setting that constrains the climax—he must break the seal to draw blood. Spatial choreography clean: key pressed to block, stone dissolves, parchment retrieved—no floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    Serpentine nexus under starlight isn’t backdrop but navigational puzzle—star patterns literally shift paths—and the seashell functions as micro-setting that constrains her next disclosure. Canyon walls reverberate her song back at the child, making geography accomplice to closure. Specific, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selective sensory detail—“frigid waters,” “coral-encrusted beams,” “candles flickered”—efficiently sketches submerged ruin and ice shrine without checklist excess. The melted snow globe charges the closing image, satisfying micro-setting rule. Spatial tracking is coherent across dive, shrine, and dream visitations. Two minor slips: “borrowed starlight” is reused three times without reweighting, and glacier ice as altar material is accepted on assertion rather than felt chill.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: hemp fibers, bamboo whisk, and moon-lit net become the universe. River cabin, parapet stones, and firefly constellations are filtered through the philosopher’s taxonomic gaze, giving tactile handling and spatial coherence. Weather (post-rain damp) makes stones literally whisper, guiding his pilgrimage; the setting constrains timing and footfalls. Final image—foam sea in porcelain—recharges every prior thread. Only the village remains a vague backdrop; no credibility breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.7)
    Wasteland orchard is vividly particular: glowing soil, trees that lean, diamond prism in storm light. Radiation-filter stillpoint is taught early and constrains the final choice—Maya must hide the orchard to protect the mechanism. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single location. Select sensory detail (radioactive dust, faint soil glow) integrates with action, never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory is evoked through ozone-stained fingertips and cobalt webs dancing across walls—details that constrain Elias’s sensory scope and physically guide his translations. Weather is not backdrop but medium, forcing schedule and method; the portico’s glass re-weights the final image as mirror, not window. Micro-setting (glass, dials, ozone) functions as charged object and earns the 9-gate. Minor gap: airship access mentioned once but never exploited for tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is biased to the poet’s scavenger eye—salt-stained carvings, dust motes as “tiny performers”—and the loft’s sand-filtered light constrains his privacy. The senior-center table becomes the charged micro-setting where the final image crystallizes. Details are woven through action, never catalogued. Enough specificity to reach high band, but the environment never actively blocks or endangers him, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drift-ice marina is not postcard scenery: the cracking “like distant bones” mirrors the artifact’s fragility, and the frozen seaweed crunch under boots constrains speed and sound. The lighthouse stone’s low hum is a tactile micro-setting that literally guides Elias’s hand to the lock. Azure coat recurs as both uniform and ritual garment, charging the final image. Only nit: no weather shift after sonic discharge, a missed causal echo.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Frozen lake, basalt corridors, and magnetic viaduct are vividly filtered through the mapper’s star-honed perception; each constrains action (lake as mirror, basalt as resonator). Spatial choreography is clean; weather and stone actively participate in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tunnel ambience is filtered through Maya’s investigator eye—water levels, fiber traces, rust—each detail doubles as evidence and atmosphere. The lantern’s greenish patina and pry-marks become micro-setting that directly guides her next forensic move. Weather history (drought broken) governs standing water and evidence preservation, causally linked to plot. No static catalog; every sensory notch alters her tactical choices or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shop is sketched with selective tactile density—aged wood polish, soft ticking, stained-glass transom—each detail filtered through Michael’s clerical habit of noticing ambient hush. Spatial choreography is clean: door → bench → stool → exit; bodies track. Weather image (storm-light) is repurposed as moral semaphore at the climax, charging the final image. Micro-setting (velvet case, pocket, letter) functions as environmental constraint that alters choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Workshop, acid sea, and kaleidoscope are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered; the acid sea’s fumes seeping through floorboards literally stiffen gears, enforcing causal pressure. Spatial choreography is clean as the glider glides from scattered tools to central kaleidoscope to hidden alcove. The bell’s brass ordinariness charged by silence functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. No orientation drift; anchors (who/where) appear within first 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Archive as labyrinthine dataspace is economically evoked through access-denied grays and static-charged screen. The Stellaris patch reappears with reweighted meaning, satisfying micro-setting gate. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; a haptic jolt (keyboard heat, server hum) is missed. Spatial choreography inside restricted sector remains legible—no floating corps of data.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gnarled apple trees, diamond-faceted in moonlight, and the ice floes groaning below the cliff are sensory, selective, and mirrored in the crystal’s facets—setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: Elena moves from orchard edge to lighthouse beam path; shadows wrap without dislodging her footing. Weather (wind howl, tide shift) cues the ritual’s cadence, constraining timing. The orchard and ice reappear in the closing sweep of light, cementing their symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drift-ice marina is more than backdrop: jagged sheets that “cracked and moaned like living things” narrow Elena’s options—boats are trapped, volunteers work between floes, she stands at literal edge. Parasol tip serves as micro-setting in pocket, its ivory curve re-weighted from funeral relic to stay-anchor. Sensory hierarchy narrows under cold: sound of ice, sting of wind, heat of tea thermos. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible body or boat placements.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Amber pavilion, drifting leaves, and pocketed scorched paper create a tight micro-setting that filters every perception; the burned edge is tactile and recurs enough to function as a “tool” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: sentinel alone beneath pavilion, station vacant, vines surrounding. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and touch in autumn gloom—appropriate to solitary watchman. Setting quietly guides his metaphorical comparisons without overt symbolic nudging.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective, breath-level sensory detail (“obsidian concealment,” “sand…held memories”) keeps the desert and temple tactile without cataloguing. The kinetic parapet is evoked more as mythic engine than machined object, yet its rumble beneath the walker’s soles in the final beat lets the setting constrain stance. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Micro-setting (half-mask, mosaic floor) functions as tool and threshold, charging the final image enough to brush the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lavender scent as cleansing agent and rusted factory as slow-motion ruin are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elara’s “decay-and-renewal” vocation; the environment literally perfumes the air while metal rots, a concrete tension that charges the theme. Micro-setting is present—the photographs on the ground become the story’s stage—but they never constrain tactics or final image; stakes remain emotional, not spatial. Factory ruins stay distant backdrop, so the 9+ gate (setting must shape tactics/image) is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Library at dawn is anchored by slanted light, dust motes, and the single crystal—economy of detail that keeps spatial choreography clean. Crystal-as-micro-setting constrains tactics: its facets literally redirect sound waves, enabling the climactic tonal emission that reweights the quest. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and vibration over visual clutter, mirroring the scholar’s auditory obsession. The “shadowed” descriptor never evolves with daylight, a missed chance to let setting externalize shift.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fog-sculpture garden is more than postcard: condensation on the arch catalyzes the chalk drawing that unlocks sound. Driftwood, chalk, and metal arch function as micro-setting—each handled, re-positioned, and re-weighted. Sensory selection stays narrow to prophet’s haptic/auditory bias; no static white-room.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory “above the clouds” is filtered through Elara’s tool-centric eye: dust from the ceiling, the moon framed by viewport glass. Micro-setting of the golden clock—its weight, its frantic ticking—constrains her choices and literally re-tunes the instruments. Spatial choreography is clean across the deck placement and filter twist. Environment is not spectacle; it supplies the resonance toolkit that saves the station.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Micro-setting succeeds: the broken vinyl’s jagged edge literally constrains the son’s grip and charges the final image. Cloudcrest Hospice is sketched only by what the therapist must navigate—semi-circle chairs, cedar chest, lavender lotion—each detail later re-used. The “radiant haven” concept is shown, not asserted, through the contrast of beeping-free skyline and the pulsing stillness of a death-room. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies orbit the bed in a slow dance that ends with the son kneeling, hands cupped.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nocturnal observatory is micro-setting done right: stone dais, telescope pointing at noon-sun in darkness, vibrating rune-floor—each detail doubles as tool or conduit. Floating-isle rule is taught early and paid off in the tremor at closure. Sensory economy favors touch and kinesthetic (vibration, clicks, warmth of key) over visual catalog. Would need one environmental constraint that actively blocks or hurts her to hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hedge maze, upside-down moonpetals, captured firefly glow, and perpetual twilight are specific sensory anchors that actively shape the ritual’s possibility rules. The garden reconfigures at closure, mirroring the porous boundary that Eleanor now accepts. Spatial choreography stays clean; the iridescent tooth functions as charged micro-setting. No constraint directly dictates her tactics, so 8.8 gate remains just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story’s engine: server racks constrain her path, glass shards underfoot literalize former eggshell-walking, and the moss-woven keyboard becomes the altar of transformation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices spiral drip-patterns, smells rust, hears glass creak—never a catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; she moves from entrance → collapsed server room → central keyboard without drift. The final image (pendant enveloped in emerald moss) recharges every prior “reclamation” motif and satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mist, ruin, and shell are rendered with synesthetic economy; the shell finally constrains the gesture of “solemnize,” charging the closing image. Sparse body-in-space cues keep spatial choreography thin, but setting still meets the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Verdant arbor” is more postcard than crucible, yet the vine-as-tool micro-setting does constrain invention and is recharged in the final cadence. Sensory selection favors visual dapple and golden light; other senses appear once each, adequate for short length. Spatial choreography holds; bodies track cleanly around the central device. The arbor never actively endangers or rescues, so environment shapes mood, not tactics, capping at low-8.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The withered orchard is evoked with tactile specificity: peeling scroll-bark, frost-encased berries, twigs as algorithmic pathways. Sensory hierarchy reflects the alchemist’s priorities—visual and haptic details dominate, sound is hushed to match “moving stillness.” Setting constrains the ritual (cold preserves, flash-paper waits) and is re-charged by the golden glow at the end. No spatial drift; geography stays coherent inside the crater.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marble cavern functions as micro-setting that literally supplies the reflection angles required for repair; removing it breaks the logic. Temperature shift (“walls growing warmer”) is sensory confirmation of successful calibration, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains crisp: gears, prisms, reflected light tracked without drift. Weather reference (“wounded season”) is metaphorical but anchored in measurable light variance, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and starlight patch are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered. The lamp burner reappears to bracket descent/ascent, earning micro-setting status. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment never actively constrains choice—no collapsing tunnel, no fuel shortage—so falls just short of 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank function as micro-setting: droplets refract choice-light, wood grain dictates cut direction; both objects physically guide her hands and charge the final closed-eye lion image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lagoon-above-clouds acts as both miracle and machine: it supplies the water-bridge of words and the carousel’s halted energy. Sensory economy favors shimmer, crystal fruit, star reflections—always filtered through Cyrus’s treasure-hunter bias. Micro-setting (camera harness) directly enables the climax. Spatial choreography holds; no floating bodies. Setting evolves from frozen to flowing as time realigns, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Spaceport shell is evoked with tactile specificity—dust on console, dormant transformers “like sleeping giants”—and the micro-setting of corroded breaker panels constrains her rewiring choices, charging the final image. Sensory economy is strong: echoing footsteps narrow to the glint of brass, mirroring the shift from vast absence to pinpoint possibility. Temporal anchoring is clear, spatial choreography clean. Brass sextant piece satisfies the 9+ gate by functioning as the charged final object that reframes prior journeys.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crystal forecourt evolves from spectacle to tool: facets catch light, then accept the watch as offering, constraining Elias’s next move. Petrichor and glacial hush are filtered through his horologist senses—smell triggers workshop memory, hush becomes metronome—binding setting to POV bias. Spatial choreography is clean: bear enters, settles, exits without teleport. Micro-setting (pocket watch) functions as portable altar; its final placement charges closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Twilight canal and rotted barge serve as micro-setting that constrains access and mirrors internal decay; pocket sundial becomes a tactile extension of setting. Selective sensory hierarchy (lapping water, dust motes) keeps density high. Weather and geography remain stable; spatial choreography is clean. No environment-to-choice pressure in climax, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Golden dock under snow is not backdrop: the whitening planks muffle sound, forcing the collector into closer attention and coaxing the fisherman’s lowered voice. The fulgurite and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choice—only here can the knot language be read. Final image of fog parting re-weights the path forward, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Shadowed garden functions as micro-setting: decay-scent, leaf-motion, and the weft thread on the bench constrain mood and ultimately the pen’s movement. Spatial choreography stays clean (bench → soil → notebook → stars). Autumn is exploited for tonal mirroring rather than cliché. The thread as charged object satisfies 9+ gate by guiding the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Suspended palace, crystalline corridors, and gear-and-piston world are selectively sketched through Elorian’s touch and movement. Setting actively guides choice: the swaying palace mirrors his precarious hope, and the stalactite anchor becomes the literal barrier he must later destroy. Sensory economy favors tactile and kinetic detail over visual catalog. One micro-continuity slip: “marble table” appears without prior anchor in a gear-metal world, minor.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selective, POV-filtered detail (“smoke-choked streets,” “obsidian lagoon mirrored an emerging sun”) keeps atmosphere taut; the garden, lagoon, and black sand function as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; weather is causal (wind shift ordered evacuation). The foreign coin and volcanic sand meet the 9+ gate by charging the final image, but one descriptive lapse—“kelp-drift peace” is evocative yet abstract—stops this just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    City and fountains move from static ruin to active conduit; the dry basin that later reflects starlight functions as micro-setting that directly enables the key discovery. Sensory selection stays filtered through Elara’s realistically imaginative bias—she sees water where none exists—so environment and perception braid cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Nebula garden is evoked in saturated, shifting color that mirrors the being’s mood; petals function as micro-setting that charge the final image. Spatial grounding is intentionally fluid—distances and physics bend—but the sensory selection (soft luminescence, dying-star petals) stays purposeful. Gear-as-tool repeatedly constrains action: faster spin equals deeper transit, so the object qualifies as setting-in-motion. World rules remain consistent: sonar pings map, gear approximates, light never burns.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ancient greenhouse glass, dust motes, monarch wings against dusk—each sensory layer is filtered through Elias’s carver-biased eye: he notices texture of granite, pattern of vines, wing-beats as measurement. The greenhouse itself functions as micro-setting that constrains: butterflies can’t be chased outside; dusk light is the literal deadline for carving. Spatial choreography is pristine—ribbon spools behind him like breadcrumb trail, bench located at path end. Weather is calm-within-thunder, a tonal mirror that charges the final image without overt symbolism. No tourist catalog; every detail either enables ritual or records passing time.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, brass gears, and weathered rake handle are tactile, selective, and mirrored in Alaric’s emotional state. Spatial choreography stays clean as Alaric climbs; environment constrains the final communal ascent. The ridge’s reflected image in the closing line recharges the stake—community now visible in the same mirror that once showed only self.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt silo absorbs starlight and sound, a micro-setting that literally swallows echo and choice; the sovereign case’s silver tarnish and tapestry fray are tactile, decision-driving details. Early anchor arrives by line 3; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Spire and lake are more than backdrop: the spire “amplifies her abilities,” turning locale into instrument; micro-setting actively shapes the task. Sensory triage is apt—she notes “small cracks” exactly where predicted, merging observation with stakes. Selective cold-weather details (kingfisher iridescence, obsidian tooth) root us in place without catalogue drift. Setting never constrains a physical choice but does charge the closure image (map held to early light), meeting the 9+ gate for environmental participation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    “Ember alcove” and “mist-shrouded hillside” are instantly atmospheric, while the shortwave’s dial glow serves as micro-setting that both enables and endangers the broadcast. Sensory selection skews visual, but the consistent nocturnal palette (ink-stained fingers, moonlit dust) mirrors the covert mood. Spatial choreography stays clean—radio, alcove, apartment—anchoring the single scene. The environment never actively constrains her choices, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rocking chair functions as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s perception of time; its final silence directly triggers her conceptual shift, satisfying 9+ gate. Gallery cues are sparse—only “lights” and “shadows reaching beyond walls”—but the vanishing-point concept is woven through action (masks that refuse wholeness, artworks receding into illusion). Selective sensory focus on creak, ash dust, porcelain glint keeps economy tight; no exposition dumps. At 750 words, the space is more philosophical than physical, yet it remains coherent and charged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sewer tunnels function as active terrain: chest-high water, overnight-shifting passages, brass gleam in lantern-light all constrain movement and discovery. Spatial choreography is clean; the city above/below polarity is vivid without exposition bloat. The tiny brass cog serves as micro-setting that finally charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Velvet library, autumn-to-spring cycle, and the zither rosette as micro-setting are selective and atmospheric; the rosette’s grain is felt each time Eleanor fingers it, charging the final hand-off. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and seasons track. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—more tactile cues during rehearsals would deepen immersion—but the setting mirrors internal fade/renewal without overt symbolism. Accuracy is adequate; no world-rule contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rusted greenhouse as micro-setting constrains every move: broken glass frames light, soil receives seed, decay mirrors rebellion. Sensory triad—rusted metal, jasmine, soil—filters through Elias’s culinary attention. The greenhouse’s physical state never shifts, yet its symbolic weight charges the final image. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lightning tower as vertical micro-city is sketched with selective sensorial strokes (gilded conductors, nectar dusk) that mirror Elara’s habitual wonder. Space is coherent: booth → staircase → transformer wall → apex chamber; no floating bodies. The riddle re-uses the golden glow, letting setting echo theme, but tower geography never actively constrains their climb or final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Bay-town predawn is economically anchored by dew, streetlight color, and pulsing cottage walls; the shard itself becomes micro-setting that drinks sound, constraining Aria’s perception in the final beat. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound hush > visual glow) mirrors the thematic question of presence vs. emptiness. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly across the single continuous walk.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Foxglove-purple shadows on coral-lit ruins is selective, tactile, and filtered through the diver’s widening attention; the garden’s spatial logic stays coherent as fish arcs mirror thought loops. The ampoule-as-micro-setting constrains the final gesture—its emptying literally reconfigures the surrounding water—satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Infinite staircase is sketched with spatial economy—curving void, echoing steps—integrated into climbing action rather than catalogued. Dice function as micro-setting, their weight and click grounding bodily rhythm; chipped corner supplies tactile specificity that later “charges” rupture. Environment constrains choice by denying exit until the mathematical flaw is located, satisfying the 9+ gate. Light sensory imbalance: almost all detail is auditory or kinesthetic; visual palette is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Greenhouse glass, moon-tipped brush, and saffron light constrain every logistical choice—ink consistency, canvas size, timing of strokes. Smog-versus-oxygen tension externalizes her internal deficit, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys an insomniac’s narrowed attention: scent of jasmine, faint moonstone glow, rustle of journals. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no prop teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Waterfall-grotto, bioluminescent fungi, and opera-glass-as-microscope are specific, sense-driven, and filter through the guide’s curatorial gaze; spatial choreography is clean. The lens-as-tool constrains the final choice and charges the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Funhouse mirrors, velvet curtain, and moonlit decay are selectively sketched yet atmospheric; the body-as-setting appears in the vein-lit final image. Spatial choreography is clear—no impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to the POV’s dread-filter. While the carnival could be any carnival, the mirror-chamber and clasp gain irreplaceable charge by closure, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating driftwood orchard is tactile—roots “conduct vibrations,” mallet strikes “ripple” through trunks—so setting becomes instrument and constraint. Blue-hour mercury sea and fractal clouds are filtered through the prophet’s synesthetic perception, anchoring who/where inside 120 words. The final image of the crescent-moon hook crystallizes the orchard as living metronome, satisfying 9+ micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Shell-as-world is economically anchored through touch and motion: “traced the spiral grooves…beneath his feet.” Sun-bleached salt air, market bustle, and turtle-shift in the final line keep sensory layering. Geography stays coherent—no impossible positions. The great turtle turn at the end supplies a micro-setting that recharges the new guardian pattern, satisfying the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivy, broken glass, and carved initials are tactile and POV-filtered; the station’s decay mirrors obscured history without overt nudging. Architectural details constrain action—she must pry floorboards, crouch beneath arches—so setting actively enables discovery. Micro-setting (ledger under boards) directly supplies the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory range is narrow but purposive, keeping word-count lean.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Submerged marble colonnades, bronze inkwell glare, cold water grip—each detail is filtered through surveyor’s professional eye and private ache. The inkwell functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final gesture (must seal before damp creeps in). Spatial choreography is flawless: drawbridge timetable, water level, stone footholds all tracked. One minor over-purple phrase—“hushed blaze of oranges and purples”—keeps it from 9.2, but the image still charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drowned library is economically evoked—“waterproof chambers”, “towering shelves”, “emergency patches like sunlight through water”—and the stamp’s phoenix emblem re-appears as shadow projection, charging closure. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s indexer gaze: texture of parchment, handwriting slant, ink corrosion. Spatial choreography stays tight between stacks and flood-proof cases, constraining how he moves and thus how he discovers. Micro-setting qualifies: the blackout’s low-contrast light enables the sigil-shadow epiphany impossible under normal glare.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glass basilica doubles as vault and paradox—transparent spires that “descend while ascending”—and this architectural contradiction directly charges the final image when the lantern rises into it. Tea-garden lanterns and dream-gems are selectively sketched through jeweler’s-eye perception, not catalogued. Spatial choreography stays clean across the one-minute walk from workshop to basilica. The basilica’s rule (dreams stored = ascension cost) constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mutated garden and amphitheater are sketched with ozone, twisted metal, liquid-light potential—selective, sense-driven. Micro-setting succeeds: the geode’s glow dictates pod interior and landing spot.Floating observatory stays postcard; no spatial constraint alters tactics. Final image uses setting only as backdrop, not tool, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory-copper dome, parapet texture, and drone telemetry create a micro-setting that actively constrains trajectory choice; weathered stone and liquid-night sky charge the final wave image. Sensory hierarchy follows operator priorities: EM spectra over color, wind over sound. Place names stay sparse—only “ancient observatory” and “Order of Cosmic Weavers”—yet feel specific through tactile navigation. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cobalt terrace, driftwood carvings, and grandfather’s tiny watch-hand carving function as micro-settings that constrain choice. The shore is not scenery; it is the archive Martin himself polluted, forcing confrontation. Temperature drops, tide rises, moonlight angles alter visibility—environment changes parallel internal shift. Final image—sand accepting both metal and wood—charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Storm-worn parapet, wind, mist, and moonlight are filtered through Lyra’s tactical eye; environment shapes timing (crescent = opening) and forces stillness (wind whips hair, negotiators stay planted). The antique pull acts as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory palette is spare but selective; no impossible geography. Detail never stalls beats; it rides the action. Final image—brass glint in lunar pool—recharges atmosphere and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Brass compass functions as micro-setting: its shifting weight against Elena's hip tracks her stance change and constrains the final image. Coastal launch, salt air, mist, and utility-pole “constellations” are filtered through mariner perception—selective, mission-driven, sensory hierarchy respected. Spatial choreography is crisp: kayak entry, paddle rhythm, pole sightings, dolphin surfacing all track without impossible positions. Weather is more atmospheric backdrop than causal force; no tactile interaction with storm or tide, so environment pressures choices only at thematic level, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bioluminescent lake, cavern rivers, and tunnel glyphs are filtered through POV urgency (“shattered mirrors”) and constrain choice (tunnel chosen by ball symbol). Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across the descent. Micro-setting credit: the baseball itself becomes portable cavern—warmth, glow, stitching map—charging the final signing image. The underground scale never crowds the 800-word limit; detail is selective and stakes-scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Moonlit orchard, spice pouches, and Eliora’s rooted feet supply tactile, POV-filtered detail; the environment literally feeds her transformation. Micro-setting succeeds: the crumpled fortune and glowing spice glyphs act as handled objects that constrain choices. Sensory selection stays biased toward Eliora’s goal—every blossom and scent is ritual-purposeful. While the orchard never changes state after the climax, the final image of morning light re-anchors the altered mood, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The midnight glade is evoked through selective synesthesia—onyx ink drinking moonlight, mist sliding like time—anchoring who/where/when by line 8. Spatial choreography is airy but coherent: cards scatter, saucer is lifted, glade dissolves while her feet stay planted. The cracked saucer re-appears as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather (clouds beneath knees) affects posture and metaphor but not literal choice, keeping the cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-settings (meditation chamber, titanium amulet, quantum rift) function as tools that constrain choreography and charge the ending; spatial tracking remains coherent. Sensory palette is selective—spectral Earth shimmer, ship groan, salt-trace map—tightly filtered through Eli’s pacifist attention. No exposition dumps; world rules (gravitational lightening, locked dimension) emerge through ritual action. The recycled ship’s final dissolution reweights the dominant stake, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Black sand, volcanic rim, and synchronized bug-light meet the specificity test; the beach constrains movement (no path to observatory) and charges the closing image (bug rising against celestial glow). Sensory triage fits POV—astronomer notices planetary angles, tactile sand, chemical scent of volcano. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms. Would reach 9 if environment forced a riskier tactical choice, but isolation suits the quiet arc.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fort’s bioluminescent walls, half-painted sundial, and twilight palette create a memorable micro-setting that actively guides clandestine action. Spatial choreography is clean; the quill-holder is tracked from pocket→hand→pocket. Sensory selection is biased toward light/shadow angles rather than tourist catalog. The environment constrains communication methods, satisfying the 9+ gate, though some phrasing (“luminous fort,” “gleamed”) edges toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frictionless stone, tidal pools, and aurora light are filtered through her eel-herder gaze; the missing friction literally guides how objects behave (dust sphere, rising eels). Painted stones function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual sequence and are re-charged in the closing image. Sensory economy is strong—“smooth stone where friction had long since disappeared” fuses tactile and physics rule. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Weather (aurora fade) times the closure beat. World rule consistency is flawless; no exposition dump. Meets 9+ gate: stones and bluff charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory is rendered through selective sensory layers—cold iron staircase, ozone, dancing shadow-verses—each filtered by Maia’s poet-perception. The telescope, timetable, and timer function as micro-settings that constrain choices (when to write, what route to recall). Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The final image of parted clouds and starfield crystallizes the stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glass-atrium optics and water-murmur counterpoint are filtered through Aris’s philosopher-eye, never touristic; the gnomon’s incomplete shadow is returned to at closure, reweighting the setting as instrument rather than backdrop. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the sundial’s angles literally constrain every tilt of the needle card. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, sun-beams, brook mist tracked across beats. Only the café spectators remain ghostly, but they never interrupt focal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted open-air library is tactile: “decaying books under the open roof,” “mangled metal,” seeds pressed into floor-dust. Body-as-setting is minor (hands remember weight) but the recurring coffee tin constrains every move and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is crisp across shards; moonlight and starlight evolve with the night, guiding seed-scatter timing. Sensory economy favors visual and haptic; smell/taste absent but not missed. Environment mirrors psyche without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cloud Station Nine is sketched with airy economy—grand concourse, dipping branches, violet horizon—yet every detail either signals the approaching night-deadline or mirrors the pianist’s suspended grief. The archive’s temperature-controlled vault and the modified projector ground the speculative leap in tactile procedure. The arbor’s tidal sway is more postcard than constraint, but the flickering compasses supply immediate navigational stakes, so the world rule still shapes tactics. Overall, selective sensory filtering keeps the setting purposeful and the spatial track clean.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orchid scent and thunderous waterfall are filtered through POV urgency; the glowing seed serves as micro-setting that finally charges the image. Ridge geography is stable, distances tracked, weather front moves plausibly. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—sound of waterfall drowns externals during cave entry—meets 9+ gate for environment constraining choice. Only lacks a tactile tool-cost (no bruised knee, wet slip) that would tighten 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting (lace, compass glass, dew-bead branches) constrains every micro-gesture; dew prisms the final hue, charging the closure image. Salt-petrichor breeze and islet scale are sketched sparely yet supply ritual boundaries. Spatial choreography is clean: tutor→window→case→trees track without drift. Weather is causal—storm brought compass, dawn brings revelation—so environment shapes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a potent micro-setting: cracked pots, broken glass, and water-stained walls constrain movement and frame Elena’s attention. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (damp earth, faded wing colors), filtered through her scientific gaze. The setting charges the final image—the chrysalis in wreckage—but doesn’t actively shape tactics beyond passive observation, slightly limiting its causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon setting functions as micro-setting: its microclimate enables the frost method, and its silence sharpens Lena’s perception, directly shaping her tactics. Sensory detail is selective—stars, rock walls, tea mug—and filtered through her trauma and profession. The environment charges the final image: she carries “the drifting resonance of the stars within her,” tying place to inner state without overt symbolism. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond enabling the frost experiment, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes perception: its glass and ironwork amplify heat patterns, enabling Elena’s method. This environment constrains and charges the final image—the conservatory becomes her symphony hall, its fragility mirroring her music. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elena’s thermal vision, though overreliance on visual shimmer occasionally neglects tactile or thermal specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting and thematic crucible: the broken lens, salt-stained canvas, coral forests, and impossible library architecture all constrain or charge choices. The underwater city isn’t backdrop—it’s the destination that validates Elias’s quest. Sensory detail is selective (silver fish like “thoughts,” rainbows from fractured glass) and filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. The final image of “impossible spaces between the waves” crystallizes tone, place, and theme inseparably.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: it anchors councils, deliveries, and the climax, constraining choice by serving as the only neutral, elevated gathering point. The bell—a tactile object—charges the final image, its muted tone embodying both heritage and defiance. Sensory detail is selective (still night air, moonlit path) and filtered through Elias’s vigilance. The “amplified quiet” evokes both sanctuary and vulnerability, directly shaping tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The twilight viaduct in bloom functions as micro-setting: wisteria, mist, and stone constrain perception and charge the projection surface. Sensory detail is selective—sweet scent, rough-hewn wall, foggy lucidity—and filtered through Elara’s artistic/spiritual priorities. The camera obscura and viaduct wall directly enable the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only slight overreliance on visual/purple motifs (“purple waterfalls”) slightly dilutes tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered as a breathing, hyperbolic organism that actively responds to Elara’s state. Its evolution—withering, flourishing, forming eye-hurting geometries—constrains perception and charges the climax. The garden functions as micro-setting: its shifting paths enable temporal navigation and culminate in bodily disintegration. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: dust motes, broken windows, empty shelves, and the piano bench all constrain or enable action. The wall’s imminent demolition tightens stakes spatially and temporally. Yet the setting doesn’t *force* a unique choice—similar seed vaults could exist elsewhere—so it charges atmosphere more than irreplaceably shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwrecks, ashen forge, and aurora lights form a microcosm where environment directly enables and constrains action—water amplifies Kael’s color-hearing, the forge imprints matrices, shipwrecks store emotional echoes. Every sensory detail serves the premise: blues become trebles that ache teeth, reds deepen to bass. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the prototype transmits through water, harmonizing with colors, making place inseparable from revelation. No white-room syndrome; space is lived-in, pressurized, and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald station, golden sunset, and moonlit tiles create a vivid, sensory-rich micro-setting that directly charges the final image—moonlight activating the portraits. The recurring object (jar of moonbeams) constrains choice (must be stolen precisely at transition) and functions as both tool and symbol. Spatial choreography is coherent: window, counter, desktop, shadows. However, while atmosphere is lush, the station itself doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond aesthetic backdrop; it’s more stage than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned control room functions as a potent micro-setting: its corroded panels supply copper, its windows frame light for glasswork, and its decay mirrors Elias’s emotional state without overt symbolism. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—dripping ice as metronome, dust motes in slanted light—and evolves causally as ice melts. The recurring objects (bookmark, kiln, glass rod) constrain choices and charge the final image. However, occupational plausibility in glassblowing is assumed rather than demonstrated, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted library under starlight functions as micro-setting: broken skylight enables decryption, shelves offer concealment, groaning doors signal threat. Spatial choreography is coherent—Maya crouches, stands, faces entrance—and the environment constrains her claustrophobic body while supplying tools (starlight, cast). The seashell and plaster cast act as object-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail (phosphorescent glow, rust, ticking clock) serves urgency without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the flaking gold leaf booklet and three pebbles constrain choices (sketching voids, selecting stones) and charge the closure (booklet glows from darkness-sketches). Storm and vanishing star pressure decisions without cliché. Sensory detail is selective (marbled hush, warm pebble) and filtered through the oracle’s obsession. Final image ties setting directly to thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: cold enables the ice violin’s existence, twilight hues frame the mystical turn, and snowflakes defy gravity only under musical vibration—environment directly constrains and charges the climax. Sensory detail (crystalline snow, lavender light, mechanical joints seizing) filters through Unit 347’s janitorial POV. Final image of “warmer” stones proves setting evolves causally with events. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal whispering forecourt after rain functions as micro-setting: its glistening pavement, resonant droplets, and hidden chamber directly enable discovery and shape Elara’s choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“soft melody that resonated with the hush”), avoiding tourist cataloguing. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain a key decision—Elara could’ve left the lens anywhere—so it falls just short of 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The garden maze functions as both setting and micro-setting—it constrains choice (paths shift with emotional state) and charges the final image (marbles embedded at junctions). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: leaves “lean toward his touch,” marbles “hold the light of day.” The cracked marbles and withered hands mirror each other, avoiding overt symbolism while deepening atmosphere. Crucially, the setting actively shapes tactics (Elias places marbles to mark unquantifiable moments) and forecloses scientific resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The xenobiology station functions as micro-setting, with the magnetic nexus and containment unit constraining action. Sensory detail is selective (violet skies, beating wings at rest, rotating light cycle) and filtered through Aris’s professional attention. The “mechanically warm” hands and levers tie body/tool to setting, charging the final image. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere—it enables rather than obstructs, missing the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The flooded opera house isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains movement (ankle-deep water), enables discovery (floating debris), and charges the climax (lanterns brighten with music). The grand piano’s preservation defies decay yet feels earned by thematic logic. Final image—water reflecting starlight—reconfigures ruin into sanctuary, fulfilling the 9+ gate via environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mountain weather station functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: thin air amplifies prophecy, snow infiltrates compromised seals, instruments frame perception. The body (fever, bare feet on snow) and the botanical illustration serve as recurring tactile anchors. Aurora borealis evolves from backdrop to active symbol charged with sorrow, directly shaping the final image. Every sensory detail serves the Accumulative lens, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned train tunnel is rendered with tactile specificity—damp air, glinting brass, oppressive darkness—and the beaded valve wheel functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice (Marcus kneels, touches, carries it). Sensory detail narrows under pressure (focus on the wheel, static, breath), and the environment evolves from foreboding to cathartic as dawn breaks. The valve wheel charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining meaning and action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the obsidian refuge’s impermeability contrasts the library’s decay, while the regenerative void physically halts rot. The origami swan and stone tablet operate as micro-settings that enable and limit action—the swan’s folds dictate access, the tablet demands permanence. Sensory detail (ozone, cold silk, leaf litter) is filtered through the keeper’s perception and directly informs choices. The environment charges the final image: river’s roar vs. remembered silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sage Ridge isn’t backdrop—it constrains and charges: sagebrush “aromatic sentinels” mirror resilience; the ridge’s height enables eclipse viewing; open windows carry scent that grounds healing in place. The locket and drum function as micro-settings that shape choice (Maya touches locket pre-breakthrough; Lila drums earth-pulse rhythm). Final image (“sunlight flooded back”) gains power from prior environmental specificity. Deduct 0.1 for slightly over-poetic “dreaming roots” phrase that verges on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The reclaimed silo library is vividly rendered as both setting and symbol—missiles repurposed into memory-keepers, metal bones humming with lost magic. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “bronze quiet,” “pages fragile as moth wings,” “curved walls.” Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the historian’s smile gains meaning because it occurs within this hallowed, post-apocalyptic archive. The tapestry and diaries are handled in ways that tie directly to environmental texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: its circular room, spiral staircase, and beam directly shape the writer’s actions and final descent. Sensory details (clicking typewriter, dancing lantern shadows) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting charges the closure—the rising sun over water mirrors his quiet hope—but doesn’t constrain a pivotal choice beyond housing his work. Vivid atmosphere supports theme without stalling momentum, though weather/environment don’t actively alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The church-as-setting functions as micro-setting: silence is physical weight, the altar anchors spatial choreography, and the dimensional anchor constrains tactics. Indigo paint and loop pedals are tactile tools that charge the final image—their irreplaceable properties shape every key beat. Sensory detail is selective (absorbing indigo, muffled clarity) and filtered through the priest’s synesthetic perception. The environment directly enables victory: without this specific sanctuary, the exorcism fails.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains and charges every beat. The shell’s spiral mirrors the lake’s horizon, creating an optical illusion that shapes perception and stakes. Dawn’s light refracts through glass into rainbows on the desk—environment directly fuels the symphony’s emergence. Final image hinges on this charged spatial-poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glowing viaduct after rain functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice—it only works when wet and during the eclipse—and charges the final image as its light softens upon return. Sensory detail is selective (phosphorescent stones, bruised purple sky) and filtered through Elias’s disoriented perception. Weather, time, and object states evolve causally with the plot. Only minor deduction: the “crumbling viaduct” shard lacks tactile grounding compared to the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drum maker’s cavern functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: its stone floor transmits vibrations, its muted acoustics make silence palpable, and its tools spark discovery. The broken needle and turntable are handled purposefully, not decoratively. Sensory detail favors touch over hearing, aligning with POV limitation—yet avoids cliché through specificity (“filament of hush,” “backward recorded songs”). The setting charges the final image: students gather on the same stone that once isolated her, now resonant with shared vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quiet courtyard functions as micro-setting that pressures choice—Elias moves laterally to avoid windows, uses the fountain’s sound to mask actions, and transforms the space from refuge to launchpad. The carrier pigeon’s silver feathers and wax seal are specific, recurring details that charge the final image. Only minor deduction: weather manipulation premise isn’t grounded in tactile atmospheric detail beyond abstract “storm data.”

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants functions as micro-setting and thematic crucible—it constrains Elias’s choices (he avoids florists but returns here) and supplies the ghost orchid whose transformation times his revelation. The ultraviolet lantern’s cobalt glass casts “crystal shadows” that evolve from mere atmosphere to charged symbols in the closing display case. Every sensory detail—lavender, rain-soaked earth, camellias—is filtered through Elias’s trauma and profession, making the environment inseparable from his emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively charges the final image—the walls “absorbing and reflecting starlight” create the visual field for the rope pattern, and their “ancient presence” lends temporal weight. The frayed rope and starlight are tactile, recurring, and constrain the poet’s method. However, the setting doesn’t *foreclose* an option or force a tactical shift—it enables rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks isn’t backdrop—it actively supplies resources (hollow hulls for resonance) and constrains choice (Kael must position his bowl precisely). Sensory detail is filtered through Kael’s acoustic perception: glass walls “resonate,” wood holds “memories,” fire “crackles” as counterpoint. The setting evolves causally—from hush to symphony—as Kael interacts with it. Crucially, the greenhouse’s broken windows and listing wrecks charge the final image, embodying the “unfinished” aesthetic that defines the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto functions as micro-setting: its hues “enhance emotional resonance,” directly charging Elias’s work and the client’s acceptance. Sensory detail is selective—amber light, static electricity, blotter petals—and filtered through Elias’s professional bias. Spatial choreography is coherent (Elias moves closer, stores petals, exits). However, the environment constrains no pivotal choice; it enhances but doesn’t alter tactics, missing the 9+ gate despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    The breezy library under retractable roof panels creates a charged micro-setting that directly influences tone and choice—Elias modulates his “exuberance” to match its “quiet dignity,” and the starlit intimacy enables vulnerability. The sea breeze, symphony echoes, and tactile details (stained fingers, chipped cups) are filtered through Elias’s maritime POV. The locket and envelope function as object-as-setting, constraining emotional pacing. Only slight deduction: the café scene lacks the same atmospheric specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater aren’t backdrop but crucible: luminescent fluid casts “restless, aching glow,” obsidian outcrops demand climbing, wind patterns inform pulley design. Sensory detail is selective—tactile reeds, spectral light pulses—and filtered through Elara’s artisan POV. Crucially, the setting charges the closure: the crater’s own sigil validates their bond, and the arbor becomes a beacon *because* of its position at the crater’s edge. Environment directly shapes tactics and final meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal system functions as micro-setting: its unnatural pulses guide the illustrator’s path, and its restored flow signals resolution. The infinity pendant and sketchbook are tactile, recurring objects that constrain choice—time-borrowing has physical toll. Sensory detail is selective (crystal-like water patterns, humming walls) and filtered through the illustrator’s professional attention. The setting charges the final image—the vibrating chamber walls release suppressed sound precisely because the environment had been silenced by design.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cavern orchard is not backdrop but active micro-setting: stalactite drips nourish bioluminescent fruits that dim to signal ritual time, directly shaping Elara’s actions. The mosaic stone constrains her method; its chipped constellations evolve under her touch, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (glow, drip-rhythm, warmth) and filtered through her conjurer’s attention. Environment and object jointly enable the climax’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “sapphire hush” of the shadowed library isn’t backdrop—it constrains movement, enables secrecy, and charges the final image. Every detail (cool pipes, plaster walls, pipe chases) functions as micro-setting that guides choice: the dweller navigates by touch, caches in forgotten spaces, and uses infrastructure as archive. The dawn light doesn’t just signal time—it threatens exposure, heightening stakes. Crucially, the tape fragment’s warmth contrasts the cool environment, making knowledge feel alive within dead systems.

    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s where the anomalous leaf appears, where shoots emerge, and where Elara’s final observation occurs. Rain, soil, and greenhouse are filtered through her botanical POV, with sensory detail (dripping wood, softened surface) serving action and theme. The environment directly charges the closure: the trellis becomes her “classroom,” proving setting is inseparable from transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal island isn’t backdrop but active constraint: treacherous waters isolate Lena, rain trails guide her movements, and the lighthouse convergence point shapes discovery. The amber brooch functions as micro-setting—its warmth contradicts ambient coolness, charging the final image. Sensory detail (solar lamps, mineral pigments, sand) is selective and POV-filtered. Only slight deduction: “continental gallery” feels slightly generic compared to the otherwise grounded specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    The musical crystal cave functions as micro-setting: its resonant properties directly enable the transformation (shadows “inhabit” crystals, chords “unlock” reality). Sensory detail is selective—luminous walls, pulsing pearl, thickened air—and filtered through Elara’s clairvoyant bias. The cave constrains nothing physically but charges every turn emotionally and thematically; its evolution mirrors her internal shift. Final image ties setting to closure: “crystalline flowers in the bright darkness” merges environment and revelation seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “ivory harbor after rain” functions as micro-setting: its pale stones and absences directly shape Elina’s work and the returnees’ emotional landscape. Sensory detail (briny air, glistening stones, ocean spray mingling with tears) is selective and POV-filtered, never touristic. The trumpet valve and diary are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning, charging the final image. Weather and setting cohere causally—rain washes away separation just as Elina washes clean historical erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint: cracks guide choices, mist embodies emotion, the vault’s charged atmosphere limits time. The phantom ticket punch—a micro-setting—directly enables translation of the fortress’s walls. Final image (“city streets... seeing everything differently”) reweights urban space through Ethan’s altered perception. Every detail serves theme or pressure; no white-room syndrome or generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stargazer’s tower functions effectively as micro-setting, anchoring perception and enabling the tile’s resonance. Whale migration and celestial imagery are woven into atmosphere without cliché. Yet the setting never actively constrains a choice—Elara could transcribe anywhere; the tower is evocative but not instrumental. For 9+ eligibility, the environment needed to force a tactical adaptation, which it doesn’t.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting: its shifting walls constrain perception early and evolve into dimensional windows under Alistair’s manipulation, directly enabling his quest. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“dying rainbow,” “hushed thunder”—filtered through Alistair’s immortal weariness. The setting charges the final image: the collapsing escondite mirrors his psychological transformation. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual metaphor without deeper tactile grounding in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: refrigeration hum, chemical scents, and stainless steel tables directly shape Maya’s philosophy and tactics. The ink pot—tactile, recurring, and causally active—constrains choices (steadying her hands) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome. Only slight over-reliance on visual description in the climax prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bonsai labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains and reflects Elias’s work—each forest an epoch, paths nonlinear like history. Fluorescent lamp and notepad are tactile tools that charge the final image; gold leaf seals meaning physically. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (hum) and touch (paper, leaf) over sight, fitting a stationer’s POV. Setting isn’t backdrop but active archive, evolving with each dawn’s capture, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping closure’s emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The shipping container labyrinth functions as both macro- and micro-setting: it constrains movement, supplies narrative fragments, and mirrors bureaucratic erasure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—metallic shadows, ocean tides, rain-sheltered containers—all filtered through the narrator’s existential lens. The poison bottle label charges the final image, embodying fragility of record. Setting actively shapes tactics (pilgrimage routes, shelter during rain) and deepens thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its decayed instruments and storm-lashed isolation directly enable the plot (cello, telescope, seashell placement). Sensory detail is vivid and selective—dust “dancing in the beam,” “rusty hinges groaning”—filtered through Evelyn’s professional curiosity. The cliffside location and tempest create atmospheric pressure that mirrors internal stakes. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood; it provides resources but no spatial or tactical obstacles that alter Evelyn’s decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.3)
    Neptunia’s floating carnival setting isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the resistance (graffiti as public yet coded medium, rafts as negotiable zones). Sensory details (fried funnel cakes, saltwater, sequined costumes) are filtered through Maya’s urgency, never touristy. The foundation stone and graffiti murals function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices. Final image—children playing over hidden coordinates—proves environment shapes legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The moonlit summit isn’t just backdrop—it’s a vantage point enabling the mission, its transformation into sunlit terrain marking irreversible change. Sensory detail is selective: amplified breathing, blue bioluminescence against gray rock, the dissolve of a single sand grain. The lunar environment constrains action (bulky suit, cold-dependent creatures) and charges the final image—sunrise destroys what darkness revealed. The setting earns its lyricism by shaping stakes and tactics, not merely decorating them.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mist-coated rail depot isn’t backdrop—it’s a micro-setting that constrains and charges every beat. Mist slows time, shapes perception, and recedes with the ship’s departure, marking narrative cadence. Tools (water bowl, conductive threads) are extensions of Elias’s body, used with tactile precision. The final image—depot settling into calm—reweights the entire space as a crucible of transformation, not mere workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen lake outpost and glacial interior aren’t backdrop but active constraints: metal contracts, ice shifts, condensation forms maps. The phrasebook and falcon are micro-settings that enable navigation and communication. Crucially, the condensation pattern on glass directly charges the final image—twice—and guides Elmsley’s interpretation. Sensory detail (cry of falcon, breath on glass) is selective, POV-filtered, and purposeful, never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting functions as active participant: cobblestones resonate, archway stones pulse, bell tower “longs” for voice. Sensory detail is filtered through Silas’s auditory expertise—silence “thrums,” dust motes “settle as if gently laid to rest.” The ebony fork and worn pathways constrain his method, charging the final image where glowing cobblestones testify to his passage. Bruised sky, skeletal buildings, and star-choked night evolve with the town’s revival, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater temple functions as both macro- and micro-setting: columns, carvings, and pressure shape spatial choreography, while the crystal vial (a tool-as-setting) directly enables the climax.

Setting constrains tactics (intuition over instruments) and charges closure (tree roots tightening as he works). No white-room syndrome; every detail serves theme or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    The golden arcade functions as micro-setting: its ethereal dawn light shapes Elara’s perception and ritual, while the physical chalk medium ties world logic to theme. The ebony clipboard and sidewalk chalk are tactile extensions of environment that constrain choice—she must draw before rain erases, mail before noon. Sensory detail is selective (warm metal, smooth wood, ghostly traces) and filtered through her pseudonym-creator POV. However, the arcade doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond mood; it charges the final image but doesn’t foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt observatory and autumn setting are vividly rendered (“prismatic tears,” “crimson leaves”) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The eternal candle functions as micro-setting—its flame swells with revelations and casts decoding shadows—directly constraining her work. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond mood; supply routes or boardrooms remain off-stage abstractions. Strong sensory specificity avoids cliché, but the setting’s tactical utility is limited to atmosphere rather than material constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mangrove labyrinth isn’t backdrop but active crucible: twisted roots disorient, moonlight enables magic, and the window’s condensation becomes narrative canvas. Sensory detail (inky water, haunting melodies) filters through Elara’s urgent POV. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the labyrinth must be navigated—and charges closure via the healed shard glowing at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: tropical plants “weep mist,” glass ceiling filters fading light, and spatial choreography (bench, shared objects) grounds every beat. Crucially, the environment constrains choice—Kaelen works in shadows, twilight obscures ink, humidity mirrors emotional saturation—and charges the final image when he closes Lina’s fingers around the coral. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaelen’s translator-trained attention: he notices smudges, textures, dialect, not generic flora. The brain coral isn’t just described—it’s handled, traced, returned, making it inseparable from setting and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog-choked orchard district isn’t mere backdrop—it constrains visibility, justifies the fragment’s obscurity, and symbolically mirrors emotional desolation. The light-therapy kit and observatory function as micro-settings that enable key actions (developing the image, hosting the display). Sensory detail is selective (cool stone, muted gray, soft contours) and filtered through Amelia’s artistic urgency. However, the setting doesn’t actively foreclose options—it enables rather than pressures—so it narrowly misses the 9+ gate requiring constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sound wave garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: chimes and wind sculptures generate the reflected sound that catalyzes Elena’s transformation. Sensory hierarchy is expertly filtered through her restorer’s POV (noticing cracks, calculating ratios) before expanding into synesthetic perception. The nickel and mural constrain choices—she paints blind, guided by acoustic patterns—and the final image charges closure: restored wall now “alive.” Every detail serves pressure or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse, community gardens, and gourd rattle seed all function as micro-settings that actively constrain choices and charge the final image—especially the mycelial network transmitting vibrations through soil.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gargantuan shell is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its pearlescent walls whisper, resonate with lullabies, and sprout blossoms in response to the poet’s art. It constrains choice (the poet works within it) and charges the final image (pulsing with light at death). Sensory detail is vivid yet selective—bioluminescent petals, reef-shadow scent—and evolves causally with the narrative. The shell’s transformation from ancient sea relic to living archive of pain-made-beauty fulfills the 9+ gate by directly shaping the closure’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.4)
    The opal library isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes the narrative: transparent floors reveal “endless sky below,” reinforcing fragility; the “deserted marvels section” spatializes loss; tools like the phonograph and focusing lenses are tactile extensions of Eleth’s purpose. Every sensory detail serves pressure or theme: glass orchids capture light as Eleth captures memory; silence becomes a physical disturbance. The setting constrains choice (only light summoned by song can heal) and charges the final image—the swaying tubes harmonizing in a breeze stirred by “thoughts of those who had passed into forgetting.”

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The extinct language archive is vividly rendered through sensory detail—dust motes, dim light, crystal inkwell—and functions as a micro-setting that supports Elena’s work. The glass inkwell evolves from passive object to near-motif, its glow and depletion marking time and effort. However, the setting never pressures choice: no spatial constraint, resource limitation, or environmental obstacle shapes Elena’s actions. It remains atmospheric backdrop, not an active force, preventing a 9+ score despite strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.3)
    The volcanic amphitheater isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its breathing rhythm dictates pacing, its cracks channel light that reveals inscriptions, its moss-covered stones yield clues.

However, the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options—it enables discovery without meaningful obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prism parapet, rain-dampened stone, and echoing acoustics aren’t backdrop—they actively enable and constrain the magic: water amplifies resonance, the parapet fractures her image into possibilities, and the terrace’s echo returns her song. Every sensory detail serves the central act—light refracting, droplets conducting energy, mist carrying melody. The setting culminates in the closure image: mirrors reflecting only a plain wall after revelation, making the environment indispensable to both tactic and thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ancient terrace functions as micro-setting: stone canopy, midsummer light, and celestial shadows directly pressure timing and ritual. The ebony clipboard constrains choice (Elian’s reliance on it) and charges the final image when left behind. Sensory detail (salt air, terracotta fragility) is selective and POV-filtered. Just shy of 9+ because the setting doesn’t actively *alter* tactics—ritual dictates action more than environment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    The salt flat isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and mirror. Its crystalline surface shapes movement (“boots crunching”), its cracks form a navigable map, and its whiteness reflects Silas’s moral fracture.

Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (no tourist catalog), with tactile specificity (“salt crystals biting”) that embodies emotional stakes. The setting directly enables the climax and closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “silver courtyard under snow” functions as a charged micro-setting: its stillness mirrors Elara’s preserved self, and its transformation—from breath-held stasis to liberated rhythm—directly reflects her internal shift. Snowflakes as “diamante witnesses” and frozen breath linking to constellations are selective, purposeful details that avoid cliché. However, the setting never actively constrains choice (e.g., no physical barrier or resource scarcity), missing the 9+ gate despite vivid texture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vividly rendered as both sanctuary and symbol, its concrete mass contrasting with Elias’s delicate art.

This micro-setting-as-metaphor elevates atmosphere without impeding momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    The verdant grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its transience dictates the impermanence of Aris’s signals, and its elevation isolates them from the “increasingly inhospitable world below.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“cloudlight,” “blushing stillness”), with moss, orchids, and gnarled branches evolving responsively to Aris’s intent. The setting charges the final image—starlit, dissolving structures—as both altar and elegy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound sanctum isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges every choice: cold preserves names, ice channels light, aurora syncs with ritual.

    Setting is masterfully filtered through Elara’s sensory bias: the bunker’s metallic closeness contrasts with the atmospheric silences she ascends through, each altitude offering a distinct taste. The xenial trellis isn’t just backdrop—it’s a micro-setting that enables the climax, its chiming flowers vibrating “in the bones and the heart,” directly facilitating the gilded hush. The porcelain doll and silence vessel function as object-as-setting, constraining emotional choices and charging the final image. However, spatial choreography during ascent lacks tactile specificity—how she navigates air currents or stabilizes herself remains vague, slightly weakening immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: its glass facets are angled to “capture and transform the silence,” directly shaping Elias’s method. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—rainbow patterns, crystalline vial shifts, vaulting hush—filtered through Elias’s professional attention. The storm glass and prisms aren’t just backdrop; they charge the final image when the vial “shimmered slightly” as clouds gather, tying environment to thematic closure. Every atmospheric element serves the central concept without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vividly specific—holographic deserts, memory-formatted forests, metallic silver trees—and consistently filtered through Elara’s trained perception. The kaleidoscopic waterfall and orchard directly enable plot (concealing entry, housing monolith). However, while atmospheric, the environment doesn’t *constrain* Elara’s choices beyond access; she moves unimpeded. Final image charges nostalgia, but setting functions more as backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ashen sanctuary functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its fading threshold dictates when and how passage occurs, and the charcoal floor’s swirling dust directly mirrors memory-ash. Starlight isn’t backdrop—it forms the door’s frame alongside sorrow. Final image charges closure: dawn replaces starlight as connection replaces isolation. Sensory detail (cold ring, misted breath, swirling ash) is selective, urgent, and filtered through the keeper’s trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choices (slippery walkways, unstable chambers) and charges the climax (mushrooms pulse in rhythm with the bolt). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: spores “sparkle,” purple fungi “breathe,” air grows “thick.” The setting evolves causally—from serene refuge to supernatural crucible—and culminates in the final image where diamonds catch the fungi’s glow. This micro-setting functions as both environment and tool, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sepia reading room functions as a potent micro-setting: its texts, ceiling carving, and gaslight actively enable discovery. Golden shadows evolve with time, charging atmosphere and reinforcing theme. The gramophone and crank are tactile, era-specific tools that constrain method and heighten plausibility. Crucially, the setting directly shapes the climax—the room’s acoustics and hidden compartment make the resolution possible, fulfilling the 9+ gate even if the score falls just short due to slight over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its endless night enables sanctuary, its crystalline fruit chimes in response to ritual, and its dissolution/reformation mirrors Galen’s transformation. Sensory detail is selective—phosphorescent vines, internal light, scent of undiscovered places—and filtered through Galen’s scholarly-knightly perception. The setting constrains choice (only here can forbidden knowledge be pursued) and charges the final image: fruits now “speak a language he nearly understood.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The foster care file room functions as a potent micro-setting: dust patterns constrain investigative tactics, folders supply emotional resources, and spatial stillness mirrors Eleanor’s solitude. The brass button and lamp light are tactile anchors that evolve from curiosities to charged relics. Final image binds setting to closure—the room becomes a site of witnessed history. Only minor deduction: park view is mentioned but unused beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    The auric lagoon isn’t just backdrop—it’s a charged micro-setting that hides vaults, reflects erased faces, and dictates tactics (marsh approach, starlight timing). The phone booth key and puddle reflection function as environmental constraints that shape choice. Sensory detail (bruised purples, liquid gold water) is selective and pressure-driven. The TrueComm logo and marsh geography evolve meaningfully across beats, culminating in the rippling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, and dewdrops form a cohesive micro-setting that actively shapes tactics: acoustics enable vibrational cancellation, mist refracts light into prisms that mirror musical refraction. The saxophone functions as both tool and extension of setting. Final image (dewdrops as stars) charges closure with quiet victory. However, setting never imposes constraint beyond enabling—no obstacle, only resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ashen skyborne arbor functions as both macro- and micro-setting, constraining choice through seasonal ritual and spatial choreography (mossy platform, canopy light). Tools (bone probe, tweezers), body (chlorophyll-stained fingers), and recurring objects (monuments) are tactilely integrated and directly shape action. The final image—moonstone monument glowing at collection’s center—charges closure with environmental specificity. Every detail serves texture, pressure, or payoff without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as active constraint and symbol: the greenhouse’s decay/rebirth mirrors Elias’s transformation; the subterranean waterfall supplies both obstacle and revelation. Clock parts repurposed as ladder tools show lived-in navigation. Light patterns and scent are selectively rendered through Elias’s tinkerer POV. Only minor deduction: “swirling leaves” feels decorative rather than navigational, missing full micro-setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-washed foundry functions as a potent micro-setting: steam, damp copper, cooling furnaces constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elias notices grit, mist, heat—not tourist cataloging. Weather and environment directly affect choice (rekindling furnaces, handling wet metal). The setting evolves causally (from desolation to redemption space) and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Echo Gorge isn’t backdrop but active constraint: sound physics dictate pursuit tactics, and the misaligned harp’s dissonance shapes every tracking decision. The hidden sunrise tightens time and casts revealing shadows. Crocodile tooth and silver bell function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Only slight over-reliance on visual palette (“lavender and gold”) slightly dilutes sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultraviolet forest functions as active micro-setting: its light reveals hidden truths, charges memory, and enables the strap’s activation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Kai notices glowing bark and UV-reactive patterns because his trauma-tuned senses prioritize threat and revelation. The environment constrains nothing physically but psychologically pressures confrontation, making it indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s market functions as micro-setting: rope bridges, glowing potions, and swaying stalls create spatial choreography that mirrors liminality. The lighthouse lens fragment acts as object-as-setting, constraining perception until the final touch. Sensory detail is selective (wind, colors, voices) and filtered through the protagonist’s urgency. However, the market never pressures a tactical choice—it’s atmospheric, not instrumental—preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ticket office is rendered with purposeful specificity—decaying popcorn scent, flickering fluorescents, impossible dust swirls—that filters through Marcus’s professional gaze. Crucially, the ceiling and mainspring barrel function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear despite ethereal elements. Only minor deduction: some atmospheric detail leans decorative without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass orchard library functions as micro-setting: its crystalline branches constrain knowledge preservation and charge the final image when they “translucently reform.” Sensory detail is purposeful—frost patterns, vibrating vial, rustling leaves—all filtered through Eldon’s professional perception. Environment actively pressures choices: warped walls force reckoning with destabilization. Final frost patterns mirror thematic renewal, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: gold filigree obscures dwellings, temporal storms manifest as “shimmering curtains,” and mirrors must be covered—a rule that directly shapes Elias’s action. These details aren’t backdrop but constraint and catalyst: the shard’s origin in this world makes it a legitimate vessel of contested history, and the visible Time necessitates his poetic intervention. Sensory specificity (golden dust motes of seconds, silken cloths over glass) filters through Elias’s poetic POV without tourist cataloging. The setting charges the final image—uncovered mirrors reflecting shared fragments—fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.3)
    The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that actively shapes tactics: its acoustics amplify Elias’s hum into restorative force, and its oak walls echo truth, reinforcing the stone’s honesty-detection. The workshop isn’t backdrop but crucible—constraining choice (only here can resonance work) and charging the final image (shadows dance as light returns). Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subterranean lagoon constrains choice (descent, immersion) and charges the final image—its obsidian surface reflecting “stars that would never reach it” mirrors Elara’s pre-transformation longing. Setting details (limestone cliffs, phosphorescent algae) evolve causally with plot and filter through Elara’s petrichor-collector POV. The compass and vials function as micro-settings that anchor thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-tossed archway, offshore turbines, and driftwood beach are vividly rendered and filtered through Elena’s artistic perception. Setting actively shapes the narrative: the archway houses the slide, the beach supplies materials, and the turbine hum provides rhythmic backdrop. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the sculpture left beneath the archway gains meaning from its placement. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice in a high-stakes way; it enables rather than pressures, just missing the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber pavilion, autumn leaves, and cathedral’s etched glass function as micro-settings that actively shape perception and choice—Elara’s murals are born from environmental refraction. Sensory detail is selective (cooling glass, suspended dust motes) and filtered through her artist’s attention. The setting charges the closure: moonlight through glass mimics nocturnal blooms, making environment inseparable from insight. Lacks only a tactile constraint (e.g., a broken tool, failing light) to push into 9.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining choice (it’s the only place temporal messages work) and charging the final image (its surface accepts then transforms her offering). The floating library isn’t just backdrop—it supplies the diaries and isolates Ellara, enabling obsession. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: teargas, wet sand, humming engines. The zeppelin’s descent and coastal dunes evolve causally with plot, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Paper-lantern Cove functions as micro-setting: lanterns symbolize hollow beauty, the bay window frames contemplation, and the amber bottle serves as tactile anchor. Sensory detail is selective (amber glass, swirling shadows, dawn-lit lanterns) and filtered through Elior’s alchemical bias. The setting charges the final image—lanterns glowing at dawn as people arrive—mirroring internal shift from solitude to shared purpose. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices; it reflects them.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard garden atop a skyscraper is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its ancient trees and obsidian slab constrain and charge Elias’s ritual. The wax cylinder, foghorn silence, and unripened fruit all tie atmosphere to theme. Yet the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices—it reflects rather than shapes action, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on a key decision.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: frost enables seed placement, cold crystallizes breath into visible intention, and starlight responds to order. The oak acorn cap, seed jars, and ice walls aren’t backdrop—they constrain tactics (bare feet on frost) and charge the final image (vortex above the cap). Sensory detail is selective (crystallized breath, dancing frost like fireflies) and filtered through Anya’s urgency. Environment directly enables the entropy-decrease method and culminates in the inverted tree vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.4)
    The windblown sanctuary functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice: thin air, creaking timbers, and the bell rope’s tension dictate Elias’s repairs and listening posture. Sensory detail is selective (eerie cloud luminescence, rope fibers, resonant hum) and filtered through his professional bias, never touristy. The cathedral bell itself constrains the climax—it must be mechanically reconnected, and its bronze tongue becomes the story’s final witness. Environment charges the ending image: the mountain’s voice made audible through ancient metal.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tracking station and cosmic void are rendered with vivid, selective detail that serves theme over tourism. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining Elion’s perception and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy aligns with his profession—light, texture, silence dominate—and the vacuum’s tactile reality grounds the metaphysical. However, the setting never actively pressures a tactical choice beyond enabling observation, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: hives dictate spirit locations, the root cellar hides the box, scorched earth isolates the sanctuary. Sensory detail (prismatic shadows, rusted extractors, warm wax) is filtered through the recluse’s apiarist-trained attention. The stained glass box charges the final image—its impossible colors and unhardened wax embody the covenant’s fragility. Setting evolves causally: moonlight triggers the opening, wasteland enforces solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The emerald silo functions as micro-setting: its pulsing walls constrain and enable perception, directly charging the final image where shadows “bend in impossible ways.” Sensory detail is selective (cool urn, humming energy, glowing walls) and filtered through Elara’s temporal sensitivity. The cremation fragment and capsule are tactile, recurring objects that evolve in meaning. Only minor deduction: weather/light shifts feel decorative rather than causally tied to action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: it mirrors sky, blurs earth/heaven, and enables the poet’s liminal state. The drake’s feather—a tactile tool—constrains writing method and charges the closure when bookmarked for “tomorrow’s woven dawns.” Sensory detail is selective (silver droplets, burnished hush, iridescent shifts) and filtered through the poet’s perceptual bias. Crucially, setting directly shapes the final image and thematic payoff, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    The temple orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: living stone pillars breathe, trees bend toward Elias, and spatial choreography remains coherent. Sensory detail is selective (“petals shimmering with otherworldly iridescence”) and filtered through Elias’s botanical expertise. The setting charges the final image—pillars glowing in rhythm with his heart—and evolves causally with each wrapped branch. Environment directly shapes tactics (copper patterns mirror constellations), fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rainwashed tower functions as micro-setting and charged object: its bronze quiet modulates with Elian’s inner state, spring cleansing mirrors cognitive clarity, and the overgrown path physically constrains his pilgrimage. Sensory detail is selective (petals as “celestial confetti,” amber’s warmth) and filtered through his scientific-poetic POV. The setting directly enables the climax—the pedestal exists because the tower is a repository for seekers. Only minor deduction: “alien grasses warped by Terra’s gravity” risks abstraction without tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the jetty, battlefield, and dying reef constrain choice (where to plant, which seeds) and charge closure (wildflowers nodding where blood once soaked). Sensory detail is selective—wind, shadows, bird cries—and filtered through the coachman’s ecological perception. However, “blooming jetty” lacks causal pressure beyond mood; it doesn’t alter tactics. Still, the reef’s absence shapes the entire moral and physical landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The waxed leaf functions as micro-setting: it constrains choice (decoding method) and charges the final image (joined leaves reveal message). The scrapyard and wasteland aren’t backdrop—they pressure survival and frame isolation. Sensory detail is selective (“tarpaulins shifting,” “desiccated earth”) and filtered through bloodhound perception. The hidden valley’s emergence feels earned, not decorative, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as a potent micro-setting: dormant equipment hums with lost purpose, spatial silence echoes abandonment, and starlight carries temporal weight. The gilded compass rose—a tactile object—constrains Elara’s perception and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “temporally stretched moments,” pencil on paper). However, the setting never actively pressures a choice; it reflects rather than shapes action, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound spire’s “otherworldly blue light” and impossible constellations concretely pressure Kael’s ascent and reflect the sky’s wrongness. Setting details evolve causally (chambers unlock via chess pieces) and charge the final image—the crystalline pedestal under the mending sky. However, the spire remains somewhat generic; its physical constraints don’t deeply shape tactics beyond gating progression. The pocket sundial and chess pieces function as micro-settings that better fulfill the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery functions as both setting and micro-setting: its acoustics enable Elara’s work, its circularity mirrors her patterns, and its walls trap memories she must unbind. The chessboard constrains her focus and crystallizes the central loss; the nomadic penumbra physically responds to her intent. All key objects charge the final image—the lone pawn pulses with collective absence. Sensory detail (footfalls spelling words, air shimmering) is purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The labyrinthine bookstore-mountain functions as both macro- and micro-setting, constraining Maven’s movement and shaping her discovery process. Sensory detail (scent of aging paper, glistening feather strands) is selective and POV-filtered, never touristic. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the mountain dissolves to reveal its true nature as a nexus, directly tied to Maven’s internal shift. The mercury glass and feather act as environmental extensions that constrain choice and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The time-frozen village isn’t backdrop but active constraint: suspended villagers, magical storm rhythms, and the platinum labyrinth shape every choice. Sensory detail is selective—the “woven hush” absorbs sound, thunder marks time, threads carry history—never decorative. The labyrinth’s liquid-metal walls respond to intention, charging the final image. All key setting elements directly enable or foreclose action, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bone towers and pale spire are not backdrop but active constraints: towers enable echo-refraction (method), spire embodies ideological opposition. Sensory detail is selective (wind whistling through bone, mist curling like spirits) and filtered through Elara’s artistic POV. Setting charges closure—the highest tower becomes both vantage and altar, and the canyon’s acoustics literalize theme. Environment directly enables the protagonist’s tactic and final act.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The acid sea, brass gears, and pockmarked statue aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the sea threatens dissolution, the statue’s scars dictate narrative sequence, and the charm pulses responsively. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (tactile stone, auditory ticking, visual amber light). Crucially, the micro-setting—the charm and statue—charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Every detail filters through Marcel’s alchemical obsession, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal cave functions as micro-setting that actively charges the climax—the tide pools, light shafts, and barnacle-encrusted shell constrain Elias’s perception and catalyze his realization. The quay’s transformation from bustling to near-abandoned mirrors his aging, grounding theme in place. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., salt on stone, gull cries echoing). Only narrowly misses 9+ because the cave’s discovery hinges on coincidence without earlier spatial groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lighthouse, post–heat wave dawn, and night-blooming jasmine aren’t backdrop but active micro-settings: the garden’s survival enables the ritual, the heat’s break mirrors emotional thaw, and the lighthouse’s color evokes protective aura. Sensory detail is selective—peach/lavender horizon, humming cork—and filtered through Elias’s maritime obsession. The jasmine scent even crosses oceans, charging the closure image with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The starlit signal station functions as micro-setting: console, censer foot, and transmitter constrain every choice. The censer foot—handled repeatedly—charges the final image, glowing intensely as the ship enters the channel. Sensory detail (bronze humming, moon shadows, blinking lights) is selective, urgent, and filtered through the navigator’s professional and emotional priorities. Environment directly enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hanging orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively enables Elara’s ritual (storms mask her work), supplies the second relic, and mirrors her state (“broken and beautiful”). Weather, terrain, and tool (truffle fork) are tactilely integrated; the ravine’s isolation is both physical and psychological. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the orchard’s role in delivering the second eye flirts with symbolic convenience, though earned by prior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain perception and action. The mist obscures footprints, enabling the mystery; the dock’s edge becomes an altar for the Edelweiss. The recurring “opal” motif charges the final image when the flower glows like a star in twilight. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure, with tactile specificity (damp fog soaking sweater, brass spyglass cool against skin).

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting and constraint: the blooming cavern isn’t backdrop but active crucible where phosphorescent flowers, crystals, and rising creek pressure Elias’s revelation. The matrix chip’s glimmer interacts with water and light to project symbols—environment directly enables the climax. Earlier urban dust and later woods are filtered through Elias’s cartographer POV (“mapped but never truly explored”), avoiding tourist cataloging. Final image of daylight over the creek reweights the entire journey, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt grotto above clouds is not mere backdrop but a charged micro-setting that constrains choice: its razor-sharp rocks test stamina, its pulsing walls demand courage, and its pool of liquid sapphire forces self-confrontation. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—moonlight on stone, fireflies like stars, the “ghostly precision” of ascent—filtered through Elara’s determined exhaustion. The environment directly shapes tactics (climbing gear, timing before sunrise) and recharges the closure image when sunlight catches embers on descent. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual descriptors in the grotto chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus isn’t backdrop but active crucible: its geothermal warmth charges tools, its pulsing fragments react to Leo’s arrival, and rising ember-fireflies mirror emotional intensity. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting, its spiral constraining Elara’s perception and culminating in rainbow-fractured futures. Twilight’s liminal quality pressures the moment—secrets belong to thresholds. Every detail serves theme and choice, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain cabin functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its isolation enables Elias’s fractured perception, and its 8,000-foot elevation frames the aurora as both omen and mirror. Birch bark, pine scent, leather cord—all tactile details reappear with charged specificity. The final image of “peaks that had witnessed countless sunrises yet remained perpetually new” directly reweights the setting’s meaning, transforming geography into thematic vessel without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock shop functions as a potent micro-setting: its location between bakery and bookstore subtly underscores Elara’s sensory exile, while the “rhythmic drip” embodies time’s passage in lieu of scent. Fog anchors mood and timeframe, evolving from hush to slight lift as connection occurs. The birthing clamp screw and workbench tools are handled with tactile specificity, grounding emotion in object. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices—it reflects rather than pressures—preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating platform, tea ceremony, and crow quill function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice: the tempest deadline forces speed, the tea ritual calms her, and the quill’s precision enables rune syntax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (moss-covered stone, luminescent ink, coiling steam). The final image—storm breaking outside while hush remains within—charges closure with earned poise. Only misses 9+ by not having the setting *alter* tactics beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sheet music archive isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: dusty spines hold dormant melodies that mirror Beatrice’s trapped spirit, and the piano anchors their shared history. The orchard’s impending destruction creates temporal pressure, while the perfume bottle’s weight and filigree constrain Eloise’s physical and emotional gestures. Final image—sheet music left on piano—is charged by environment, object, and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient temple library functions effectively as a micro-setting: its self-rearranging shelves respond to intention, directly shaping the witness’s path. The dictionary glows at the center, charging the final image. However, sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses are absent even in high-stakes moments, slightly muting immersion. Still, the setting constrains tactics via its liminal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    The horizon measurement station functions as a potent micro-setting: its brass fittings, aqueducts, and clear chambers directly constrain Arlo’s actions (avoiding razor edges, tilting the clock). The fjord’s silence evolves from oppressive absence to companionable presence, charging the final image. Crucially, the setting’s tools—the hydraulic clock, mantle key—drive the central action and closure. Only minor deduction: while vivid, the fjord itself remains slightly generic beyond “quiet,” missing one more tactile detail to fully cross the 9.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges every turn: mushrooms intensify under laser pulses, their glow signaling comprehension. The setting functions as micro-setting through the laser-tool interface and fungal responses, culminating in the final image where “mushrooms brightened in approval,” directly validating the new covenant. Sensory detail is selective (blue-green pulses, silent air before birdsong), filtered through Elara’s spatial-professional POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. Environment shapes tactics (using light as medium) and recharges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “rainwashed library” functions as micro-setting: its damp quiet enables focus, its solitude mirrors Elena’s isolation, and its candle-lit intimacy contrasts Moscow’s anonymity. The mica-pane lantern constrains perception—light filters through it to reveal hidden patterns—directly enabling the plot turn. Midsummer’s “clover melancholy” isn’t cliché; it’s tied to diminishing daylight, echoing her father’s mortality. Every sensory detail (damp shoes, dust-smelling books, blue eyeliner) serves character or theme, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    The subway utility tunnel functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: its isolation enables Elias’s estrangement, while its pipes, condensation, and rails ground the atmosphere in tactile specificity. The glass harmonica disc—treated as an extension of setting—constrains choice (he answers because it glows) and directly charges the final image (its melody shifts from mourning to hope). Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action (“walls sweating with condensation that dripped a rhythmic punctuation”). The environment evolves conceptually alongside Elias’s arc, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The blooming jetty isn’t backdrop but active crucible—wildflowers supply pigments, planks creak under ritual, twilight dictates timing. Walnut ink, locket, and vials are micro-settings that constrain choice: he must work within fading light, using only what the place yields. Sensory detail is selective and profession-inflected (calloused fingers assessing paper grain, amber solution glowing “ethereally”). The jetty charges the final image: his departure reconfigures it from refuge to relic.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The disused railway station overgrown with ivy functions as both setting and micro-setting: it constrains Archie’s choices (neutral ground for clandestine meetings) and charges the final image (his sanctuary amid spreading connection). Sensory detail is selective—cracked mirror, ivy-choked windows—and filtered through Archie’s emotional state, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The moon rock (spray-painted pumice) gains texture through handling and mythmaking, directly shaping the plot’s escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and guides choice—its frequencies are legible only through Elion’s skin, shaping his path via musical pressure points. The platinum ring and constellations are recurring objects that charge the final image: the ring absorbs not direction but wisdom, redefining its purpose. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective (ultrasonic hum, braille-like notes), filtered through Elion’s unique perception. The setting evolves causally—from humming energy to absolute silence at the stillpoint—and directly enables the climax.

    The luminous harbor is vividly rendered through synesthetic detail (“water shimmered like scattered diamonds,” “salt-tinged air”), filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias. The moonlight and dock choreography remain coherent, and the setting actively shapes the narrative: it supplies the silence he translates. The vintage camera functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices—it enables them without friction, narrowly missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archive functions as a charged micro-setting—its dusty halls and Aeridor’s memory-weaving constrain Maya’s choices (she must follow artistic clues, restore the portrait). The recurring tapestry fragment evolves from relic to bridge between destruction/renewal, directly shaping the ending. Sensory detail is selective (“faded,” “dusty,” “worn pages”) and filtered through Maya’s guilt. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond providing objects; it’s more atmospheric than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sound wave garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active infrastructure that responds to Elena’s drumming, enabling the climax. The Resonance Tower’s vibrating metal surface directly channels cosmic music into bridge-building. Even her cell’s “cool metallic surfaces” foreshadow this tactile-sound logic. Final image charges the lagoon with irreplaceable emotional weight, fulfilling the 9+ gate: setting constrains tactics (rhythm unlocks paths) and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shipping container labyrinth isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics via acoustics, shifting alignments, and storm-induced blackouts. Sensory detail (humming metal, puddles, wind howl) is selective and pressure-driven. The folded map’s zodiac creases and the key’s smooth teeth are micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image charges the environment: the new map records how atmosphere alters sound, making place a living variable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt dock, rain-glistened shutters, and canal function as active micro-setting: they supply reflective surfaces, constrain movement, and directly enable the guardian’s light-weaving. The dental mirror and water surface aren’t just described—they’re tactical resources that shape every beat. Sensory detail (wet planks, clicking shutters, refracted starlight) is filtered through the guardian’s purposeful attention. The setting charges the final image: constellations painted on cobalt planks vanish at dawn, embodying ephemeral understanding.

Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—sepia-dusted petals, pine curls, the moan of blades—filtered through the performer’s ritualized perception. The mason jar’s crack and the wood’s knot are not just description but charged particulars that shape thematic resonance. However, the setting never directly alters tactics—it reflects rather than pressures, preventing a 9+ score despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake function as active micro-settings: the quartz colonnade’s vibration responds to the poet’s approach, and the lake’s surface mirrors then ripples with transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the poet’s aesthetic perception—light on cobalt stone, hum as melody—but avoids overreliance on visual cliché. However, the environment doesn’t constrain a pivotal choice; it reflects rather than pressures. Final image gains charge from the lake’s thaw, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly missed due to lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glassblower’s courtyard functions as a charged micro-setting: hanging glass ornaments refract light that interacts with Elara’s arrangements, spatial choreography remains clear (Elara arranging → approaching Gideon), and the environment directly enables the awakening. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the glassblowers know not to interrupt—and charges the final image when prismatic reflections coincide with the courtyard’s “inhalation.” Sensory detail is selective (wilted petals, metallic reed tongue catching light) and filtered through Elara’s colorblind then color-perceiving POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The concertina reed tongue and molten glass tools are purposefully integrated, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)

    The “glowing library in mist” functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its organic walls, hovering books, and internal luminescence directly shape the protagonist’s actions (e.g., using the watch to part the mist). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—the tea leaves, fogged mirrors, and cracked crystal all serve the cipher logic. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax: time inside distorts, forcing rapid transcription. The final image of fading walls charges the closure with irreplaceable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    The velvet observatory, ice violin, and desert rose function as micro-settings that actively constrain and enable choices. The “mulberry-hued drapes” absorb arctic light, deepening Elara’s physical and emotional state; the greenhouse plants are tactical resources, not backdrop. Final image—ice violin budding from roots—is charged by every prior environmental detail. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s profession and telepathy: she notices microscopic fractures, plant anxiety, resonant frequencies.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    The skyborne grotto under the aurora isn’t backdrop—it actively enables Elara’s work: crystals refract light to amplify connection, transparency isolates her in sacred hush, and altitude suggests liminality. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (only it captures memory) and charging the final image (glowing vial on shelf). Sensory detail is selective and urgent—orchard scent emerges only when memory is infused—avoiding tourist cataloguing. Every atmospheric element serves the threshold-of-stillness concept without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    The umbral grotto functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: clouds as floor, starlight as path, bark hollow as rest—each detail shapes Elara’s ascent and reflection. The hairpin and scallop-shell light patterns charge the final image, and sensory hierarchy (tactile bark, visual mist, auditory “vineyard hush”) reflects her meditative state. No white-room syndrome; every atmospheric cue tightens thematic pressure around rebirth and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: its height, spiral stairs, and lantern room choreograph movement and isolate moral deliberation. Wind, mist, and dawn light are not backdrop but active forces—shaping chime sounds, obscuring embers, filtering through the lens onto the mirror shard. Every sensory detail serves POV bias (Elian notices materials, frequencies, textures), and the environment directly charges the closure when morning light reveals “endless possibilities” in the hollow shard. No white-room syndrome; spatial logic is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating rock, magnetic grotto, and pond rings aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints: the platform isolates focus, the grotto’s invisibility embodies the lesson, and ripples visually scaffold Maya’s epiphany. Sensory detail (“sycamore hush,” starlight on water) filters through meditative urgency, avoiding tourist cataloging. Final image of glowing grotto charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and circular depression aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable Kael’s ritual. The setting functions as micro-setting: dust carries ancestral memory, light fractures through bone to energize the arrowhead, and the humming depression physically receives the artifact. Sensory detail is selective (whispering surfaces, shimmering air) and filtered through Kael’s reverence, never touristy. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the arrowhead pulses *because* it’s placed in that exact earth—and fulfills the 9+ gate by shaping both tactic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire, cloud layers, and crystalline air aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable action (e.g., mist walking requires shedding preconceptions tied to environment). The keystone’s “soft, persistent light” charges the final image, and the spire itself transforms post-journey, proving setting evolves with character. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and purposeful—cold isn’t described but felt through glistening ice and oppressive gear. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting through the oil lamp, skeleton key, and lampposts, all constraining or charging choices. The sunken library’s porthole links sky lanterns to underwater music, making environment causal to the climax. Descriptions are filtered through Hemingway’s synesthetic POV (“foghorns are deep purple”), avoiding tourist cataloging. The final lamppost’s multicolored flame directly reconfigures the opening image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ambered observatory deck functions as a potent micro-setting: its alumina walls, obsidian slab, and cosmic glow directly frame the ritual and charge the final spiral image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (amber light fracturing, coins humming), filtered through Loran’s focused perception. The setting constrains choice by housing the only apparatus for cosmic interpretation, and evolves causally as contraction intensifies. This integration earns high marks despite minor exposition in “transparent alumina walls.”

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ancient observatory functions as a charged micro-setting: cracked glass filters light that “paints patterns,” the brass mechanism tracks stars, and the dome echoes sacrifice—all directly enabling the reaper’s naming ritual. Sensory detail is selective (dust, scattered light, parchment flutter) and filtered through his grief. The setting constrains choice (he must use the observatory’s light to crystallize names) and charges the final image. Only minor deduction: “star-dusted realms beyond death” risks slight vagueness against otherwise concrete textures.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: its smooth stones enable kneeling, its height frames the sea, and its refraction of dawn light becomes “liquid sky” at climax—directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (mournful dripping, spectral bronze, teeming waters) and filtered through the mage’s obsessive focus. The bell’s meteoric origin and fractured state constrain choice: only intention, not bronze, can rebuild it. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is not backdrop but active constraint: the receding waters dictate timing, the ridgeway frames perspective, and the exposed town enables discovery. Sensory detail (violet-indigo twilight, mirrored hush) filters through Thomas’s professional and emotional lens. The sapphire label and silent chime function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Only slight overreliance on visual lyricism prevents a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail that mirrors Elara’s duality. The setting actively participates: the starlings appear only here, the blue flame burns uniquely in this space, and the waterfall intensifies in response to ritual progress. Sensory hierarchy favors light and sound over touch or smell, fitting the ethereal tone. The micro-setting (orchard as liminal crucible) constrains and enables the entire ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal arbor functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: thin atmosphere limits communication, canopy filters moonlight onto the buckle, and cloudless skies heighten observational pressure. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—cold winds, rustling leaves without wind—filtered through the watcher’s professional bias. The parachute buckle evolves from equipment to symbol of survival mathematics, charging the final image where its weight becomes an anchor for truth-telling.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock dojo functions as micro-setting: its stability amid flux enables the vivification ritual, and its trembling during climax shows environmental consequence. The brain-in-jar is handled repeatedly and charges the ending. However, while vivid (“clouds and fragments of reality”), the setting doesn’t actively constrain Maya’s tactics beyond providing a stage—it supports but doesn’t shape her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Moonshadow Brook and the nocturnal haven are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: the brook’s “silver flow” mirrors Elara’s thought process and directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., storm-born silence, seed texture). The environment constrains nothing materially but deeply shapes tone and reflection. It stops short of 9+ because the setting doesn’t force a tactical choice—it enables contemplation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    The echo chamber tunnel functions as micro-setting: its acoustics enable Silas’s symphony and shape his tactics (modulating airflow for lullabies). The pull cord handle and blower nozzle are handled repeatedly, grounding abstraction in tactile specificity. Stone walls “perfect for his symphony” directly constrain choice, and the final image (“ghost of laughter lingering”) charges the setting with thematic weight. Sensory detail (slick handle, chugging thrum) is selective and pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen garden in mist operates as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: its crystalline roses tremble and shift color in response to the pendant, and its boundaries of light dissolve as the guardian’s consciousness expands. Every atmospheric detail—weathered cherub, frozen flora, oscillating mist—serves the thematic arc and final image. The setting evolves causally with the guardian’s internal state, never static. Crucially, it charges the ending: stepping forward transforms the garden into “another page,” making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus functions as micro-setting: its suspended particles, residual heat, and twilight liminality directly enable and mirror Elias’s work. The crozier, cobblestones, and tools are tactile extensions of environment. Final image—the nexus releasing fragrance after something new is born—charges closure. Every sensory detail serves pressure or theme; no white-room syndrome or generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The suspended radio tower city over the gorge functions as both macro- and micro-setting, directly constraining Elara’s actions (she must ascend, balance, use the tower’s resonance). The shard of hush and Hollywood fragment are treated as environmental extensions—tools that alter perception and possibility. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered (e.g., wind whipping hair, rusted antennas), and evolves with lunar perigee’s intensifying light. The final image is charged by the setting: the city hums, then sleeps, mirroring cosmic cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions masterfully as micro-setting: the ferry’s transformation, the spectral grotto’s “stalactites of frozen time,” and the liquid-starlight water all constrain choices and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—ozone scent, glowing console, three-moon light—filtered through Liam’s trained perception. The grotto directly enables the timeline merger, making it indispensable. Deducted slightly because the harbor’s daytime reality remains underdeveloped, though this serves thematic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    The optical illusion gallery functions as a dynamic micro-setting that actively pressures choices: walls breathe, illusions reflect inner states, and spatial choreography supports the eruption of phantom figures. The sinew thread—a tool and object-as-setting—constrains and enables Elias’s actions throughout and directly charges the final image when he touches it. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective, filtered through Elias’s fever-dream architect POV. The environment evolves causally with the plot, culminating in the gallery’s transcendence into a realm of connection.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The benthic city is vividly rendered through bioluminescent algae, pressure seals, and submerged ruins, all filtered through Kael’s professional attention. The anchor chain link functions as micro-setting, constraining his method and charging the final image when held aloft. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., “iron surface etched with barnacles and memory”), though tactile or auditory immersion beyond the visual remains light. The environment directly enables the thematic pivot—without this specific depth-bound setting, the core tension collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: its twilight obscurity enables the predator’s lurking and Elena’s sensory focus. The hearing aid and photograph are tactile tools that constrain choice—Elena must follow pulses, not sight. Sensory detail is selective (dim blue light, ethereal fog) and filtered through Elena’s professional bias. Final image charges the setting: the atrium becomes a site of interception, not just communion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The facility isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: salt-stained walls, humming pipes, and the concrete cable cylinder shape Elara’s movements and rituals. The ocean’s “crashing hush” and tidal countdown charge the final image as the waves reclaim the entrance. Gold-fleck Codex and undersea cables merge setting with tool, constraining tactics (e.g., working only between tides). Deducted slightly because spatial choreography of the “central monitoring room” vs. “access point” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal observatory functions as micro-setting: iridescent walls blur with snow, constraining perception and mirroring the protagonist’s liminal state. The shard, inkwell, and dormant telescope are tactile tools that enable the ritual. Weather (snow cessation) times the climax; aurora-like walls pulse with emotional valence. All details serve the defragmentation act—no postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the bone towers, canyon echoes, and tunnel physically constrain and enable the storyteller’s method. Every sensory detail (pale light on flawed diamond, lavender-gold twilight) serves theme and tactic. The environment charges the final image—the towers themselves hum in harmony—fulfilling the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underground garden functions as both setting and micro-setting, actively constraining choice (e.g., gravity-defying gremlins signal altered physics) and charging the final image via luminous flora and bioluminescent gatherings. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—frostbitten hope, moon-petal scent—and evolves causally with cryptid behavior. The flint arrowhead’s warmth ties environment to character action, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge are rendered with evocative specificity—copper skies, glowing roots, iridescent shells—and directly constrain choices (e.g., navigating statues). The locust shell functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when its dust is kept in a locket. However, while atmospheric, the mechanical city remains underdeveloped, reducing spatial contrast. Still, key environments shape tactics and closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt arcade isn’t just backdrop—it pressures choices (guards entering, shift change timing) and charges the final image (neon blue as uneasy sanctuary). The “thunderstorm in a bottle” functions as micro-setting, constraining action and symbolizing contained hope. Sensory details (flickering lights, brittle hush, puddles) are filtered through Elias’s urgency. Only minor deduction: “disputed territory” lacks specific geopolitical texture, though plausibly vague for thematic universality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: decayed metal contrasts the oasis, ivy forms a portal, broken windows frame light. The halo fragment and wind bells are recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (warmth of fragment, chime harmonizing heartbeat) and filtered through the carpenter’s silent perception. The garden’s impossible flora reweights the train’s meaning, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scientific poetry library functions as a charged micro-setting—its shelves of quantum texts and sonnets directly enable Margaret’s emotional-resonance system and hyperbolic ritual. Sensory details (scent of old paper, impossible light, vibrating words) are purposeful and filtered through her POV. The setting constrains choice: only at 3 a.m., amid oblivious patrons, can she perform her work. The final image—dawn touching the window as she returns to her desk—charges the closure with earned stasis, though the spatial choreography of the “gateway” remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.3)
    The whispering archipelago isn’t backdrop but active participant—its murmurs soften at dawn, its islands hold breath, its light carries emotion. The watercolor palette and camera are micro-settings that constrain action: only predawn light vitalizes images, only the easternmost point yields the cipher. Final image charges the setting: sunrise becomes a language. Every sensory detail (murmuring books, rippling waves on paper) serves the thematic core without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shadowed nexus functions as micro-setting: stone under palms, starlight, compass spin—all constrain Silas’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (tactile stone, visual stars, temporal twilight). The lock of hair transforms within this space, proving environment shapes outcome. Only minor deduction: cosmic possibility isn’t spatially grounded beyond metaphor, slightly weakening physical choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks aren’t backdrop but active constraints: vines obscure the ring, broken glass frames starlight, and half-buried hulls channel shadowy figures. Sensory detail (dew on caps, skeletal wood) is filtered through Elara’s folklorist POV—she notices decay as narrative. The setting charges closure: shipwrecks “release secrets” as memories return, tying geography to theme. One flaw: “waterlogged orchard” slightly contradicts earlier “sunken” descriptor, minor spatial fuzz.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The forgotten library functions as micro-setting: its shelves, shadows, and silence constrain movement and perception, directly enabling the shard-annotation ritual. The “afternoon shadow caught in glass” evolves from passive detail to active collaborator in revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects the archivist’s expertise—dust, porcelain, tremor—while spatial choreography remains precise. Only minor deduction: the Wall of Whispering Shadows and Case of Slumbering Histories flirt with ornamental naming without functional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: the falls supply energy for the weaving, and the moss receives the seed’s rainbow, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—water whispers secrets, leaves hold breath—avoiding tourist cataloguing. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice; it enables without resistance, missing a 9+ gate. Still, atmosphere and specificity serve theme with lyrical cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting: its fractured light mirrors Elena’s psyche and directly pressures her work—the bending light signals spirit unrest, guiding her actions. The tapestry needle and fisherman’s net are tactile, recurring objects that constrain tactics (only knots can be unraveled) and charge the closure (net dissolves, light calms). Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elena’s professional attention—no tourist catalog. The setting evolves causally with the ritual and culminates in the final pattern of mended masks on the floor.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault functions as micro-setting: its leaking ceiling and eroded frescoes mirror Elara’s work of recovering lost meaning, while the persistent drumming rain directly pressures her discovery moment (“One rainy Tuesday…”). The torn map constrains her choices—she cannot cross the divide—and charges the final image when she repairs it as a threshold. Sensory detail is selective (sound of rain, visual traces of color) and filtered through her professional perception. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure without static description.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken ship library is vividly rendered—not as backdrop but as micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax: pressure preserves history, ocean presses against glass, silence amplifies revelation. The snow globe functions as a secondary “setting,” its evolving state directly shaping the ending. Sensory detail (water droplets like tears, reinforced windows) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options—it reflects rather than pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The misty courtyard functions as a potent micro-setting that actively enables communication—the graffiti shifts, responds, and encodes meaning. The flower press bolt plate and storm-timeframe are tactilely integrated, constraining when and how Elara can act. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mist, flickering screens, spray-paint), filtered through Elara’s drifting alertness. The setting charges the final image: the courtyard is where the silent song endures, making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound spire isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting. Crystalline walls fracture light, enabling decryption; the vertical climb tightens time and stakes.

Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    The brass telescope and sky gondola function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the narrative: the gondola’s sway limits movement while enabling perspective, and the telescope mediates all key observations. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (cumulus “anxious,” cirrus “joyous”), avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the telescope appears in opening and closing lines, reweighted from anchor to proof-gathering instrument. The “dusty starlight” atmosphere evolves with emotional stakes, directly shaping the final image’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The hollowed tree trunk functions as both setting and character—its grain, light patterns, and hidden compartment directly enable Elara’s discovery and final act. Moonlight through carved leaves creates shifting constellations that mirror her evolving understanding. The wooden floor’s depression is discovered through goal-directed movement, grounding revelation in physical interaction. The setting doesn’t just reflect mood; it constrains and catalyzes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The antique airship functions as micro-setting: its brass-and-wood texture, observation deck, and drifting motion ground the discovery. The hopscotch board and luminance are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (cloud-streaked sky, dusty squares) and filtered through Eli’s cartographic bias. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices—it enables but doesn’t pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen library, hall of mirrors, and clockmaker’s tools function as micro-settings that actively constrain and charge choices—the ice must melt for knowledge to flow, the mirrors distort navigation, and the gear assortment enables precise empathy-driven repair. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“hauntingly bright tools caught the morning light, scattering rainbow reflections”), filtered through Elias’s profession and emotional state. The environment directly shapes the climax: melting ice and shivering mirrors manifest the heart’s restoration. This integration earns the 9-band; setting isn’t backdrop but co-agent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Veridia’s floating arches, violet sunsets, and nebula create vivid atmosphere, but only the watering bell functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its mechanics dictate pollination tactics. The orchard planet backdrop remains largely decorative; spatial choreography is coherent but doesn’t pressure decisions. Descriptions are lyrical yet integrated (“soil-depleted plants,” “mist that carried symbiotic larvae”), though the setting rarely impedes or enables beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: its “pane of hush” actively absorbs sound, enabling the whispered lullaby to resonate where louder force would fail. Salt spray, bruised twilight hues, and iron stairs ground perception in Elias’s urgent, tactile reality. Crucially, the environment constrains choice—the silence isn’t backdrop but tactical condition—and charges the final image: beam sweeping ocean while starlight glows in the puppet’s crack, merging outer and inner worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the orchard’s curse defines Elias’s duty; the labyrinth’s stone walls, frost, and mechanical birds shape navigation tactics; the hollow tree anchors both blueprint and device return. Sensory detail is selective—“violet and amber” twilight, “glittering crystals” of frost—and filtered through Elias’s pragmatic attention. The recurring nut and device charge the final image. Only slight deduction: mechanical birds feel underutilized post-climax, reducing environmental pressure consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The braided ravine functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes Elara’s insight—the river’s splitting and reconverging directly mirrors her thematic realization. Sensory detail is selective (foam patterns, afternoon light, branch texture) and filtered through her polymer-chemist POV. However, while the setting charges the final image, it doesn’t *constrain* a choice—Elara could’ve had this epiphany elsewhere. Still, the environment is tightly interwoven with cognition, avoiding postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass orchard library actively constrains and enables: floating on clouds limits access (“accessible only to those who lost something”), glass trees supply narrative fragments, and bottled moonlight functions as both inventory and ritual tool. Every sensory detail serves theme—crystalline fruits “pulsed with captured narratives,” glass birds hold “unvoiced wishes”—avoiding static description. The setting evolves causally: the library trembles when breached, shifts before the ceremony, and culminates in the door formed from moonlight shards. This micro-setting charges the final image and forecloses the vendor’s isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The desert fortress, rain-damp sands, and coral icebound pavilion form a cohesive micro-setting where environment directly constrains action: the rain enables tidal readings, damp sand allows passage, and the pavilion’s brittleness mirrors emotional stakes. Sensory detail is selective—glistening walls, bitter taste, icy sheen—and filtered through Kael’s chef-POV. The final image charges the setting: he emerges onto shifting dunes, the pavilion hidden again, its work done but its danger lingering. Only slight deduction for minor visual dominance over other senses in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astronomical clock tower functions as micro-setting: its library, basement, and refurbished meeting space directly enable Elena’s actions.

The porcelain insulator functions as tool-as-setting, its rainbows and hum directly shaping her tactile translation of memory. Sensory hierarchy aligns with her symphonic focus (vibrations over visuals), and the final image (“work of redemption began anew”) is charged by the grove’s quiet intensity. No white-room syndrome; every element serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The magnetic nexus isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: its twilight alignment dictates Elias’s deadline, its pulses structure his analysis, and its energy intensifies at climax. The basalt worry stone functions as micro-setting: its dent fits his thumb, grounding abstraction in tactile specificity. Final image—dent catching last light—charges closure with earned poignancy. Sensory detail (crackling air, polished stone) is selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “shadowed workshop under stars” operates as a potent micro-setting: crystals and tuning forks are tactile tools that directly enable the method, while celestial light and encroaching fireworks charge the atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective—visual shimmer, auditory tones, emotional hums—and filtered through Elara’s vibrational POV. The setting constrains no choice but deeply charges the final image: fireworks casting colored shadows as she accepts her new mission. Just shy of 9+ because the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The treetop village is vividly rendered through scent, mist, and rope bridges, filtered through Elara’s profession and senses. The corpse flower’s blue filaments and doodle-covered papers charge the final image. However, the setting never actively constrains choice—it enables but doesn’t pressure. The “wildflower hush” atmosphere is consistent but decorative rather than tactical, missing the 9+ gate of environmental constraint on decision.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Verdantis is vividly specific: floating arches, inverted rivers as “aerial roads,” latticed shadows—all constrain Arion’s choices. The setting actively guides navigation and shapes the climax beneath the First Arch. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: trees settling, water flowing down, the planet “breathing easier” after inversion. The broken arrow tip (micro-setting) directly enables the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Thunder-echo range isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the climax: telluric fissures align with driftwood markers, avalanchingly quiet air amplifies sound into chords, and canyon hush retreats wildlife instinctively. The gilded flute and stream-sourced driftwood are micro-settings that constrain ritual mechanics and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Eldrin’s focus: tactile wood selection, auditory echoes, visual pearlescence—all filtered through relic-keeper expertise. Only minor deduction: “pale morning light” feels generic amid otherwise precise atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The topaz workshop is not backdrop but active constraint: its shimmering walls, skylight-starlight interplay, and spatial uncanniness directly enable Elara’s methods and disorient subjects. The halo fragment—a micro-setting—charges every key beat and the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s dual identity: tactile precision with type vs. celestial awe with the fragment. Every atmospheric detail serves the central conflict, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining choice and reweighting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.3)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: auroras trigger pendant pulses, snow yields to shoots underfoot, village windows mirror fireflies. The dragonfly-wing pendant functions as body-tool-setting hybrid, constraining choice (must protect it) and charging the final image (earth trembles in its absence). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—cold, light, vibration—and avoids tourist cataloguing. Only minor deduction: “northern wastes” lacks tactile specificity compared to ridgeway details.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and prism form a tightly integrated micro-setting that actively shapes the experiment and final revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—water droplets enhancing crystal properties, frost shifting in response to touch—and evolves causally with the action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest function as active micro-settings: the silence originates there, the bead warms in response to it, and the final redemption occurs at a specific bamboo etched with forgotten script. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (green-gold light, mossy floor), filtered through Elara’s perception as a weaver attuned to absence. The amber bead and loom serve as object-as-setting that constrain choice—she cannot act until the bead pulses. Final image recharges the orchard with returned sound, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Veridia’s orchards and floating arches are vividly rendered and functionally integrated: falling asteroids supply Orion’s material, making the setting a causal resource, not backdrop. The mine shafts serve as both sanctuary and crucible, constraining his work and shaping his isolation. Sensory detail is selective (azure glow, humming silk, dripping water) and filtered through Orion’s craft-focused POV. The recurring azure light charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining choice (he works only where the silk’s energy flows) and reconfiguring meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay functions effectively as micro-setting: dust motes, frozen tools, and shafts of light establish mood and history while grounding spatial choreography. The green glass shard acts as an extension of setting—its warmth, pulse, and heat directly constrain action (e.g., preventing contact with the red shard). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, prioritizing touch and vision appropriate to a sensory cartographer. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere; it enables but doesn’t compel.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern room functions as a charged micro-setting—its salt-oil-thunder smell, vibrating floorboards, and locked isolation directly enable the discovery of letters and stones. The sea glass and stone stack constrain choices: Elias must decide whether to join the chain. Fog, tide, and tower vibration aren’t backdrop but active forces shaping perception and possibility. Final image of the shrinking lighthouse reweights the setting as both physical and emotional shelter.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    The emerald lighthouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its spiral stairs, manuscripts, and beam-directing lenses enable Elara’s actions.

Sensory detail is selective (aurora energy, swirling nebulas) and filtered through her professional attention. The setting evolves causally: night to dawn to night again, with storm-to-fleet transition altering spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock tea house is not mere backdrop—it constrains access (rope ladder), shapes methodology (prisms, sun tracking), and charges the closure as the site where stories become magnetic. The morpho wing, morning dew, and prisms function as micro-settings that directly enable the climactic dye creation. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Kaelen’s dye-master perception, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit tower isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: moonlight enables healing and sextant alignment; the scarred oak floorboard anchors arboreal memory; acoustics amplify the pin-drop into revelation. These elements constrain and enable Samuel’s actions—his workspace, tools, and environment are tactile and purposeful. The final image of “silver serenity” recharges earlier motifs with earned calm, fulfilling the 9+ gate: setting directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: phosphorescent flora respond to song, starlight fruit must be swaddled, and the mica window reflects transformation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—cold glass, gossamer threads, pulsing jade leaves—all serving the keeper’s ritual. The environment charges the final image: the window reflecting sunrise elsewhere crystallizes the theme of indirect restoration. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library functions as both setting and micro-setting: its “hidden in plain sight” nature mirrors Eleanor’s paradox and directly enables her method of “staying while leaving.” Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned—“enlarged tranquility,” grandfather clock chimes—but avoids over-description. The recurring object (invitation) and spatial choreography (aisles, hidden chamber below) constrain choices and charge the final image. However, environmental pressure remains atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house function as micro-settings that actively constrain and enable choice: the hidden space allows private ritual; wild herbs supply tea; cracked flagstones frame decay vs. persistence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (yeast smell evoking memory, rain on tin roof). However, while the setting charges the final image, it doesn’t *constrain* Eliza’s decisive act—the letter could be read anywhere—missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The frozen library above the clouds functions as both macro- and micro-setting: ice-encrusted windows, velvet cushions, brass-and-crystal devices—all tactile and specific. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the extreme cold and silence demand precision; the library’s resonance with sampled frequencies directly enables the climax. The “magic lantern slide” and “frequency sampler” are tools integrated into action, not decoration. The final image—vows pulsing as the library brightens—charges the setting with thematic weight, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rotting pier and pirate market aren’t backdrop—they’re tactical terrain.

The setting evolves causally, culminating in the dawn-lit emergence that frames her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the lavender bluff’s terrestrially cosmic energies constrain choice by triggering the compass and bodily changes, while the aurora’s algorithmic pulses mirror the forest’s democratic process. Sensory specificity (ozone-copper taste, humming roots) filters through the skeptic’s POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the bluff charges the final image—lavender flowers opening wider as transformation begins—fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave is far more than backdrop—it actively constrains and charges the narrative. Moonstone columns guide his path; amethyst glow reveals hidden blues in the portrait; crystal clusters form an easel. Setting merges with tool and body: mineral light enables visual revelation impossible in studio, directly altering his artistic perception. This micro-setting irreplaceably shapes the climax and closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse city under toxic sky isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: failed filtration zones dictate route, humidity warps floorboards hiding the map, and the air itself becomes a moral filter. The zinc plate and shredded map function as micro-settings that constrain tactics (alignment required) and charge the final image (reverently packed as “keys”). Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“dim light of a solar-powered lamp,” “warm in her hands”), filtered through Elara’s calligrapher’s attention to texture and truth. The environment directly enables the climax by preserving clues only sincerity can unlock.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering bluff functions as micro-setting: its altitude isolates Elara, enabling her unique perception, and its height makes the Aural Spectrum visible to communities below, directly shaping communication tactics. The iceberg fragment—a tool-as-setting—constrains choice (only she can tune it) and charges the final image (its undiminished glow after her death). Sensory detail is selective (vibrations, hues, overtones) and filtered through Elara’s profession, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The setting evolves causally: from bell tower to kinetic sculpture hub, then to pilgrimage site.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and magnetic shift are vividly rendered and causally active—the dome’s failing field directly pressures Unit 734’s choices.

Only minor deduction: “fractured light” ending feels slightly abstract versus earlier tactile precision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vibrant courtyard functions as micro-setting that enables storytelling and resists external intrusion—it’s not backdrop but social infrastructure. The locket and mailbox act as object-as-setting, constraining choice (Leo can’t open it; must seek stories). Descriptions are sensory and selective (“morning light painted the benches... in gold”), filtered through Leo’s curatorial gaze. However, the defunct post office lacks spatial specificity, slightly weakening the climactic mailbox retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken laboratory functions as a potent micro-setting: coral-encrusted pipes, dripping consoles, and filtered light constrain Elara’s movements and shape her methodology. The hangman’s dice and journals are tactile, integrated into action. However, the environment never actively resists or complicates her quest—no malfunction, decay, or spatial obstacle raises tension. Still, the setting charges the final image by housing reborn innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt crystal growing chamber and dock-side harbor aren’t just backdrop—they constrain and enable action. The chamber amplifies gravity pockets; the beach holds the whale and crystal. Lanterns, wildflowers, and coffee mugs function as micro-settings that charge the final image: Elara relighting lanterns while carrying memory-work forward. Sensory detail is selective (salt facets catching light “in ways that defied normal physics”) and filtered through Elara’s ritualistic perception. The “gleaming silence” evolves from comfort to charged liminal space.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook functions as a potent micro-setting that actively shapes the ritual: water reflects stars, sound harmonizes with breath, and stones anchor rhythm. These details aren’t decorative—they constrain and enable the summoner’s actions, culminating in the crane’s release upon the current. The origami wing and brook jointly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate condition. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the summoner’s focused perception, avoiding tourist-like cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The historic district, study clutter, and rooftop garden are vividly rendered through Clara’s architectural attention—she notices carvings on windowsills, not generic “old bricks.” The meteor shower isn’t just backdrop; it literally illuminates the seal, enabling thematic revelation. However, while the seal functions as micro-setting, the city skyline remains decorative (“constellations on earth”) without constraining choice. Still, sensory detail serves Clara’s perception and the final image earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    The velvet garden functions as micro-setting: moss enables kneeling, twilight-dawn transition gates the ritual, blooms bowing at climax charges closure. Sensory detail (velvet moss, ethereal blue light, whispering shell) is selective and pressure-driven. Final image ties setting to theme—garden transforms as Elara does—fulfilling the 9+ gate. Minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual/tactile at expense of other senses during peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marble sanctuary and aurora function as micro-setting: cool air contrasts the key’s warmth, stained glass shapes the “pearl twilight” that modulates tone, and stalactites mark time. These details constrain mood and perception but don’t actively shape tactics—Elias could write anywhere. Still, the heritage rose thorn and key are tactile extensions of setting, and the final image of planting the thorn charges the environment with renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The serpentine nexus under starlight functions as micro-setting: its winding paths and canyon walls constrain movement and amplify sound, directly enabling the echo mechanic central to the plot. Sensory detail is selective (star patterns, stone, starlight) and filtered through the singer’s perception. The setting charges the final image—the canyon holding its breath—but doesn’t actively foreclose tactical options beyond ambiance. Vivid yet slightly ornamental in pressure application.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its warmth in cold water and later glow constrain tactics and charge the ending. Glacier shrine isn’t postcard description; its candlelight and frozen tears actively shape ritual and perception. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities (tactile glass, visual candle flicker), and environment evolves causally (coral-encrusted beams → clear altar). Only slight deduction: ocean chill vs. warm glass risks physics amnesia, but magical realism cues mitigate this.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting through tools (net, whisk) and environment (parapet after rain), all of which charge the final image. The whispering parapet isn’t backdrop—it enables the climax, its damp stones triggering auditory intimacy that mirrors the protagonist’s attunement to hidden patterns.

The floating mountain and atmospheric upheavals enforce isolation, making the setting inseparable from theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The feral loft, dunes, and glass jars form a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—the jars are tools, not decor—and the salt-air-tarnished music box gains texture from its environment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: dust motes as “tiny performers,” light “filtered in mysterious patterns.” The senior center’s spatial choreography remains coherent despite multiple characters. The setting charges the final image: the jar and box on the table become altars of reconciliation, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drift-ice marina isn’t just backdrop—it constrains movement (crunching ice, rotting dock) and mirrors tension (ice cracking “like distant bones”). The lighthouse’s stone walls and spiral stairs shape spatial choreography, and the orb’s blue light charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (cold metal, fogged breath), filtered through Elias’s engineer POV. Only minor deduction: “fleeting golden sunset” feels slightly decorative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as active micro-setting: the basalt sanctuary channels wind into melody, the frozen lake acts as mirror/amplifier, and the viaduct’s magnetism constrains observation methods.

The environment charges the final image: dawn’s thaw literalizes the thematic shift from rigidity to flow.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subway tunnel functions as micro-setting: pooled water, alcove, pipe, and airflow directly enable or constrain actions (e.g., fabric caught on pipe, water displacement). Sensory detail (mildew, damp air, patina) is filtered through Maya’s professional and ancestral lenses. The lantern qualifies as object-as-setting—it charges the final image and constrains her choice. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    The antique shop functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: its atmosphere of ticking mechanisms and aged tools mirrors the thematic tension between repair and acceptance. Sensory details (scent of metal polish, stained-glass light) are filtered through the priest’s weary perception. The music boxes’ “vibrant hush” charges the final exit, making the environment integral to closure. Only minor deduction: the shop’s spatial layout remains slightly abstract, though not detrimental.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The workshop and acid sea aren’t backdrop but active constraints: fumes stiffen gears, spatial navigation defines the quest, and the kaleidoscope’s placement centers the setting’s logic. Brass-and-cog textures permeate perception, grounding abstraction in tactile specificity. The final image charges the bell through its unassuming brassness, echoing the workshop’s materiality. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *narrow* tactical options beyond general ambiance—hence just below 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The social network archive functions as a potent micro-setting—a digital necropolis where static, flickering files, and grayed-out sectors constrain Elara’s access and shape her tactics. The Stellaris patch and recurring numbers act as tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail (static electricity, corrupted files flickering like ghosts) is vivid and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Deduction: the archive’s physicality remains abstract—no body-in-space navigation—but as a tool-bound setting, it earns high marks.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage mirrors form a cohesive micro-setting that charges the final image—the crystal glows with “captured light of a thousand moments,” directly echoing the mirrors’ time-net function. Sensory detail is selective (diamond-like branches, groaning ice) and filtered through Elena’s shadow-laced perception. However, the setting constrains no tactical choice; it atmospherically supports but doesn’t pressure decisions. Vivid yet slightly decorative in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active micro-setting: ice cracks like “living things,” cold reddens faces, wind lifts hair and carries solace.

The parasol tip functions as a tactile extension of setting, its warmth echoing environmental light. Every sensory cue aligns with Elena’s emotional arc without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    The amber pavilion and autumn vineyard are vividly evoked with sensory specificity (amber light, charred paper, chill air), and the setting functions as micro-setting through the sentinel’s tactile interaction with place. However, environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—the pavilion is a passive backdrop, not an active pressure. Weather and season mirror mood effectively but lack causal force. Strong atmosphere, yet setting remains decorative rather than instrumental to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vividly specific—the mosaic floor, whispering stones, dune-buried parapet—and filters through the line walker’s peripheral awareness. However, environment doesn’t constrain choice; the pavilion enables rather than pressures. Final image of “truth growing wild like flowers” charges closure beautifully, but no spatial or tactile detail actively shapes tactics during the ritual. Strong atmosphere, yet setting remains stage rather than participant.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: the ruins frame decay/renewal, the field supplies scent and sway that “approve” Elara’s work. Crucially, the dove gray map case and vines climbing the walls charge the final image—the case is “lighter in spirit,” vines mark time’s passage. Setting constrains no tactical choice but deeply shapes tone and thematic resonance, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly via final-image reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shadowed library at dawn functions as both setting and micro-setting: its silence enables acoustic discovery, its dust motes visualize time, and its books are active constraints (sources of dead languages). The crystal—a repurposed chandelier shard—charges the final image, refracting dawn light to signal rebirth. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (scent of paper, tactile spines, sonic reflections), avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the environment constrains choice (only here can the crystal work) and directly shapes the ending’s revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fog sculpture garden isn’t backdrop—it actively obscures, reveals, and resonates. Metal arches shimmer with condensation that responds to chalk; fog swallows driftwood arrows and the caretaker alike.

The setting charges the final image by enabling perception beyond human limits.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” remains atmospheric rather than tactical—it evokes mood but doesn’t constrain choice. However, the micro-setting shines: the cedar chest, lavender lotion, and especially the broken vinyl function as charged objects that shape ritual and closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (therapist notices scent before sight), and spatial choreography is clear (chairs arranged, son kneeling). The vinyl piece, not the hospice, is the true setting—and it charges the final image, narrowly missing 9+ due to the titular location’s ornamental role.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting—the telescope, rune stones, and dome directly enable the ritual. Sensory detail is selective (glowing runes, vibrating stones) and POV-filtered. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice; it facilitates without resistance, missing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    The secret garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: moonpetals enable the ritual, upside-down blooms signal altered physics, and perpetual twilight permits the tooth’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “feral nexus in mist” functions effectively as micro-setting, its swirling unpredictability contrasting the novelist’s rigid plotting. Sensory detail is selective (mist curling, morning light glimmering) and filtered through POV bias, avoiding tourist cataloging. The spiral seashell fragment constrains no choice but charges the final image when placed on the manuscript. Description integrates with action (“clutching,” “placed gently”), yet setting never actively pressures decisions—it reflects rather than forces change.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The verdant arbor functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: it shelters Elara’s work, hosts the miraculous vine, and becomes the village’s reclaimed heart. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—sunlight through canopy, luminescent pulse, amber moonlight—never touristic. The setting evolves causally: from private workshop to communal ritual space, charged by the harvest moon’s presence. The vine tendril, as object-as-setting, directly alters the final image when its song restores memory.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The withered orchard and subarctic crater are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: peeling bark supplies materials, frost shapes object states, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices—it enables them without imposing meaningful limits. The flash-paper and plate charge the final image, but the setting itself doesn’t foreclose options or alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The marble cavern isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the plot: its reflective surfaces provide the data Elara needs, and its “warmer” response validates her method. Light angles shift with the wounded season, making the setting a dynamic collaborator. The timer’s brass-and-crystal form contrasts with the stone, heightening tactile specificity. Every sensory detail serves the central mechanic: reflection as temporal calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bronze grotto isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes the ritual: walls shimmer to catch starlight, the altar is “natural bronze and crystal,” and spatial choreography (descent, central chamber, threshold exit) grounds every move. The kerosene lamp’s glow interacts with metallic surfaces, and “shingled hush” merges acoustic and geological texture. Final image ties setting to theme: grotto “waited beneath the awakening sky,” charging the horizon with cyclical duty. Only minor risk: “bronze towers under alien stars” slightly detaches from primary setting.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that actively shapes perception and choice—Clara reads constellations in droplets, ties rain angles to circus tents, and times her carving to its shifting light. The ash wood blank, tools, and kettle are handled with lived-in specificity, each constraining or enabling action. Final image gains charge from the loft’s unchanged-yet-transformed state, proving environment is not backdrop but co-agent. Sensory detail (hiss of kettle, grain of wood) filters through Clara’s professional and emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The kinetic lagoon functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its halted state mirrors Cyrus’s stagnation, while its magical properties enable the bridge of words and temporal photography. The camera wheel, lagoon currents, and celestial debris are tactile, recurring elements that constrain tactics (e.g., needing stories to form the bridge) and charge the final image (carousel restarting as currents realign). Every sensory detail—crystallized moon fruit, iridescent debris, reflected stars—serves atmosphere without stalling momentum, fulfilling the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned terminal functions as micro-setting: dust, dormant transformers, and ticket counters constrain Maya’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (brass gleam, echoing footsteps) and filtered through an engineer’s attention.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active crucible: crystal columns constrain choice (only operable post-rain at dawn), their prismatic surfaces warping reflection to mirror Elias’s fractured self-perception. Petrichor and glacial hush evolve from atmosphere to tactical elements—the former triggering memory, the latter modulating epiphany. Spatial choreography remains precise (forecourt center → sanctuary edge → woods exit), with stones absorbing sound to heighten crystal whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight barge canal functions effectively as micro-setting: decaying barges, humid air, and broken windows create a tactile, liminal space that mirrors submerged truths. The sundial and journal are not just props but environmental extensions that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “dust motes dancing in the last rays”), avoiding tourist cataloguing. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices—it enables discovery without imposing meaningful obstacles, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The golden dock under snow and fog functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: silence, cold, and muffled sound enforce the required patience and attunement. The fulgurite glass and rope knots are tactile anchors that evolve from objects to vessels of meaning. Weather actively shapes behavior—thickening fog deepens hush, snow blankets distraction—and the final image of fog parting charges the closure with earned revelation. Every detail filters through the collector’s philosophical attention without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shadowed autumn garden functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every beat: its lonesome splendor mirrors the traveler’s internal state while enabling his ritual. Sensory details (earth, decay, vanished blooms) are filtered through his professional and emotional priorities, never generic. The crimson thread and fountain pen are tactile tools that shape action—thread as memory conduit, pen as instrument of reckoning. Crucially, the setting culminates in the final image: stars over the garden frame his self-obituary, making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The suspended palace is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its sway, quaking, and mechanical structure directly mirror and amplify Elorian’s emotional and thematic arc. The stalactite anchors literalize entrapment versus aspiration (“dreaming of flight”), while crystalline corridors and extinct floral scents charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—metal gaining “luster of living tissue,” air filling with lost scents—and evolves causally with the egg’s pulse. The environment constrains no tactical choice, but it deeply charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate via resonant reconfiguration of space itself.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint: black sand nourishes grafts, obsidian lagoon mirrors thematic transformation, and cloud migration dictates fire behavior. Every environmental detail filters through Maya’s professional and personal priorities (e.g., noticing kelp-drift peace only post-crisis). The volcanic beach’s black sand directly enables her botanical method, making place inseparable from character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Elara’s quest: dry basins hold breadcrumbs, silence rebels, buildings “remember.” The setting constrains choice (only starlight reveals the key) and charges the final image (water reflecting stars). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elara sees moss arrows and hears lone birds because her imagination makes them visible. The fountains’ return is both physical consequence and thematic apotheosis.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nebula garden functions as a charged micro-setting: its colors deepen in response to the sentimentalist’s presence, petals drift as dying-star fragments, and it anchors the departure/return structure. The calculating machine gear acts as a tactile object-as-setting that constrains choice (must carry history) and charges the final image (spinning resumes post-mission). Sensory detail is vivid yet purposeful, filtered through cosmic perception without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ancient greenhouse functions as micro-setting: its glass panes rattle with thunder yet hold calm, mirroring Elias’s inner state. The woven ribbon and monarchs are tactile extensions of environment that directly constrain choice—Elias uses the ribbon to measure, mark paths, and translate butterfly patterns into stone. Dusk light evolves across scenes, charging the final image where the completed monument is “bathed in the same dusk light.” Every sensory detail serves theme, mood, or action without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, pendulum bob, and rake handle form a micro-setting triad that constrains and charges key choices. Obsidian reflects turmoil and later communal unity; the bob’s weight harmonizes with the handle’s grain, guiding Alaric’s epiphany. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., heat bleeding into wood), avoiding white-room syndrome. However, the ridge itself doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond mood mirroring.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt silo isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes the work: its sound-absorbing walls create the “velveteen gloom” necessary for decoding echoes, and its construction from cemetery discards mirrors Elias’s philosophy. The sovereign case, tapestry, and chess clock are micro-settings that constrain and enable action. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over sight, aligning with the task of “hearing” threads. The final image of dawn outside contrasts the silo’s gloom, charging Elias’s return to duty with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian spire isn’t backdrop—it amplifies Elara’s abilities and frames the entire scene. The frozen lake’s cracking ice validates her model and pressures action. The kingfisher quill functions as micro-setting: its shimmer prefigures illumination, and its use charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (iridescent blues, cold air) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial glow form a micro-setting that constrains choice (hiding spot enables broadcast) and charges the final image (dust dancing in moonlight). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: the copyist notices ink stains, dial luminescence, and thistled calm because they reflect her covert labor. The alcove’s isolation directly enables her subversion—without it, no broadcast. Weather (mist) evolves causally, swirling in response to her voice, deepening atmosphere without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vanishing point gallery functions as a potent micro-setting: its illusion-based ethos directly enables and pressures Elena’s art. The rocking chair, porcelain mask, and charcoal ash are not just described but handled, constraining choices—e.g., powdering highlights cracks, making brokenness visible. Light and shadow evolve purposefully, culminating in elongated shadows that “stretch toward a horizon that never came closer,” charging the final image. Every sensory detail serves theme and character without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken city isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint. Chest-deep waters shift overnight, demanding navigation skill; silt preserves yet obscures; the sewer sanctuary houses Milo’s rebellion. The chronometer cog functions as micro-setting: its brass teeth and patina embody the tension between decay and precision. Sensory detail (murky water, lantern glint, dripping pipes) is selective and POV-filtered. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: below, “the true chronometer of human knowledge continued its silent turning.”

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    The velvet library functions as a potent micro-setting, its autumn-to-winter atmosphere mirroring Eleanor’s emotional arc and constraining her reflective solitude. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—crunching leaves, golden light, aged rosette—filtered through Eleanor’s professional bias. The setting charges the final image: the unchanged yet “forever different” library embodies Earned Stasis. However, spatial choreography of the choir remains abstract, limiting full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted greenhouse functions as micro-setting: its decay contrasts with the seed’s potential and directly shapes Elias’s purpose (“ruins” make his rebellion clearer). Sensory details (jasmine, rust, dust motes) are selective and POV-filtered. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood—it enables but doesn’t pressure tactics. Still, it charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lightning collection tower isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its conductors, transformer room, and vertical gardens shape every tactical choice. “Nectar dusk” evolves from atmospheric cue to tonal anchor, deepening into twilight as tension rises. The charred panel visually embodies the story’s central rupture. All sensory detail serves pressure or perception—no museum-tour excess—and spatial choreography remains precise across ascents.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “quiet bay in spring” is not backdrop but active micro-setting: dew-kissed streets, predawn light, receding tide—all shape Aria’s movements and perception. The lighthouse cottage pulses with memory, and the orris shard’s stillness contrasts ambient sound, making silence tactile. Crucially, setting charges the final image: as dawn breaks, every house breathes deeper, proving the theme through environment. One point lost only because the bay itself doesn’t constrain choice beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater garden functions as a dynamic micro-setting: corals pulse with memory, ruins frame spectral echoes, and currents mirror cognitive flow. Every detail constrains or charges—foxglove shadows stain revelations, fish movements echo knowledge complexity, silt preserves both city and insight. The ampoule’s iridescence evolves with each turn, culminating in its expansion as environmental catalyst. Final image ties setting to theme: ruins animate only when nuance is embraced.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The infinite staircase functions as both setting and micro-setting: its symmetry, void-center, and physics-defying structure directly constrain Elias’s tactics (climbing, placing the die at the calculated weak point). The dice—especially the chipped one—act as recurring tactile anchors that evolve from regret symbols to rupture tools. Final image (dice tumbling on felt) charges closure by contrasting stone steps with finite possibility. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it supplies oxygen-giving plants, filtered saffron light, and isolation essential to her work. The moonstone-tipped brush and smog-choked city below create tactile, sensory contrast that charges the final mural. Every detail (jasmine scent, stained glass, waxing moon) serves atmosphere and theme. Only misses 9+ because the setting enables rather than actively constrains a pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the grotto’s bioluminescent fungi, damp walls, and hollowed baker’s space directly shape ritual and resistance. The opera glass lens and dough act as micro-settings that charge the climax—the emerald focus reveals “dormant life force,” enabling the thaw. Sensory detail (rosewater dread, trodden earth) filters through POV bias, avoiding tourist cataloging. The waterfall isn’t backdrop but causal boundary enforcing displacement.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hunger stone, yoyo, lighthouse beam, and receding tide form a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges choices: the tide dictates timing, the stone houses the mechanism, the lighthouse beam reacts to the radiance. Sensory details are selective (“cold water,” “ethereal light”) and filtered through Esme’s clockmaker precision. The environment culminates in the final image where the lighthouse transforms into a “bridge,” fulfilling the 9+ gate by reweighting setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse functions as micro-setting: its mirrors constrain perception, its decay pressures choice, and its collapse charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—“sickly, beautiful light,” “heavy velvet”—filtered through the cursed POV. The opera cloak clasp and lingering luminance evolve causally with the environment. Deducted slightly because spatial choreography between mirror chamber and curtain lacks precise grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and conduit: roots transmit vibrations, driftwood shapes musical response, open seas enforce isolation. The xylophone mallet and fractal clouds are micro-settings that directly enable tactics. Sensory detail (mercury ocean, ethereal blue glow) serves perception under pressure, never stalls momentum. The final image—mallet hung on a crescent hook—charges closure with ritual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The turtle-shell city functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its spirals guide navigation, encode history, and physically crack open to reveal truth. The reed whistle, salt air, and sunwashed light are tactile, recurring details filtered through Kael’s professional perception. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the sealed gate, the living titans’ movement—and charges the final image as the turtle turns “following the ancient patterns only Kael could now read.” Environment and tool fuse into narrative engine.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-covered station is not just backdrop but a functional micro-setting: it hides carvings, initials, and the ledger, directly enabling discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Eleanor notices architectural matches, not ambient sounds). The ivy metaphor is integrated through action (“clawed at crumbling stone”) and culminates in the final line, where truth “flourishes beyond its walls.” Environment constrains and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: water depth dictates when he can work; foundation stones trap the box; drawbridge timing shapes his access. The antique inkwell and preservation cubes are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—chill water, hushed blaze of sunset—and filtered through the surveyor’s professional attention. Every environmental element serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater library setting is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (“dappled sunlight through water,” “waterproof chambers”) and filters perception through Elias’s professional bias. The antique ink stamp functions as micro-setting, constraining interpretation and charging the final image. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere—it enables discovery but never obstructs or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating isle, tea garden, and glass basilica are not backdrop but active micro-settings that constrain and charge the narrative. The basilica functions as both destination and emotional vault; the workshop’s gems and cranes are tools that embody memory. Sensory detail is selective—fluorescing gems casting dancing shadows, amber-gold lantern light—and filtered through the maker’s grief. Crucially, the setting directly charges the closure: the basilica’s paradoxical architecture mirrors his internal state and enables the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating observatory and ruined garden are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ozone, mutated vegetation, liquid light), filtered through Elias’s trauma. The geode functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and guiding action. However, the amphitheater’s description lacks tactile specificity—stone benches are “cracked but still recognizable,” a near-generic cue. The final image gains resonance from setting, but environment doesn’t actively shape tactics beyond providing coordinates.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient observatory at dusk functions as micro-setting: copper dome, crumbling parapet, and “brilliant dimness” directly enable and constrain Maya’s actions. The Nightingale drone and type foundry chip are tactile extensions of environment, handled with purpose. Sensory detail is selective (twilight blue/violet, hum of the chip) and filtered through Maya’s operator POV, avoiding tourist cataloging while charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore function as micro-settings that charge the closure: the terrace’s coldness mirrors emotional isolation, while the shore’s driftwood constrains Martin’s search and enables revelation. Sensory detail is selective (moonlight on wood, cool metal) and filtered through guilt. The watch hand qualifies as object-as-setting, directly shaping the final image. Just shy of 9+ due to slight overreliance on visual texture over tactile immersion in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-worn parapet functions effectively as micro-setting: wind, mist, and crashing waves constrain movement and amplify tension, while moonlight pools precisely where Lyra choreographs the exchange. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Lyra notices the stone’s roughness through Rennett’s voice, the mist through its ghost-like swirl. The setting charges the closure: moonlight on the brass pull becomes the focal point of reconciliation. However, the parapet remains largely atmospheric; it doesn’t actively foreclose options or supply critical resources beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal kayak launch, mist, salt air, and utility poles form a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—Elena navigates by terrestrial markers because she no longer trusts celestial ones. The compass and kayak are tactile extensions of her psyche. Weather mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. The environment constrains choice (no open ocean navigation) and charges the final image: paddling forward amid diminished means.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its pulsing light mirrors the baseball’s warmth and the cyclical nature of the mission. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal elements; tunnels, chamber, and lake form a legible underground geography. Sensory detail is selective (glow, hum, warmth) and filtered through POV urgency. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choice—the tunnels are chosen via symbol match, not environmental pressure—preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fairy-tale orchard under eternal moonlight isn’t backdrop—it actively supplies resources (moon-pepper, soil for roots) and constrains tactics (circle must be drawn there). Sensory specificity (whispering cinnamon that sings, blossoms blooming brighter at the brother’s name) filters through Eliora’s urgency. Final image—morning light on a changed but recognizable beast whisperer—charges the setting with earned resonance. Only misses 9+ because the orchard’s rules aren’t tested beyond facilitation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The midnight glade above clouds functions as a charged micro-setting: its ethereal mist and dissolving boundaries directly pressure the protagonist’s perception and ritual. The dolls’ tea set saucer—a recurring object-as-setting—constrains choice (must trace hands to unlock memory) and charges the final image (gold-repaired crack held by daughter). Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and POV-filtered (e.g., onyx ink “drink[ing] moonlight”).

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The recycled spaceship functions as a potent micro-setting: its salvaged bulkheads echo destruction/rebirth and directly supply the meditation chamber where the rift opens. Kwan yin’s tear and the photographs constrain choice—the shimmer pattern dictates stitching. Body (gravitationally lighter when happy) charges the final image as Eli floats upward. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though tactile grounding occasionally yields to lyric abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    The black sand beach and volcano aren’t backdrop but micro-setting: sand’s “forged in fire yet cool” texture mirrors Ian’s arc, and the volcano’s rumble pressures his realization.

No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout corridors and courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless physics constrain choice: bare feet grip vanished friction, stones are sourced from tidal pools, and the aurora provides “borrowed dawn” light essential to the ritual. These details charge the final image—the star dust sphere blending with aurora—as the environment actively enables revelation. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *foreclose* options or impose tactical limits beyond mood; it facilitates rather than pressures. Still, the micro-setting (painted stones, vial) functions as charged tools that shape the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stormlit observatory above clouds functions as a charged micro-setting that constrains and enables: isolation permits uncensored thought, altitude symbolizes moral clarity, and the telescope becomes a tool of rebellion. Weather actively shapes perception—lightning reveals verses, thunder mimics censors—and the parted clouds at climax visually affirm thematic hope. Every sensory detail (red timer digits, storm-kissed wonder, scratching pen) serves atmosphere and character, never stalling momentum. The setting is inseparable from the final image and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints. Sunlight fractures through the crystalline roof to enable decoding; the brook’s “dignified chaos” sharpens perception; the incomplete sundial demands interpretation. These elements charge the final image: sunlight “turning questions into destinations.” Every sensory detail filters through Aris’s philosopher-duelist POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting directly enables the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted library functions as both setting and micro-setting: its open roof admits moonlight that guides labor, its mangled metal shapes movement, and its decaying shelves demand physical negotiation. Every sensory detail—smell of mildew, grit of rust, whisper of pages—is filtered through the poet’s tactile reverence. Crucially, the environment constrains choice (working at night to avoid detection) and charges the final image: stars through broken ceiling mirroring luminous fracture in psyche and society. The coffee tin and seeds tie nature to knowledge, making setting inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal arbor isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: branches dip with evening tide, compressing time; the station’s architecture forces descent into the archive; flickering compasses make navigation perilous, justifying memorized paths. The broken clock functions as micro-setting, its glow and spin directly enabling the climax. Sensory detail (crimson horizon, ivory keys, temperature-controlled vault) filters through the pianist’s professional and emotional priorities. The environment charges the final image: returning to the piano becomes a bridge between temporal states, not mere resumption.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ridge, orchids, and waterfall are sensory-rich and purposefully filtered through Elara’s attuned perception. The knowledge fruit seed functions as micro-setting, constraining action (guiding her steps) and charging the final image (its glow awakening memory). However, the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options—it enables rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The breezy islet after rain functions as micro-setting: petrichor, salt air, dew-prisms, and spatial choreography (windowsill, glass case, lace) constrain ritual actions. The antique lace and compass are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices—it atmospherically supports but doesn’t foreclose options. Vivid sensory hierarchy (olfactory → visual → tactile) aligns with calm introspection, avoiding white-room syndrome.
