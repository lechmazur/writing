  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    The orchard planet and floating arches are vivid and recur to charge the final image. World logic is consistent and details serve intent (falling stones as both threat and resource). The environment influences stakes and materials but only lightly constrains on‑page choices. Strong atmosphere, short of fully determinant.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The repair bay is vivid and functionally dynamic: its alternate histories and the sudden appearance of the door make setting an active pressure. Detail selection (dust motes, tools mid‑project) works through POV bias, and the door’s emergence charges the final image. The shard as micro‑setting/tool constrains choices (heat prevents red shard; power drain). A few familiar visuals (“dust motes”) appear, but specificity predominates and serves action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse and lantern room are tactile and lived-in: salt, oil, “pause between thunderclaps,” spiral stairs, loose floorboard. Setting drives choices (lamp failure prompts the search; physical space hides the letters and stones) and charges the final image. Objects (sea glass, stones, lens) function as micro‑settings that constrain action and meaning. Vivid without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The emerald lighthouse, aurora-fed wick, and optical mechanics are vivid and POV-filtered, and the environment/tool directly shapes tactics (mirrors, lenses, beam path). The setting charges the final image and is not mere postcard. Sensory specificity prioritizes functional detail over excess ornament. Not quite 9+ because constraint-driven cost from setting is implied more than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock tea house, rope ladder, prisms, and valley mist create a vivid, idiosyncratic world filtered through a dye master’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The predawn bay, “daydreaming” streetlights, and lighthouse cottage are vividly filtered through Aria’s sensibility. The shard, driftwood, and key function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image and guide action. Details are selective and purposeful, with the environment cohering to tone and ritual. World rules (quiet magic) stay consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater garden is vividly evoked (bioluminescent corals, darting fish) and the ampoule’s foxglove stain charges images. While the environment rarely constrains choice, it meaningfully colors the revelation and final peace. Details are selective and purposeful, integrated into action. The world’s rules remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The infinite staircase is vividly sketched and functionally constraining, its physics informing Elias’s tactics (searching for an anomaly) and the rupture. The dice operate as micro-setting objects, charging the final image. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual; still, the environment is coherent and purposeful. Minor opportunities for tactile or auditory deepening remain.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog, stained glass “saffron quiet,” jasmine scent, and moonstone brush create a coherent, lived micro‑world filtered through her artist‑scholar priorities. The environment enables and charges action (moonlight activating daydreams; greenhouse sanctuary) and returns in the final image. Multisensory detail is purposeful without overstuffing. While the setting rarely constrains choice, it credibly shapes tempo and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto city, bioluminescent fungi, and waterfall ecology are vivid and purposeful; the lens functions as a charged tool that constrains tactics and inflects the final image. Sensory detail is selective and bias-filtered by a “cultured” eye. World rules (bees as cultural conduit) are taught via action, not dumped. Minor constraint: the waterfall’s physical pressures don’t directly force a choice in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rocky shore, hunger stone, and lighthouse are tactile and situational, with the tide constraining tactics and the lighthouse beam charging the climax. Details are integrated through action (tools, wet trousers, the yoyo’s wear). Atmosphere complements theme without museum‑tour excess. Strong object‑as‑setting work via the stone and yoyo elevates the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned funhouse, crooked mirrors, and the opera cloak/clasp create a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the internal ordeal. Spatial anchors and object states evolve (unsnapping, dissolving), and the environment collapses at closure to charge the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful, if largely visual; the carnival’s pressure is thematic more than tactical. Not quite constraining enough to push into 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating orchard and driftwood circle are vivid and functional: roots conduct vibrations, wood becomes instrument, weather pressures tactics. Sensory specificity (“ocean into mercury,” “blue hour”) is integrated with action rather than decorative. The mallet and hook image charge the final tableau. Consistency of world logic holds without exposition drag.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and functional: spirals as maps, a living shell that cracks to reveal the chamber, a turtle turning in the final image. Details arise through action (pattern tracing, vibration, descent) rather than static catalog. The environment constrains choices and charges the ending with the slow turn and the whistle reprise. A touch more tactile hazard inside the chamber would heighten immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station is vividly rendered and filtered through a historian’s eye; ivy, arches, and carvings aren’t mere décor but investigative cues.

Strong specificity without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The submerged pavilion and drawbridge create palpable constraints (solitude after sundown; cold, current, and stone forcing tactical choices). Objects—inkwell, metal box, preservation cubes—are integrated and charge the final image (“click” closure). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, if occasionally leaning lush. World rules are consistent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library is vivid and functionally integrated: emergency lighting, waterproof chambers, and underwater tunnels shape mood and method. The blackout concretely alters tactics (no digital cross‑ref), and the stamp’s imagery and shadow‑symbols charge the final image. Detail selection generally tracks the POV’s occupational filter. A touch more tactile constraint (navigation hazards, risk) could have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating isle, tea garden, and glass basilica are vivid and distinctive, filtered through the artisan’s eye. The basilica functions as a charged space that shapes the ending image and gives the lantern’s ascent consequence. Tools (gems, paper) are tactile and profession-coded. While richly rendered, constraint is soft rather than forcing a specific tactic, keeping it just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid, selective anchoring—the floating observatory, ruined garden with mutated growth, collapsed amphitheater—filters through his purpose. The geode functions as a micro‑setting/object shaping choices and the final image. World rules (invisible currents, shields cooling) are consistent enough for this length. Some details feel generic at moments, but the amphitheater reservoir usefully localizes the abstract premise.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, its copper dome, and the “brilliant dimness” are vivid and integrated with action; the mechanism’s pulses constrain tactics and charge the final image. The Nightingale and chip function as micro‑settings/tools that shape choices. Sensory selection matches urgency without tourist cataloging. World rules feel consistent within the piece’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shore, driftwood carvings, and cobalt terrace provide a vivid, tactile world filtered through Martin’s obsessions. The environment and recurring object (watch hand/carvings) charge the final image rather than serve as postcard detail. Professional eye shaping what he notices (sanding patterns, signatures) grounds specificity. Weather and light subtly track mood without cliché overload.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet, wind, mist, and moonlight are vivid and functionally used—moonlight pools to charge the final image with the drawer pull. Sensory details track with urgency and mood, filtered through Lyra’s professional lens (timing, neutrality). The setting constrains tactics (stillness, measured approach). A touch more physical constraint (e.g., peril of the ledge) could further intensify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal launch, approaching storm, dolphins, and utility poles are purposeful and filtered through Elena’s navigator bias. The astronomical compass operates as micro‑setting/tool that charges the final image. Sensory balance favors visual/atmospheric with enough tactility to feel lived‑in. A touch more constraint from weather or water could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bioluminescent lake and tunnel chamber are vivid and integrated, with the symbols constraining the tunnel choice. The baseball functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image and choice. Sensory detail is purposeful, even if a touch ornamental at times. The environment bookends the piece and subtly frames the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard and permanent moonlight are vivid and purpose-driven; they enable and constrain the ritual (rooting, drinking moonlight, the zenith’s timing). The spices and environment integrate with action, not just postcard description. Sensory detail is specific (star anise, moon-pepper, whispering cinnamon) and filtered through the POV. The setting charges the final cadence as dawn returns her to herself.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The midnight glade above clouds is vivid and functional: moonlight‑drinking onyx ink, wind that scatters the cards, and dissolution of the glade shape action and cadence. Objects-as-setting (saucer, cards) are integrated and charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t hard‑constraint tactics beyond the ritual, it consistently mirrors and pressures the moment. Economy of detail serves tone and intent.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recycled spaceship is more than backdrop: it’s sanctuary/lab, tones the piece with elegiac debris-history, and its dissolution charges the final image. Micro-objects (Kwan yin’s tear, the photographs with salt-maps) function as setting constraints by guiding tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, if skewed to the visual/lyric. World rules feel consistent within the story’s metaphoric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The black sand, volcanic rumble, and celestial alignment infuse the atmosphere and charge the final image. The environment meaningfully colors choices (the detour along the beach; the sky’s timing dictating the release), even if it rarely constrains movement. The lightning bugs function as a micro-setting object that carries the scene’s charge into the ending. Vivid, selective, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The luminous fort, bioluminescent walls, and half‑painted sundial are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elias’s professional eye. The blackout and coded sundial constrain tactics and charge the final image. Object‑as‑setting (bronze quill holder) also functions well. Minor overglow in diction occasionally edges toward overt symbolism but remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bluff, aurora, tidal pools, and frictionless rule are vivid and purposeful; the dust’s behavior and the stone placement are charged by the world’s physics.

Occasional abstract phrasing keeps it from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stormlit observatory, telescope, and above‑cloud perch are vivid and purposeful, shaping mood and opportunity (privacy, vantage, storm electricity). The timer, deck, and lightning charge the final image and the thematic stakes. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered, avoiding tourist listing. Minor symbolism edges up to overt at times but stays effective.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vivid and POV-filtered, with tactile use of object-as-setting (sundial) to enable the decode. Light and water textures mirror the “dignified chaos” tone without feeling like a tourist catalog. While the environment rarely constrains choice, the sundial–card interaction materially shapes action and the final image reprises the atrium’s light. Strong atmosphere with purposeful specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and functional: the rusted, open‑roof library shapes tactics (open sky for seeds, ruin necessitating rebuild) and charges the last image. Concrete, selective details (“luminous fracture,” moonlight through a missing ceiling) are filtered through the poet’s priorities. Rules feel consistent and lived‑in. One explicit constraint‑driven choice (e.g., weather forcing adaptation) would push this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arbor, cloud station, and archive are vividly particular and integrated with action—compasses fail, branches dip, horizon invites night. The broken clock and the projector function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. World rules (film-reel interstices) are introduced through purposeful action, not dumping. Atmosphere supports theme without museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge, orchids, waterfall cave, and storm build a vivid, tactile world filtered through Elara’s vocation. Setting shapes action (hidden cave behind water, moss‑covered stone circles) and the monsoon charges the final image. Sensory balance is strong though a few lines verge on postcard lushness. The recurring object (seed) integrates with place to direct movement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly specific across senses (petrichor, salt, breeze, dew prisms) and filtered through his ritual mindset. The antique lace and compass function as micro-setting that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Environmental consistency supports tone and action without museum‑tour excess. It stops just short of 9‑band only because the broader islet pressures choice less than the objects.

Crucially, the environment is not merely decorative; the starlight through the skylight becomes a functional tool enabling the decryption of the cast. This direct interaction, where the setting constrains her hiding and then enables her escape plan, is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The "marbled hush" is not just description but an active presence.

The environment is inseparable from the story's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is masterfully integrated, with elements like the "magnetic nexus at twilight" and the "hush of beating wings at rest" serving as essential constraints and plot devices rather than mere backdrop. This direct impact on choice and action is exemplary. However, the score is capped by repetitive phrasing in the descriptions which, while part of the setting, are a prose-level flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most powerful element, rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail. The flooded opera house is not mere backdrop; the water creates the musical code on the program, and the miraculously preserved piano provides the means of resolution.

    The radar dome’s concrete hush and indigo twilight texture the mood, but it never constrains a choice. Bar staging is vivid yet generic. Campfire stick is handled twice, gaining new stories, yet its weight is more symbol than lever. Micro-setting (worktable, stage corner) is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s floating moss, orchids, and cloudlight are filtered through Aris’s selective attention; the moth wing and knotted threads function as micro-settings that constrain the final gesture. Sensory economy is strong—mist, shimmer, dusk—each detail earns its place. The environment subtly guides the ritual; no static cataloguing. One minor spatial vagueness: “ancient stone marker hidden among the ferns” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound sanctum is more than backdrop; its cold literally preserves the names and forces her choice to remain. Aurora, rope-light channels, and frozen font converge in the final image, constraining action and charging closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    Bunker and storm frame mood beautifully, but the vine-filtered sunlight only decorates the final beat without altering tactics; it satisfies specificity but stops short of constraining the closing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Observatory-palace, clay shards, and candlelit tile anchor space; the tile itself constrains the final choice. Sensory detail is selective, but “dusky harmony” edges toward atmospheric cliché.

Spatial choreography tracked cleanly up spiral rails; no floating props or impossible positions. Specificity serves beat-by-beat pressure, not décor.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Twilight violet, frost crystals, mechanical birds—details are selective and filtered through Elias’s urgency. The orchard’s oppressive gloom and the labyrinth’s stone corridors constrain movement and mood. The nut’s inner light and the compass-device serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ravine’s braided channels, foam eddies, and chrysalis are selective, sensory, and repeatedly filter through Elara’s polymer gaze; the river’s pattern literally constrains her insight and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass orchard library is vivid, selective, and purposeful; every detail (transparent branches, bottled moonlight) constrains the vendor’s ritual choices. The floating cloud-sea and crystalline fruits charge the final image of the door appearing in empty air. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static repetition. Environment directly shapes the incising action and the earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Desert-rain textures and coral-ice architecture are selective and POV-filtered; the damp sand and mirrored pool constrain movement and perception. Yet the fortress interior remains a white-room sketch—no tactile props beyond knives and bowls—so the micro-setting never fully weaponizes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    The clock tower is vividly sketched and returns in the final image, but it never physically constrains Elena’s choices; it serves as scenic backdrop rather than active pressure. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, yet the spatial choreography inside the library meetings remains vague. Micro-setting (the polished weight) does reappear, but its tactile influence on action is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moon-drenched circuitry on canyon rock supplies both glamour and functional pressure—mirror geometry dictates sightlines, silver glare dictates mood—while the fractured reflection that charges the final beat is specific to this moonscape and cannot be ported elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Serpentine grotto’s mist and clandestine runes constrain movement and time, anchoring spatial choreography. The rainwater chamber and moonlit aperture function as micro-settings that gate entry; the grotto’s curved walls narrow options as gravity reasserts. Sensory detail is selective and urgent, but the final image could more sharply charge the prism pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The siskin alder grove is not decorative; its fog, alder roots, and stress cracks become the very conduit that narrows Elara’s options. The micro-setting of the half-alder-engulfed sculpture enforces spatial pressure and tactile access, shaping how she kneels and strums. The porcelain insulator literally “charges” the final image by channeling vibrations into the wood-skin-circuit. No cliché seasonals; every sensory detail is filtered through her craftsman’s bias, constraining movement and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    The magnetic nexus is rendered with tactile crackle and visual shimmer; the worry stone’s dent becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Early orientation is swift; twilight’s charge intensifies choices. The environment is not merely backdrop but active pressure that reconfigures Elias’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    The starlit workshop is tactile—crystals glint, shadows shift—yet it never physically constrains choice; it’s backdrop rather than obstacle. Micro-setting (diary, tuning forks) carries more weight, guiding her gestures. One step short of the 9+ gate that demands environment alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    The treetop village is evoked through rope bridges, mists, and platform choreography that constrain movement. The corpse-flower’s blue filaments become a micro-setting that charges the final image. A few phrases (“wildflower hush of dawn”) risk prettiness but stay within POV.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Floating arches, reversed rivers, and the First Arch’s crystals are vividly tactile, supply navigational constraint, and supply the visual charge in the closure image. Landscape consistently affects tactics; “latticed shadows,” “aerial roads,” and echo-shimmer are sensory and purposeful rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The container labyrinth is vividly sketched—metal canyons, wind corridors, distorted air—each detail filtered through Elena’s investigative priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting actively narrows movement and channels observation. However, the environment never forces a final tactical shift or charges the closing image; it remains backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ice cavern’s crystalline acoustics behave like resonant tools—aurora light filters sculpt the strike pattern—directly steering tactics; cap raises slightly because removal would force new physics for the sound-light fusion. Spatial choreography tracks; environmental pressure tightens her reach and strike placement.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thunder-echo range is vivid and selective; the “avalanchingly quiet” hush modulates from menace to benediction. The driftwood spiral and canyon walls constrain Eldrin’s ritual movements, charging the final image of the silent canyon within him.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    The topaz-lit workshop, halo fragment, and star-pricked skylight are not mere backdrop; the fragment’s pulsing light literally enables the empathy transfer and reappears in the final beat, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean—Thomas crosses to the fragment, staggers back—anchoring the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and village valley are filtered through Ayla’s urgency; the pendant’s shimmer against the lights and shoots through snow constrain her path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Quartz arbor and mist are tactile, refracting light and sound; the frost on the car window becomes a dynamic interface that literally channels memory. Setting constrains action—only this misted prism arbor allows the communion—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bamboo forest and forgotten orchard are evoked with sensory precision (“sunlight filtered green-gold through ancient stalks”) and function as both physical and metaphysical space. The loom and amber bead serve as micro-settings that constrain choice. However, the orchard itself is more backdrop than active pressure; only the bamboo shoot at the climax directly shapes the final act, capping the score just below excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Floating rock arches and orchard planet are not backdrop; the falling stones supply raw material and the repaired arches glow with inner azure, charging the closure. Sensory selection is POV-tilted: Orion notices “humming” silk and “azure dusk” because they matter to craft. Spatial anchors are immediate; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    The repair bay is vividly anchored—“dust motes danced in shafts of afternoon light”—and the green glass shard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when it heats to prevent contact with the red shard. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though occasional phrases (“forgotten histories and secrets”) edge toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lantern room’s salt-oil scent and vibrating floorboard anchor every discovery; the sea-glass and stone stack function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elias’s final gesture. Fog, darkness, and beam rotation are selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern, and aurora-charged wick are tactile, selective, and constrain every beat; beam angles must be physically set. Nebulas and twin comets serve atmospheric scale without clutter. Spatial choreography is clean—mirrors, lenses, water paths track logically. Setting subtly guides choice: the hidden channel exists only through the lighthouse’s engineered light.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock tea house, prisms, and valley mist are not mere postcard backdrops; the swaying rope ladder and shifting light physically constrain Kaelen’s experiments and shape the final image of guests ascending. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, its color shifts mirroring the story’s iridescent caution and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stormlit tower, moon-slatted windows and the scarred oak floorboard are not backdrop but constraining agents: their acoustics and silvery beams activate the sextant and heal his hands. Details are filtered through Samuel’s intimate knowledge; only a brief “profound silence” nicks toward cliché. Micro-settings (sound of the pin amplified by corridor design) directly shape the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Greenhouse night, phosphorescent flora, and starlight saplings are vivid and selective; the mica window returns at the end as reflective surface for the first sunrise, charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear early and track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library’s “enlarged tranquility” is not mere backdrop; it constrains Eleanor’s tactic of “staying while leaving” and mirrors her final calm. Sensory detail is selective (clock chime, book spines) and filtered through her reclusive gaze. Micro-setting (the crumpled invitation as bookmark) charges the final image. Could use one more tactile cue at climax to hit 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tea house, courtyard herbs, and rain on tin roof are selective, sensory, and filter through Eliza’s caretaker bias. The guerrilla garden constrains her identity and supplies the final herbal tea, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library is vivid and selective—“quartz hush,” “ice-encrusted windows”—and the lantern slide functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean; the sampler’s brass-and-crystal presence anchors the scene without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rotting-pier market is sketched with selective sensory cues (creaking wood, hush, rum barrels) that guide movement and concealment. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the watch fob doubles as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but environment never actively thwarts her.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lavender bluff, aurora, humming roots, and metal-tongue ozone create specific immediate ground; final reprise of lavender flowers widening beneath fused bodies ties environment to transformation. Setting doesn’t constrain a later tactic, so capped at 7.7.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal cave is not backdrop but crucible: moonstone columns form the easel, amethyst glow reveals hidden blues in the charcoal, and the cave’s silence modulates to witness rebirth. Spatial choreography is tight—descent, north wall, loose panel—anchoring every move. Environment constrains and enables the decisive act, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and failing filtration press against every beat; the zinc plate’s warmth and the warped floorboard ground us in tactile specificity. Environment constrains choice—only candor can open safe passages—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering bluff and bell tower are tactile, wind-borne, and light-soaked; the iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains every tuning decision. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the final image of the sculpture glistening atop the bluff recharges the opening vista.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting of shimmering dome, bio-luminescent wilting roses and shifting shadows gives tactile urgency that forces miniaturisation; the empty box glowing in epilogue serves as charged object re-weighting the cycle, satisfying high-band constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Vibrant courtyard at dawn” is sketched with selective sensory detail; the locked mailbox is concrete. Neither object constrains a pivotal choice, but the courtyard’s communal space charges the final gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken lab’s “coral-encrusted corners” and “dripping pipes” are tactile and selective; the dice and journals function as micro-settings that constrain her dance choices. Final image of “filtered sunlight” recharges the submerged gloom, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The salt-crystal chamber, dock lanterns, and buried crystal function as micro-settings that constrain action: the chamber amplifies gravity, the lanterns mark her ritual return, the crystal’s warmth/cold cycle limits how she can interact with memories. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“gleaming silence,” “frozen light”). The whale carcass itself remains slightly abstract, but the crystal’s facets supply the tactile anchor that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    The brook, moonlight, and paper wing are rendered with selective sensory detail that filters through the summoner’s ritual focus. The wing’s translucence and the water’s breathing rhythm constrain pacing and mirror internal state. While the larger cosmos is invoked, the micro-setting—the circle of stones, the folded paper—does the real work of guiding choice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rooftop garden and meteor shower function as micro-setting that alters perception and enables the climactic interrogation; earlier spaces (cluttered study, historic façades) are sketched with selective sensory detail that filters through Clara’s POV.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Velvet garden, moss, and twilight are vivid yet selective; the resonance structures act as micro-setting that constrains her posture and ritual. Final image of blooms bowing reweights the space, but the garden itself never threatens or limits her physically, keeping it just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marble sanctuary under shifting aurora is sketched with selective sensory strokes—dripping stalactites, pearl twilight—that mirror Elias’s stasis. The setting constrains choice: isolation enables reflection, the hidden compartment is revealed through tactile interaction with the wall. Aurora’s color shift cues emotional cadence, though the wider kingdom geography remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Serpentine nexus under starlight” and the whispering seashell half function as micro-setting that constrains tactics: the shell’s glow cues the final choice. Sensory selection is biased to the singer’s perception, though some phrasing drifts toward the generic (“webs of intrigue”).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Frigid water, coral beams, and glacier shrine are sharply evoked and filter through Elara’s professional gaze. The snow globe’s warmth against ocean chill is a tactile pivot that later charges the altar scene, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    River cabin, mossy parapet, and hemp nets are vivid and selective; the moonlit hexagonal net in the final image constrains the closing meditation. Spatial choreography is clean, though the moon-path mechanics remain lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard’s toxic glow and leaning trees are filtered through Maya’s investigative gaze, constraining her movements and guiding discovery. The diamond’s warmth against her palm in the final beat reweights the setting from threat to conduit, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stormlit observatory is rendered with tactile specificity—floatstone, ozone, cobalt glass casting cobweb light that Elias traces. The setting constrains every move: storms gate access, the portico amplifies signals, altitude enforces isolation. Final image reuses the portico’s “humming” to charge closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The feral loft’s filtered light and salt-tarnished music box are tactile and atmospheric; the loft itself, however, never constrains choice or reappears in the final image, capping the score below 9. Micro-settings (glass jars, senior-center table) do the constraining work instead.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vivid and tightly filtered through Elias’s sensory bias; the “crunch of frozen seaweed” and stone wall’s hum constrain pacing and choice. Final image of drifting intruder-boat reprises setting as proof of victory, anchoring earned calm.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly evoked and filter through the mapper’s precise attention. The lake-as-mirror and viaduct hum serve as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory economy is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Damp-earth smell, pooled water, and fluttering police tape anchor the tunnel; the lantern’s greenish patina constrains her next action (prying it open). Micro-setting (service alcove) directly shapes evidence collection and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    The antique shop’s ticking hush and stained-glass light constrain the decision moment; the heart itself serves as micro-setting. Selective sensory detail supports mood without clutter. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The brass-and-steam workshop, acid sea, and kaleidoscope are vivid, selective, and purposeful; the kaleidoscope’s mirrors constrain the transliteration action, and the acid sea’s fumes momentarily stiffen gears, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no orientation debt. Could edge higher if the workshop’s layout more directly shaped tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archive’s “digital necropolis” and “malevolent eyes” of warning glyphs are tactile and constrain access. The Stellaris patch as micro-object reappears with reweighted meaning, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Setting is lush: moonlit diamond-hard apple branches, groaning ice floes, beam sweeping in “ethereal brilliance.” These sensory particulars do more than set scene—the trees “shudder as if in recognition,” actively co-performing the ritual—but environment never materially constrains choice (e.g., no branch snaps, no cliff-edge positioning stakes). The lighthouse itself is backdrop scenery rather than apparatus Elena must navigate or manipulate during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marina’s cracking ice and windborne solace are not backdrop; they constrain movement and mirror Elena’s loosening grip on finality. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; no static postcard effect.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    Amber pavilion, drifting leaves, and vacant station create a vivid seasonal capsule; the burned letter’s tactile detail recurs to charge the final image. Environment guides mood more than choice—no spatial constraint alters tactics—so the 9+ gate is missed, yet specificity is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet are sensuously specific (“sand outside…held memories”), and the parapet’s subterranean motion directly enables the ritual; however, the environment does not physically constrain the walker’s choices—its role is facilitative rather than limiting.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lavender and factory are vivid and thematically coherent, but they serve as backdrop rather than constraint. The dove-gray map case is handled twice yet never alters tactics. Final image gains some charge from the setting’s decay/renewal duality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Garden and fog act as mutable geography that hides/reveals props (arch, tapes driftwood), directly constraining every placement and search vector. Condensation on the arch and tape hiss provide multisensory anchors without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lunar observatory is sketched with selective sensory economy—silence thick enough to touch, moonlight on the deck—while the clock itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial anchors are clear early; the environment subtly guides Elara’s decision to place the clock outside, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Radiant haven above the clouds” is evocative but functions as postcard backdrop; it doesn’t constrain choices. The cedar chest and lavender lotion, however, anchor sensory memory and return in the final scent, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clear; no weather or physics violations.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, and living star-map are rendered with tactile specificity; the telescope pointing at a noon sun in darkness crystallizes the world’s dislocation. Setting actively constrains the ritual geometry, but a few atmospheric phrases edge toward purple (“tasting of determination and old magic”).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The garden’s perpetual twilight and moonpetals constrain Eleanor’s ritual choices; the hedge maze literally funnels her to the center. Victorian bio-engineering details (upside-down blooms, firefly glow) are filtered through her skeptical botanist eye and charge the final image when walls reconfigure around Arthur’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Grotto, mist, and cliffside workshop are anchored early and constrain tactics—polishing must happen here, not anywhere. The serpentine walls pressure safe fireless illumination; sea-glass micro-objects charge the final light-projection.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is richly textured—rusting racks, vines through circuit boards, sunlight through broken ceiling—yet its pressure on choice is atmospheric rather than tactical. The moss-garden does constrain movement (glass underfoot) and supplies the final altar, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mist, ruins, and seashell are vividly rendered and filter through the novelist’s perceptual bias. Setting does not actively constrain choice, but the fragment’s glimmer in final light recharges earlier imagery, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The verdant arbor is tactile and atmospheric, filtering dawn light and housing the glowing vine; it constrains Elara’s workspace and later hosts the communal rite, but the final image doesn’t hinge on a specific environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The withered orchard, flash-paper shimmer, and frost-encased berries are vivid and selective. The crater’s stillness constrains sound and movement, charging the final glow. However, the setting never actively obstructs or enables the ritual; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its veins and angles literally calibrate the mechanism. Light on stone constrains every adjustment Elara makes, and the final swirl of reflections charges the closing image with earned wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bronze grotto’s metallic shimmer and shingled hush are selective, sensory, and constrain movement; the lamp’s orange glow and starlight patches physically guide orientation. The final threshold crossing recharges the grotto as both prison and portal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank are micro-settings that constrain choice: the light dictates where she sits, the grain dictates the cut. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—circus-tent rain, kettle hiss. Final image reuses skylight constellations to reconfigure meaning, meeting 9+ gate. One minor drift: “rust-hued peace” is more label than lived detail.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The kinetic lagoon’s mirrored stars and crystallized moon fruit are vivid, selective, and filtered through Cyrus’s scavenger gaze. Most crucial, the lagoon’s stillness after the halt literally enables the word-bridge; setting constrains tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Terminal’s dust, dormant transformers, and flickering lights are vivid and selective, filtered through Maya’s engineering gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Garden, thread, and notebook form a micro-setting triad that constrains choice: the thread's fragility limits memory access, the garden's decay mirrors the gardener's blindness, the notebook demands ink. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. Final image recharges the thread as compass, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The suspended palace and stalactites are evoked with tactile specificity; the egg’s glow and the softening stone constrain the climax, but the broader world rules remain lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Black sand, kelp-drift lagoon, and volcanic breeze ground emotion and constrain tactics without clutter. Descriptions remain focused through POV urgency; the lagoon mirrors stakes and recharges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    City of Forgotten Fountains is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (“dry fountain basins,” “stone throats”). The micro-setting of the central plaza fountain constrains the final discovery and is recharged when water returns, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    The nebula garden’s shifting colors and falling petals are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; they mirror the “troubling serenity” tone and guide the sentimentalist’s transit path. Spatial choreography holds across dimensions; the gear’s glow and petal drift anchor sensory continuity. Micro-setting (the gear as handled object) constrains the final choice by recording outcomes. One slip: “troubling serenity” is named rather than rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse dusk, granite dust, and migrating monarchs are vivid and selective; the bench and ribbon function as micro-settings that constrain Elias’s path. Final image of amber wings against glass recharges the opening dusk light, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower interior are filtered through Alaric’s precision mindset; details constrain choices (heat bleeding through the rake handle, sun at zenith dictating timing). Micro-setting of the rake handle functions as charged object. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment subtly mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt silo’s star-drinking walls and velveteen gloom are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elias’s absorption; the setting constrains sound and light, shaping his ritual focus, though it never directly threatens or limits his choices.

    Obsidian spire and frozen lake are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Elara’s perception; the spire’s conductive property constrains her ability and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true, but the lake’s cracks could be more causally tied to her next beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ember alcove and mist create tactile pressure; the radio dial’s glow serves as micro-setting anchor. Details are selective and filtered through POV. Environment guides choice—hidden hillside enables broadcast—but final image doesn’t hinge on setting itself. Sensory balance favors visual; other senses underused.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    The vanishing-point gallery and the rocking chair anchor all movement, literally shaping Elena's trajectory from creak to silence. The micro-setting of the porcelain shards under powder light creates spatial intimacy that finalizes the image. Only the gallery itself does not coerce a concrete choice, preventing the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sewer tunnels and submerged ruins are rendered with tactile specificity; the chronometer cog functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. A few generic “gleaming spires” phrases keep it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library and autumn light are vividly sketched and return as sanctuary, but they never constrain Eleanor’s choices or charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric yet ornamental; the rosette does more practical work than the room itself.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is rendered with selective sensory density—rusted scent, cracked glass, jasmine on the breeze—and its decay actively mirrors Elias’s necessary cuts. The seed’s planting spot becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate.
