  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon functions as micro-setting: frost patterns constrain the detective method, the fire ring provides charcoal for the furnace, and the enclosed space amplifies "drifting resonance." Sensory detail is selective and craft-filtered (frost as "lacework maps," soot-dark camp ring). The glass pane itself becomes setting-as-object, sealing evidence. Spatial choreography remains clear across the riverbed journey and schoolhouse reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and purposeful: frost flowers, seed vaults, sensor grids, and benches that transmit vibration all constrain the heat-mapping method and shape Orren's calibration work. The tuning forks function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography (center hall table, benches, vitrines) remains clear. Minor penalty: the conservatory's architecture could pressure a mid-scene choice more directly; it mostly supplies resources rather than obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater library is not postcard description—it constrains every choice. Kelp curtains must be cut; tables chained to the floor signal the librarians' foresight; aisles "rearranging" into impossible angles force Marek to "occupy the gap" between volumes, a body-level tactic that advances the plot. The brass receiver, plankton light, and wax-sealed books supply resources Marek uses to stabilize the lens. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal geometry: descent path, rotunda, stacks, alcoves are legibly staged. The final image—Marek surfacing, "the sea feels lighter"—charges the setting with thematic weight. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias: he notices catalog cards, ledger entries, coffin coordinates before ambient décor.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The terra-cotta arbor recurs as the site of meetings, the tin box, posted letters, and the daylight bell-ring, anchoring spatial continuity and charging the final image. Sensory detail—warm clay smell, wind pocket, chalk stars on doorways—is selective and filtered through urgency (midnight runs prioritize stealth, the officer's gaze weighs the bell). The arbor's elevation and visibility meaningfully constrain tactics: it invites inspection, forcing Amira to shift routes. Micro-setting (satchel, carts, doorways) supports goal-directed action across beats. No penalty for scope; occupational systems (food distribution, guard shifts) are sketched efficiently without breaking credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The viaduct's wisteria, fog, and iron ribs recur with purpose: petals fall at closure, charged by the breath-work. Kwan Yin's tear moves from tongue to camera pinhole, constraining the revelation (the rib-corridor vision). Fog modulates perception throughout, and the spatial choreography (parapet, walkway, rail) remains coherent. The micro-setting (camera box, tear, breath) functions as a constraint engine for the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The living bridge is tactile and rule-governed: "vines braided into arches that flexed…every leaf held a tremor," "bridge responded, thickening its tendrils into angled corridors." Hyperbolic geometry micro-setting constrains the protagonist's planting choices and enables the maze's multiplication effect. The halo fragment's "ringed shadow that did not match the lamplight" charges both middle investigation and the final circling gesture that tightens corridors. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (geometry, growth rings, hedge lean) without tourism. Spatial choreography stays coherent across entrance, center, and return.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The carnival prize center is not postcard—it supplies the piano, bench, keys, and bear that enable her tactics. The chain becomes a tool (handle-wrap), the arrow wedges pedals, the stuffed bear hides drums. Micro-setting (piano bench arrangement) constrains the vault decoding and charges the closure by transforming toys into resistance infrastructure. Sensory detail (grime, sunbleached plush, tin-and-hope smell) is selective and mood-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse with its ashen forge, shipwreck ring, apple trees on salt-tolerant roots, and aurora skylight is vividly particular and charges multiple beats: the forge breathes under aurora, Mara dives the wrecks with hydrophones, she fits the prototype beside apple trees, blossoms open "as if forgiving were just another growth." The forge and apple-cell motif both constrain her method (memory in metals, division as faith) and reweight the final image when she returns to melt brass into new housings. Spatial choreography remains clear across workshop, forge, and wreck-ring.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The emerald station's tiled arches and green fire effect anchor the opening; moonlight transforms the tiles to "dark as bottled sea" at closure. The jar of moonbeams functions as a recurring object but its physical properties (humming, flaring, casting script) do not meaningfully constrain Lio's choices—he simply sets it against the lock. Spatial choreography is coherent (platform three, florist's stall, the door), but sensory detail skews heavily visual with minimal embodied friction (temperature, sound underfoot, the weight of the jar). The flower arrangements exist as exposition rather than lived-in world texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned control room functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "curved consoles like ribs around an empty heart" anchors the space, and the transformation to "observatory" at closure reweights prior material. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"corridor tiles sighed with each drip," meltwater "in bright threads"—filtered through Mara's glassblower's eye. The kiln, salvaged fuel cells, and aluminum frame ground her work tactilely. The final image of monitors reflecting glass walls and stars constrains and charges the closure moment, qualifying for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Settings—studio mirrors, props vault, rusted library, soundstage—are vivid and purposeful. The library's "iron shelves bled orange dust," "moths skated through moonlight like shredded film" charge atmosphere without stalling momentum. Micro-setting qualifies: the boy's cast and charcoal rubbing constrain the decryption method, directly affecting tactics. Spatial choreography across four locations (studio, vault, library, soundstage) remains legible. The shell as recurring object charges the final image when its whisper fills the microphone. Minor: the "backlot" and "call sheets" anchor occupation, but the rusted catalog cards' production codes feel slightly decorative—used once without prior grounding in studio systems.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: "walls sweating salt and thunder," "ridge of shattered shells," wind-carved chapel with broken mosaics, and the pebble bowl all anchor the narrator's sensory filter. The storm and battlements constrain access and heighten urgency. The booklet's physical transformation under rain—gold leaf lifting, pages like "pale reefs beneath a tide"—charges the final image and the shift from star paths to spiral pattern. Micro-setting (body, bowl, ruined booklet) functions as environmental constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard supplies concrete constraints: blue ice, salt cart, glazed stones, and the fountain anchor spatial choreography across loops. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—J-17 notices "little clicks of crystals settling" and "frost from the case latch," grounding its custodial perspective. The violin case as micro-object constrains the key choice: the crack's appearance forces J-17 to weigh inventory mercy against continued search, directly shaping closure. Idiom is consistent (maintenance log, work order, safety codes) without caricature, and the courtyard's reset-versus-stable final state charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "crystal whispering forecourt" opens and closes the story, charging the final image with tactile and acoustic specificity; the forecourt "steamed gently" evokes thaw and matches the thematic shift. The lens as micro-setting object constrains Mara's choices (she hides it, uses it to decode tickets, then reveals it), and the projector room anchors the final explanation. Minor limitation: the conservatory interior (office, hallway, rehearsal room) remains generic; selective detail supports tone but does not pressure choice beyond the lens itself.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The maze setting actively constrains choices: lanterns along hedges, marbles in niches, the spiral on grass. Micro-setting details—yew gate, jasmine scent, rosemary and rot—are filtered through Elias's horticultural lens and matter to his tactics. The final spiral "that also looked like a dying vine curling back on itself" charges the closure image with tension between bloom and decay. Spatial choreography (corridors, center, archways) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The station setting is vivid and selective: frost-filmed dome, radiator grids, ventilation echo. The rotor on the roof becomes micro-setting that constrains Mara's choice and charges the climax. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (grease fluidity, magnetic gooseflesh), though the hologram mechanics receive more exposition than tactile grounding. Spatial choreography is coherent across lab and roof, and the gliders' caged presence pressures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded pit, velvet seats, drowned music stands, and swollen rehearsal door are vivid and filter through Lena's musician's attention. The lanterns, water, and in-between spaces constrain her path and charge multiple beats (pit, bass drum gap, balcony stairwell, rehearsal room). The oilcloth-wrapped ledger and the fermata-beside-keyhole image tie setting detail directly to plot turns. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the environment enables Varga's hidden arrangement concept at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    The weather station supplies concrete constraints: iced door, rime-ice checks, radiosonde balloons, antenna mast. The botanical illustration with its penciled warning functions as micro-setting and recurs with reweighted meaning (chart of lungs, petal as moment of lie). The mountain and aurora are filtered through the narrator's feverish then clarified perception, grounding each turn. The smudged notebook is handled twice and alters the narrator's stance. Environment charges the final image: "auroral sorrow" and "stiff shoulders" under faint noon light.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tunnel environment—wet iron, dripping water, rusted pipe, bolted flange—constrains the protagonist's access and charges the closure: the beaded wheel must fit the spindle, and turning it back seals the ghost shift. The radio, tool roll, and valve wheel function as micro-setting objects that pressure choices. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The tunnel "breathed" and the passage "smelled of wool coats and cigarettes" anchor the ghost-shift bay in lived-in specificity that supports the protagonist's appraisal method.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    The overgrown library, obsidian refuge, and origami swan are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (moss stitching shelves, volcanic stone drinking sound, paper with sheen of old bone). The swan's folds guide navigation, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. However, spatial choreography during the transit and in the refuge chamber remains vague, and the collapsed ceiling at the end arrives without prior set-up, weakening causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sage Ridge, the Dreaming Roots grove, and the eclipse's "dim blue hush" are vivid and purposeful. The kalimba and locket function as micro-setting tools that constrain Liora's choices and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and reflects urgency—shadows sharpen, birds go uncertain, color seeps back—without catalog excess. The grove's "room without walls" at totality directly enables the vulnerable exchange that unlocks Mara's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silo's concrete skin, central stair, bricked hearth, and window slit form a coherent micro-architecture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "scent of smoke," "cedar and panic," "scaled shadows that crawled across the shelves." The tapestry fragment held to the window slit constrains the final beat—sunset through warp casts dragon shadows that help Lysa understand direction itself changed—directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (draft up stair, chiseling hearth, laying fragment on table, holding to window) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse as setting constrains choice: Mara explains the beam orchestrates ferry and supply routes, and Lian uses the Fresnel lens shutters to misdirect the patrol boat, a tool-driven micro-setting moment that alters tactics under pressure. The rocky island's west-steps cleft functions as a resource that affects outcome—without it, the courier has no escape. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "cooling conveyor tick like a metronome," "kelp," "salt," though some elements (the Golden Lotus interior, the ferry crossing) receive postcard-level treatment without lived-in texture. The spatial choreography of the lighthouse (lantern room, kitchen below, exterior cleft) remains coherent across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The basalt ring bolted to air is vivid and specific; the palette's single ash-blue well becomes a concrete constraint that channels Mara's final choice. Micro-setting elements (Selo's satchel, the stone rim, the rift) are integrated into action. The "cloth over a bell" metaphor and "muffled clarity" establish atmosphere that charges the final quiet dawn scene. Spatial choreography remains coherent—Selo kneels, Mara sits, the circle is drawn on stone—without floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon constrain the protagonist's nocturnal ritual and charge the final image when "the double line collapsed into one." The nautilus shell segment functions as micro-setting, handled across beats (placed on the sill, warmed under palm, tucked into pocket) and its spiral ridges supply a tactile anchor for the conducting gesture. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the protagonist's professional and temporal priorities, avoiding catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is vivid and purposeful: wet glass tiles, river below, maintenance hatch, and the water-bead moment all ground the action. The tablet's warmth and the shifting runes provide tactile, micro-setting detail. The viaduct's reflective tiles and the branching paths they create directly constrain Lysa's movement choices and charge the final kneeling image on the shining tile.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cavern functions as micro-setting: its "mirrored hush," thinning vibrations, and "deeper chambers" shape Mara's tactics (pressing palm to wall, conducting with hands) and house the Listener. The antique phonograph and needle are tactile anchors that constrain the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, wall, darker chambers). The "faint rustle of turning seasons" and the shift "from dry to wet in a single scented breeze" charge the ending image, linking interior reconfiguration to environmental change. Sensory detail (drip, echo, heat in ribs, gray pollen) is purposeful and filtered through Mara's deafness, though the "scented breeze" at the turn risks soft coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard's jasmine and rain barrels, the warehouse's chlorine-and-grain smell, and the riverwalk reeds are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear: courtyard → inner passage → neighbor walls → rooftops → barricade waterline → loft → riverwalk → courtyard return. The notebook and pigeon function as micro-setting objects that constrain choices (copying logs, message tube). The "dusk" lighting recurs at closure to charge the final image. Minor gap: the bureau coats and generator hum are vivid but don't alter a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly rendered ("roof had fallen in layers, each collapse revealing older bands of earth," "clay walls glowed as if holding a private sunset") and directly constrains the narrator's tactic: matching rope knots to strata to coax time's surfaces. Desert badlands and starlight anchor the moment; the grotto's layered geology becomes both setting and thematic mirror. Spatial choreography is clear (rope on dusty floor, beings' light poured into twists). The setting charges the final image when drivers return by rumor and headlights flicker through years, making the grotto a functional lock/map rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse—glass ribs, shipwrecks holding hands, trees in brackish pools—functions as micro-setting that constrains Mara's approach and charges the final image. The central cistern's stillness becomes the knot's anchor, and when it ripples, the space transforms. Sensory hierarchy (ash-stained palms, salt-dusted leaves, clicks like seeds trying to split) filters through Mara's acoustically perceptive POV. The post-fire hush saturates every detail, and the wrecks' circle suggests collective failure, grounding tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto's resinous air and amber seeping "like syrup" constrain the ritual: Mira holds the blotter over the pool to let it drink fumes, and the transformation itself depends on the space. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's professional focus—static crackle, scent notes, the glow of the ledge—filtered through her dealer's lens. The final image of miners watching from the path and the sky "the color of cooled embers" charges the ending. Minor gap: spatial choreography of Orin cross-legged on warm stone versus Mira's case on a ledge versus the pool's location is slightly fuzzy, though it doesn't break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The breezy library, open windows, and promenade are rendered with sensory specificity ("salt and music," "wind flipped pages as if applauding"). The library's roof deck and the "box marked Unsung Hands" function as micro-setting that grounds the envelope exchange. However, the setting does not constrain a difficult choice or alter tactics under pressure—it provides atmosphere and symbolic support but remains postcard-level rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater-edge setting constrain Sava's choices: she uses marsh reeds (her idiom) to graft the arbor to crystal trees, a micro-setting move that charges the final image. Sensory details—"rain on stone," "craterlight bled through obsidian like dim stars trapped under skin"—are selective and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean across the orchard-to-arbor walk. The setting functions as both crucible and resource, with the arbor's obsidian beams holding reed impressions that reweight Sava's loneliness into address. The "shimmering crater" recurs purposefully, though its physics (ice-sheets over shimmer) remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop canal system, Giant's face-as-hill, throat chamber with iron bars, and the dark pool all constrain Rin's path and supply tactical resources (ladders, condensation drips to steal time from, bars to tap). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "warm breath rose in slow drafts," "the loops grew hot," "a clear, child-sized figure made of reverberation." The metronome tick and pendant-warming anchor micro-setting as pressure devices. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (studio → canal → jaw vent → throat chamber → back to canals).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cavern orchard is vividly particular (stone branches, quartz pear, calcite trees, dripping stalactites as clock and nourishment) and constrains Lysa's conjuration method. The mosaic stepping stone functions as micro-setting: its chipped triangles become coordinates that she uses to open the seam of light. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens (conjurer noticing rhythm, patterns, alignments). The environment charges the final image when she repairs one tile with pear quartz, embedding her discovery into the physical world. Spatial choreography (kneeling, setting eyes, turning the ladder into a bridge) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library's architecture—vents, pipe chases, beam nests, atlas table—constrains Lio's movements and enables his caching system, making the space essential to his tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "copper smell and cool condensation," "sapphire hush." The ferromagnetic fragment functions as micro-setting, its warmth and stored sensation charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the vertical layers of the building, and the dawn light progression marks time and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mossy trellis constrains a key choice (rebuild by releasing control vs. forcing vines back) and charges the final image (sitting under the rebuilt trellis, tasting the leaf). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mara's professional lens: "roots angled toward runoff," "vines... straining for a different path," "scent of wet mint." Storm season and the trellis's collapse create immediate spatial pressure. The linden leaf as micro-object anchors the transformation and reappears with reweighted meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal island, causeway timing, and convergence sinkhole directly constrain choice—crossing must be timed, the map's wells guide the search, and the metal ring in the sinkhole provides the mechanism for memory-summoning. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "the stink of old minerals," "reed beds that whispered with brackish wind," "the sky looked like a bruise that would not heal." The post-war water scarcity permeates every detail (ration lines, bombed reservoirs) and motivates both the narrator's and Mara's stakes. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the beach-to-chapel-to-sinkhole progression. The setting charges the final image when the returning tide frames the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid and purposeful: crystals chime at proximity, overlapping shadows create spatial anomalies, and the pearl on the pedestal anchors the climax. Sensory detail is filtered through the pilgrim's wonder and Lan's practiced certainty, and the cave's function as a tuner rather than answer-giver shapes the thematic closure. However, spatial choreography falters when "something without a body" moves through shadows—its position relative to Lan and Sera remains vague, weakening the climactic inhabitation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivory harbor's sensory signature—wet salt, crushed lime, rain-bright stones—recurs purposefully and filters through Mara's archival attention. The brass valve functions as micro-setting: greened by seawater, stamped with the old court seal, it constrains Mara's understanding (the missing note is itself a record) and charges the final image when Ilven raises the restored trumpet. The corroded trumpet, weathered notebook with torn pages, and bell tower anchor tactile choices. Spatial choreography (quay, doorways, tower) remains coherent across moves. The harbor setting pressures closure: the decree traveled mute, silence became a corridor for doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The phantom punch, pavement arrows, and star-colored lamp constrain Mara's path and charge the final image. Sensory details—mist lanes, dew on rails, stardust on shoes—are filtered through her mapper's eye and integrated into action. Spatial choreography (station roof, Platform Nine, stairwell descent) tracks cleanly. The "fortress of conversations never spoken" supplies a vivid micro-setting that shapes the closure image without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The open tower, basalt headland, brass instruments, and the tile itself form a coherent micro-setting. The tower's roofless exposure to "salt wind" and the moon path below pressure Mara's choices to stay and witness. The tile's ceramic coldness and the pinned pages as "prayer flags made of math" charge the final image. The whale migration supplies temporal urgency but remains more atmospheric than a constraint that alters on-page tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prismatic escondite constrains choice: the building's magnetic lattice responds to the amulet, corridors slide through themselves, and the hexagon heart chamber becomes the decision site. The solar storm tightens urgency by overwhelming shields and waking the mutiny. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"ozone and old letters," refracted light curtain—filtered through Ilias's dimensional awareness. The amulet fragment (micro-object) charges the final image by completing itself around his heart. Spatial choreography (corridor tilts ninety degrees, doors open onto nonexistent rooms) remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prep room is vivid and functional: "air tasted of disinfectant and roses that refused to die," the drain "gurgle like a throat clearing," stainless table and scalpel tray ground the space. The unclaimed woman's body anchors the thematic work—her toe tag becomes a micro-prop that constrains Mara's choice, reminding the agent of name-mishandling stakes. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered. Minor: spatial choreography when agents enter could be tighter (positions of Ivo, Sami, agents less clear), but the setting charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains Haru's method: "paths twisted between knee-high pines," "leaf-rustle and distant river" mix with lamp-hum to refract fiercer rhythm, and tactile anchors (brittle needles, wet soil, bruised petals) charge his invented histories. The split bonsai oak's scar becomes the final image where silence is reweighted as pause. Sensory hierarchy reflects the stationer's priorities (gold leaf, paste, cedar, paper slips catching light). No generic placeholder or white-room syndrome; the garden's living persistence despite abandonment tensions the premise purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth constrains movement and discovery throughout: stack labels (KX, MZ), tidal gaps, Container 9H's flood-lapped placement. The poison-bottle label functions as micro-setting, its paper "bite" charging the protagonist's hand and priming the erasure motif. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: salt air, kelp smell, diesel engines, burlap/silk touch synesthesia. The maze's tidal reconfiguration pressures the week-long search and the final act of hiding folders "in different stacks." The port's architecture directly enables the closure: "the labyrinth protect[s] what was left."

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory is vividly particularized: cracked dome, green telescope, thin star charts, half-finished cello. The seashell fits the cello's curve perfectly, a micro-setting beat that constrains Eli's final assembly. The cliff wind and sea fog anchor mood and tactile pressure throughout, and the space shapes the resonance experiment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The raft city is vivid and purposeful: pontoons, barges, theater floors, swing-bridges, and tie-points all constrain Ira's tactics and enable the reorganization climax. Sensory detail is selective (lantern light flashing quartz seams, brass bands against engine teeth) and filtered through Ira's carnival-native perception. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when its quartz map reappears. Spatial choreography during the reorganization night remains legible despite the moving decks, and the perpetual-carnival atmosphere supports the hopeful-desperation tone without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit summit is not postcard; it constrains the entire narrative (the fresh crater, the observatory dome, the tracking lights about to be installed) and charges the final image. The hourglass sand grain, film canister, vials, and iodine strips are handled across multiple beats and function as micro-setting elements that shape Mara's tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "scorched pine," "melted metal," "the wide black," "the eastern edge of the world paled." Spatial choreography is coherent (gate, crater, dome, impact site). The 1969 space-age setting is woven through action (Sputnik, moving satellites, radio tower) without exposition dump. Environment directly enables the central choice (photographing before the lights erase the old sky).

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mist-coated depot, slate fountain channel, and glass roof are not mere backdrop; the fountain becomes the diagnostic instrument ("light told him angles, and angles told him where a broken thing wanted to go"), and the mist/harbor setting frames the navigation stakes. Lio's blindness inverts the usual sensory hierarchy—he listens to the hiss where colors meet stone, feels warmth shift across knuckles—so the environment is filtered through his particular skill set. The anchor chain at the quay, "water spilling from each link like beads from Lio's channel," charges the final image by echoing the repair method in the ship's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The outpost's rust, frozen lake, fogged window, and black-stone field with steaming hollow are vivid and purposeful. The crack in the window glass becomes a ridge line that guides the atlas tracing—micro-setting as constraint that charges the closure. Spatial choreography stays clear across indoor and tundra beats, and sensory details (mist rising, ice sighing, frost on beak) reflect Riven's cartographic lens without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway functions as both spatial anchor and conceptual throat/ear, shaping Sava's method and constraining the final collective measure. Cobblestones, kiln, fountain, and belfry are tactile and purposeful, each responding to rhythm with physical consequence (shutters unwarp, lintel levels). Sensory detail is selective—dust spirals, hush, dull ring—and filtered through Sava's tuning mission. The micro-setting (archway, street, fork) charges the ending when the footsteps set the fork singing and the town answers, though the decree carrier's sudden stop relies on told effect rather than embodied response.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered (coral-furred pillars, lapis mosaics, bronze mirror, spiral of shells) and constrains choice: the wire knot traps her beacon, the relief's mouth is a lock she must engage, the mirror is the final tool. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency (silver beads, gathered hush, "shaky reports"). The crystal vial and bronze mirror function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor: the Lark above remains abstract; one concrete anchor (deck detail, crew name) would deepen the pull.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse prison setting constrains movement and choices throughout: the beam's rotation lulls guards, the oldest wing's impossible architecture (stairs to nowhere, cells opening into walls) literalizes the labyrinth metaphor, and the Fresnel lens becomes the repository for the hidden bodies. Sensory detail is purposeful—copperlight pooling, salt-mottled glass, reef showing teeth at dawn—and filtered through the protagonist's mission. The scuffs on the door function as micro-setting, a physical map that guides both the protagonist and future searchers. Spatial choreography remains clear across the vertical movement from cells to lantern room.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and functional: "alchemical orchard under glass, rows of grafted pear and mandrake trees, shrouded in endless night" anchors the space early, and tools (copper tubes, quince wood, the resonator) constrain Eli's choices. The winter-locked valley and moonlight-into-sap alchemy create a coherent, specific world. The bead and resonator charge the final image when the orchard wakes "in a rush of blossoms that smelled of weddings." Minor: spatial choreography of the bride's exact position among the roots could be sharper, and the valley's broader geography remains vague outside the greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and specific: orchid-woven shed roof, red canyon spirals "like waves frozen mid crash," tide-pool timing. The illustration plate and thread at ankle height constrain sleepwalking navigation, shaping tactics. The altar of broken oars reveals backstory that reweights the labyrinth's purpose. Spatial choreography—corridors, collapses, iron rings—remains clear and the orchid/thread details charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and selective: "tree roots snaked between bones," "ribs made pale trellises," "drafts that sounded like pages turning." The setting constrains choice (tremor caves the trench, forcing side-gallery exit; root corridors guide wandering) and charges the final image (sundial set "between two apple trunks," shadow sliding forward). Micro-setting detail (clay lamps, pocket watch stopped at noon, carved inscription) anchors the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across underground and surface moves.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden arcade is rendered with layered detail (roof panels, postal membrane conduits, antique mail slots, chalk on walls) that anchor time and place vividly. The chalk codes constrain the protagonist's method and the maintenance hatch behind RETURNS provides a spatial turn that alters tactics. Micro-setting (clipboard sensors, tile projections) functions as tool-constrained setting at this length, charging the final discovery without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt observatory, brass rail, clockwork orrery, and eternal flame are vivid and purposeful. The orrery constrains Liora's method (she must align beacon timings) and the flame's "never flickers between realities" property is load-bearing for the adjacent-possibilities logic. Sensory detail is selective (autumn wind, dry leaves, echoed silence) and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves. The flame in a glass cup over the orrery is handled twice and charges the final proof, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid, purposeful detail: roots clasp ankles "like questions," the stilt house window is "filmed with salt," and the spirits' song sharpens "into rain, into footsteps on stone." The shard and the condensation messages function as micro-setting, constraining Mara's choices (she must carry the shard through the maze, wait for moonlight, interpret spirit script). Spatial choreography is clean—stilt house, window, sill, water below, skiff arrival—and the brother's breath mingling with hers at the window charges the final image with physical intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atrium's mist, twilight, glass roof, and pond anchor the scene with purposeful sensory detail (gray coins, prayer-like footsteps). The cast functions as micro-setting, constraining Lani's translation work and charging the final image. The coral fragment recurs with evolving meaning. Minor: the "corridors outside" and field clinic remain abstractly sketched, but the dominant spatial frame—atrium and bedside—guides all key choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ruined orchard, fog, and defunct schoolhouse are rendered with vivid specificity ("thick fog sat in the branches like old wool," "sunk into mud and time"). The prism lamp and fresco recess function as micro-setting elements that constrain action: Mara must align the fragment and thread the film to unlock the projection. The fog itself becomes a screen for her mural, charging the final display. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, though spatial choreography across the marketplace-to-courtyard transition compresses slightly without tracking Mara's path. The setting participates in closure by serving as both canvas and catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sound wave garden (sine hedges, tuned stones, comma pools) is vivid and functionally integrated: the reflected echo guides Mara's strokes, and the coin-in-pool splash returns her name as a question. The garden constrains her approach (she steps between stones to find the long echo) and charges the final image with bright possibility. Spatial choreography remains clear across the amphitheater, garden, and wall. The hobo nickel as micro-setting also qualifies: its fit into the pinhole and tapped response drive pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse micro-setting constrains choices throughout: humidity fogs lenses (opener and climax), moth dust closes throats, fern aisles enable escape. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's entomologist lens (beetle larvae, pinned butterflies, mesh). Spatial choreography is coherent across the raid. The body and tools (gourd rattle, pinned specimens) charge the final image when the spiral "still waited" as auditors argue and members scatter. Economy is strong; every environmental detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gargantuan shell's architecture—ribs, Spiral Atrium, Heart-Cistern—guides Mara's descent and the lullaby's resonance; the off-key wind that "threaded the passages" becomes a functional carrier. The pearl-colored pool and blackened root-hairs create vivid micro-setting. Sensory detail is purposeful: "the taste of the air" delivers Iren's message, and the blossoms' light "traveled through the city like dawn through kelp" charges the final image. The shell's physical properties (calcium ribs that hum, coiled passages that echo) constrain her method and anchor the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and museum cases are vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "shelves glimmered like wet stone," "a fountain that poured upward into nothing." The cracked bamboo tube and the oil lamp function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice—repair requires the museum journey, the lamp flares when recognizing the past—and the final image of cloudbanks and empty aisles charges the closure. Spatial choreography across the two wings (library, museum) is clear, and sensory selection reflects the caretaker's priorities (checking for cracks, listening for rhythm). The setting directly enables the plot and the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The vault is well-anchored: cedar oil, cold quartz lamp, drawers of extinct scripts. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (desk → vault → center ink well). The ritual setup constrains the climax—witnesses required, objects arranged—giving the environment causal weight. However, the archive itself remains atmospheric rather than a live pressure on choices; Mara could perform this ritual in any secure room. The glass ink well and tuning fork function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amphitheater's warm vents enable the adhesive analysis (direct constraint on method) and the exhaled ash closes the accord scene with atmospheric charge. The antique chain's link spacing provides the decryption key, functioning as both tool and micro-setting. Spatial choreography remains clear across tiers and stone bench. Minor cap: while the volcano setting is vivid, it does not alter a protagonist choice as directly as the chain and vents do; most work is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The attic is vividly established (foxed paper, pigeon feed, skylight, rafters) and micro-setting details constrain choice: the balance beam practice grounds her equilibrium metaphor, the dust-mote swirls under the skylight provide her trust-selection method, and the floorboards hide the original scores. Sensory hierarchy is strong (smell, sight, spatial choreography), and the setting charges the final image ("dust-lit air as the attic emptied"). Minor slip: "soaked coat" with "no mud" on boots is a telling detail but the weather/exterior context is never grounded, creating a small spatial gap.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drifting prism terraces, old fairgrounds below, and the doorframe salvaged from the maze anchor the spatial logic clearly. The terrace's wind-driven motion creates the timed corridor constraint that forces Mira's crossing. Wood grain as map, brass plates hidden in seams, and the pavilion's barnwood all serve the mystery and the method. The seven-minute alignment window charges the final crossing with urgency. The setting constrains choice (the corridor dissolves) and the doorframe charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater facility is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "screens leaked cold algae-blue," "jellies drifted in ceiling cracks like slow thoughts." The cracked dome and algae currents constrain the firefly release and charge the final walk. Spatial choreography (service shaft, atrium, lab, dome, drowned streets) tracks cleanly. The burnt feather and terrarium function as micro-setting objects that alter tactics and the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate's constraint requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The geode's "crystal ribs," "luminescent algae," and "pool of sea foam" are vivid and purposeful; the environment supplies the foam pool that Mira uses for her confession, directly enabling the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (cliff → doorway → spiral tunnel → cavern → pool → return). The crater glass functions as a micro-setting object, constraining the narrator's diagnostic method and charging the final image when the gap fills.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal arcade functions as active constraint: rising water creates time pressure, the warped booth lock becomes the problem, and the bishop's diagonal shape supplies the solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt wind, neon, water tapping pilings—filtered through Milo's performer's awareness. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from suitcase stage to barrel to booth. The micro-setting (the booth, the bishop as tool-object) directly charges the closure moment when the wedge action saves the boy, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint shaping outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden is anchored early with blackleaf spirals, brine-language fountains, and dew-wet paths. The moonstone speck and fountain brine become literal ink, constraining her choice to stay anchored and shaping the tattoo's silver-cold quality. The garden's rhythmic anchoring forces her to dance seated, altering her method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (stone bench, hedge edges, heron's nest) remains clear. The setting participates directly in closure: the keeper touches the bench to release her, and the garden "keeps time behind her" as she departs.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pearl Bay at dawn, the fog-beaded prism atrium, and the lily pond behind it create a coherent micro-setting that constrains Ilya's choices (he returns to the pond, uses plain glass to contrast with prism glass). Sensory details—mist pooling on tiles, gull cry, sunrise through droplets—are filtered through Ilya's glazier's attention. The pond's ripple patterns function as setting-as-constraint, shaping the climactic demonstration. Spatial choreography (harbor → atrium interior → pond behind) tracks cleanly and the setting charges the final image (the repaired pane holding the horizon).

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit ridge, porcelain box, and Pulaski anchor setting and prop with specificity. The box's "hairline fractures held together by wax" recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (climb, lookout tower, flat stone). The setting does not pressure a choice in scene—it is a reflective backdrop—but the porcelain box constrains the confession moment and charges Jonah's understanding, meeting the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: tide-polished stone, sea breathing through it, tidewater glow, wet sand for writing. The altitude gauge functions as micro-setting, constraining Mina's method (she repairs its calibration, reads needle angles, translates sideways units). The balloons' mirrored decorations and their interaction with offshore updraft directly shape the climactic canopy design. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (cavern ledge → beach mouth → town → basket). Sensory selection is filtered through Mina's investigative focus, though occupational depth (balloonist mechanics) remains light, appropriate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage, fireplace, and ceramic chamber are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (soot taste, overlapping taps, ceramic murmurs) and each constrains or enables a choice: the passage hides the entrance, the fireplace yields the diary, the chamber reveals the archive. The film strip held to afternoon glare is a micro-setting move that charges the discovery beat. Climate-shifted fog and heat anchor the world without exposition, and spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The ceramic plates speaking in layered murmurs directly charges the final image and Liora's decision, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace, prism parapet, rainwater pooling as lenses, and market stairs below create coherent spatial choreography. Sensory detail—scent of new leaves and stone, rain sliding away, droplets as tiny lenses—is vivid and filtered through urgency. The prism parapet constrains and enables: it becomes the surface where the mirror is set and the raindrops multiply the glass, directly shaping the painter's method and the protagonist's access to the vision. The "dusky harmony before morning" and spring opening "the city like a wet book" are poetic but occasionally drift toward stock seasonal metaphor without strong POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The terrace mosaics, solstice line, bowl, and candles constrain the ritual choreography and charge the final image ("ash drifted over the terrace … the celestial bodies continued their indifferent waltz"). Micro-setting details—cracked mosaics, lantern smoke, ridge where the sun touches—filter through Sera's professional attention and pressure the delegations' willingness to perform. Spatial choreography is clean (opposite stairways, mosaic circle, low altar). The setting shapes the ritual's gravity and thus the treaty's legitimacy; removal would flatten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt flat constrains and charges every beat: "sheet of broken glass," salt cutting her soles, the converging fissures she counts and follows, the dark oval pool drained by her pumps, the rusted survey stake from her dam project. The crack-map is both navigational tool and accusation, its geometry guiding her pilgrimage and indicting her. The storm's lull functions as temporal pressure, and the final image of wind carrying shell shards along the crack-lines directly charges closure. Micro-setting (the stake, the egg, her bleeding feet) shapes the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and snow anchor setting early and constrain Maris's approach (she must guide the governor under the arch without alarming him). The sanctuary's glass and starlight function as micro-setting that charges the closure image when echoes pour out "like startled birds." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (cloves, old breath in glass, light as calm knives). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (courtyard → arch → inside sanctuary → behind pedestal). The nine-thread knot is handled twice but does not constrain a later choice; the sanctuary itself does.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radar dome functions as both literal setting and symbolic constraint: its "meteor hush" acoustics mirror Ilya's need to strip noise from his practice, and the storage closet housing the stolen stick makes the space complicit in his moral inventory. The seedy bar's spilled-gin specificity and basement lighting ground the puppet show, and the dome's curved walls serve the final shadow-projection performance. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations (gallery exit, dome interior, bar basement, return to dome). The dome's decommissioned surveillance past subtly charges the theme of ethical listening without becoming allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto as setting constrains every choice: thin soil limits how deeply frames can be staked, cloud-cover timing dictates when cloth signals are visible, the alcove houses the weather station that seeds the wing discovery. The moss-dripped basalt and "slow blushes" of light create a distinct sensory signature without postcard listing. The micro-setting (notebook, reeds, marigold cloth) functions as constrained toolkit. The final image—cloth over the weather station door—charges the space with memorial weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and craft tools constrain choices throughout: the rope must be warmed over seal oil, the wax tray is pricked with the punched-card pattern, the bronze strip can survive fire and flood. Micro-setting (the protagonist's hands, the rope, the punched card) functions as setting and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across the glacier road, the blue-ice chamber, and the furnace room. The sanctum itself is vivid but does not pressure a major choice; it supplies resources and atmosphere more than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest constrain the protagonist's path: the wafer slot determines entry, roots and wires shape the dream-space, and storm pressure times the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven ("wet concrete and old batteries," "sweet, dusty scent"). The final image—"the path in front of me is new, pressed into wet leaf-mold, yet my feet know it"—charges the ending by making the environment active and complicit. The storm functions as both weather and deadline, tightening the window for action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reimagined palace (glass roofs, baked-brick arches, bricked-up stairwell) and the underground chamber with "metal lines like circuit traces" create a vivid, specific environment that constrains movement and choice. Micro-setting works well: the tile's square depression, the bronze mask, the rack of tablets are handled objects that charge the closure. Sensory selection stays purposeful (cool darkness, lapis glaze, evening water color) and filtered through the astronomer's POV. The timeframe "between regimes" is atmospherically rich but functions more as backdrop than spatial pressure on most moves; still, the chamber's design alters tactics at the key beat, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The soundless sanctuary (pressure in ears, walls becoming glass) constrains interaction and charges the climax when silence allows only bodily reception of the music box's click. The broken cylinder pin is handled twice (opening, closure) and its reappearance directly enables the final turn. The shifting city outside provides escalating context (three possible streets) that pressures Mara's panic. Spatial choreography is clean; the stone floor and Lio's fingertips anchor the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ruined orchard district, fog, frost, terrace, and the roofless kiosk constrain Lio's movements and supply materials (brass from hinge, cider crates). The final terrace climb and mirror placement on frost charge the closure image. Sensory detail (fog as "ground glass," branches as "black antennas," mulch underfoot) is vivid and filtered through Lio's artisan lens. Minor: the Observatory Guild backstory and "glass mountains" metaphor feel ornamental rather than pressure-sourced.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard-cathedral is vivid and purposeful: apples glowing where candles hung, pear tree rooted in cracked marble. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's irritation ("saints should have swept"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (aisle, altar, beam, choir stall), and the carved vow on bark supplies a recurring image that charges the final pledge. The orchard constrains the boy's position (beam) and supplies the visual/thematic anchor for closure, meeting the 9+ gate for setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    The astral orchard, station mirrors, and greenhouse walkway are vivid and anchor the setting early. The cameo blank and logbook are handled across multiple beats, creating micro-setting texture. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice or charge the final image—Mara walks the orchard, leans over sinks, and opens the logbook without spatial friction or resource pressure altering her tactics. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met, capping the category at 8.8; present execution stays in mid-band due to lack of causal pressure from setting elements.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly realized through specific, purposeful detail: shelves breathing "in chords of paper and ink," a staircase of alphabets, books sprouting as seedlings in the BOTANY wing. Sensory selection (wet and green air, dust-cloak, pressed fern) grounds each beat and reflects Lysa's linguist lens. The botanical diary—a recurring object—constrains her path (matching the fern unlocks the corridor) and charges the final image (grammar copied beside pressed leaves). Spatial choreography remains coherent across descent and vault discovery, and the mountain's body as setting directly enables plot moves.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carnival ship supplies vivid anchors: ferris wheel "welded to the deck like a rusted halo," calliope corridor, Tilt-a-Whirl, sideshow gallery, deck hatch to greenhouse. The emerald swatch card constrains choice (it hums the filament, later unfolds to reveal stitched lines). The fog functions as spatial wall and the ship's answer-to-no-compass refusal pressures the narrative throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cracked glass, fishing-line grin, silver filaments—filtered through Mara's professional lens as a "chimera twin discoverer." The final hatch and greenhouse setting charges the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room is anchored early and used concretely: gears click, the pendulum slows, iron struts and oak door materialize. The ceremonial rope is handled tactilely across multiple beats (kneeling, unweaving, threading, re-braiding), and its physical properties constrain Mara's method. The "gap archive" image charges the conceptual payoff. Sensory details (cool draft, oil and rain scent) are selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the tower's physical logic supports rather than decorates the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harmonic caves are vividly rendered through shifting sound textures (water to struck iron, crystal honeycomb amplifying heartbeats) and constrain Sava's path through acoustic pressure. The ice-crack patterns function as micro-setting that guides her navigation, and the echo chamber stone acts as both tool and spatial anchor. The Forge of Listening charges the final image by becoming the sanctuary that houses the pact. Sensory detail is filtered through Sava's professional lens (mapkeeper perceiving through harmonics) and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass pavilion's hum, the prism cradle, the beacon stairs, and the salt flats supply concrete spatial anchors that constrain choice (climbing with fragile objects, working in dim lantern light). The hush shard functions as micro-setting, dampening sound to sharpen thought and later steadying the flame—both instances alter tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful (wind combing ribs, cold shard tugging hand) and the post-collapse idiom (grids died, radio towers were bones) reads consistent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory, solid fog, crystal forecourt, and shadow-measurement tools constrain the archivist's methods and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "rain had rinsed the crystal whispering forecourt," "thunder rolled along the solid fog like carts on a bridge." The body and tools (summer quill, shadow tracing) shape tactics throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across terrace, forecourt, and monuments. The fog's transformation from atmospheric to architectural directly enables the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming fortress wall gardens, "soot-gray cloud," courtyard, and river gate anchor space and mood consistently. The kerosene rag knot, clay filter pot, and mortars function as micro-setting tools that constrain Jorin's method (filtering powder, syncing fuses to chant). The final image of the river gate grounds the closure spatially. The environment shapes choices (collapsed masonry blocks entry, courtyard layout enables the diversion) and charges the ending with the contrast between blooming fortress and starving camps.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto's physical details—black rock opened like a book, starlight through a crack, trapped seawater pool—constrain the conversation's staging and charge the cicada's use. Micro-setting (the pool, dripstone) anchors Mara's perceptual signature and her tangential method. The tidal rhythm governs the scene's clock and mirrors the thematic "turn of tide" in the final image, which directly shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The xenial trellis functions as spatial constraint and resource: gravity inversion forces the rope-crossing choice, the scorched vines localize the gilded hush, and the tasting niches structure the collection beats. The porcelain doll as micro-setting object charges the final image (warmth on blackened leaf) and constrains the protagonist's panic-management method. Sensory hierarchy is strong—"bitter tea" for storm hush, "metal and honey" for gilded hush—and filtered through the child's priorities (fear of walls, fascination with silence flavors).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drifting prism terrace and storm glass vial constrain action: prismatic stripes paint Mara, the vial's clumping forces Elias to slow the car, and the cables' creaking becomes the pedagogical tool. The body (collar meter, storm glass in palm) and the gondola roof-tap are micro-setting that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (catwalk, bay three, far platform). No occupation-level depth demanded at this length, and the yards' "dark geometry" supports tone without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, bioluminescent orchard, and painted pavilion are vivid and selective. The ruby flake as tool meaningfully shapes two beats: unlocking the gate disguise and revealing the murals. Spatial choreography through the grotto and chamber is coherent, and the setting detail—"static from a radio tuned between stations," "leaves edged with bioluminescent veins"—filters through the lore keeper's sensibility. The descent into the chamber and the "dark glass" steps modulate atmosphere at the turn, supporting rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ashen chapel, warm doorknocker rings, and charcoal-rubbed walls anchor setting early and recur purposefully. The doorknocker constrains choice: its rattle signals Lio's arrival and its final strike reinforces the threshold, directly affecting the closure beat. Starlight spilling "like water into a sinking boat" modulates sensory detail under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara at door, Lio kneeling in ash outside, scars between them). The "fading threshold" micro-setting functions as both boundary and mechanism, altering tactics when grief encroaches. Minor gap: the exact geography of "where the city ended and the sky began" remains slightly abstract; one concrete anchor (a visible landmark, distance cue) would lift specificity without bloating the count.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bioluminescent farm and submarine bolt are vivid and specific, and the bolt constrains the drum's mechanics (threads hold pressure). Spatial choreography is clean (shed → aisles). The "shadowseam light" and "indigo pulses" create consistent atmosphere, but sensory detail skews heavily visual; the mushrooms never smell, the drum never hums or heats Mara's hands. The bolt charges the final image, lifting this into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sepia reading room supplies the crucial hidden compartment and acoustic properties that enable discovery; the gramophone mechanism requires the room's architecture to function. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dust trembled," "pale ripples," "golden shadows" filter through Leander's scholar's lens. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cabinet to portrait to balcony. The room constrains choice by containing the secret, but does not pressure the climax action beyond serving as archive; a stronger tactile struggle with the mechanism or spatial obstacle would lift this into high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse setting—grafted trees bearing coins, glass pears, vials of smoke—anchors the alchemical premise vividly. The leaded-glass door, marionette stage, and tin-plated puppet constrain Calven's sequence of actions (tracing loops, unsnapping clasps, opening the latch). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though "rows of luminous saplings" appearing after the stage dissolves slightly blurs the final geography. The setting charges the closure: "chemical rain" and the compass needle steadying on a path "that had never existed" ground the final image in the world's alchemical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The file room's "metal cabinets that sweated in summer and sang in winter," the dust pattern as "a quiet map of absence," and the button "warm from her skin" all anchor setting through tactile, purposeful detail filtered by Mara's archival attention. The dust rectangle and Cabinet H drawer constrain her search path, and the "sour smell of smoke and river mud" charges the moment she unfurls the papers, directly shaping her realization. The micro-setting (button, dust, twine) functions as environment and constraints that alter tactics. Strong integration across beats, though the room itself remains somewhat static beyond the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The auric lagoon, phone booth, and Ministry press truck are rendered with selective, purposeful detail that advances plot and constrains choice. The booth key opens a "door in her chest," the lagoon's starlight braids into navigational code, and the press truck's "ink and ozone" anchor the climactic beat. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves, and the waterfront setting supplies the resource (reflection-map) that enables the final action. The micro-setting (booth, truck interior) constrains tactics and charges the closure image with coded pages on water, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    The grotto is vividly particular—river under glass, octagon panes scattering light as "old postcards," drip-song as code. The atrium constrains Lio's movement: he must align with seams to intercept the prophecy. Sensory hierarchy reflects his musician's ear: sound details dominate, with mist and color filtered through acoustic purpose. Spatial choreography stays clean across his pacing. The vest's leaded cloth charges the final choice by altering how sound behaves in his chest.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, seed trays, monument shelf, and vault seam are vivid and purposefully integrated: the moonstone-dust needle, the sealed vault door, and the monument-building habit all constrain Lio's choices and charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (pods "tick like clocks," fingers "smell like rain," air "smelled suddenly of moss after rain"). Spatial choreography remains clear across root hall, sorting room, and public walkways. The setting's sky-borne status and the threat of descent create concrete stakes, and the vault's blackened seeds and bark-paper book provide tactile anchors for the climactic reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conservatory greenhouse and subterranean waterfall supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere; the waterfall's spray forces Mara to improvise gear placement, directly constraining tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: soot, wet earth, cold roar. The clocks-on-the-table and the feather function as micro-setting that charges discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (sill → table → trapdoor → tunnel → pool → niche). One missed opportunity: the burned botanical conservatory's former purpose could have deepened thematic resonance if its lost order contrasted with Mara's embrace of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-washed foundry constrains Mara's search—quench pit reflection shows ORIN, gold-flecked clay becomes the reagent for the coin's inlay. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "gutters spilling silver water into slag heaps," "air holds the old heat," rivets shining "as if grief itself were luminous." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from broken doors to casting bays to quench pit to culvert to anvil. The foundry's cold furnaces and pooled rainwater anchor the night's urgency and Mara's solitary work. Minor gap: Ellis's shack and the culvert receive less grounding, though they function adequately for their brief scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge constrains Mara's tactics (distorted harp in a ribcage cave, ledges where sunrise cannot reach) and charges the final image when light slides into the cleft. The crocodile tooth and harp strings function as micro-setting, shaping how confession is heard and cracked. Sensory hierarchy—mist beading on lashes, river as pewter ribbon—reflects Mara's urgency and the gorge's amplifying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and purposeful: glowing trunks, violet moss, antiseptic air, and bark etched with equations. The pewter strap functions as micro-setting object, handled twice and charging the final image when pollen "burns away the last anesthetic fog." Spatial choreography is clear (clearing, fallen tree, shoulder brace), and sensory detail is filtered through proprioceptive bias. The forest constrains choice by requiring a body "tuned by cruelty" to read invisible ink, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist's market is vividly anchored early ("web of catwalks under laundry lines and copper chimneys") and returns as a spatial constraint that houses the seam. The lens fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's access to hidden details and charging the final image when joined. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's translator lens ("drowned stone and low stars," "cold light breathed up"). The bolted hatch and stored canvases are discovered through goal-directed action. Environment, body (kneeling, tracing, fitting), and recurring object (lens) all constrain choices and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The circus ticket office constrains action: jammed service entrance forces the gap entry, the counter becomes a platform for ceiling access, the ticket window reflects phantom crowds at closure. Micro-setting details—"machine oil and sugared peanuts," "moth-eaten sequined coat," "ink-stained cuffs"—are filtered through the narrator's professional and spectral priorities. The mainspring barrel functions as both tool and recurring object, its weight and warmth charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves (floor → counter → ceiling void → control cabinet → door). The crack in the facade is established early, mirrors ceiling fractures, and drives the thematic closure when the narrator marks it for sealing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glass orchard is vivid, purposeful, and charges the final image: transparent boughs, frost patterns, thin bark at the westernmost tree. The frost constrains Lio's choice by spelling the press's demand, and the clouds-as-mirror transformation at closure reweights the entire setting. Spatial choreography is clean (balcony, aisles, westernmost tree). Sensory selection is filtered through Lio's craft (proofs, spacing, glyphs) without catalog tourism. The setting is integral to closure; removing the glass-tree structure would collapse the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful: gilded buttresses, iron craters, visible time pooling in corridors that can be "tripped over," and the Mirror Gallery with glass panels and carved cherubs all constrain the final choice. The method of covering mirrors is spatially grounded (velvet drops, reopening one mirror to view the alcove) and directly enables the climactic discovery of the star-routes map. The open crater plaza during the storm, with covered mirrors and projections through time strata, functions as the stage for closure. Micro-setting detail—Len carrying the shard in his pocket, the crystal vase on a table beside the map—charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong: visible time "striking the mirrors like thrown coins," the storm "scraping the asteroid's hull like a bow on tarnished brass." The setting does more than describe; it shapes Len's tactic and the exhibition's form.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered ("cathedral of copper lungs") and constrains Ivo's descent via the tether and wire mechanics, shaping his tactical choice to draw a chord. The philosopher's stone chip and oathfern function as micro-setting objects that charge key beats and the final image. Sensory hierarchy is professional: Ivo reads metal tremors like faces, filtering detail through his craft. The setting drives at least two beats (descent, repair) and participates in closure (pipes answer, light pours up), meeting the 9+ quick test with a small margin; minor vocabulary choices ("headache of quiet") feel slightly strained, keeping the score just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean lagoon charges the final image: "black water cupped in white" and the mist that "insists on reverence" create spatial and tonal pressure that shape Mara's choice to pour rather than collect. The compass as micro-object constrains two key beats (kitchen psychometry, cavern reading) and its brass hinge click becomes a recurring sensory anchor. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "scrape calcite," "cool air like a submerged mouth," petrichor's "earthy exhale." The factory's absence functions as negative space, shaping the town's new silence and Mara's permission to delve. Spatial choreography in the cavern (kneeling, wading, setting compass on rock) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway functions as micro-setting throughout: it shelters the carving, frames the projection, and becomes the convergence point for both gatherings. Sensory anchors (rust, kelp, salt-flecked glass, rain skewing sideways) are selective and voice-filtered. The driftwood spiral planted on the service road constrains the town's path at closure, satisfying the choice-constraint test. Storm pressure is present but remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a ticking clock that narrows options beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral cloister, and transept window are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (sleet tapping panes, soot-dark stone, etched glass like scratches on ice). The cathedral's architecture directly constrains and enables Lina's discovery: the narrow stair, the exact viewing angle, and the hidden palimpsest all shape her final understanding. The map of warm air currents rising from crypt vents is a concrete mechanism that charges the closure by explaining the night bloom. Spatial choreography remains clear across the seasonal transition, and the final mural panel integrates setting into the thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    The obsidian lagoon constrains the final choice (descent to black water, surface clicks, ripples as cipher key) and charges the closure image when it "rises like a hand offering its palm." The zeppelin library and dunes are vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail (kerosene, crushed sea grass, kelp commas, white pebble vowels). Beach debris and lagoon surface function as micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cove's setting—harbor posts, sagging shops, cracked shrine steps, the shed with nested lantern frames—grounds the piece in concrete decay and supplies the materials (paper frames, driftwood, fish oil) that Sen uses. The coin gleaming inside one frame triggers the plan, and the shrine steps serve as a literal platform for the soap offering, so environment does constrain and enable key choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-rotted beams, sea fog, the throb of the bottle against ribs), though most description serves atmosphere rather than immediate tactical pressure. The final image of lanterns "fed by the town itself" charges the setting with thematic weight, but the actual mechanics of how guilds and a schoolhouse arise from ruins remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The orchard garden atop the skyscraper constrains Erem's choice—he brings the shaving there explicitly because "silence has depth" and clerks won't watch. The stone table between pear trees and the hand-crank phonograph are tactile anchors. Spatial choreography (tower, garden, roof intercoms, stairwells) tracks cleanly. The glass windbreaks and gnarled trees charge the final image of the cedar box storage without over-symbolizing. One quibble: the orchard's altitude could pressure a decision more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound atrium supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: frost on glass palms, the meltwater spiral that refuses to freeze, starlight rotating "like a calm animal turning its ear," and the sealed service door whose frost cracks in a circle. The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting, constraining Lio's sorting ritual and later receiving the rye grain that closes the spiral. The corridor's textural variety—velvet nap, burlap roughness, pollen sweetness—grounds the metaphysical moment in embodied sensation. Setting detail is filtered through Lio's seed-saver lens (lineages, entropy, planter labels) and charges the final image when the hatchling perches on a frozen frond, watching.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The windblown sanctuary is vividly anchored (stone arches, belfry, parapet, bell tower, lantern clock) and sensory detail is selective and purposeful (hail ticking on slate, glue smell, bell rope "hanging like a dark river"). Micro-setting elements—the siren housing, vane, control box—constrain Maris's tactical choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from steps to tower to parapet to radio desk. Minor gap: occupational detail (Weather Office protocols, sensor mechanics) is functional but never pressures a key choice; the setting enables rather than complicates. The final image of monks pulling the rope "not as an alarm but as gratitude" charges the ending, lifting the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The basalt ridge, decommissioned tunnel, and tracking dome constrain Lio's movements and choices. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, filtering perception and charging the final communal scene. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's priorities: dust on lenses, generators ticking like bones, green meteor flare. The collapsed tunnel's pumice and oilcloth logbook are tactile discoveries that alter present stance. The station itself acts as vessel-constraint, its "forgotten generators" and "old astronomers' practice" shaping the tracing ritual that drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The beekeeping oasis setting is vivid, particular, and purposeful: cracked hives, dry spring, smokers, and water trough anchor spatial choreography and ghost positions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air still smelled faintly of wax," "wind carried ash"—and supports the final act when the narrator carries the box "outside to the dry spring, set it on the cracked stone." The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (its sealed contents) and charging the closure image when moonlight spills through its panes during the reading.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The emerald silo is signaled early, micro-setting (the capsule cradle, green light, iron-filings air) charges the exchange beat, and the spatial choreography (spiral stair, vent chamber, service door) remains coherent. The urn fragment and capsule seam function as object-as-setting, constraining the final choice when Eli places the shard and the humming stops. Sensory hierarchy reflects Eli's professional past (chronometric vents) and present urgency. The silo's stored wind and green-filtered light recur to charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt lagoon is vividly established with "ink thinned with milk" and "burnished hush," and tactile details (sand on cuffs, soaked paper, mangrove roots) ground action. The setting supplies materials (kite string, feather, net, warm stone) that enable each repair sequence, and the drake's emergence from reeds charges the final image by linking environment to thematic closure. Sensory detail is dense but occasionally ornamental; "palm stumps" and "fishermen's shed" serve as anchors without adding pressure. The final beat uses the lagoon's lap of water to pace Rian's breath, meeting the micro-setting constraint test for 7.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The living stone pillars function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's choices—the hidden channels guide her remodeling plan, and their warmth returns at closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: rain turning the courtyard into a mirror triggers the discovery, copper conducts mist to let oaks "sense" currents, and the pillars "sweating less" shows environmental consequence. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard, courtyard, and center court, with the flagstone hollow providing a physical anchor for thematic revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tower, footprints, bronze door, and pedestal chamber are vividly anchored with sensory detail (rainwashed bronze, dusty glitter, terpene scent) filtered through biochemist POV. The fly amber vial and Pilgrim Salt crystals function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: cracking the vial opens the seam, breath shifts crystal color. Spatial choreography (gate→plaza→sculpture path→bronze door→chamber) remains coherent. The pedestal's glass and dripping rain supply the humidity that grows the crystals, directly enabling the narrator's final scalpel theft.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming jetty constrains the entire ritual: "narrow as a spine" yet reaching into "vast blue dusk," it supplies the literal platform and the charged threshold between land and dead reef. Seed pods rattle "like small bones," lanterns lean away from rising pressure "like reeds in wind," and the trench "drinks the silt"—each detail filtered through the coachman's occupational lens and animating the space. Spatial choreography is exact: jetty's end, knee-deep wading, bucket of dark silt, the trench. The body (kneeling, wading, spreading) and recurring objects (seed pods, silt, lanterns, blossoms) charge the final image where the jetty blooms "against the empty sea." The micro-setting functions as world and stake simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scrapyard's catwalks, rusted heaps, and blue lamps anchor spatial choices. The phonograph cylinder and waxed leaf function as micro-setting that charges the closure (leaf warm from skin, cylinder grooves read by needle and mirror). Sensory filter is purposeful: bolts cooling, wind hush, Morrow's whine. The relay station's "field of sunken antennas" arrives late but constrains the final beat. Minor: "cracked flats" and "open cracks" are under-differentiated in traversal, leaving the path slightly abstract when specificity would sharpen Morrow's route.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observation deck's double-pane treatment becomes a functional instrument that constrains the protagonist's navigation choice, charging the closure by revealing true north. Sensory details—ventilation fans slowing, moonlight striping water, air tasting clean—are filtered through the protagonist's relief and temporal distortion. The deck setting is not merely backdrop but the tool that makes the resolution possible. Spatial choreography (deck to hatch to coast road) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound spire, cathedral of ice, chapel with chessboard, and top platform constrain movement and choices throughout. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "blue walls," "thin chapel where the wrong sky leaked through glass," "wind tore at my cloak." The wrong sky functions as atmospheric pressure and ties directly to the timeframe constraint. The pocket sundial lid and chess pieces operate as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the sundial opens and "warmed as the unknown opened its arms."

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering gallery functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: whispers "skate along curved stone" to reach the farthest balcony, enabling eavesdropping and the paced-word unlocking method, and the hidden latch responds to heel clicks as "whispered prayer." The pawnless chessboard recurs with shifting charge (heirloom, proof of belonging, field after battle, finally placed on the ledge as the frame for the new history). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the historian's attention: "cold air rose… smelling of paper and dried violets," "mosaics," "curved stone." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the gallery floor, archive descent, and closet imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The labyrinthine bookstore supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: shelves like cliff faces, book spines glittering with mica, the locked case. The environment constrains choice (the nightly shuffle threatens to strand the protagonist in "kinder lies") and the feather—a micro-setting object—enables the stone's unlocking and acts as a compass during the reality substitution. The hidden thunder recurs as atmosphere that charges the final beat ("the hidden thunder quieted"). Spatial choreography remains clear across descent and corridor navigation. The setting does more than backdrop; it pressures the protagonist's tactics and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, tapestry, and Mara's body (fidgeting thumb-and-forefinger) all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's chess-tutor perception: "snowflakes hovered like pinned notes," "bright maze of metal lines that hummed." The mirrored gate surface forces her confrontation with her past self, a micro-setting move that drives the climax. Spatial choreography across street, inn table, labyrinth junctions, and bell tower remains clear throughout. The frozen ale mid-pour and children mid-skip ground the village's stasis vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon of bone towers and pale spire create a vivid, specific micro-world, and the echoes function as both atmosphere and mechanism. The prisms constrain Mara's final choice—she must destroy them to pay the price—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the crowd's movements and the killer's exact position during the lunge remain vague. The setting does more than decorate; it enables the refraction tactic and enforces the forgiveness price.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The acid sea, pontoons, gears, the submerged Lung, and the pockmarked statue constrain action throughout: the listing workshop supplies urgency, the Lung's glass pocket enables the underwater matching ritual, and the statue's surface serves as literal map for memory retrieval. The gold-laced resin repair directly answers the environmental threat at closure. Sensory detail (spray hissing on brass, green churn, water shivering) is filtered through Lysa's alchemical lens and supports the "dire enchantment" tone without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered—"seawater pools clear as glass," "barnacles ring the pool like a crown," "pencil of afternoon sun"—and constrains Lio's choice by offering the pocket where "minutes can pretend to last." The oasis functions as both setting and charged object, enabling the promise fulfillment. Spatial choreography is clean (quay → tunnels → chamber → return) and the cave's stillness directly charges the final image of the shell at the pool edge. The sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's painter's eye without catalog padding.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt lighthouse functions as both macro-setting and instrument: "the whole structure began to tremble" constrains the method and charges the closure. Micro-setting through the cork, jasmine pots, and lantern-room lens mechanism shape tactical choices. Sensory specificity—"damp soil," "exhausted anger" of sea slaps, "teeth sing"—filters through the narrator's urgency. The dawn timing and garden scent directly enable the beckoning action. The "cobalt shadow" reprise in the final third ties setting to the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The signal station's frozen dish and jammed doors establish resource scarcity that drives the floor-built instrument. The censer foot's weight fluctuation with moon phases constrains the armillary's directional shifts, directly altering the safe passage each night. Spatial choreography remains clear (station → salt flats → aqueducts → camp), and the aqueducts' collapsed canals embody the reversal of infrastructure that once "carried life by force of hydraulics." The final camp setting charges closure by providing the reunion space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "lanterns look like a second sky" and the boy's "patient hands" echo the father without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hanging orchard setting constrains multiple choices: swaying platforms during storms create immediate danger, the truffle bed becomes both workspace and burial site, cables and terraces shape spatial choreography. Micro-setting (glass eye pressed to palm, then eyelid) functions as constraint in the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wind thread the ladders," "ravine filled with static empathy"). The setting charges the final image when Mara buries the relic "beneath the black truffle bed," converting her professional ground into a keeper of secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The opal dock "shining like pearl through mist," the lighthouse beam's slow pulse, and the post lacking rope scars all constrain choices and charge the final image. Nautical twilight brackets the narrative and creates temporal pressure. The Edelweiss—mountain coldness on the coast—supplies sensory specificity that drives investigation. Micro-setting (the post, the packet sewn in canvas) alters tactics. The environment is filtered through both the narrator's clerk role and Eamon's sensory method, avoiding catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sinkhole, cavern bloom, rising pools, and ants function as micro-setting that constrains choice—Mara kneels unsure until the ant-line reveals the entrance, and water climbing through ceiling holes forces the fork. The creek-road silt, ferns, wet-iron smell, and compositor's-grid slab charge the final image. Minor: the shop's cedar-and-dust opening does not return, limiting closure linkage for that anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt grotto is vividly rendered ("night had condensed into mineral," "ash and crushed violets") and charges the final image; the fissure's heat bites through gloves, a micro-setting detail that constrains Maelin's descent. Spatial choreography is clean (postern gate → ridge → ledge → grotto mouth → fissure). The cloud-sea below and the firefly patterns create atmospheric pressure. The shale and rope are integrated into action, not catalog. Minor: the palace interior and ridge topography remain sketch-level, but at this length selective detail serves closure more than breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember nexus is vividly anchored—basalt ribs, red-breathing fissure, mica-dusted stone table—and constrains the climactic choice: Lio releases the suns *here* to make the Academy watchers see them. The shell curl's spiral grooves are handled on the page, guiding the solar dust into luminous stripes that alter each sun's character. Spatial choreography (rim walk, vents, distant towers) remains clear. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (copper smoke twilight, humming sun, warmth climbing wrists), filtered through Lio's alchemist lens. The setting directly enables the protest act and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cabin's birch-bark scroll constrains the protagonist's choice at two beats (untying it, tracing grooves to write) and charges the final image ("last length of birch bark"). The graveyard's absurd slope placement and the ridge's "too sharp" moonlight are vivid and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean across dream and waking moves. The scroll functions as micro-setting, meeting the 9+ gate test by constraining action and charging closure. Minor slip: the "down-valley" cemetery hike adds a concrete anchor but does not alter tactics or reweight the dominant stake; it reads as corroborative texture rather than pressure, slightly diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock repair shop, fog, and birthing house are rendered with purposeful sensory detail (dripping clock, wet glass, steam, untouched tea) that guide perception and constrain Iris's method of reading through veils. The repaired screw's reddish tarnish and stripped thread are specific, tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clear: counter, bench, street, birthing house, curtain. The recurring fog and occluded views charge the final walk back, reinforcing the thematic lens. Minor: the shop's occupational texture (water clock mechanics) is sketched but not pressure-tested in Iris's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating platform, its chains, storm fronts, and lacquered table constrain the central action—Ila must stabilize the platform during the held breath or the storms will tear the sky. The quill, mica-tea ink that crystallizes under stress, and the brazier with cloudleaf steam are handled tactilely and charge the closure (ink facets whiten, then soften when brother-rune warms them). Sensory details filter through Ila's trauma: mineral scent recalls lightning, steam rides the storm's exhalation. Deduction: the valley below and cliff town remain postcard anchors without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archive's metallic shelves, old security current, and spatial layout (stacks, folio table, windows facing the orchard) all enable Marin's wire-loop setup and constrain her method. Sensory density is high—dust, ozone, pear-and-smoke scent, emergency bulbs—and filtered through her exorcist's practical lens. The perfume bottle and copper wire function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. The orchard's red-marked trees provide urgent atmospheric pressure and symbolic counterpoint. The one slip: "the kind of silence that had a name" is an elegant but vague opening anchor; full spatial grounding arrives a beat later.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The temple library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (stone doors, incense, dust, circular shelves, central well, mirrors below). The dictionary is handled twice (opened, traced) and its shifting definitions constrain the narrator's spiral arbitration process. The well and staircase structure the narrative journey, and the mirrors below force the narrator to confront multiple pasts. The setting constrains choice and charges the final climb, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fjord, the regulator house, the brass telescope, and the intake pipe with ice constrain Ivar's choices materially: he must use a warmed probe to avoid cracking the pipe, and the fog blurs the horizon sighting. The mantle clock on the mantel and the key in his pocket anchor micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("ice blooming along the intake pipe like white moss," "the horizon's edge met not as a gentle kiss but as two blades crossing"). The station's function—telegraphing the sunrise instant—pressures the plot throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mica-pane lantern is handled across multiple beats (library, subway, overpass, father's room) and its "layered amber" light charges the closure. Rain, clover scent, and subway seat scrawls anchor sensory perception. The library and hospital settings constrain her choices. Small slip: "circulation desk" and "waterproof envelope taped behind a timetable" read convenient rather than lived-in; the spatial choreography of the overpass is vague.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subway utility tunnel constrains the final choice—Mara must use the booth's dial-out key, a physical affordance that exists only in this setting and carries职业风险. The glass disc functions as micro-setting: its tactile "milky circle scored with grooves" and the finger-slide action recur to mark transitions and finally "sang her courage into existence," charging the closure image. The streetlamp hum filters down the stairs and brackets the piece, anchoring time and creating atmospheric continuity. Spatial choreography is clean: booth, conduit, grated door, stairs. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered—"walls sweated rust," "trains rumbled like distant weather"—without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming jetty, walnut ink, and night-blooming lilies create a distinct sensory signature filtered through Mara's archival priorities. The locket lodged in barnacles and the salt-stained crate at the final ceremony are tactile anchors that constrain action: Mara must pry the locket free, place the book on the crate. The jetty's damp planks and the tide sliding in "with an almost celebratory hush" charge the closure image. Minor gap: the archives workroom and the mayor's rehearsal space lack spatial grounding, reading more as narrative stations than lived-in environments.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly anchored early (ivy-swallowed board, cracked clock, baggage room as "altar built by pranksters") and constrains the encounter—it's "neutral enough for strangers to meet without feeling recruited." The moon rock's warmth is tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent (platform, baggage room, exits). However, the station's ivy and decay remain largely static description after the opening; the setting does not materially alter tactics in the middle beats, holding the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as both atmosphere and constraint: Iris reads air currents and bark languages to navigate, and the clearing's wave-cancellation creates the silence necessary for her realization. The platinum ring, though small, acts as a recurring navigational anchor that charges the final pool moment when it "clicked to stillness." Sensory detail is purposefully filtered through Iris's blindness (tremor of breathing, skin-reading, air on cheeks) and the rare-night constellation pause subtly mirrors the emotional stillpoint. Minor slip: the "market of listening-bells" is named but never spatially grounded or revisited with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The anomaly compresses corridor lights into "a blue thread," the listening room houses a mercury reservoir, and the bent nib functions as a tactile constraint that must be unbent to restore function. The viewport's shifting constellations charge the final image. Micro-setting (the pen, the headphones, the metal ruler) substitutes effectively for broader world-building at this length. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The harbor is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (lanterns as floating commas, rope fibers, gull cries) filtered through a lyric POV. The foghorn's failure provides a concrete environmental event that narrows tactical options and charges the climax. Spatial choreography is legible across bollards, pier, and crate. The moonlit water and accordion anchor the ending image, making setting participatory rather than merely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lost civilization archive is vividly realized: obsidian steps, stone tablets, polymer reels, lamps that wake, mosaic footprints, clay hands. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Sera's urgency. The tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining her decryption choice (scraping the canvas) and charging the final image by linking past promise to present action. Spatial choreography is clean through the descent and chamber sequence. The archive supplies the reel that shapes her decision, meeting the Q3 gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sound wave garden is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: reeds, basalt bench, gold algae that glows with sound. Spatial choreography is clear (glass doors, courtyard center, narrow rim). The lagoon constrains the climactic choice—perching on the rim, feet dangling, becomes the posture for the shared trance and the narrator's solo return. Sensory selection (cold fire in veins, breathing amplified, light moving across reeds) reflects urgency and anchors the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with concrete spatial detail (numbered corners, ARIES/LIBRA stamps, steel grating). Micro-setting (the acoustic conduit, the hidden door) constrains Mara's choices and directly enables the whisper proof. The geomagnetic storm affects action (frozen cranes, dead radios) and sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (footfall identification, seam acoustics). The final image charges the maze itself as a listening entity, fulfilling the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt dock, shutters, and canal are tactile constraints: the guardian's cord-weaving uses the boarded warehouses as an instrument, and the mirror descent into the water reveals the fisher's body. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: oil film, petals, bruised coin glisten, cold starlight skipping across wet boards. The dental mirror (micro-object-as-setting) charges the final image by constraining the girl's search and reflecting both star and eye. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library, mist, Harbor Street grid, and magnetic grotto are vividly anchored with sensory specificity (blue stone swallowing sound, black ore tugging metal). The grotto's magnetic pull constrains the plan's timing mechanism, directly shaping tactics. Spatial choreography across town windows and the cliff-to-street sightline remain clear. Minor slip: "watery stars" and "amplified quiet" veer toward stock lyricism without adding sensory concreteness.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—knee-deep green water, barnacle-bit pilings, coral roots lifting from sand. The scrimshaw (warm as skin, glowing pale) and chains (iron links running into dark, sighing when released) are tactile and plot-active. Spatial choreography remains clear across the night dive and skiff approach. The setting charges the final image: stepping into "sublittoral green" to claim "truest shape" reweights the opening patrol beats.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wind turbines anchor the setting and constrain the narrator's sensory world ("I kept the windows shut... to muffle the blades"). The turbine shadows functioning as "slow clock hands" at the fence line and the "blade wash" scattering petals upward directly charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (farmhouse, kitchen, barn, fence line). The dried bouquet and cedar bird function as micro-setting that recurs with reweighted presence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (milky pillars, lantern-moth hush, mist threading between ribs). The quartz vibrating through boot-soles and the blue light deepening as boundaries dissolve tie setting to the protagonist's actions. The colonnade constrains Soren's physical reach (his fingers pass through her cloak) and charges the final image when Lira steps into the circle's center. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored—glittering panes, furnace smoke, flagstone fractures, hanging chimes—and the plant-arrangement spiral visibly structures Mara's persuasion. The reed tongue's "cold edge bites her palm" and the vibrating chimes at the end charge the final image. Spatial choreography (pots, planters, velvet pouch) tracks clearly. However, the phoenix's world-altering effects (bartered awakenings, awakenings as currency) remain conceptual furniture rather than tactile constraints that pressure on-page choices; the courtyard itself does the causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly established with velvet baffles, copper throats, and golden shadows; the soot-blackened lens focusing sound functions as both tool and symbolic anchor. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (narrator's table, the chamber, the press walk). The lens and chamber constrain the protagonist's method—refracted sound must pass through specific apparatus—and charge the final image when visitors "reached out as if feeling fabric, because the sounds had weight and temperature." Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's acoustic priorities (overtones, textured air) without catalog excess. Minor gap: the "mapped loop of sensors and screens" for the pilgrimage remains abstract; we never see a station's physical layout or how visitors move through it.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's "brass instruments never tarnished," "stone floor held the cool of all winters," and dome that opens to rearranging constellations establish timeless constraint and tone early. Micro-setting details—curtains of intention, meteorite filings, the pot of basil under telescope—constrain Mara's ritual choices and supply resources (lamp, stencil projection). Spatial choreography mostly tracks (hanging cloths around central telescope, control room, dome), though the line of strangers arriving is staged generically. The basil pot and ring return charged at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's jeweler attention (soldering, polishing, etching). No occupational depth beyond jewelry basics, but germane to conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vivid and recurring: "wet stone and old paper," rain stitching dusk, beads still present at midnight. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining the method (twelve feet from skylight marks a card placement). Streets are sketched through pawnshops, murals, water-truck queues—specific enough to ground the mapping expedition. The tape and skylight charge the final image when they return, raising this into the 7s despite limited occupational texture for cartomancy itself.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive setting (copper air, bronze door, violet windows) is vivid and mood-driven. The bronze pagoda functions as micro-setting, constraining the purification method through its rotating facets and light corridors. Spatial choreography is coherent (descent, vault, upper halls return). However, the pagoda's mechanics remain abstract; we see light and scent but not tactile resistance or physical consequence that pressures the historian's body or tool-use in a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Blooming Library above clouds is vividly rendered with blossoms as screens, vines, and petals dropping perfume. The river stone constrains choice: Mara presses it to the screen and finally offers it to the shadow, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the stone, the desk, the petal screens) shapes tactics across beats. Some geography remains abstract—how patrons "arrive," where the main conservatory sits relative to the terrace—but the core visual anchors hold.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The misty workshop with heat lamps and terraria provides tactile grounding and constrains her nocturnal reflection. The chameleon's tail tip on paper towel is a micro-setting element that charges the final image when pinned above her desk. Sensory detail (cedar smell, mist hiss, chalk squeak) anchors without catalog excess. Spatial choreography (crates, van, workshop, sanctuary) tracks cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower, greenhouse, and cellar are spatially coherent and constrain action (spiral stairs pull stitches, archived hymnbooks hide the crack). Micro-setting—hourglass, coffee saucer, bread knife, roots pulsing like veins—charges choices and the final image. "Meteor hush" and sensory anchors (wet stone, frosted sand, chlorophyll syllables) build atmosphere without catalog. However, the coffee-ring diagnostic method and the healer's buried blessing lack procedural grounding; the world rules feel asserted rather than discovered through action, and the plants' guilt-ridden whispers remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The projection booth is rendered with purposeful detail: projector as shrine, lamp housing incubates the can, beam path and rewind table hold imagined emotions, sprocket clatter provides the tune. Micro-setting (the strip, the light rectangle on the wall) constrains Mara's ritual and charges the closure image. Sensory selection—velvet-folding rain, underground thunder, quivering light—filters through Mara's spatial imagination and intensifies at peak beats. The booth's "hidden chambers" open in her mind at closure, making environment inseparable from the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that constrains Sel's action (resting beneath it to match the sky's pulse, using it as a spatial anchor for the vault). The astrolabe—a tool—charges the final image and enables the meteor-tracing method. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("bruise of green fire," "sour hush"), though some phrases ("shadowed rapture," "remembered stardust") repeat without evolving. Spatial choreography is clear across the archway, streets, and vault. The unwritten calendar adds texture but remains conceptually vague, diluting practical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing dune constrains action: grains "lit from within," sparks "skittering along the bloom," the guard planting "glassy ember seeds between the grains." The chess clock's "cracked casing" opens the shack "like a paper fold," showing shelves that are "also dunes, also train cars." Spatial choreography across divergent timelines remains legible through purposeful compression. The archive's rule—"everything occasionally everywhere"—directly enables the guard's simultaneous presence and tactically shapes the climax when auditors' "boots dulled the dune's glow."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and purposeful: sheet-brass leaves, stacked-piston trunks, chain-vines, oil streams, and wind-as-instruction create a sensory world filtered through the philosopher's perceptual priorities. Micro-setting elements (the gear under the tongue, the rusted crank with the protagonist's name) constrain the final choice and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across translocations, and the cathedral's rib-arrangement of trees provides a legible anchor for the turning-point.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting elements—shingle, fog, old pier, heather-and-cloud ridgeway, bracken thicket—anchor each beat and shape Mara's choices: the tide line stops her chase, the skiff crosses without oars (world logic), the cairn fire provides a vigil site, and the fallen fence enables the final descent. The ticket punch as micro-object constrains action (she uses it to bite open wire) and charges the final image (one last star punched as keepsake). Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's urgency (surf as lullaby, scree underfoot, wire tangle), and the guides' knowledge of terrain (indirect routes, easier crossing) pressures her path. The veiled ridgeway and shoreline recur to bookend the journey, modulating from liminal threat to trusted ground.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt fortress, snow pressing "like a white palm," ice tunnels, dusty spiral staircase with the ninth-step thumbprint, and the underground chamber with monitoring consoles create a coherent, oppressive setting that constrains choice (the silence policy, the surveillance grid, the wobbling piano bench). The bolt becomes micro-setting that enables the therapy scene. Sensory detail is purposeful: "oil and old varnish," "muffled hymn that had no voices, only humming pipes," frost breath as "a small flag of surrender." The setting directly enables the protagonist's discovery and final act. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the fortress exterior and snowfields remain abstract backdrops rather than active pressures on the page, but the interior spaces—staircase, chamber, therapy hall—all constrain or enable key moves.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered with specific details (cracked basalt, broken oculus, mosaic sky-door) and the rune of drift mechanically enables the quest by bending time and space. The setting pressures Orun's route and supplies the proof he needs (the sealed Librarium Regnum, the mosaic star). The "librarians of ash still turning pages" and vines "like loosened braids" charge the atmosphere, and the final mosaic star he sunders is both spatial constraint and symbolic hinge—without it, the proof remains hidden and the closure cannot occur.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating station functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its isolation enables Mara's monthly skiff attempts, the glass well frames reef observation, and the metal surfaces anchor the tapping practice that charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven—"slap of water under the deck," "fog," "aluminum gunwale"—filtered through Mara's professional attention without catalog excess. The post-ban archipelago's navigational ambiguity (shifting sandbars, buoy fields, vanishing routes) directly pressures the central mystery. The tidal cycle and beacon timing create a coherent constraint that shapes the final revelation and Mara's encoded response. Spatial choreography remains clear across station, skiff, and canal encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: cold plating, cracked skylight, unpowered shuttle, and the ancient stone circle all constrain and enable Ilya's actions. The circle's hum is both sensory anchor and plot mechanism, guiding her console tuning. Thunder and serenity interweave to charge the final image. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, filtering perception through brass-and-scar texture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the bay's emptiness reflects the rebellion's lull, making setting inseparable from stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Volcanic hot springs are anchored early and recur with purpose: sulfur heat enables the unsealing steps, the "ground hummed like a drum," workers use the garden beds where the salamander moves. Micro-setting (amber, pool lip that burns palms, tamarisk tree) constrains the unsealing action. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("steam rose in curtains," "soot colored thread"). One slip: spatial choreography occasionally drifts—the exact positions of Nara and the narrator during the pool scene lack precise tracking. The salamander's final movement toward garden beds charges the ending image with the springs as ongoing site of repair.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The arboretum setting constrains Mina's exposure therapy choices and the lighthouse lens becomes a micro-setting that enables the pearl of stillness. The cypress sapling parallels her stakes-and-shelter formulation. Spatial choreography (gravel paths, glass pavilion, cliff edge) remains coherent. The reed-mat windbreaks function as both literal object and embodied metaphor that charges the final planting scene without resorting to overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse library—circular room, rising shelves, trapdoor, lens mechanism below—constrains Mara's physical descent and provides the webbed filaments that she must untangle, directly enabling the redesign action at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "dust glowed…with a luminescent ache," salt and cold ink rising from the stairwell. The closing-walls threat adds atmospheric pressure but does not materially alter her tactics on the page. The body (fingernails unknotting twine) and recurring objects (tarot cards, thread, canvas) function as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wind-carved encampment, disappearing ink bottle, hummingbird drone, and canyon obelisk are rendered with specific, purposeful detail that supports the core action. The encampment anchors the frame; the ink pool becomes the method of travel; the obelisk is the constraint Keir must breach. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (cross-legged at camp, stepping into ink, emerging at canyon, returning via spirals), though the "corridor of slow-moving dust" and canyon replay lack grounding sensory detail that would charge the final image. The drone as micro-setting object constrains the climax choice (mapping the pulse, revealing the seam), meeting the 9+ gate test, but the canyon itself reads more as backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library under snow and the frost-rimmed cabinets anchor place vividly and constrain the protagonist's choices (the retrieval slot, the dormant consoles behind walls). Sensory detail—echoing stone, muffled snow, flickering lights—reflects urgency and the protagonist's isolation without excessive catalog. The setting's function as a sealed, silenced archive directly shapes the central conflict and the final image of the library "humming beneath snow" charges the closure with purposeful environmental transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass dome, copper gutters, sand beds, and roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the roses' trained refusal to open when hands hold weapons directly shapes Tarek's decision. The dome's "calm that felt like an oath" and the filtered sun create a coherent atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear—Maris leads Tarek between beds, to the workbench, to the central bed—though the militia "outside" and Lio "from the shade of the water tanks" introduce a slight positional ambiguity about the dome's permeability. The setting charges the final image (planting at the dome's rim) and the sensory detail (soot like dark snow, roses burning orange and white) is filtered through the thematic lens of continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden constrains multiple choices: zigzag walking to avoid constellation-matching, reeds that howl softer with rhythm breaks, pool that answers his voiced silence. The rail spike's metallic memory and Mera's inked page function as micro-setting tools that enable and charge the final act. The Wave Arbor and trellis guide spatial movement and the final image (spike falling into pool) uses environment to seal the closure effect with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echoing observatory is anchored early (cable car, domed halls, red-lamp darkroom) and the acoustics ("every footstep returned in echoes") mirror Celeste's doubt. The rosewood nib and glass plates are handled tactilely across beats. Spatial choreography is clear (penthouse → cable car → observatory corridor → darkroom). The dust on the mislabeled plates constrains Celeste's final confrontation, charging the closure. Minor gap: the "white sea" and "ship" simile at the cable-car beat feel slightly decorative rather than tied to a present micro-choice, and occupational verisimilitude (astronomy logistics, grant mechanics) is sketched rather than deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The decommissioned observatory and laboratory shelves are vivid and purposeful, framing the lost-sounds collection as both archive and cathedral. The amber's warmth ("warm as skin") and the insect mid-flight supply tactile specificity that charges the tether moment. Spatial choreography is clear: alleys to hill, steel door to console, amber to port. The observatory ceiling "opening like night water" during the fold integrates setting into the climactic beat, though the city itself remains generic. The micro-setting (Lio's wrist, comet-tail ink) constrains the tether action and elevates Q3 eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (limestone walls "the color of watered lilacs," mist that makes footsteps sound distant) and recurs as both acoustic space and crucible. The tile flake and mandala function as micro-setting, constraining Inez's method and charging the final image when the boy smudges the outer ring. Spatial choreography (Inez kneeling on a flat stone, students in a circle, teacher watching) remains clear. The setting actively shapes choice: the grotto's echoes enable the proverb's fragmentation, and the mandala's rings organize the communal listening.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The plaza's ash-white stones, shattered sky, and chipped mosaic ground the setting with sensory specificity. The mosaic stepping stone constrains discovery (retrocognitive trap) and the tessera's blue fragment charges the final renaming beat. Spatial choreography is clear: plaza center, minaret base, storehouses. The iron frame functions as wearable micro-setting, pressuring others' reactions. Minor gap: the storehouses Lina guards are mentioned but not used to complicate access or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard setting is richly textured (apple trees in unnatural circles, hedges, small stage) and actively constrains: the fractured timeline forces Mara and Silas to navigate overlapping eras, and the hedge maze channels their ritual. Synesthetic details (green velvet air, distant brass) filter the space through Mara's POV. The stage boards become the site of closure when she presses the coin and whispers into them. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the alternating 1931/present moons create a palpable sense of temporal instability.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The studio setting is anchored early and provides concrete resources (violet wand, camera sensor, darkroom) that enable the lattice test and photo archive. The muscovite sliver functions as micro-setting, constraining how light splits and enabling the fractal route discovery. Spatial choreography during the square-walk test and tunnel expedition remains clear. The willowglass-hope motif recurs but does not visibly alter a choice at closure, limiting its charge. The exhibit wall functions thematically but lacks direct pressure on Mara's final negotiation with the recall company.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cave network constrains choices throughout: sealed exit forces reliance on the floating fossil, shell-lined tunnel and clay handprints provide tactile discovery, moonlight vent becomes the escape route. Sensory detail is filtered through Mina's training ("dripped in slow metronome clicks," "limestone," "shell fossils"), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from chamber to slit to older tunnel to vent. The environment charges the final image—Mina etches her map on slate and places the fossil in a niche, integrating geology and emotion. Minor: the "older tunnel" could use one more grounding detail to sharpen the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse beneath cliffs is vividly anchored with "unearthed silence" and sensory specificity (dust, resin, narrow stairs, intake platform). The buttons, hourglasses, and jar function as micro-setting elements that constrain Lysa's method and charge the final image. The cliffs participate actively in the closure (the canyon mouth returns the echo), meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Spatial choreography remains clear across the warehouse, platform, and cliff mouth.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Zephyr Bluff, mist, snow, tide cave, and the shed anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The pillbox and solder constrain Rina's repair tactics, and the snow codes shape the reunion beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mist as erasure, salt sting, sea wind masking frequency), filtered through Rina's spy-tradecraft priorities. The final image of the pillbox on the beam charges the closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog-bound crossing, gutter-tick, and ferryman's condition create spatial and temporal constraint that tightens the final beat. The yarn needle as micro-setting object charges the vellum-reading and final scratch. Sensory hierarchy is strong: spindrift, lamp halos, barley tea percolating. The river-mist bargain and Gloom Hill anchor setting in stakes rather than postcard detail.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oasis is vividly particular: "broken hives stacked like little kilns," "palms burned black at the tips," "brick chimney...shimmer, showing the same chimney built, burned, rebuilt." Micro-setting and recurring object (lantern, chimney, spring) constrain the protagonist's choices: he uses sun patterns traced on bricks to rotate the lantern, and the spring's state signals the final shift. The environment charges the closure image decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fire-escape planters, harbor pilings, and customs cages supply resources that alter tactics (mirror shards wedged between bolts to angle moonlight). Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical iron, skiff, and pier. The rosebush's stripped canes charge the final image, functioning as micro-setting that reconfigures meaning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (luminous spill of silver, quivering hush, oar rhythm). The lockmaster occupation reads plausible in scope and the mirrored-moonlight recurrence constrains the detective choice, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Tidal Library's vapor surges constrain the narrator's brittle awakenings and charge the wrinkled-page image at closure. The brass sundial's atomically reflective grooves enable the light-script reveal. The stone circle's hum and lichen-covered pillars ground the pivotal translation beat. Micro-setting (body + tool) drives two key choices: placing the sundial on the flat stone and transcribing the script into ordinary ink. Sensory detail is filtered through reincarnation perspective ("moa eyes catching dawn") and serves pressure without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and storm-aftermath sensory details (wet stone, jasmine) ground the opening cleanly. The thrush's nest spiral constrains the final choice by becoming the installation's centerpiece, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (causeway, desk, floating platforms) tracks clearly. Sensory selection reflects the narrator's professional lens (envelopes, ink, paper as texture). No occupational depth issues; the ghostwriter trade reads plausible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The radio station's "glass and rust," the observatory dome, the studio transmitter, and the spectrum analyzer all anchor the setting concretely. The astronomical charts constrain Mara's choice twice (she traces alignments, then uses them as evidence), and the subsonic shield device charges the final act. The fault line "split the town into east and west, signal and silence" elegantly mirrors the social divide. Minor gap: the vigil and rally outside remain postcard description rather than sensory immediacy that shapes Mara's tactical window.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nexus as a space that "argues," "votes," and refuses geometry is specific and charged; the organ reverberation functions as sonar and constraint, shaping the narrator's steps ("only on notes that rang clean"). The compass point as tool constrains choice twice (mortar strike, final planting) and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the mutinous architecture; the body's claustrophobia filters perception throughout ("enclosed dark made my lungs tighten"). The shadowed nexus under starlight recurs as frame and final anchor, grounding the drift.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wine-red ribbon, calipers, gray paper, and tin-roofed rehearsal shed anchor the investigation convincingly. The quarry mist functions as more than atmosphere—it charges the entry into the shed and mirrors the protagonist's face-blindness ("in fog every person becomes any person"). The matching ribbon on the wall lance supplies a concrete constraint that pivots the interrogation. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations (studio, quarry theater, shed interior), and the fog-muffled footsteps at dawn create sensory density tied to the POV's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The experimental weather station setting is vivid and purposeful: the dehumidified cabinet, the GIS lab, the radar dome, and the cliff cemetery all constrain and enable Mara's actions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("the air tasting of rust," "fog," "wet concrete"). The copper nail and the annex door function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. The setting subtly mirrors the thematic concern with memory and exile through the juxtaposition of modern instruments and buried history.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bridge, scaffold wrap, mountain pullout, and collodion process are rendered with concrete sensory detail ("white plastic stitched to steel, billow and snap," "poured collodion like moonlit syrup"). The scaffold wrap functions as both clue and atmospheric device, its fluttering revealing the arrow and later reappearing to frame the hitchhiker's spectral return. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains the middle choice (hidden box, service road) and charges the final image (wrap flashing white through pines), lifting the score into mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges multiple choices: it becomes lab, refuge, investor meeting place, and the site where the protagonist tests loop theory with pinned bills and chalk arrows. The train's "paint dulled to a dusky harmony of reds and soot" and "dust fell like stage glitter" anchor tone and filter perception through the protagonist's lens. The territorial markers (chalk arrows, ribbon, stones) act as tactile setting elements that enable the dissuasion scene and the final escape breadcrumb trail. Spatial choreography remains clear across the warehouse district, the lion car interior, the tracks, and the dining car.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory—salt flats, rotating maps, brass instruments—is anchored early and returns at closure. The dream temple courtyard offers vivid sensory detail ("pulsing stars like slow breathing," "air cooled as if exhaling"), and the variable stars constrain the narrator's decode method. The daylily-pressed telegram and Nera's brother's field journal function as small recurring objects that charge key beats. Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the observatory itself does not constrain a choice until the very end (Nera reads under the dome); much of the middle uses the dream courtyard as the active setting, which slightly dilutes the title location's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The swirling orchard vortex, ice coffin, and mirror-cage are vivid and purposeful, constraining Thalen's method of entry and shaping the unbending choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through druidic perception: "air smelled of apples that never ripened," "Cold seized my lungs." The lake's machinery—mirror shards, sprouting teeth, the twin's open mouth—charges the final image. Spatial choreography (boat anchored on roots, descent through rings, ice coffin wedged in silt) is clear and evolves causally.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt glade's metallic leaves and "air tasted of rain" are vivid and sensory. The topiary clipping is handled twice (proof at entry, blood-touched at climax) and charges the final image as a shared compass. Spatial choreography is mostly clear: Lysa steps close, the visionary's palm holds the sprig, her scar presses it. The glade's blue light sharpens when the clipping is shown, suggesting setting responds to action. However, the "round clearing in the maze" and "black disk... eclipsed seal" lack spatial anchoring—are these physical or mental? The ambiguity doesn't obscure the closure image but prevents the environment from fully constraining choice in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard constrains Mira's navigation ("when a femur pointed east, she turned east") and charges the closure: the silver thread caught among roots becomes the tactile site of her final bargain. Micro-setting (tarot card burning on tomb lid, ash falling "like dark pollen into the bones") integrates action and atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's divinatory bias. The half-lit corridors function as both spatial constraint (she refuses brighter light to avoid waking the dead) and tonal anchor. One small distance slip: "lanterns hung in their branches" introduces new light sources without explaining how they coexist with the earlier warning about bright light.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry office trailer functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: thin walls humming, window overlooking the stone scar, isolation enabling overnight work with the scrap. The pit's acoustic memory (crowd roar "rolled off the quarry walls and came back doubled") charges the final listening-station proposal. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (tarp "smelled of rain," grille cloth texture measured with calipers). Spatial choreography remains clear across office, crate, corkboard, and pit view, with the valley's "stone throat" holding voices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic arbor constrains choice (the field snaps when he tightens grip, warning against possession) and charges the final image (planting the seed between magnetic roots). Sensory selection is purposeful: cold iron and apple skin taste, the weight-drop sensation, the seed's hum. Spatial choreography is clear (observatory ring among ironwood trunks, platform, infirmary below). Micro-setting qualifies: the seed in the glass dish and the horn used for calibration are handled, not merely described. Tool and body constrain tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal atrium is rendered with purposeful specificity—grates, floodline, dry upper ring—and actively constrains the librarian's preservation work (titan-gear required, timing dictated by tides). The creel, furnace, and shelves function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the narrator wades through "waterlogged aisle" watching books "learning to migrate." Sensory detail (winter light on knuckles, river mud smell, sea breath) is filtered through the narrator's archival priorities. The moon as a temporal and memory anchor coheres with the setting's logic. Minor gap: spatial choreography during the creel-lowering and bookmark-distribution beats could be sharper; we lose exact positioning of the furnace relative to the atrium basin.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered ("mineral spires caught their lantern light and broke it into silent rainbows") and the seashell fossil with hair-thin confession markings functions as micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear: entrance → storerooms → maintenance shaft → caves → back to the entrance at dawn. The pearl crowning the door at dawn supplies the final image with concrete environmental detail. Sensory selection remains filtered through Mara's professional attention (blast valves, water pumps) early, then shifts to wonder in the caves without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    The disused railway station is vivid and purposeful: ivy threading ticket windows, the sheltered bathroom, the platform edge all constrain movement and choices. The corroded intake gate—half buried in silt—serves as the micro-setting that charges the final action sequence. Spatial choreography is coherent (tunnel to bathroom to riverbank behind station), and sensory detail (rust, wet leaves, tape on bellows) is filtered through the protagonist's guilt-driven attention. The station's decay mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing library constrains choice through its mechanics: blank spines that "exhale words," light pulses with measurable lags, and shelves that respond to the watch's reversals. The confidence man's watch functions as micro-setting, its cyclical reversals forcing backward steps in the canal district and later serving as the decoding mechanism at the reading table. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "wet and warm" air, "bottled dawn" glow, mist carrying faint radiance. The environment is handled tactilely (he sets the watch down, touches the codex) and its properties directly enable the final discovery. Spatial choreography in the canal district and library interior remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet observatory is vivid and purposeful: violet drapes to stop stray light, frost-silk lining, service hatch shown by the figs. The setting constrains choice (vent shaft enables smuggling, dome's slit frames the intended performance) and charges the final image (terrace garden, festival alleys). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("every footstep sound like an apology"). The basil pots and fern house anchor micro-setting that alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora supply vivid anchors ("frost-slick stone," "stone bier rimed with ice") and the setting constrains Mara's ritual: only here does "the aurora's whisper meet the planet's silence without interference." The emerald chip on Orin's tongue catches the aurora light and scatters it into his throat, making the environment integral to the closure mechanism. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and sensory detail (the "crackle" of static, the "radiant hush") modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sky vineyard, fig trees, and umbral grotto are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dripping water, fermenting-foam clouds, loam and pale vines). The hairpin-as-key and scalloped wall constrain Mara's discovery sequence, and the grotto's cycle-mirror charges the final decision to plant and climb again. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the ascent and return. Minor: the grotto's mechanics (how a hairpin "seam" opens stone) brush against plausibility without full grounding, but the effect supports the accumulative design and the body-in-space texture is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the lighthouse at dawn, wind chimes tuned in code, the spiral stairs, the lantern room. The chimes constrain Mara's entry ("do not trust your certainty" shapes her choice to enter without a knife), and the cloak itself functions as micro-setting, a tactile object that "drinks the dawn and breathes it back as questions." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional priorities. The breezy lighthouse environment charges the final image—the dawn, the extinguished fire ring, the ash between them—grounding the thematic resolution in concrete spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating platform, sycamore hush, pond geometry, and magnetic grotto are vivid and purposeful. The magnetism constrains perception (pennies taste, jacket buttons tug) and the cave's iron-pull directly enables the vanishing mechanism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across platform → grove → cliffside → cave interior. The pond's ripple patterns function as micro-setting that charges the instructional beats, and the final empty entrance reweights the opening platform image with absence. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: detail sharpens during trance instruction, then narrows to magnetism and starlight in the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bone towers function as both setting and instrument: wind tunnels through sockets to create organ music, and the tower's crown amplifies Oren's tone until the canyon answers. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—striations on the arrowhead match the canyon's sound lines, dust carries footfall memories. The arrowhead placed point-down on the tower's crown acts as a compass needle made of silence, directly shaping Oren's method. Spatial choreography is clear (climbs tower, places arrowhead, waits, hums). The environment constrains and enables his final success, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    The icebound spire and terrace garden constrain Davin's path and charge the final image: "frozen roses shaped from hoarfrost," the "plain limestone with a thumbprint of quartz," and the folly's silence when the automaton enters all pressure the closure choice. The spire's "accommodated impossibilities" (stairs that "argue with geometry") function as micro-setting that alters tactics (Davin stops trying to understand and lets the spire carry him). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Davin's priorities—"silver dark where lanterns became halos"—and the folly's "low, brilliant dimness" anchors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The forgotten library constrains the protagonist's discovery—glass cases preserve the vellum cards, the registry slot accepts the key tag—and the shattered porthole delivers the sky-lantern counterpoint that charges the final violet bloom. Sensory detail (silt, waving curtains, muffled applause as silver rain) is vivid and selective, filtered through the lamplighter's synesthetic bias. The underwater setting's micro-elements (narrow brass slot, emergency lanterns, card pressed to chest) all participate in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ambered observatory deck, contracting sky, and museum coins function as micro-setting that constrains choice: amber panels "glow as if sunlight has been remembered," coins "click...like stubborn little planets," and the edgewise coin's roll becomes spatial proof of time choosing. The split dish and thin power reserves impose material limits that Mara must work around. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: visual (bruised sky, amber glow) and tactile (coins in palm, deck tremble) dominate high-pressure beats, while the void's "stuttering" static provides auditory specificity filtered through her professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: mirrors must be angled, the lens "waited," and the phonograph requires manual turning. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("cold brass and rain," "thin bridges" of light beams). The atlas page with sea monsters provides a surface that "seemed to breathe" and accepts the crystallized names, directly enabling the final act of tucking the crystal "where the ocean was blank." The setting charges the closure by providing the mechanism (scattered light through the great lens) that makes the transformation possible.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sapphire viaduct stones, the measuring basin, and the dripping water constrain Evin's method and charge the closure: he must time his breath between drips, and the bell hangs from the viaduct as a substitute prow. The harbor's silence, the green-with-salt bell, the cooled-flame dawn light are filtered through Evin's mechanical lens. The final image—viaduct stones brighten, sea tilts like a listening ear—ties setting to the cosmic rebalancing. Micro-setting (the basin, the blue stones, the net cord) shapes every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ridgeway corkboard, exposed rooflines, bar counter, and boot print in mud are vivid and purpose-driven. The wind chime functions as micro-setting that charges both opening and closure. Spatial choreography is clear across the levee station, ridgeway, and bar doorway. Minor gap: the reservoir's physical mechanics (seep meters, weak banks) are mentioned but not shown constraining a choice on the page, remaining atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and silver-barked trees create a vivid, purposeful environment filtered through Liora's alchemist lens. Sensory detail is selective and layered—"roar turned into a hush," "fruit that smelled like rain on stone"—without tourism. The cracked basin and ash-black hearth anchor the setting as a constraint (relics of an older laboratory) and the orchard functions as more than backdrop: the starlings' flight and the waterfall's refracted light directly enable her solution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous scene, and the "ancient freshness" tone integrates organically with the orchard's sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nocturnal arbor is vivid and specific (leaves like black glass, slick trunk, thin branches), and the high fork physically constrains the protagonist's position and sightlines. The setting enables the trap (southern crown with thin branches and wind) and the final act (climbing down, cinching lines in the netting). Micro-setting (the buckle as tactile anchor) and sensory hierarchy (prioritizing sound over sight) reflect the protagonist's professional focus. Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and confrontation, though the arbor's exact scale and the parachute mechanics remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating dojo with gravity ropes, wind bells in two tones, and the edge falling into cloud is vivid and purposeful. The dojo edge stage-manages the trial, and the wind shift correlates with history's flux. Spatial choreography (highest slab, mat, edge, jar placement) remains clear. The setting constrains the trial's staging and charges the final image—the protagonist guides staves and signatures "into the same circle" on the mat—meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice, though the tactile engagement could be sharper in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The echo chamber tunnel is not mere backdrop: its acoustics enable the lullaby's return, the grime holds trapped laughter, the dripping water becomes an ingredient, and the curve toward daylight provides the escape route for sound. The leaf blower nozzles, rusted bucket, wet leaves, and mist all constrain or enable Bram's ritual. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (fuel stink sharp as memories, mist smells like autumn and detergent, pulp steams by the radiator). The apartment's airtight quality and the laundromat hum below are economically sketched. Spatial choreography is clean: tunnel floor, headlamp cone, curve, climb out, home radiator, windowsill.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: roses cast shadows when the pendant brightens, hedges frame the threshold, and breathing the garden "as if it were a book" becomes the tactical method. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's particular perception ("foggy lucidity of thoughts that almost became daylight"). The pendant as recurring object charges the final image when it becomes dull stone with a catalog card. Spatial choreography remains clear across the circling, the shelves, and the inward turn.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember nexus supplies heat, basalt, and a furnace pit that enable the transformation; the "frozen bloom" leaning closer and the pit's final collapse to glass charge the closure image. Sensory detail (iron, saffron, old prayers) and spatial choreography (rings, center, stone table) remain coherent. The setting constrains choice—Mara must use the nexus's ember breath—and the environment's collapse completes the creative destruction, meeting the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The suspended city, gorge, copper clamp, vacuum tubes, and the physical act of loosening rusted plates all constrain Mara's tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail (ozone, old copper, humming bolts under moonlight) is selective and filtered through a signal interpreter's professional attention. The environment is a lived-in workspace, not a postcard. The hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting when wedged against the falling mast, and the spatial choreography (catwalks, stairwell, roof, workbench) remains coherent across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto under starlight constrains the climactic choice: Lina must aim the ferry there, and the blue salt light and hovering ferry above the black pool provide the physical stage for the seam-stitching. The hourglass (empty vs. full) and the sideways harbor clocks function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the clocks "straightened with a reluctant click." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("smelled of coffee," "water drew a single map between them"), filtered through Lina's professional perception. The spatial choreography of two ferries touching on a gangway remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gallery's "honest lies," sinew as surgical leftover, and the mirror that "showed no face, only more thread" constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (floor grids → hanging webs → central chamber maze). The sinew's tactile presence—"sang softly," "scraped," "brushed their sleeves"—keeps the micro-setting active. Sensory selection reflects urgency (calm that "scraped," fever easing as memories alter). No slips touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    The benthic city is vividly realized—basalt towers, biolamps, silt storms, pressure doors—and its constraints (sonar navigation, quarantine bay, elevator pod through kilometers of dark water) actively shape Mara's tactics. The chain link functions as micro-setting object, its curve and angles constraining her method and charging the final act when she holds it against the stars. Spatial choreography (classroom dome, quarantine bay, surface) remains coherent across transitions. The surface moment—"horizon that did not curve away into black"—delivers charged specificity that reconfigures prior subterranean enclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium, stairwell, and decades-old hearing aid are vivid and purposeful. The hearing aid's "tiny pulse" and "four quick pulses" constrain Mara's tracking choices and charge the final image when it grows warm. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara moves from atrium to corridors to stairwell to atrium. The photograph's soot-smudged "PLEASE" offers tactile, lived-in detail that shifts meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The facility's salt-crusted consoles, wet copper smell, and pressure-lock chamber constrain every move. The reactor coil becomes micro-setting: its warming hum and fog-without-bubbles enable the impossible passage, and Mara's body (shoulders in the gap, condensation on lashes) is the terrain she navigates. The codex page's gold fleck physically tracks the cable's field, guiding her to the terminal. The crashing-hush surf marks time and frames the final return to ordinary sound, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory dome, telescope, snow, and server-room hard drives "tick like small insects" provide spatial grounding and sensory texture. The porcelain shard (warm from her palm, "as if it remembers the hot coffee") and the ink-soaked charts function as micro-setting that charges the ritual beats. The "snow shifts on the dome" and "static free sky opens" bracket the ritual and final image. The shard and ink constrain the repair-script method and charge the closure gesture (leaving a clean cup on the console). Environment and recurring object shape choice and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel of echoes and bone towers constrain Ilen's tactics throughout: he must time whispers to avoid cacophony, the diamond placement in a crack matters, and the canyon's geometry (wind funneling through ribs of stone) enables the translation method. The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting, vibrating "like an eager mouth" and requiring physical scraping to match Toma's voice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the "dry rasp" from the chipped edge, ash-gray swifts drawing a slow spiral (the Vey sign for return), and Ilen's copper-veined fingers used as tuning fork. The canyon evolves causally—unpatterned repeats threaten uniformity when swifts don't fly, then late flock restores structure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underground garden functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: warm earth, glowing plants, pots that slide uphill establish the gravitational playfulness and pressure Mara's anchor-planting tactic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("air tasted of iron, honey, and the old grief"), and the flint arrowhead's hum and Edda's claim it "pins the world down" charge the final beat when Mara uses it as a tent-stake. Spatial choreography remains clear across the shop-to-garden descent and the climactic lure scene. The cordless phone by the potting bench integrates setting and method cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard's sap-over-coal smell, bolted tree with PROPERTY tags, and statue joints that "rasped like gears in sand" are sensory and purposeful. The locust shell in bark notch and chains quivering "like guilty teeth" constrain Lio's method. Spatial choreography is clear: gate → trees → center → trunk. The final image—tree walking, statues following—charges the space with transformed meaning. No reach for 9+ band because setting supplies resources but doesn't decisively narrow a live choice beyond enabling the method already planned.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt arcade's shattered skylights, sensor towers, and rooftop staging constrain the smuggler confrontation and charge the opening/closing images. Nela's thinness and the bottle's rattle supply tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is mostly clean (stairwell, cart block, drone in arms). Timeframe (twilight at daily drop) tightens the smuggler launch window. Setting participates in closure (arcade recurs, clinic gate as destination) but does not directly alter the final choice beyond framing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The halo fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the repair choice by casting "a faint ring of light that showed every grain of wood as if it were a map." The oasis hidden within the train's ribcage provides water that loosens the misting hush, directly altering Rowan's capacity. Wind bells sewn from bottle caps and the marsh-train environment are filtered through Rowan's silent carpenter perspective. Spatial choreography (corridor, junction, unlit car, oasis, crate) tracks cleanly across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library's nested reading rooms and hyperbolic geometry constrain Mara's search and supply the mechanic for discovery—she must measure angles and rotate her hand "as her diagram required" to open the pocket. The scarf as micro-setting object charges the closure: it's wrapped back "not as a relic but as a key." Sensory detail (river water, coal smoke, grain shifting "like a living proof") is selective and filtered through Mara's priorities. Spatial choreography of the narrow gap behind the non-Euclidean elegies section is coherent. The scientific poetry library's specificity (equations shelved beside odes, "Thermodynamics of Yearning") is purposeful and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archipelago's "cliffs whispered across narrow channels" and the library's back room where prints develop create spatial coherence. The watercolor palette and camera function as micro-setting tools that constrain Mina's method: she must capture sunrise at "the exact minute the sea turned to glass." The eastern watchtower and high library window structure her attempts spatially. The final beat uses the hanging cipher between stacks and the doorway of light to charge closure. Sensory detail is vivid—"salt-stiff hands," "luminous absence," light that "throbs like a heartbeat"—and filtered through Mina's obsessive focus. Minor gap: the "whispering" archipelago remains more lyric atmosphere than a constraint that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ravine, spiral stairs, and starred-ceiling room create spatial disorientation that mirrors the protagonist's internal lock. The pool reflecting stars and the locksmith's comma-tool are micro-settings that constrain the ritual's choreography. Sensory detail—"cold metal and distant rain," "stars hung low"—is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's longing. The red ribbon and the lock of hair function as charged objects that participate in the unlocking sequence. The final paragraph's "shadowed nexus…closed like a book" charges the setting as a threshold that has now altered the protagonist's carry-forward state.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and algae-filmed dome create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Lissa's choices: she must learn to dive, navigate darkness with a lantern, and approach the mushroom ring underwater. The drowned orchard and raised bed supply the fairy ring, and the painted zodiac on the glass roof provides the map she studies. Sensory detail—rust and old apples in the water, cool mushroom cap, apple-sweet and iron-clean taste—is specific and filtered through her folklorist's attention. The final image of her repainting constellations charges the setting with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The forgotten library functions as micro-setting, supplying tools (cracked teacup, glass pane, shard-mirrors) that constrain and enable Lio's method. The brass exile tag, teacup, and glass pane recur with purpose; the playground swing outside bookends the piece and reinforces the mood of suspension. Spatial choreography is clear (table, door, lamps, swing outside) and sensory detail is selective (dust smell, swing creaking). The trapped afternoon shadow and shard-mirrors charge the final image when Mara aligns them. The setting pressures Mara's choice: she must work within the archive's geometry to reverse the sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The parapet crack, waterfall mist beading on shears, and the seed locket are vivid and purposeful. The jars lined with beeswax and the doorway in falling water constrain choices—Soren cannot cross without the ritual, and the narrator must pour essence onto the seed. Sensory detail is filtered through the POV's creative lens ("ink the color of their scent," "bell underwater"). Spatial choreography is clear across the threshold crossing. The bruised patches in the other orchard provide tactile pressure that shapes the pruning and drawing actions at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly realized—angled walls bending starlight, quartz staircase, salt mirrors—and the setting constrains the protagonist's choices (descent to slab, needle work in the burial chamber). The tapestry needle and the net function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through urgency (hush "pressed back, dense as wool"). Minor dock: the sanctuary's spatial choreography is mostly clear, but the transition from slab to chamber and the spirits' simultaneous presence above the slab and later dropping "to the floor" introduces a slight spatial ambiguity. Tone (lucid unrest) is well-supported by setting; the environment actively participates in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shop above the harbor, the torn chart on the worktable, the henge ring, and the rain-scoured vault are all vivid and purposeful. The framing knife, notebook, and camera anchor Lena's professional lens, and the vault's pale fresco and persistent water constrain her investigation and charge the final archive decision. Spatial choreography (counter → back room → henge → stairway → alcove → ascent) remains clear across the full sequence. The setting works actively: the torn map divides known from unknown, the henge's seam marks the threshold, and the vault's dampness becomes "soft applause" at closure, reweighting the silence motif.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: "shelves now pitched like ribs around a drowned nave," "paper turns to lace, the way ink becomes a bruise." The snow globe functions as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's interpretation and charging the final image. Dive equipment (slate, waterproof player, tether line) and the steel box with communication wires ground the action. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional attention (depth pressure, reel mechanics). The freighter's history (banned books, wartime conversion) supplies atmospheric context without distraction. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the dive sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard's wet stones, floating sundials, parapet graffiti layers, and bolt-plate holes as musical stave constrain Lio's encoding method and charge the final spark-strike image. Storm metal smell and phosphor afterglow filter through Lio's attentiveness to atmospheric pressure. The brass-gear lute, memory chip, and charcoal guide anchor micro-setting as tools that enable the encoding action. Spatial choreography (kneeling by parapet, sliding plate under charcoal) remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, elevator mechanics, and goggles constrain Lysa's choices: she uses the goggles' ground lenses to decode the diary, the elevator's maintenance hatch and brake cable become her tools for sabotage, and the frozen environment charges the atmosphere. Sensory selection is purposeful—"grit of ice in their hinges," "prismatic shimmer," "muffled and distant" hangar lights—filtered through her careful, ascending perspective. Spatial choreography remains clear across ten floors and the service corridor. Minor excess: some description (e.g., "like a frozen candle") borders on ornamental without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gondola's rocking "like a loose tooth," the brass telescope "dented and warm," the anvil cloud "sparkled like crushed mica in moonlight," and the catenary line "trembled with old vortices" all constrain Mara's choices and charge the final image. The telescope's physical weight carves the channel; its return "swinging like a pendulum" seeds the tactical success. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: she reads wind shear, names storm edges, watches backscatter haze. The micro-setting (telescope as anchor-object) directly shapes the climactic move. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hollowed oak library with spiral shelves "like ribs" and the heartwood panel smooth "as a closed eyelid" constrain Liora's movements and encode the secret. The coin's faint indentations require light, touch, and fractal translation—specific micro-setting that enables her central action. The demolition crew's distant engines and the foreman's boots anchor the temporal pressure. The final painted ceiling becomes a charged object that reweights the commission: not a copy of the outside sky but a recursive map that fits inside walls. Spatial choreography is clean; the ladder, desk, and panel track coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The brass-ribbed airship, chart room, hopscotch board, and porthole anchor spatial detail throughout. The hopscotch board's worn squares constrain Lio's charting method and enable the light's movement, directly shaping the central turn. Starling murmurations provide atmospheric pressure and a visual parallel to the spirals Lio traces, though their direct influence on choice is lighter. The antique airship setting charges the final image as the engines wake, making environment essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library is vividly anchored (frost-lace doors, air "ground into powder," iced table) and the clockmaker's gear assortment constrains her final choice—she cannot simply take, so she files her own. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mara's locksmith focus (oil traced along the slit, teeth counting heartbeats). The hall of mirrors supplies spatial pressure and the iced table enforces the return rule, both shaping tactics. Micro-setting (the gear against her pulse) charges the climax, meeting the 9+ gate threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating arches, pear orchards, and butterfly garden are vivid and consistent, with sensory details (pollen, milkweed, windblown thorns) woven through action. The brass bell is handled twice (rung to summon Serren, rung again at the relay well) and the chalk messages appear in multiple beats, both constraining the crew's tactics. However, the relay well itself—the closure pivot—remains abstract; we never learn how hands "rebuilt it together" or what cables-across-arches means in spatial terms, weakening the micro-setting test at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse, workbench, clock, and pane of hush are vivid and purposefully integrated: the gears constrain Mara's adjustments, the pane opens under her tinkering, and the puppet head sits on the bench as both tool and anchor. Spatial choreography is clear (lantern room, basement, shore), and the "depthless window" showing strangers charges the final third. The setting directly enables the closure action (the clock's gears demand her heartbeat) and the pane's spread across continents supplies the story's conceptual payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds constrains choices throughout: the forty-seven-minute frost deadline, the birds' patrol confusion when the waystone sings, the child pinned under a bent wing. The nut as micro-object charges the final image by becoming "quiet inside the stone." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("tears steam in the cold air," "brass wings click in the dusk"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through "seven right, two down, one back." The orchard-as-shadow and wind-bitten fruit anchor the setting in the opening, and the environment evolves causally (frost threading corners, birds returning "with a sound like reluctant applause").

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The braided ravine functions as both setting and conceptual anchor: gravel bars, foam rafts, scalloped patterns, and ruined abutments ground spatial action and directly enable the polymer insight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (chemist sees "boundary conditions," "shear lines"). The ravine constrains choice—Mara must come here to trace patterns—and charges the final image when she crosses the new bridge and hears the hammer-water duet. Field station and cairn provide micro-settings that advance beats without catalog padding. Minor limitation: the "warm rock" and "confluence" moments trend slightly generic in phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass orchard library floating on clouds is vividly anchored early and charges the final image: the protagonist moves toward "the root of the orchard." Spatial choreography (cart beneath glass boughs, reading table hung over open sky) remains coherent, and the bottled moonlight functions as micro-setting, constraining the incision method. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"pale pulse," "swirling sea of clouds"—filtered through the vendor's bias toward blanks and patterns. The environment enables the closure choice by providing the root-address in the margin.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    The desert-as-former-shore conceit operates throughout: rainwater pools analyzed as tidal formations, coral pavilion beneath dunes, brine smell rising from the sinkhole. Setting constrains the descent choice (storm reveals the sinkhole) and the pavilion's frost-glazed coral architecture charges the final image of preservation and release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from courtyard to map room to sinkhole to cavity to return. Micro-setting detail (salt crystals, resin jars, ice under sand) shapes Safi's choice to unwrap his hands and accept direct contact.

    The astronomical clock tower is vividly anchored with brass planets, spiral stairs, inspection hatch, and speaking tube; these details constrain Mara's nocturnal work and enable the counterweight mechanism. The cuckoo clock weight's physical use (fastened, lowered, retrieved) makes the tower's systems tactile. Grain-dust scent and Elevator Nine's cracked concrete add sensory specificity. However, the repair's spatial choreography (welding a catwalk, bolting roof sections) remains gestural, and the mayor's sudden arrival lacks spatial grounding. The weight's return to the satchel charges the final image modestly, though the tower itself does not evolve or resist during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit canyon, periscope half-buried in shale, and the rusted dream-mine instruments provide concrete anchors. The mirror's cracked reflection constrains Nira's final choice: she modifies it to "give each memory a clean angle of return," and the periscope tube at the end renders the canyon wall "translucent with layered sleeping histories," charging the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful ("sand gnawed," "moon fractured into a dozen pale eyes") and filtered through Nira's engineer lens. Spatial choreography is clear across the rim-to-floor descent, though the dream-mine mechanics remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto's inverted gravity, upward-dripping water, and calcite door constrain Ilya's choices at multiple beats (seeds settle into a crack-stair, door ripples when seeds are pressed). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "viscous air," "fog and salt," "books hung like bats." The prism compass functions as micro-setting, filtering gray into bands that reveal carvings and sort dial marks—directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the spiral descent and antechamber ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grove, monument, and porcelain insulator form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: sap-rise changes tension, the monument's cracks map her score, roots carry vibrations. Sensory detail is purposeful—"cool and dense" porcelain, quivering wire, moss-buried stone—filtered through her tactile attention. The insulator functions as both tool and spatial anchor, charging the final image when left hanging. Spatial choreography (wire between alders, block pressed to insulator) remains clear across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered with compasses spinning, iron dust spirals, and field murmurs that respond to chess-piece placement. The travel board functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining Sable's method of listening. The dust's crescent formation when the pawn moves forward demonstrates how environment shapes and validates his interpretation. Spatial choreography remains clear across the field, elder's approach, and council hall.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop under stars, velvet mat, and skylight provide tactile grounding; the resonator as tool constrains Lio's method and charges the closure when he uses it as a "stethoscope" on crates. Sensory detail is selective (smoke and lavender scent, summer dust) and filtered through Lio's attention. The town square and crates supply spatial stakes, and the final return to the workshop bookends the frame. The micro-setting (diary on velvet mat, resonator dial) does light work shaping choices, but the broader environment remains somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The treetop village is spatially coherent—spiral ladders, rope bridges, canopy gardens, compost shrine—and the olfactory layer (sulfur/honey, crushed fern) anchors Jun's POV. The corpse flower's stench and the moths' role in rot management constrain Etsu's choice to withhold the seed, and the mudflats below frame her return. Minor limitation: the "turning of the tide's thought" phrase recurs but remains ornamental; it does not shape a tactical choice or tighten the window.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating rock arches, inverted gravity, and irrigation channels climbing like glass ladders create vivid, purposeful constraint. Water-flow navigation is signaled early and pressures her route choice at the climax. The arrow tip's warmth and the stone tree with embedded tips function as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory detail (violet sky, orbiting fruit, whirling silence) is filtered through Lysa's pilot attention and supports the lyric accumulation without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth constrains choice throughout: wind patterns guide the search, the cylindrical stack functions as both concealment and acoustic weapon, and the investigator's final sprint to crack seals directly depends on spatial choreography. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cold vapor, muted rhythm, air behaving like liquid. The patch and sensor rig function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image. The convergence concept depends on spatial configuration, earning high marks for constraint-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ice cavern is concretely realized—lanternlight, veined marble block, stalactites, dripping tunnel—and directly constrains the crisis: the sculpted hush "clenches" in the enclosed space, Maera's breath makes no sound, and the cavern "answers with soft thunder" when Lio plays. The amber music sheet as micro-object charges the final image: its notes darken "like resin swallowing fireflies," visibly recording the new pattern. Spatial choreography (Lio unrolls the sheet on the marble block, hangs bells from wrists) remains clear. The alternating stillness and drips on the climb back subtly mirror the oscillating repose theme, and the Council hall's shuttered windows provide pointed contrast to the aurora-lit cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Thunder-echo range constrains action: sound "sink[s], avalanchingly quiet and heavy," the split boulder functions as a threshold, and the driftwood markers are tactile wayfinding tools that matter. The altered canyon on the other side—"clouds frozen like ash," "taste of iron rain"—signals changed rules and pressures Liora's final understanding. The lacquered case, pale driftwood, and throat-shaped boulder anchor spatial choreography across the crossing. Setting detail is filtered through Liora's relic-keeper priorities and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The topaz workshop under vanishing stars creates a coherent micro-setting where starlight quality affects her work and the cosmic instability mirrors her internal fragmentation. The halo fragment's physical properties (hummed, honey-gold sheen, edges filed to fit the forme) constrain her process and charge the final image. The recurring star-vanishing motif tracks through the narrative and tightens at "the darkest interval" when she prints the blank sheet, then releases as stars reappear—environment and internal state interweave without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ridgeway's aurora, scree, cairns, and iron-rich mountain constrain the closure: the pendant vibrates sympathetically with "the buried iron of the mountain," making the setting an active participant in the final reconfiguration. The lamplighter encounter demonstrates how the route itself extends brief moments. The cairn as anchor for Rook's chalk question charges the final image with spatial specificity. Sensory detail (green curtains, frozen scree, felt buzz) is selective and tied to pressure rather than catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quartz arbor in mist, river clay on boots, and frost-filmed windshield supply concrete anchors that constrain the communion (frost must not be scraped, prism set against glass). The car itself functions as micro-setting: windshield, steering wheel, radio knobs, rearview mirror absorb emotion and become tools that charge the final image. The salvage yard's muted dogs and pale streetlamp frame the "shifted hush" spatially. The prism on the sister's dresser at closure—an object moved from arbor to home—carries setting pressure forward and charges the ending with cold spectra thrown across the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard, bamboo culms, and loom constrain Yara's space and choices (she cannot leave, must weave within the puzzle-edge frame). The puzzle edges function as micro-setting: they map the coast and fence the loom, shaping tactics. Sensory details (mulberry bark thread, soot on amber, salt crust on Jun) are selective and POV-filtered. Deduction: the village square and market rummage sale remain generic placeholders without spatial choreography or lived texture; the orchard's transformation ("faded beyond" the puzzle frame) is asserted but not grounded in concrete perceptual change.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock arches, bruised-fruit orchards, and abandoned mine shafts constrain Lio's repair strategy and supply the ore/stone he smelts. Sensory details (hard azure sky, dust-breathing shafts, boulder warming) are vivid and filtered through Lio's focus. The arches' glowing underside when steadied charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the precise mechanics of how the silk "wakes" stone and how rods "bite rock" remain impressionistic rather than concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The repair bay's "broken conduits and unfinished hull plates" and coolant smear guide sensory mapping choices, and the shard functions as both prop and constraint (clamp, prism, seam-opener). Spatial choreography remains clear across parallel-universe shifts, with each Dock Seven variant offering distinct atmospheric detail (fresh coolant, open hatch, intact terminal). The green shard charges the final image by enabling the log amendment, satisfying the 9+ gate, but occupational detail (sensory mapping kit: chalk, microphone) decorates more than it constrains mid-scene choices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The haunted lantern room, the brass table with sea glass, the shingle beach, and the stone cairns all constrain choices and charge the final image. The lens "gleam[s] with an aching, drowned luminescence," the wind pushes at panes, and Noah's body (bleeding fingers, chest sore) anchors the work. The cairn grammar (three flat stones = safe water, single tall = come) teaches a micro-setting rule that enables the trawler's horn response and the climactic "come" stack with Maris. The setting drives action rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse, glass wick, and emerald shutters are richly specific and constrain key choices: the narrator uses the wick's polished length to redirect light inward, and the paper cutouts bleed green into their fibers. Sensory detail (salt spray, raw throat, "wet ink") is purposeful and embodied. The post-newspaper coastal setting matters to both stakes and atmosphere. The wick's "total internal reflection" charges the climactic sequence, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint, though broader spatial choreography (harbor mouth, dunes, hill) remains slightly generic in visual anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock tea house supplies vivid anchors (rope stair, brass prisms, outer deck over mist-wrapped valley) and micro-setting detail (mirror, lacquer tray, jar wedged in crack) that enable the sun-trail method and constrain Maru's movements across three mornings. Sensory hierarchy reflects dye-master priorities (color, shimmer, bleed). The final image—sparks illuminating mist-painted figures—charges closure by making abstract legacy concrete. POV filter is consistent; no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stormlit tower, moving-ink windows, wind-bent pines, and the improbable oak sapling in a floor drain create vivid, purposeful texture. The sextant resting on the sill under moonlight, the corridor breath-holding, and seawater-wet leaves all constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (internal labyrinth to pocket chamber to roof parapet) tracks cleanly. The tower's micro-setting—drain, sill, numbered stones—serves as infrastructure for the worker's discovery and deconstruction, meeting the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse setting is vividly rendered ("mercury apples and salt pears under lamps that mimicked noon") and the mica window constrains the final breakthrough, charging the closure image when dawn "spills into streets and orchards." Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, spatial choreography remains impressionistic—distances, door mechanics, and the relationship between greenhouse interior and exterior hamlets are vague, and the "endless night above" fighting back is metaphorically resonant but physically unclear. The mirror world timeframe is declared but never pressures choices or supplies concrete constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret library constrains Marin's choice to reveal himself and charges the closure: the hinged panel and the stacks labeled "Silence Speaks" and "Departure Returns" ground the nested-paradox premise in tactile space. The folio shelf enables his hide-then-reveal tactic, and the reading desk becomes the site where mistake is reframed. Lamplight "pooled like honey" and the scratch of shoes anchor sensory perception without catalog excess. The museum above and the library below create a micro-setting that enforces the "staying while leaving" duality, though the city outside remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The overgrown palace courtyard constrains action (lantern light among fig trees, planters hidden behind marble, fountain bowl) and charges the closure image. The bricked bakery and the sprout through mortar form a purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the dominant stake. Sensory selection is filtered through Mina's noticing: "the faintest sweetness," "lantern light trembling," "water that no longer ran smelled clean anyway." Minor dip: the transition from Alder Row to palace courtyard could anchor spatial distance more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quartz hush, frozen windows, frost-sleeping lenses, and cloud seas create a vivid tactile world. Spatial choreography is clean (aisles → Lumen Room → window). The projector constrains choice—Ilian must "measure its pulse" and "let the slide borrow something from him"—charging the closure when he returns to the window and makes his vow. Sensory selection reflects urgency (warmth leaking from the cracked case, crystals catching breath).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rotting pier with tar-sweating pilings, lantern-light, brine-soaked splinters, and mussel shells grounds the action throughout. The watch fob's wax is ruined by brine, then warmed between fingers—micro-setting details that constrain Mara's tactics. The fishmonger's scale pan becomes the delivery mechanism at closure. Spatial choreography (barrel, pilings, chain, skiff, ladder) tracks cleanly. The setting's sensory density (tide licking nails, crab dragging the fob, gulls at sunrise) reflects Mara's focused urgency and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lavender Bluff, aurora, and election-night ozone anchor atmosphere with purposeful sensory detail (citrus-to-iron taste, sleet-to-mist hiss). The tin compass ring functions as micro-setting: it warms, spins, aligns, constraining the protagonist's path and charging the final image when it "settled, finally sure." Spatial choreography is clean (city walls → bluff → promontory → circle center). The setting pressures choice by guiding the protagonist to the carriers and enabling the convergence ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and purposeful: "walls glitter like frozen music," "auroral sorrow," cold air that charges each beat. The broken lock, canvas, pigments, and hidden studio are choreographed cleanly and the crystals' light becomes a functional constraint—highlights in the sketch, bending strokes in the mural. The cave's sorrowful atmosphere directly shapes the final image, where color "wakes" the hidden stage, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse city constrains movement (algae canals, biodome spine, maintenance hatch) and the toxic sky frames every choice as survival-scaled. The fern Sable functions as micro-setting and recurring object: it wilts at dishonesty, guiding Mara's exchanges and validating her final honest note. The conduit's translucent tubes with floating scraps and the scent of "ink, ozone, and something like rain" charge the final third with sensory specificity and thematic weight, making the setting essential to the closure (candor unlocks access).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    The whispering bluff, cloud sea, and kinetic sculpture are vivid and specific, anchoring the story in a distinct sensory world. The iceberg fragment's physical properties (cold, light refraction, melting) constrain and enable key beats—Lysa's initial tuning, the Auditor's confrontation, the basin's evolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image as the sculpture continues to turn "throwing borrowed rainbows from glass alone."

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dome's compass roses, heaters, irrigation valves, and the dune-packed hatch all constrain tactics materially. The organic-grained ribs flexing like bark anchor N-3's embodiment. The bead functions as micro-setting—a portable mass that burns hot but short—and charges the final image when buried under a cutting. Sensory selection is purposeful: magnetic hiss behind optical sensors, mulch corridor, residual shimmer. The skewed constellation where north should be reconfigures orientation at closure. Minor penalty: the cedar box's texture ("paper rustle like distant thunder") leans slightly ornamental, but it remains within caretaker-POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dawn courtyard is vividly rendered with basil pots, pigeons, murals, and warm stone rim; sensory selection reflects urgency when the police siren intrudes. The brick seam and hidden keyhole provide a tactile puzzle that drives the search. The setting constrains action (the locked mailbox, the painted seam) and charges the final communal reading at the courtyard tables, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken lab is vividly rendered—"saltwater pressed against cracked glass like a slow drum," "door scabbed with coral," "waist deep water"—and the setting constrains choices: Lyra cannot simply cut power because pods broadcast tampering, and water pressure shapes her tactical dance. The spider and its web function as micro-setting and recurring object that charges the final image (she takes its falling as her cue). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact layout of consoles, pods, and exit hatch could be tighter. The environment genuinely pressures the protagonist and participates in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The saltworks chamber is vivid and functional: glittering walls swallow sound, tools float, gravity shifts as Lysa opens the drain. The harbor's "gleaming silence" and the whale carcass anchor the timeframe and atmosphere. Coffee grounds and wildflowers serve as micro-settings that constrain choices. Minor gap: the pier and net shed receive less spatial grounding than the saltworks, and the beach ritual at the end lacks concrete choreography detail.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, stones, and alder shadows anchor the scene consistently. The flat stone and brook mist serve as micro-setting that constrains her summoning method (drawing intervals with twig and water). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "terrestrially cosmic" stones prime the closure (the joined crane dissolves into them) but their mechanical role—grounding the prophecy—arrives late and feels more decorative than constraining. Sensory detail is vivid yet sometimes ornamental ("sky pricked with cold stars") rather than filtered through urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop anchors early with concrete details (herb pots, brass kettle, parapet stones) and the dove-and-key seal recurs purposefully, constraining the narrator's search and charging the final preservation. Meteor shower and steam-curling-into-letters create atmospheric texture without postcard drift. The maintenance room cavity and soot-lined documents feel tactile and plot-essential. Spatial choreography remains clear across roof, stairwell, and maintenance room, though the broader Dovetail interior stays lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet garden, glasshouse Memory Ward, and copper-lattice setup provide spatial anchors and constrain the archiving ritual. "Lanterns floated low" and "black roses… drinking the remaining purple sky" filter through Mira's aesthete lens and pressure her choice by making loss beautiful yet contained. The shell itself functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket murmur, then table placement) and its resonance physically trembles the panes, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single location with minimal transit.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora reflections, and stalactite refrain anchor atmosphere. The basin's hidden seam becomes a micro-setting element that constrains the climactic choice: Liora's discovery and counter-move depend on that physical feature. Sensory detail (crushed petal scent, pearl twilight, green aurora veils) is vivid and filtered through crisis perception. Spatial choreography (altar, basin, hidden compartment) tracks cleanly. The sanctuary's symbolic weight (knots, chains carvings) charges the final image when the door opens, though "on its own" slightly softens concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon setting and the spiral chamber with luminous threads supply vivid, purpose-driven images that constrain movement and charge the climax. The shell—pressed to ear, guiding her journey, split and rejoined—functions as micro-setting and shapes key turns. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (rim → mouth → spiral chamber → ledges), though the ledges and masked singers remain underdeveloped. The "star-silver rocks" and "luminous threads" anchor the nexus effectively, and the final image (canyons answering with "softer, kinder returns") uses environment to reconfigure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glacier shrine is vividly anchored: "hollowed chamber carved into glacier ice, candle-lit... ice walls carved into shallow alcoves," and the ice lens functions as both setting feature and tactical resource—Mara uses it to align the globe and see Fen's entry into the wreck. The melted globe itself acts as micro-setting, constraining her method (she must warm it, align distortions). Sensory hierarchy reflects occupational POV: she notices "candles borrowed starlight through the ice, tinting every flame with a cold blue" and the tactile shift of water inside the globe. Spatial choreography is clear across all beats. Minor limitation: the pier confrontation and the crowd's presence are asserted rather than choreographed, slightly reducing immersion at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    The parapet after rain functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: wet stone seams guide the moon-path lesson, puddles reflect fireflies, crenels snag nets. Spatial choreography is clean across two nights. The whisk, nets, moon pools, and river currents form a coherent sensory lattice filtered through craft-worker perception. The setting charges the closure: Ren brews tea "on the parapet," embedding the philosophy in place. Selective detail (tarred twine, bamboo ribs, lattice shadows) advances both atmosphere and theme without catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wasteland orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains and reveals: the Stillpoint's physical boundary is felt ("world stop humming"), the basin's calm becomes tactile proof, and workers' presence supplies immediate social pressure. The flawed diamond's violet pulse within that field charges the closure by converting superstition into evidence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"glossy and unburned" leaves, "gray masks," airborne grit that "circled but never fell"—filtered through the debunker's investigative lens. The city's "concrete ribs" and "dust storms like walls" establish broader wasteland plausibility without catalog. The orchard's discovery and interior both constrain the protagonist's next moves and supply the ledger that drives the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: cobalt portico, bent antennas, cloud ocean, and puppet stage all constrain choices (the portico sanctifies visitors, the dome becomes projection theater). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("ozone, burnt coffee, old incense"). The micro-setting (puppet stage bolted to telescope) charges the closure by enabling the final broadcast. Spatial choreography is clear. One slip: "the museum crate he had looted for its ancient shadow puppets" introduces backstory without present anchor, slightly diluting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes, the shore at dawn, and the glass jars function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the jars "glow in the dark" as redemption settles. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"sea wind threaded," "tide hiss," "rope creak," "church bells"—and filtered through Sato's gleaning lens. Spatial choreography is clear: loft to shore, shore to widow, back to loft; the semicircle of jars and the music box are handled on the page. The dunes and shore subtly guide choice: Sato's labor is physical, outdoors, ritualized. The pier, village, and cannery provide social context without catalog. One small slip: the widow's house location is not anchored, and the transition from shore to her is summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered (floes nudging pilings, copper water, creaking planks) and the setting constrains the confrontation spatially—Lio presses his palm to a piling to feel vibrations, using the environment's resonance. The lighthouse chapel and crypt anchor the stakes materially. Micro-setting (the dock's vibration, the maintenance fork) charges the climax, lifting the score into the 7s despite some ornamental flourishes ("water shone copper," "sky against sunset") that don't alter choices.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake constrain movement (caravans follow lunar cadence to cross safely) and supply resources (iron filings in rock, cold basalt dulling coils). The magnetic viaduct's copper seams and humming tides are tracked across multiple nights, shaping Irena's tactical choice of the third full moon. Spatial choreography is clean: boots on ice, climbs up stepped walls, sleds rolled into reeds. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "angry twitch" of the compass, lake groaning under ice, humming dropping to a purr. The body and recurring objects (compass, sleds, moon paths) charge the final image when the viaduct is unyoked.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subway tunnel pressures choice through spatial details: the rusted alcove hides the lantern, the curve conceals the staged cart, scrape marks and bolt spacing provide forensic anchors, and the emergency shaft enables the drone upload. Sensory selection is purposeful—dust where water refused to go, kerosene scent impossible after decades, post-drought grasses finally green—filtered through investigator priorities. The lantern's physical properties (cold handle, soot pattern, flame chamber) anchor the entangled memories and constrain the final choice. Minor cap: the historical Underground Railroad route feels imported rather than organically built into the tunnel's present function, though it does charge the final image of breaking free.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The music box shop is anchored early with sensory detail ("brass tooth and velvet lining," "light breaks through storm clouds") and the setting constrains the solution: Lena's tools, the testing rig, and the after-hours workspace enable the repair plan. The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting, its mechanism examined and later installed in the testing rig. Spatial choreography remains clear across the three nights. The recurring light-through-clouds image charges the final beat without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on acid sea supplies vivid, selective detail: "hissing at the foam," "gears under the floor agreed with clanks," "gear paper." Setting constrains choice—the workshop floats "to keep [the bell] above the acid"—and the arrow tip's socket on the basalt slab directly shapes the climax when "gears under the coast woke with a sound like gigantic laughter." The kaleidoscope functions as micro-setting/tool, fracturing horizon into ribbons of possibility and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across launch ramp, mist, dead coast, and return. Minor gap: the "dead coast" arrives abruptly; a single sensory cue earlier would anchor its threat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The server room is vivid and specific: "a wall of servers that hum like a choir muffled by dust," "bright status lights," and the Chute as a concrete region where deleted files "dissolve into zeroes." Mara's body and attention are filtered through her professional lens—she notices "slips in metadata the way other people notice weather"—and the environment constrains her choices (the old administrator account she was told never to use, the locked folder, the midnight timing). The patch image, scanned so closely "the threads look like roads," functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final beat when Mara stitches it to her coat. Spatial choreography is clean: desk facing servers, server room at midnight, Legal office in the morning. The recurring numbers appear as comment counts, time stamps, track numbers, creating a textural layer that supports the accumulative lens. The archive as a space where "certain names are missing from the air" establishes sensed absence as an environmental quality. Minor deduction: the southern sea and the buoy remain abstract coordinates rather than felt geography.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse orchard, shifting ice, vintage store mirrors, and the fragment itself are vividly rendered and integral: the mirrors function as a narrative tool that unlocks hidden fears, the ice groans under the moon to charge the ending, and the orchard's apples anchor the resolution. Spatial choreography is clean (storehouse upstairs, vintage store below, rows outside) and sensory detail—rope-braced trees, salt-clouded crystal, wind-gnawed postcards—grounds every beat without tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drift-ice marina constrains choices (pontoon crawl, net-cutting) and charges the final image (ice pops as interval). The bone parasol tip functions as micro-setting, a recurring tool that shapes action (tapping ice, cutting net) and carries symbolic weight without becoming ornamental. Sensory detail—metal taste, wind tireless, ice needles—is filtered through the narrator's sensitivity to endings and modulates with pressure (calm sorting vs. storm chaos). Spatial choreography (pontoons, boathouse, sled departure) tracks cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber pavilion functions as micro-setting and constraint: its glow draws them upslope, the glass "holds warmth," and the honeyed light charges their shared confession ("shadows look steeped in honey"). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("crushed skins and smoke," "wires hummed faintly like distant strings"), and the vineyard's spatial logic (trellises, rows, the slope) remains coherent. The pavilion table becomes the stage for the burned scraps, and the setting directly enables the final turn—Mara unfolds her letter under that amber light—elevating the category into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    The kinetic parapet beneath the dunes constrains the entire action: Iri must balance "between attention and disregard," and its noon twitch signals the prophet's disruptive pressure. The rope walkway, dune crest, and "thin stair of sound" are tactile and purposeful. The half-mask is worn and referenced multiply, functioning as tool and social marker. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("a faint, grinding pulse," "the usual wind hiss vanished"). Minor gap: the pavilion's interior layout during the prophet's speech remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lavender field and rusted factory create a coherent pressure site: scent softens metallic memory, vines climb through windows as time passes, and the acetate fence constrains Mara's curatorial method. The micro-setting of the overturned pallet scanning table and tea-candle halos during the power outage both enable her work and charge the final image with moving frames. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (fence, rows, broken section, vine-thick wall), and sensory detail (lavender scent, rattling rain, flicker) modulates with scene urgency. The setting's dual role—memorial site and collaborative workspace—directly shapes the choice to widen the path and hang acetate like curtains.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library and crystal anchor setting as micro-objects that constrain choice: the crystal maps by echo, the maintenance stair reveals the hidden corridor, the paper skins and compost build world logic. Spatial choreography is clean across all three sequences. The "after the last dictionary" frame provides a coherent rule-set (words grow without fences), and the sensory detail—"cold as a tear," "damp earth and beginnings"—is filtered through the scholar's POV. The crystal's sonically reflective property charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-tool.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog sculpture garden supplies vivid, purposeful details: metal arches breathing sea air, broken figureheads and glass whales rising from gravel, the fog bell's stone spiral, and the shed stacked with salt-furred videotapes. The chalk marks on stones and driftwood arrows constrain the search, shaping Mira's path through the garden. The recurring videotapes and their "magnetic hush" charge the final image when silence is turned into future echo. Spatial choreography is clear (shed → sculptures → fog bell → shed return), and the tidal clock subtly pressures the driftwood map before fog rearranges everything. Micro-setting (chalk, recorder, videotapes) functions as both tool and atmospheric anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory setting constrains every choice: the tremor threatens rail alignment, the clock governs the launch window, and the dome slit reveals the Moon as a visual stake. The pressed aspen leaf in its clear cylinder functions as micro-setting that supplies a solution under pressure. The closing image—"thin blue," telemetry, the roar that "shook her bones"—charges the final beat with embodied consequence. Spatial choreography (service corridor, control room, clockwork bay, rail) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The skybridge above clouds, citrus cleanser mingling with greenhouse air, and the broken vinyl shard are vivid and purposeful. The radiant light reflected upward and the "scent of hope, clean and possible" anchor Mara's perception and recur at the reunion, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear—elevator, hallway, Elias's room, dock, skybridge—but the supply-drone dock and roof-garden vents feel like ornamental world-building rather than constraints that shape choice. The turntable between father and son is the one tool that directly enables closure, elevating setting utility in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory, automaton key, chalk circle, mirrors, and light reservoir all function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the key's heart-spring must be wound, the rune-ring traced to close loops, the door opened by pattern rather than force. Sensory details—iron and cold tea, white pool under glass—are vivid and filtered through Liora's scholarly attention. The floating isle and spoon-bent reality remain postcard backdrops; only the immediate chamber, tools, and mirrors alter tactics. The final image charges when Liora's shadow joins the rest, fulfilling the micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The secret garden behind the hedge maze functions as micro-setting that charges multiple beats: weathered sundials beside hybrid roses signal "nostalgia and innovation," the bench hides Lina's notebook, the loose stone conceals her case notes. The garden's silent electric pump and crushed-mint future anchor the tonal blend. Spatial choreography remains clear across four locations (morgue, garden, riverbank, garden return). The hedge door opening onto darkness supplies the final threshold that alters Rowan's options. The riverbank reeds and twig splints provide forensic texture that drives plot.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's serpentine corridors and tide pools constrain Lio's search and supply the sea glass, directly enabling the plot. The scale anchors his ritual gesture (weighing the glass "until the beam hovered perfectly level"), and the meeting hall replaces the lantern space with purposeful contrast. Micro-setting: the wet sand and powdered shell are present in the polishing action, though their properties don't alter tactics. The mist recurs at opening and closure ("patient as the mist"), charging the final image with tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moss-garden data center is vivid and specific—servers under green quilts, ferns in aisles, icicle drips on coolant pipe—and directly enables the encryption method, constraining the narrator's solution to natural pattern rather than corporate tech. The amber pendant functions as micro-setting, warming in the palm and serving as physical seal. Spatial choreography (narrator behind vines, Jun in aisle, foil spread beneath pipe) remains clear. The setting charges the final image: "the moss seemed brighter" reweights the space from refuge to collaboration site.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral nexus is vividly particular: "ground underfoot was made of shredded chapters," "wind had teeth," "narrow river of ink," "bank of broken metaphors," and the wet-leather book "closing itself page by page." These details constrain Mara's path (she must wade upstream, climb the bank, cut her thumb to mark the climb with blood) and charge the final image (blank paper "breathing"). The shell fragment functions as micro-setting: it warms, pulses approval, cuts her thumb—each use alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the scent of yeast, the cool mist "like erased drafts," the ink rising "like doubt"). Minor: the nexus rules (how the cameos leave shapes, why the vow makes them return) remain somewhat abstract; a bit more grounding in the mechanics of this space would anchor the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant arbor, harvest moon, lightning scar, and dawn dew are vividly rendered and anchor the setting throughout. The vine tendril threaded through the trunk scar becomes a micro-setting that constrains Marn's method (he must use *this* tendril in *this* wound), and the alignment of moonlight and dew shapes the timing. The arbor's response—sap rising, fruit dropping—charges the final beats, lifting Q3 into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crater-orchard setting pressures Eira's movements (careful steps, kneeling until joints ache) and supplies the ice-capped well as the sealing site. The arrangement of spoons, lenses, and wire on snow integrates micro-setting into ritual action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Eira's priorities (sap trying to move, heartbeat thud), and the frozen soil's "remembered starlight" constrains her approach. The aurora's loosening at closure charges the spatial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (veined marble, warped lantern bands, polished stone cathedral) and directly constrains Ivo's work: he marks reflection angles, shaves marble to exact angles, and anchors the timer to a reflective seam. Spatial choreography is clean across the days-long span. The setting participates in the closure—the cavern "exhales in relief"—charging the final image with purposeful environmental response.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bronze grotto constrains choice: the "boundary-lessly trapped" effect forces the burner-alignment solution, and the whalebone lattice becomes a functional tool rather than decoration. Starlight through the crack anchors the climax. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (kelp/tide, drowned constellations, thawed moss) and filtered through the weaver's craft lens. The micro-setting (burner holes, shadow match) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loft setting (rain-beaded skylight, single burner, worktable) constrains action: steam from the kettle activates the crystals, the skylight frames rust-hued light that charges the final image. The ash wood blank functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats (outline, channel-cutting, oil-sealing, lifting into light). Sensory details—"wet metal and tea leaves," "rust hued peace"—filter through Miriam's professional attention (lion tamer's widow, gate-latching precision). Spatial choreography is clean; the environment shapes choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kinetic lagoon is vividly rendered with specific, voice-filtered detail: "water looping in deliberate spirals that click like gears," "cloudlight is thin," "cloudcoat." Spatial choreography is clear—platform, railing, undercarriage—and sensory hierarchy fits Mara's scavenger focus. The lagoon constrains the ghost encounter (it lives in the mirrored water) and the final image charges when Mara "walks the rim of the kinetic lagoon above the clouds." The disposable camera wheel functions as micro-setting object that constrains choice (she clicks it to release fragments). Economy is strong; no tourist-catalog sprawl. Setting reaches the 9+ gate but a few generic phrases ("the park," "the ride") and the lack of tactile interaction with the bolt itself (we're told she fixes it, not shown the wrench or struggle) keep it just under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    The terminal's queue rails, murals, and mechanical systems constrain and enable Lina's choices throughout. The sextant arc physically aligns with the balcony curve, charging the final recognition. Sensory detail (cold metal smell, trickle sound, carnival glitter) is selective and purposeful. The tile map's "routes that ended in blank oceans" returns with new meaning when emergency lights reveal it, micro-setting shaping both tactics and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quartz veins in the forecourt function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the protagonist kneels, listens, and this tactile engagement enables the epiphany that reframes silence. The glacier, wet stones, and lichen are filtered through the POV's occupational and emotional bias—"blue breath filled our hours," "petrichor nostalgia that made my throat tighten." Spatial choreography is coherent: kneeling at the vein, the bear approaching, the ledger at hand. The final sunrise "colored" the silence without cracking it, charging the closure image. The body (cheek against stone, warmth soaking through robe) operates as lived-in setting that pressures the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The barge canal setting is vivid and purposeful: the half-sunk barge supplies the key evidence, the floating relay shack provides the mechanism for broadcast, and the stilted warehouses and black water establish atmospheric pressure. The pocket sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's forensic method (comparing shadow to tide chart) and charging the final image when she uses it to watch "a single shadow moved across fixed marks." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's investigative priorities. The setting directly shapes the climactic choice and the ending's conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden dock under snow, fog rolling across the harbor, and the fulgurite lens catching lamplight provide vivid, purposeful anchors. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara beside the coil of rope, the weaver rising from beneath the dock, the seed placed in the dock-board crack. The fulgurite glass functions as a micro-setting element that constrains Lio's method (tracing knot shadows) and charges the final demonstration when it sharpens the bowline's shadow for the clerk. Snow and fog modulate perception and urgency throughout, and the crack between dock boards becomes the planting site, tying environment directly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed garden is rendered with purposeful detail—"crooked pear tree shedding copper leaves," "hedges swallowing their own shadows"—that mirrors the queen's lonesome splendor and charges the closure atmosphere. The carpet thread functions as micro-setting, handled twice (wrapping the narrator's finger, then placed in the palm as payment) and its "softness" recurs to anchor the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, shoulder proximity, sleeve brushing wrist) and the dusk timing modulates tone without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The suspended palace, Archive Vats, and Foundry Cradle are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail—"liquid glass," "bitterly sweet smell, like sugar burnt on a blade," "stalactite shadows"—is selective and filtered through Lorian's reverie. The egg's warmth and the song cylinder's scored errors constrain the assembly choice. Spatial choreography (descent through corridors, placement on the dais) tracks cleanly. The environment directly enables the closure: the nest and Cradle machinery charge the final transformation, lifting the setting into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The volcanic beach, obsidian lagoon, kelp, and black sand are vivid and purposefully recurrent, with the sand used twice (judging wind/moisture, then as a jar gift) and the lagoon's calm contrasting the fire. Spatial choreography is mostly clean (boardwalk, dunes, shack, lagoon edge, burn unit), though the shack's exact position beneath the dunes is slightly vague. The black sand and kelp-drift peace charge the final image when the protagonist returns to the lagoon, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge closure. Minor slip: "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" is poeticized to the point where physical plausibility (a lagoon beneath dunes, not behind or within) becomes unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The city of forgotten fountains is rendered with vivid, selective detail ("dry basins held only chalky moons," "air smelled of old copper," "fountainheads lay stacked like skulls"), and the underground engine room provides concrete spatial grounding that charges the closure image. The limescale breadcrumbs and constellation pedestal constrain Mara's approach, meeting the 9+ gate test. The faint slippage: "cold smell of wet stone that should not have existed in a dry city" is noted but does not resolve on the page, leaving a small credibility gap.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Nebula Garden is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "violet dust hung like pollen," "blooms the size of sails," "wall of condensed starlight that approximates infinity." The hollow reed for sonar pinging and the gear carving "faint grooves that glimmered without heat" function as micro-setting that constrains navigation and becomes the story's central image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the transit (moth-harness, floating boulders, observatory clearing). The environment pressures the final choice: children "tended night seedlings" at the outskirts, a setting-detail that enables the ending and charges it with generational hope.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered (sweating panes, vines swallowing benches, rain drumming) and functions as both workshop and liminal meeting place. Butterflies settle on ribbons, their weight making fabric tremble—a tactile detail that charges the migration timeframe. The potting table anchors repeated ribbon work. Setting constrains choice (greenhouse as the only place "where echoes felt willing to answer") and the final placement at the cemetery gate completes spatial logic. Spatial choreography across cemetery and greenhouse remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian ridge functions as micro-setting that pressures the final recalibration: Mara uses the bob as plumb, sets it beside the old marker, and the wave meets the notch she cuts. The tower's interior (escapement, chain assembly, brass belly of the bob) supplies tactile constraint. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "black glass veined with salt and barnacle scar," "heat rose from the dark stone though the air was cold," "green corrosion." The ridge's dual presence—at opening and closure—charges the final image without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt silo's "velveteen gloom" and "star-cold roofline" constrain the investigation spatially and charge the final planting image. The tapestry strip and its frayed border function as micro-setting, guiding the decoding action and narrowing options (green strand pulled hard, cipher stitched). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("smells of smoke and lavender," "iron gate shut like a lid"). Small slip: "stars over the silo roof" are invoked for pattern-matching but never dramatized as visible constraint during the night scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen lake and obsidian spire anchor place vividly and recur (ice singing, thaw water cracking open). Micro-setting details—wind cuts, fisher lights, salt sheds at choke points—constrain the modeling choice and are integrated through action. The kingfisher nib functions as a tool-as-setting element that charges the final act: its blue-barred sharpness and legend of writing the future press against Jora's empirical stance. Spatial choreography (threshold, chart room, shore walk, return to spire) tracks cleanly. The spring thaw image returns the spire and lake as environmental witnesses to transformation, meeting the 9+ quick test for setting constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember alcove, archive loft, and central square are vividly rendered with soot drifting "like snow" and fog rolling in. The shortwave radio's dial glow functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's tactics (she must return to the alcove, position it behind the timpani) and charging the final image when it washes the stands "like moonrise." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: during the concert the glow and dust take precedence. The famine-era specificity (bread lines, Censors of Noise) anchors tone without over-explaining occupational systems.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vanishing-point gallery is vivid and purposeful, with perspective lines that guide Lira's work and create thematic resonance. The rocking chair returns as a charged object that interrupts the inspector's reach. Sensory detail (powdered charcoal like a night sky, porcelain mask chime, river smell) is filtered through Lira's professional attention. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the relationship between the white-walled corridor, the back room, and the convergence point where she pins the paper could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken city and sewer setting constrain every choice: Orin must barter for an auger, navigate toxic pools, bore through silt layers that encode the Council's narrative erasure, and finally retreat to pipe fittings because institutional space is foreclosed. The cog's green patina and sharp teeth are handled twice (discovery, teaching rig), charging the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful—"stank of old paper and salt," the auger's click traveling "into his teeth"—and filtered through Orin's philosophical stance (naming strata for lies). Spatial choreography remains clear across sewer, library district, market, and return.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet library in autumn is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (cold windows, warm rugs, traveled stillness), and the zither's repaired rosette constrains Mara's choice to include it in the performance, charging the final image with its "lace of shadow." Sensory selection reflects urgency (chaos of first rehearsal vs. stillness of final concert), and micro-setting (the library after hours, drapes, chalkboard) shapes the choir's transformation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's particularity—velvet, old instruments, stamped ledgers—filters through Mara's professional and emotional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly realized ("broken glass made good skylights," "bent ribs," "collapsed rail yard") and actively shapes Mira's work: the cracked terracotta pot, the dead vines she prunes for light, the rafters the tree tries to tangle. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a chef's idiom (compost from burned books, honey-glazed roots, nettle disinfectant). The greenhouse's spatial logic remains stable across the timeline, and the three-moon alignment light floods the space at closure. The recurring pruning motif charges the final image when Mira shapes the tree "into an open canopy," making the micro-setting indispensable to both tactics and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lightning tower's storm-charge jars, dead drone trays, and thunder nets create vivid micro-setting that constrains the box-opening choice. The tollgate booth and nectar dusk anchor early. Sensory detail is purposeful (scorched shell, sap softening, sweet scent). The tower's physicality—spiral stairs, control bay, projector bees painting walls—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The toll ramp, hill cable line, and rooftop gardens form a coherent geography that tightens the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quiet bay, boardwalk, Alderwick House, and tide line are vivid and purposeful. Micro-setting (the orris shard in her pocket, teaspoons and saucers, the clock's alcove) directly constrains Mara's choices and charges the final image when she sets the shard on a flat stone. Sensory details—violets, saltgrass, iris note, floorboards softening—are filtered through Mara's attention and reflect her stake. The "streetlights daydream" anchors time poetically and recurs to bracket the night work, though the mechanism isn't strictly causal.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater garden, structural cracks, and guide cord function as setting-as-tool: fissures guide the threading action, the nursery altar cradles the ampoule, and the physical environment (algae fronds holding still, every empty fountain a throat) accumulates pressure and charges the final image. The "salt roses grew from broken mosaics" and "plankton like stage dust" are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear through the threading sequence. The setting constrains Ilyan's path and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The staircase is vivid and purposeful: "boundless confinement made architecture," repeated landings, same height and angle. The dice return with reweighted meaning (first as memory trigger, then left beside the stalled wheel as "evidence of my former self"), and the perpetual motion machine's brass and glass constrain the protagonist's final proof. Spatial choreography is clear across landings and the device room. The body is less foregrounded—most action is mental—but the notebook and dice function as micro-setting that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse, citrus trees, saffron crocuses, smog-choked streetlamps, and moon-tipped brush constrain and charge multiple beats: Mira paints panes because street visibility is nil, Ro removes his mask (toxic dawns), the thermos of saffron tea offers hospitality, and the final glow draws passersby who mouth remembered sounds. The micro-setting (greenhouse panes as canvas) directly enables the proof Mira seeks. Spatial choreography (metal stairs, brightest patch of moonlight, street-level view upward) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto city, waterfall spray, museum kiln, and frozen ice door all constrain choices and supply resources: the ice seals the cache, heat thaws it, the hall becomes a stage. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("monumental curtain," "museum lamps and prayer candles," "rosewater and wet stone"). The emerald lens functions as micro-setting, altering what Maris perceives and enabling the rescue. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image when the guards' boots are "damp" with waterfall mist.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rocky island, barnacled flats, spiral stairs, and cracked lenses create spatial pressure and reflect Orin's griefscape. The tide's withdrawal supplies a live time constraint that tightens his window. The hunger stone and yoyo function as micro-setting objects that constrain the final choice: the stone's appetite measures his shadows and the yoyo's copper circuit must close to initiate. The lighthouse lantern room charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-smeared gloom, kelp, gulls). Minor slip: the mainland shop is mentioned but never grounds the reader in prior spatial habit.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funhouse is vividly rendered ("mirrors mottled with fungus," "flash bulb swollen like a maggot") and constrains the protagonist's path through discrete chambers (Hall of Snapshots, Tilted Corridor, final booth). The opera clasp functions as micro-setting/object-as-setting, sipping light and charging the final act. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting pays off at closure: the booth's mechanics (countdown, flash, clasp activation) directly enable the curse-breaking. Minor: some description edges toward ornamental ("cold perfume") without altering choice in those lines.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The driftwood orchard afloat in open seas constrains tactics throughout: the torn anchor line forces the noise solution, the freighter's approach pressures the timing, the storm's arrival threatens the pear tree that holds Leeward. Micro-setting (the xylophone mallet, water barrels, iron bell buoy, loose spar) directly enables the sound-layering. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "branches heavy with salt pears," "fruit thudding like drumbeats," "the wet deck." Spatial choreography is coherent across the driftwood circle, tree, deck, and approaching freighter light.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and purposeful: spiral seams guide her search, the crack constrains her route, the cistern hides the journal. Micro-setting (gate rivets stamped with watcher motifs, shell grooves) charges the final image and alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lira's cartographic lens (salt light, reef-like rust, dust leaping from seams). The mirrored city at closure transforms the setting from bowl-and-rim to recursive threshold, deepening the conceptual space.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy-covered nameplates "like graves with green hair," cracked tiles, weeds "like slow smoke") and the lamplight stages the confrontation. The rosebush petal and bare branch bookend the piece, reweighting the seasonal metaphor at closure. Spatial choreography (Mara stepping closer, taking the satchel) tracks cleanly. The ivy "hid meetings from street level" subtly constrains secrecy, linking setting to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: "moonlight filters down in pale ladders, igniting a hushed blaze across silted tiles," pillars "lean like tired dancers," curtains of weed replace velvet. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves—steps to the skiff, threading through posts, the cloud of silt that blinds Beran. The pavilion actively constrains Lira's choices (she must row carefully, wedge notes into footings, navigate around Beran's skiff) and charges the final image when she surfaces on the far side with the drawbridge raised. The inkwell and silver mask function as micro-setting objects that ground the scene in tactile immediacy. Minor: "firm shore" recurs without evolving, and the city's silhouette at the end feels slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunken library constrains choice throughout: corroded doors, sediment, swollen catalog, oiled-cloth wrapping all shape Maren's tactics and slow her investigation. The stamp's velvet rot and the folio's fiber-memory are specific, purpose-driven details that charge the discovery beat. The blackout darkness recurs as both physical constraint (headlamp flicker) and thematic anchor. Spatial choreography remains clear across atrium, reading room, cabinet, and desk.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and stairway "that descends while ascending" supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The lantern (brass throat, polished moonstone lens) is handled across multiple beats and its mechanics (storing dream flickers) constrain Mira's method. Sensory detail is selective: jasmine scent pulls the island, tea steam and cold rain inside the basilica, stained-dawn projection. The vertigo on the corkscrew stair and the priests' mirrored veils avoid postcard catalog. However, spatial choreography during the climax—"she steps into the projection" and "takes the paper part"—compresses the body's position and the mechanics of splitting, leaving the reader to infer rather than track Mira's literal stance. At this length, the detail economy is sound, but one more concrete cue (e.g., where her hands are, how the flame/paper division manifests physically) would anchor the pivotal act.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory is more than backdrop: the cracked waveguide, manual thrusters, and twelve-minute battery window all constrain tactics and shape choices on the page. The geode functions as micro-setting (calibration reference, scattering microwaves in a known pattern) and recurs meaningfully at the gradient's edge, where it "rang faintly." Sensory detail (groaning balloon skin, hot portable screen, relays ticking "like teeth") is selective and tied to urgency. The ash-colored sea and bruise-like clouds underscore tone without halting momentum, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's "soot-dark lenses and brass circles," the slit leaking dusk "like ink poured onto paper," and the hidden cabinet all anchor spatial choreography and constrain Mara's search path. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional attention (drone screen, rotors, grooves in the chip). The "notch" in the stone rim and the hidden passage function as micro-setting that alters tactics—she climbs, pulls masonry, and discovers the cabinet. The final tuner hum fills the chamber, charging the space at closure. Minor slip: "dusk leaked through a slit" and "brilliant dimness" are evocative but edge toward stock metaphor without fresh grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt terrace, dusk palette, and driftwood shore anchor mood and provide the archive mechanism. The watch hand as tactile object recurs and charges the rail moment. Spatial choreography is clean (terrace, balustrade, rail, walking down). However, the "forgotten shore" and "driftwood carvings" remain abstract—no texture of sand, salt, effort, or proximity that would constrain Mara's search or choice. The terrace does not pressure the confession; it is backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, crack in flagstones, and moon phase all ground the exchange and constrain choreography (both sides watch the crack "as if it burned"). The drawer pull functions as micro-setting—its scrollwork, brass warmth, and lever curve enable the wire-removal beat. Sensory hierarchy fits the lens: chains chiming, wire's "cruel" efficiency, brass "complaining in a tiny squeal." The environment charges the final image (boy stepping "onto Ridge ground" under full moon) but does not decisively alter a tactical choice mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The utility poles function as micro-setting constraint, replacing stars and shaping navigation choices across multiple beats. Eelgrass, storm drain outlet, and pier are tactilely present. The astronomical compass charges the final image by remaining in his palm during the logbook moment. Sensory detail is purposeful (wet pencil gleam of poles post-squall) but leans visual; other senses appear sparingly. The coastal kayak launch anchors the frame, though its pressure is mostly tonal rather than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underground bioluminescent lake functions as more than backdrop: it "answers by turning on" and its glow "outlined dozens of branching passages," making spatial navigation concrete and choice-dependent. The baseball as micro-setting element constrains the thief-rescue choice (used as counterweight) and charges the final image when tossed to the traveler, satisfying the 9+ quick test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "wet stone and algae," "lake light," "leather thin as old skin." The aquarium hatch, pawn shops, and service tunnels anchor the journey's phases without catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight supplies concrete resources (star anise, cardamom, saffron) that enable the conjuring and the oldest tree opens to provide the corridor, directly constraining Mira's path. Spatial choreography is clear: pear trees, bowls among roots, bark, blossoms, corridor. Sensory detail (sweetness stinging lungs, sap scent, mist threaded with cinnamon) is purposeful and filtered through Mira's beast-whisperer senses. The setting charges the final image—two hounds running among blossoms under permanent moonlight—meeting the 9+ quick test for environment constraining choice and charging closure.

    The midnight glade functions as more than backdrop: "the air turned painfully clear," "jeweled with ice-light," creating sensory constraint that "choked me the way milk chokes." The vapor-braided tree with pulsing pouches labeled with names anchors the metaphysical geography and directly enables the protagonist's choice. The sigh-stair, ribbon-tether, and cracked saucer all constrain tactics. The body (daughter wrapped against chest, fist clenched like seed) operates as micro-setting throughout. The final return to the kitchen table grounds the closure image in domestic space.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The recycled spaceship is vivid and particular: patched hull plates, municipal scrap, air recyclers hissing like surf, repurposed solar tiles. Setting constrains choice (oxygen waste, ceiling pipes, welded hatch) and the narrow chapel remnant charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Micro-setting (the quilt, the vial warming in her pocket) acts as functional geography. However, spatial choreography in the climax—Mara rising, forehead touching hatch, Lio at the doorway—could be more precisely staged; the mist corridor beyond reads as atmosphere rather than tactile space, slightly weakening the final beat's grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    The black sand, lava tube, and mineral-threaded walls anchor the scene vividly and pressure Amina's cave entry through heat and tremor. The lightning bugs function as micro-setting: their spiral "mimicked the moons above" and their flight choices guide the escape, satisfying the constraint test. Spatial choreography (tideline → lava tube → crack exit) remains clear. The volcano's transformation metaphor (stone to sand, air to ash) charges the final realization, though the "stranded villagers" at the end lack concrete spatial placement.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The luminous fort and blackout create atmospheric contrast, and the half-painted sundial with coded scratches functions as a plot device, yet spatial choreography remains vague: the narrator moves from Archive Door to terrace to corridor without clear distances or obstacles. The bronze quill holder constrains one choice (alignment on the sundial), meeting the micro-setting test, but sensory detail is visual-heavy and filtered through a declarative rather than experiential lens. The fort's "bright skin" and "winking hush" are vivid phrases, but the environment does not evolve or resist the protagonist's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal bluff without friction is vividly realized: rope harnesses, eels herded with willow wands, aurora-lit dust forming maps. The frictionless sea sliding "like glass" under Eren's feet at the climactic hour constrains his final action and charges the closure image. Sensory details (aurora catching dust, eels' turns counted as prayer) are filtered through Eren's obsessive POV. Minor dock: some world rules (why eels still swim, how Marel walks unslipping) hint at deeper logic but remain unexplored at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory's sensory particulars—wet black domes, thunder rolling under the mountain, roof slit aimed at a crossed-out star—are filtered through the narrator's professional and emotional lens. The darkroom functions as micro-setting: its red safelight, glass plates, and timer constrain choices (snapping the dial at three minutes, stopping exposures mid-bloom). The storm's rarefaction guides the vigil's timing, and the final image (dawn streets, damp masks) charges the closure by contrasting raw sky with the city's return to routine. Setting details remain selective and purposeful, integrated into action rather than catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vividly established and serve functional roles: the sundial enables the code-breaking, the duel strip provides the arena, and Lysander's footwork mirrors the coded angles. Sensory detail is purposeful (brass ribs cooling, cymbal-like clash, brook murmuring). However, the setting remains somewhat ornamental—removing the brook or glass would not fundamentally alter choices or closure, and the "higher ground when the brook became a river" backstory arrives late without prior environmental foreshadowing that would deepen the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library under stars is vivid and returns with charged specificity at closure, constraining Len's rebuilding choice. Sensory detail (moon, silver light, bent shelves like ribs) is selective and atmospheric. However, spatial choreography across the city and prison remains vague, and the "false bottom" mechanism is described but never shown in tactile use that alters a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arbor, station, projection booth, and hidden heartwood room are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (root-bridges rising/sinking, cloud-mist on posters, heartwood stillness). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across moves: hall → ladder → booth → stairwell → hidden room → return to hall. The environment constrains choice: the condemned booth is chained but accessible; the hidden room offers refuge but traps performance in a loop. Sensory selection is strong (piano strings hum, compasses flicker, clock ticks) and filtered through Lio's musician's ear. The final return to the departure hall charges the closure image with the now-living clock and calm compasses.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridge setting is vivid and specific: orchids, stone lilies, warm stone meeting cool mist. The crevice where Tavo plants the seed becomes a micro-setting that constrains his choice—he must match dream logic to physical materials (rainwater, ash, breath). The monsoon functions as both temporal and atmospheric pressure, and the ridge draws the villagers upward "as if by scent," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment directly shapes the planting ritual and the tree's emergence, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The island's sensory signature—kelp, wet basalt, rain pearls on cedar, slick stones—is vivid and POV-filtered through the protagonist's grief. The ghost ship and cove setting constrain the sequence: the protagonist must follow Sera's path, board the ship, encounter the bonsai. The compass as micro-object charges the final moment by pointing inward. Spatial choreography (cove, planks, porthole, deck center) remains clear. The setting participates in closure: the bonsai on deck and the "sea-glass hue" that emerges are not postcard detail but pressure points that shape the protagonist's recognition.

    The floating observatory and geode crystal are not just backdrop but active constraints that shape tactics and charge the final image. Sensory details ("balloon skin groaning," "relays tick like teeth") are selective and reflect the POV's technical mindset. The setting evolves with the action, and the geode's recurrence calibrates both instrument and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.5)
    Observatory at dusk is vivid and constraining: the slit, dome, and hidden passage dictate Mara's drone flight and discovery. Sensory detail (soot-dark lenses, smell of old oil) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are selectively detailed and pressure the encounter through isolation and symbolic weight. The watch hand functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and decisively charging the final image when placed on the rail and destined for return. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mara's professional and emotional bias ("sifted hush," "bruised ink").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    The parapet setting pressures choices through its narrow edge and mist, while the drawer pull functions as micro-setting that constrains action (lever for untethering) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's POV, with spatial choreography coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly filtered through Theo's POV; the utility poles and astronomical compass constrain choice and charge the final image, with sensory detail purposefully integrated into action and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight is not merely atmospheric; it actively supplies the spices, points the way, and ultimately splits open to offer the corridor. The setting constrains choice and charges the final image, with sensory detail filtered through Mira’s urgency and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    The glade and the domestic objects (tablecloth, saucer) are vividly rendered and actively constrain choices, charging the final image with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Recycled spaceship setting pressures choices; photos and vial constrain actions and charge the final image; sensory details are selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.5)
    Setting is vividly sensory and actively constrains choices—the volcano’s eruption pressures escape, the cave’s glittering walls mirror the bugs’ rhythm. The black sand beach and celestial bodies charge the final image with transformative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.5)
    Setting is richly specific and integral, with the fort, sundial, and quill holder actively constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the sentinel's professional perception.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frictionless tidal bluff under the aurora is a masterfully integrated setting that actively constrains every choice (the harness, sliding) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Eren's professional and emotional priorities, making the environment indispensable to the plot's logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting (observatory, darkroom) is indispensable, constraining choice (timed exposures) and charging the final image ("descended into morning streets"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered ("domes wet as black pearls," "thunder rolled under us"). Spatial choreography is coherent; the micro-setting (timer, plates) functions as a tool that shapes the entire narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    The glass atrium and half-painted sundial are not just backdrop; they constrain choice (dueling strip, coded angles) and charge the final image (the sundial's line like a baton). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sensory details are vivid and purposeful—dented coffee tin, rusted library under stars—filtered through Len's poetic perception. The tin and library function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and tone supports the luminous fracture theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    The tidal arbor, flickering compasses, and hidden room are vivid, selective details that constrain choice and charge the final image. Setting is woven through action, with sensory detail filtered through Lio's POV. The environment directly pressures tactics, such as the compasses pointing toward the booth, and the room's stillness enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly realized and always functional: broken panes, silt lines, humidity, and drafts are not mere backdrop but the very forces the dust records. Environmental constraints (sensor loss, leak, drafts, mold) drive Mara’s tactics and the practical stakes, and the storm damage is the enabling pressure for the entire experiment. The recurring objects (dust, black plastic, seepage corner) are tightly woven into the final image of the dust map on the door. The setting’s slow “learning to breathe again” elegantly mirrors and charges the thematic and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canyon, frost, kiln, and glass tools are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a glass artist’s perception, giving the piece a rich atmospheric coherence. Environment directly constrains tactics: tracking through frost, building a makeshift furnace from stones, and using starlight to read the sealed ledger. The schoolhouse and town are lightly but effectively sketched, enough to make the public exposure scene land. Setting details evolve causally with events (frost erasing behind her, fire rings, dawn) and strongly charge the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly realized and tightly integrated: frost flowers, jungle orchids under domes, silent pulsing lamps and sensor benches all grow out of the “no noise” premise. Setting isn’t backdrop; its tools and constraints (heat sensors, benches, glass, domes) directly shape the tactics for making music and the form closure takes (“the conservatory glow with wordless, measurable song”). Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, consistently filtered through Orren and Mara’s priorities. The environment meaningfully charges the final image without any white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater city library is vividly, specifically rendered (“stone arches lean like drowned ribs,” chained tables, wax-sealed books) and entirely shapes what Marek can do. World rules—kelp curtains, clearer inner water, impossible aisles—are consistent and taught through action. The environment constrains tactics (cutting through kelp, navigating impossible spaces, wiring lens into brass receiver) and powerfully charges the final sense of housed quiet and a lighter sea. The recurring object-as-setting (lens, receiver, stacks) is integral to both conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridge above the port, the terra-cotta arbor, and the nocturnal food runs under sanctions are all concrete, sensorially vivid, and consistently filtered through Amira’s priorities. Setting actively shapes tactics—the midnight timing because guards are sleepier, the arbor as a discreet meeting/donation site, chalk stars marking doorways—rather than serving as backdrop. The recurring bell as a handled object and the arbor as the final gathering point charge the last image. There is still room to deepen how the physical hardship of the city constrains bodies in the peak scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The viaduct, wisteria, fog, river, and camera with its dark cloth are not decorative; they actively shape meaning and action (camera as ritual tool, rail as “wisteria-laced” altar, blossoms responding at climax). The setting’s sensory richness is tightly curated around the emotional stakes—fog as obscured feeling, lamps as “small moons,” petals and embers echoing stored love. Environmental response at the climax (petals shaking free, going dark on the pilgrim’s coat) tangibly charges the final reconfiguration. World rules stay coherent, with the light-magic feeling internal rather than world-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The living bridge garden is richly, specifically realized and continually intertwined with action: its ribs, vines, and hedges literally shape movement and choice. Environmental rules (organic structure, dreamlike responsiveness, reflection-based memory) remain consistent and evolve as the maze grows and contracts. The setting actively constrains tactics—hyperbolic paths, thickening tendrils, the center chamber—rather than functioning as backdrop, and the final “smaller, simpler, more humane” maze and empty river photograph charge the closing image. This is immersive and functional environment work at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival prize center, the fallen Wall, and the improvised use of piano, bench, and stuffed bear create a vivid, specific environment that directly shapes tactics. Setting is always filtered through urgency—tickets underfoot, grime, the hollow brick, the drums’ “hush of sleeping trees”—and never feels like postcard description. The carnival’s faded joy versus the new, dangerous hope of the seeds deepens atmosphere and theme. Environment and objects (especially the chain and bear) constrain and enable choices all the way to the final image, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, wreck-ring reef, aurora, forge, and grafted apple trees create a distinctive, fully inhabited micro-world filtered through Mara’s professional and synesthetic priorities. Setting not only decorates but constrains action: the wreck ring is where Jory died and where Rell dives, the greenhouse is both sanctuary and lab, and the forge is where memory-metal aids are literally made. The final image of apple blossoms opening “as if forgiving were just another growth” against the moaning wrecks recharges the environment with thematic weight. The world’s rules (salt-tolerant roots, hull-dust charcoal, jars of silence) stay internally consistent and materially shape options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald station and its green-tiling, platforms, and “destiny’s door” are vividly rendered and tightly bound to mood. Setting is not ornamental: the door, iron, and station geography directly constrain choices and enable the magic (jar humming, lock opening). Light conditions (sunset vs. moonlight) are spatial and tactile, not just pretty; they shape both what’s possible and what matters in the final bargain. The world’s rules around iron, oaths, and trains-that-don’t-run are consistent and do a lot of heavy lifting with minimal exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: melting ice, cracked permafrost, and the condemned control room mirror and pressure Mara’s inner thaw. The research station’s architecture and decay are filtered through her memory and vocation, from “ribs around an empty heart” to the antenna mast shedding meltwater, and the kiln and glass panels are fully embedded in place. The final image of the control room turned “observatory” is charged by this environment. It’s superbly handled, with only the mild sense that the harsh physical risk of the unstable structure remains more atmospheric than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted library, backlot, and soundstage are vivid and purposeful; details like “iron shelves bled orange dust” and “moths skated through moonlight like shredded film” create an eerie, cinematic atmosphere. Setting constrains tactics: the library yields catalog cards and charcoal, the soundstage provides the public arena and microphone. The seashell functions as a charged micro-setting-object, literally altering the final choice. World rules (props, vault, production codes) are consistent and integrated without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ridge fort, shell-ridge foundation, storm, chapel mosaics, and pebble bowl are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail tied to action (“walls sweating salt and thunder,” “marbled hush under every gust”). Environment actively shapes the method: the storm’s sound, the pebbles’ clatter, and the fort’s memory of storms all become tools for “summarizing silence.” The final image—spiral of pebbles, vanished star, blank booklet—depends on this specific setting logic. It’s excellent work, just shy of transcendent only because the physical constraints never quite force a practical, life-or-death decision.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen courtyard, blue-iced stones, and the salt cart are not mere wallpaper; they charge the tone and mirror the temporal stasis/looping. The ice-crystal violin as an object-setting hybrid constrains choice and literally enables the story’s mechanism, then returns in the final image reweighted with cost. Environmental details are filtered through J-17’s priorities (maintenance tasks, safety, tidiness) rather than listed, which keeps the world grounded. The academy’s broader presence (music wing, chapel incense, workshop lubricant) is sketched with economical, vivid touches that support the mundane-mystic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the “sheet of crushed crystal” forecourt, whispering stones, and silent concerts form a coherent, sensorially rich world filtered through Mara’s attention. The lens, office, projector room, and routes through the building are not just backdrop but functional geography that supports the ticket-map revelation. The forecourt returning at dawn, steaming as mistrust thaws, elegantly charges the final image without feeling forced. World rules (nonverbal communication, institutional conservatism) are consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden maze is vividly realized as both physical space (hedges, yew gate, rosemary, compost, lanterns) and conceptual arena where luck, choice, and memory intertwine. Environmental specifics—niches in hedges, chalk on stone, the center lawn—directly shape Elias’s tactics and the final image of leaving one marble under the oldest vine. World rules about the Luck Bureau and its meters are seamlessly embedded in the setting rather than dumped. The atmosphere of simultaneous bloom and decay deepens theme without lapsing into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The xenobiology station, glider-beasts, frost-filmed dome, and heated gloves create a rich, coherent environment that feels lived-in and professional. Setting actively constrains choices: the aviary risk, rooftop wind rigs, and cold roof dictate Mara’s tactics, and the nexus itself is a spatial and conceptual centerpiece. Details are selective and filtered through Mara’s working familiarity, avoiding tourist-list excess. The recurring objects (gloves, nexus, rotor) also charge the final image of “time” resuming while keeping “sideways secrets.”

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The flooded opera house, shallow pool in the pit, drowned stands, and flickering lanterns are vivid and integral: water enables the code, flood damage isolates spaces, and lantern placement shapes her path and the final staging. Setting and atmosphere aren’t postcard backdrops; they directly constrain choices (ankle-deep water, swollen door, in-between crawlspaces) and charge the final image of musicians playing in corridors. The sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, especially in how reflection and light are used to mirror the “in between” theme. At times the lushness approaches maximalist description, but it remains controlled and scene-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain weather station, instruments, and aurora are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s weather-trained, grief-saturated perception, avoiding generic “cold mountain” tropes. Environmental elements constrain choices (isolation, the iced-shut door, radiosonde balloons, Eli needing to check rime ice) and deeply inform the metaphors of pressure systems, fronts, and calibration. The botanical illustration functions as a micro-setting object that’s fully integrated into the emotional arc, literally laid out like a “chart of my lungs.” The final image of “faint noon aurora” and swaying certainties directly charges the closure with atmospheric specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and constantly purposeful: wet iron air, brick “throat,” rusted pipe and spindle, and the buried loading bay all guide specific actions and constraints. The beaded valve wheel and the tunnel architecture literally open and close access to the ghost shift, charging the final image when the narrator turns the wheel back. Sensory detail is well-balanced and POV-filtered (the narrator notices industrial remnants the way an explorer/appraiser would), with no white-room moments. This is top-tier scene-building for the length, though not quite so formally innovative as to demand 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings are vividly realized and highly integrated: mossy catacombs, riverbank, and obsidian chamber all feel textural and distinct. Environment shapes meaning and options—the sound-drinking refuge enforces silence, the shifting catacombs justify the swan’s map-function, and the collapsed ceiling plus sunbeam literally expose decay as “script.” Details are filtered through the archivist’s sensibility (paper as loam, atlases as ruined knowledge), creating a strong atmosphere that supports theme. Spatial and world rules are consistent, with the magical elements treated as extensions of this strange but legible library-world.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sage Ridge, the Dreaming Roots, and the eclipse are vividly evoked with economical, sensorial detail (“smelled of sage and cold sap, clean as a first note”). The environment constrains choices: they must climb, the grove offers a sheltered, liminal space, and the eclipse’s brief totality shapes the timing and intensity of Mara’s breakthrough. The micro-setting of the locket as carried object also charges the final image. A touch more use of physical constraint (weather, terrain as true obstacles) could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The reclaimed silo library is vivid and purpose-built: bronze dust, concrete skin, bricked hearth, window slit, and metal shell all shape what she can do and know. Setting details are always filtered through the premise of walls as witnesses and of direction changing, so the environment is never postcard; it literally "hears" the axis shift and hums back through concrete. The final signpost image depends on the silo’s door, walls, and wind to charge the new north, so environment directly loads the closure. Atmosphere and specificity are exceptionally controlled without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the after-hours takeout and the rocky island lighthouse—are vivid, specific, and tightly bound to action (conveyor ticking, west-step cleft, Fresnel lens, patrol boat scanning to the beam’s rhythm). Environment consistently constrains and enables choice: the beam’s reach, the hidden steps, and the geography of sea vs inland channel all determine tactics. The lighthouse-as-tooth and the harbor’s normalized superstition also reinforce tone and theme. There’s little wasted description; nearly every detail either orients or pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and functional: a basalt ring “bolted to air” over a rift that literally responds to conceptual shifts (mercy as boundary). Environmental constraints—one color, the Anchor’s sensitivity to promises—directly shape both tactics and the final image of the inner circle. Details are filtered through Selo’s ritualistic, sonic sensibility (loop pedal, muffled air, silence as ornament), tying atmosphere to function. The world’s rules stay consistent and materially affect the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake with their doubled horizon are not just pretty backdrops; they are the governing physics of the piece and literally enable the central act (aligning horizons, standing in “two dawns at once”). The micro-setting of the stairwell and crown windows, plus the kiosk below, orient us spatially and socially while mirroring the thematic split between mundane commerce and numinous ritual. The nautilus and glass wall function as charged objects-as-setting, constraining how the narrator can access the symphony. World rules (the mirrored horizon answering to honest memory) are taught and then paid off through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing viaduct, wet glass tiles, and river traffic are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Lysa’s embodied relationship to height and gravity. Setting is not just decorative: the bead of water falling to the river literally defines the temporal window of her power, and the bridge surface becomes the grid on which timelines branch. The ancient tablet as object-setting recurs and clearly charges the final image as she carries it as “proof that her self maze had an exit.” Overall, the environment meaningfully shapes both rules and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern, the quarry path, and the tactile soundscape filtered through a deaf protagonist create a highly specific, atmospheric setting where environment and tools (drums, phonograph, stone walls) directly constrain tactics. Mara’s habit of feeling vibrations in the floor and on the wall is both worldbuilding and mechanism for sensing the thinning hush, making the setting integral rather than decorative. The Listener as a cave-dwelling “keeper” deepens place-based mythology in a way that feeds the stakes. This is just shy of the very top band because the broader world (town, school) remains mostly gestural rather than texturally present.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the jasmine courtyard, rooftops, riverbreath, and warehouse district all feel tactile and filtered through the narrator’s meteorological sensibility. Environmental constraints and affordances matter to tactics—the lateral crossing of walls and roofs, the gap at the waterline, the pigeon loft, and the riverwalk all shape how the protagonist navigates danger. The return to the darkened courtyard and jasmine at the end charges the final image with earned calm and conceptual cost. A slight excess of descriptive richness in a few spots edges toward lushness, but it largely serves atmosphere and theme rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Orphan Conservatory/greenhouse is vivid and integral: the “greenhouse for extinct plants” and “crystal shadows” are not just ornamental but define the stakes (resurrecting species) and the emotional crucible (where his mother died/worked). Setting details like ash-filled labeled pots, pumps warming nutrient mist, and resurrecting vines all directly constrain the ritual and tie remembrance to living growth. The environment charges key choices (bringing the vial here, using it as catalyst, his new role as lantern guide) and deeply colors the final image. Sensory specificity, especially around smell and light, feels filtered through his professional and personal lens, not touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    The settings—the humming highways and especially the terra-cotta grotto—are specific, sensorial, and tightly tied to action and theme. The grotto’s layered roof directly motivates the choice of location and the “uncovering layers” method, and its physical strata mirror and constrain the rope mapping. The energy beings, highways, and badlands feel lived-in rather than touristic, with details like “highways hummed like tuning forks” doing multiple jobs. Environment and key objects decisively charge the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally textured and particular—Echo Harbor, shipwreck-ringed sunken greenhouse, ash-stained palms, glass ribs “like a whale’s skeleton,” all filtered through Mara’s acoustic focus. Environmental rules are consistent: the hush actually alters behavior (no creaks, gulls’ silent cries, speech feeling rude) and the cistern’s unrippling water physically embodies the knot. Place constrains tactics: she must go inland to this specific greenhouse, attend to the cistern, and use the bowl/violin there for the attempt. The recurring bowl and the harbor’s auditory landscape strongly charge the final image of her walking back, though the greenhouse itself, while integral, could in theory be swapped with another singular ruin without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    The amber grotto is vivid, sensorial, and meaning-bearing: “bottled honey” ledges, resinous air that literally changes lungs, dusk bleeding violet, and coins slick with resin. Environment constrains choices—the grotto “demanded honesty” and its air is the mechanism of Orin’s looming death, so Mira’s method and timing are inseparable from place. Details are consistently filtered through her professional nose and haptic sensitivity, making the world feel inhabited rather than touristic. The final image of embers in the sky and a lantern-like glow under Orin’s ribs charges the setting as an active participant in the transformation, not just backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor fog, promenade, dunes, and roof-deck library form a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels lived-in and thematically apt for “unsung hands” and quiet labor. Details like windows that “never fully shut” and the box labeled Unsung Hands deepen atmosphere while reflecting the story’s preoccupations. The setting supports character behavior (Mara choosing the opposite flow on the promenade; the library as after-concert refuge) rather than reading as postcard description. Environment enhances tone and theme more than it constrains options, which keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystalline orchard, crater shimmer, and obsidian arbor are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Sava’s sensibility as a reed sculptor. Environment repeatedly shapes meaning and options: the dangerous ice-sheets motivate the search; the crater shimmer and obsidian arbor charge the kinship revelation; the final winter ice and tag on reeds reweight the entire landscape as a network of connection. Details like crystal fruit ringing and craterlight as “a wound trying to heal” serve both atmosphere and theme without feeling like static postcard description. Spatial and world rules remain coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    The city built atop a sleeping giant with rooftop canals is not just decorative; the Giant’s movements threaten collapse and dictate timing, and the canals provide Rin’s literal path to his throat. Environmental details (warm drafts in the vent, dead museum acoustics, canal air swallowing voices) are sharply filtered through her sensory priorities. World rules around sound, time, and architecture are consistent and learned in motion. The final image—ferrying a freed echo through those same canals under the looming Giant—recharges the setting as a charged constraint, not a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern orchard is vivid, strange, and consistently filtered through Lysa’s priorities—roots, stone branches, and stalactite drops all matter to the spell, not just as décor. Environmental constraints meaningfully shape the action: silence and dripping mark time, the mosaic is embedded in the path, the calcite trees define where the seam can open, and the ladder is a specific physical tool repurposed into spellwork. The orchard’s atmosphere mirrors the emotional stakes (ambiguous, half-living space) without sliding into blunt allegory. This is publish-ready setting work; only the sheer density of images risks, very slightly, tipping toward decorative in places.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shadowed library, vents, pipe chases, and flickering city lights are not mere backdrop; they actively constrain how Lio moves, hides, and helps. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (copper smell, condensation, “sapphire hush”), and the building’s physical systems double as emotional cartography. The setting directly shapes tactics (he can assist only through the infrastructure) and charges the final image of him listening through the vents. Environment and recurring objects (tin, tape) clearly function as micro-setting that powers the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: storm season on a coastal highway, mossy trellis, wet mint, and damp soil all filter through Mara’s plant-obsessed attention. Weather is not decorative; storms bring the leaf, break the sign and trellis, and frame the time window of change. The trellis and nursery function as micro-settings that constrain and enable choices, especially the reconstruction sequence and the final evenings under the rebuilt structure. The world feels specific and lived-in without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is superbly realized: the tidal causeway, rain trails that “run toward what wants to be found,” the roofless chapel, and the sinkhole all feel tactile and rule-bound. The environment constrains behavior (tides, timing of crossings) and spiritually mirrors the convergence premise without over-explicit symbolism. Recurring objects (brooch, instruments, rain) and the island’s hydrology directly charge the final image. A slight increase in how the physical peril of tide or terrain constrains moment-to-moment tactics could make the pressure as strong as the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid, sensorially specific, and integral to how the story works: crystals chime as Sera moves, the cave stores intentions, overlapping shadows form seams, and “bright darkness” justifies the unlit lantern. Setting actively shapes events—the pearl responds to song, the shadows permit the force’s movement, and the environment’s properties are what allow the wish and the possession at all. The final contrast of the cave’s charged glow with “ordinary footsteps” on the surface reweights the entire environment thematically rather than serving as pure spectacle. A slight additional sense of physical risk from the cave itself would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ivory harbor after rain, with wet salt, crushed lime, gulls, and “rain-bright stones,” is vivid and threads the whole piece, returning in the final image to frame the transformed note. Setting is not just postcard; the harbor as a social space—quay, doorways, bell tower—organizes who can gather, wait, or hide, and the maritime milieu makes exile, routes, and absences feel materially grounded. The recurring valve and trumpet function almost as micro-setting objects, charging the environment with political and emotional history. Still, environmental constraints rarely force specific tactical choices, so the setting is thematically potent more than logistically decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: mist lanes, the “starlit vault” roof, dew-glimmering rails, and the star-colored lamp all feel filtered through a cartographer’s eye. Environment and recurring objects constrain choices—the pavement cracks physically point her, and the hidden stair and bench-localized conductor stage the key confrontation. The final image of mapping corridors by “star-dust on her shoes” tightly braids place, object, and inner arc. Occasionally the density of description edges toward ornamental, but it generally remains in service of mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The basalt headland, roofless tower, salt wind, brass instruments, and whales create a distinctive, embodied place that feels inextricable from the story’s concerns. The tower is not backdrop: it functions as a pilgrimage site and physical container for sorrow, and its open-air architecture plus the railings for pinning squares directly shape how the ritual works. The whales’ migration and surfacing “like turning pages” explicitly charge the final image. Description remains selective and purposeful; nothing feels like a tourist catalog.

    The prismatic escondite, with its folded corridors, magnetic lattice, and spinning glass prisms, is vivid and functions as more than décor: its spatial mutiny and dimensional leanings literally dictate what choices are possible. Environmental details evolve with the storm (hallways reconfiguring, railings becoming ladders) and directly constrain movement and stakes. The recurring glass/prism imagery filters perception and charges the final council scene rather than feeling like ornament. World rules (magnetic fields, spatial allegiance) are consistently implied through action instead of dumped in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The funeral home prep room is concrete and atmospheric (“air tasted of disinfectant and roses that refused to die”), with tools and the corpse integrated into action and meaning. The setting constrains choices—the existence of an “unclaimed” body and toe tag is tactically used to sway the agent—and the ink pot functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Environmental specifics align with Mara’s professional eye and moral concerns, avoiding generic mortuary imagery. This is extremely strong, though not quite revelatory enough to justify a 9+ under these standards.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings are vivid and integral: the paste-and-cedar shop, the silent town, and especially the bonsai labyrinth where “each turn seemed to open onto a different century.” Environment is not postcard backdrop; it directly shapes tactic and meaning—he goes to the mountaintop seeking “rougher grains” of time, and the bonsai scale lets him test imagined histories against touch. The lightning-split oak and the maintenance shed’s lamp charge the final revaluation of silence, fulfilling the 9-band gate in spirit, though I’m capped by the global 9+ rule. Sensory detail is consistently filtered through Haru’s professional and temporal obsessions, giving the world a strong lived-in bias.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port and container labyrinth are richly realized and constantly active: tides move gaps, walls throw back voices, and container stacks literally hide and protect the files he rescues. Details are always filtered through his idiosyncratic senses and work life, avoiding postcard description. The environment constrains tactics (waiting for ebb, prying open 9H at slack tide, using stacks to hide folders) and charges the final image of tide-washed footprints and thickened port air.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, sea fog, cracked dome, greened brass, and star charts are vivid and tightly integrated with the story’s concerns about perception and pattern. Objects-as-setting (telescope, shell, compass, half-finished cello, book) are not decorative; they shape Eli’s options and charge the final image of the observatory keeping the hum “inside the whisper of closing pages.” The environment’s tone (kindly yet gloomy) mirrors Eli’s own “gloomy cheerfulness” without heavy-handed symbolism. The only restraint is that physical constraints (cliff, weather) don’t exert direct tactical pressure beyond atmosphere, so the setting is more thematic than obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft-city carnival is vivid and specific—“pontoons, barges, and old theater floors” and “dancers hauling ropes” embed us in a tactile, lived-in environment. Setting is not decorative: the city’s modular float-architecture and hidden tie points literally enable the resistance tactic and define the stakes of mapping versus unmapping. The anchor pier chip and final mural of a stone heart cracking into boats charge the closing image with place-based meaning. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual could elevate it further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The summit, observatory dome, crater, and moonlight are vivid and tightly woven into action—the wind dropping, the smell of scorched pine, the dome slit, and the moving satellites all shape what Mara can see and do. Environmental constraints (night, altitude, dawn, coming artificial lights) directly pressure her tactics and choices. The hourglass and single sand grain function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image without feeling over-signaled. Description remains selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog while sustaining a cohesive, mournful atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rail depot and repair shop are richly and economically realized: mist, rusted signs, cedar, and the slate channel turn the setting into an instrument rather than backdrop. The condensation-fed fountain and prism are not just pretty—they directly constrain Lio’s method and thus the repair tactic. Environmental details evolve with action (doors opened for mist and harbor light, water poured, roof shivering with the horn), and the final echo between anchor chain beads and the slate channel is precise and earned. This is high-level setting work that shapes both process and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The outpost, frozen lake, and steaming convergence hollow are sharply drawn, with details like rusted hinges, dead radio, and rising mist doing double duty for mood and constraint. The environment directly shapes tactics—the broken window and condensation pattern enable the map breakthrough, and the tundra walk plus blizzards explain their isolation and reliance on Slate. Setting images evolve meaningfully, from silent ice to a singular, living spring that embodies the story’s core concept. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk in the landscape during the journey could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are major strengths: the Lumen Gate as “the town’s ear,” cobblestones as frozen river, kiln and fountain as chiming bodies all create a tactile, acoustic world. Environmental details are not postcard decoration; they’re the medium of action and the mechanism of change. The rules of this quasi-magical acoustic town are consistent and learned by watching Sava work rather than through exposition. The only ceiling here is that we stay tightly on one street, so the larger world’s specificity (mines, governor) remains more schematic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater temple is vivid, tactile, and integrated into action—the coral-furred pillars, relief of the drowned king, spiral of shells, and bronze mirror aren’t postcard details but functional components of the world’s “ancient technology.” Environment constantly constrains and enables choice: depth, failing rebreather, current muffling signal, the knot of kelp and copper, and the silence itself define Mara’s problem and its solution. The setting also charges the final image, returning to “lonesome splendor” with new weight as a guardian of intangible wealth. This is just shy of 9 because while the description is excellent, one or two more concrete frictions (physical navigation, tactile impediments) could have deepened its role as obstacle rather than mainly atmospheric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are not mere backdrop; they dictate isolation, the search pattern, the rotation of the beam, and the inevitability of the bodies’ eventual discovery. Details like the scuffed door, iron ladder, salt-mottled lens, and “reef began to show its teeth” are sharply filtered through the boy’s sensibility and echo his internal stakes. Setting actively shapes tactics (hovering under the rotating beam, navigating the old wing) and heavily charges the final image of dawn and docks. World rules stay consistent, with the one magical element (the lattice) integrated smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse/orchard in an endless-night, winter-locked valley is vivid and constantly active: panes, heaters, frozen rivers, and moonlight sap all constrain what Eli can do. The environment shapes tactics (distilling moonlight, building a resonator among grafted trees) and is not a backdrop but the instrument of salvation. The final pear that “glowed with bottled dawn” is an excellent charged-object culmination of the setting. On a ruthless line, a tiny trim of descriptive redundancy would sharpen impact without dulling atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integral: wharf, orchids, tide pools, and especially the red canyon labyrinth all shape what is possible and what it costs. Environmental features constrain tactics—the maze’s collapses and mouths, the rockfalls, the hidden altar, and iron rings all directly determine Ila’s methods and discoveries. Sensory detail (smell of salt and kelp, “sweet, bruised perfume” of orchids) deepens atmosphere without feeling like a tour. The final image of the plate as a window with sea wind moving through the maze is charged by all the prior spatial and sensory work.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly and economically rendered—“tree roots snaked between bones and ribs made pale trellises,” apples smelling of incense and soil—and these details consistently interact with action (roots marking voids, bones as structural and moral constraints). Environment directly shapes tactics: she maps the orchard by walking it, navigates collapses via root corridors, and the roots “tightening” metaphorically brace the roof during the reading. The sundial, watch, and orchard together charge the final image of resumed time and pilgrims walking the paths. Setting is inseparable from character and theme rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The golden arcade is vivid and integral: its museum-of-commerce design, gold tiling, and embedded conduits all constrain tactics (the floor as envelope, the old “RETURNS” slot concealing the hatch). Details like drones “like old pigeons” and the chalk on the walls do double duty as atmosphere and plot devices. The environment directly enables the discovery of the interception cache and the trap’s deployment, and the closing image (“across the golden tiles”) is charged by all that prior work. Description is rich but remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt observatory, dome, oculus, and clockwork orrery are not decorative; they anchor every action and literally constrain tactics (the synchronization mechanics, brass rail, and beacon machinery shape what is possible). The eternal candle as shrine fire, invariant across realities, becomes a micro-setting object whose properties directly determine how they identify the conspirators’ chosen branch. Autumn wind, dry leaves, and “echoed silence” modulate atmosphere without bloating description, reinforcing isolation and tension. The final sense of the observatory as a space holding a “held breath” richly recharges the opening environment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth, stilt house, salt-filmed window, and condensation-writing spirits form a richly textured, coherent environment that shapes what is possible—she must pass through roots “like questions,” use the house and window as her interface, and rely on moonlight to heal the shard. Setting details are not decorative; the window is the literal and symbolic plane of communication, and the condensation fading in the final image charges closure. Weather and water are integrated into action via floating letter strips and the spirits’ singing in the leaves. The world’s rules (shard memory, moonlight healing, condensation messages) are consistent and taught through use, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass roof twilight, water lilies, and reef imagery are vivid and filtered through Lani’s sensibility, giving the hospital a liminal, sacred feel that deepens the moral stakes. The brain coral and the cast function as micro-settings/objects that structure perception and charge the final image of grafting meaning. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics in a physical sense, but it powerfully frames the choice between violence and vigil. The specificity and integration with theme and closure are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard district and “centuries of thick fog” are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s artistic eye, with strong, specific images like fog sitting “in the branches like old wool” and walls “begging for color that no sun could give.” Setting is not just backdrop: the fog becomes an active surface for projections, the sunless district necessitates painting with light, and the buried orchard schoolhouse shapes the search and the key discovery. The recurring physical spaces (marketplace shell, orchard rows, courtyard wall) are coherent and evolve meaningfully as the investigation proceeds. The environment consistently supports the story’s tone and thematic preoccupation with lost/latent joy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden is vividly and economically realized—“hedges cut into sine curves, stones tuned to ring, pools shaped like commas”—and it strongly shapes action (clapping to map cracks, walking to where the long echo reflects). Environment and recurring objects (garden, mural, coin, comma pool) constrict and enable choices rather than sitting as backdrop. The surreal acoustic physics remain internally consistent and feed atmosphere. The final images—nickel in the pinhole, echoed footsteps forming a question—are charged by the fully established setting.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse is vividly realized and tactically crucial: humidity fogs drone lenses, moth dust disrupts auditors, and insect rooms provide both cover and coding surface. The broader city—where thoughts are taxable and gardens become public syntax—emerges via concrete institutional detail (Revenue Bureau, auditors, drones) rather than exposition. Setting is not postcard decoration; it constrains surveillance and enables resistance, and the final image of “garden messages outside took root” is charged by everything established. There’s little slack description; nearly every environmental detail does double work for mood and mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gargantuan shell city, rib walkways, Heart-Cistern, and bioluminescent lilies create a striking, coherent environment that never drops into white-room abstraction. Setting directly shapes action and closure: she must follow the spiral map, descend through the shell’s ribs, and use the architecture’s acoustics so the shell can “repeat the tune” and awaken the treaty. The environment also charges the final image as blossoms’ light travels through Nacre and outward “like dawn through kelp.” World rules (shell hums, lilies metabolize sorrow, lullaby-echo mechanics) are consistent and legible through action, not infodump.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal library above the clouds and the museum of extinct feelings are richly specific and deeply intertwined with action: orchids store names, the museum yields the needed bamboo, and displays like the Hall of Apologies exert palpable pressure. Environmental details are filtered through the caretaker’s priorities and profession, never reading as a neutral tour. Recurring objects (orchids, chime, lamp) are spatially consistent and charge the final image. The setting both constrains options (isolation, need to traverse the museum) and shapes how the theme of preservation manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Extinct Language Archive is vivid and specific (clay tablets, bone slips, cedar oil, cold quartz) and clearly inflected by Mara’s professional gaze. The vault and its tools (codex, tuning fork, ink well) don’t just decorate the scene; they are the operational infrastructure of the ritual and its stakes. Weather and building (“last summer storm,” rattling windows) support mood without bogging down action. The setting’s logic is consistent, and the archive-as-courtroom metaphor quietly informs the social dynamics in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carved amphitheater inside a breathing volcano is vivid and specific, with vents, ash, and acoustics all woven into action—the warm vent literally enables the dye to appear and thus the plot to move. Details are filtered through Mara’s professional and ethical priorities, especially the surveyor’s chain and gate schematics. The environment also mirrors the thematic tension (a crumbling, living structure where people argue about rigid vs. pulsed control) without feeling over-symbolic. It stops short of a fully charged final image tied to setting, which keeps it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The attic is richly realized—foxed paper, pigeon feed, skylight dust, floorboards hiding scores—and every major object is functional rather than decorative. The environment constrains and enables choices: pigeons as secure couriers, the floorboards as an archive, the skylight and dust as a selection tool. The final image of birds leaving into dust-lit air, with the attic “emptying,” recharges earlier setting details into a charged emotional space. World rules (book bans, Archives, rooftop singers) feel consistent and are conveyed economically through setting-inflected action.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drifting prism terraces, pavilion, and repurposed maze doorframe are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s concerns about distance and thresholds. Setting actively constrains choices—the wind-timed corridor, narrow leaps, and single doorframe shape what she can do and when. The wood grain as a temporal/ethical map elegantly fuses environment with method and theme. The final image of her building “her own maze of doors” on the terrace is strongly charged by all this prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater research facility is extraordinarily vivid—glass corridors with “pockets of breath,” algae-lit screens, jellies in the ceiling—and always filtered through purpose (mapping hollows, tending air plants, reading algae currents). Environment actively shapes choices: the cracked dome, surrounding pressure, and drowned streets constrain movement and charge the decision to open the terrarium there. Recurring objects (the dome, feather, terrarium, algae-zodiac) all feed the final image. This is premiere-level atmosphere with tactile specificity; I’m only holding it just under perfect because the physical danger of the structure doesn’t materially alter tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The geode, foam, crater glass, and cliff are all sharply rendered with specific, sensuous detail and clearly belong to the same strange ecology. Setting is not backdrop; the geode’s property of hoarding stories directly explains how emotional ruptures erase physical paths, and the crystal doorway and central cavern contour the characters’ actions. Recurring setting elements (foam, seeds, crystal facets) return at the end charged with new meaning, especially as the seeds straighten when the emotional gap is mended. One small limitation is that the wider world beyond this coast stays impressionistic, but for this length the central environment does more than enough work.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal arcade is richly and specifically rendered—“ribbed tunnel of tin and glass,” water threatening the floorboards, crab nets, photo booth—and the rising tide and warped lock concretely constrain tactics in the rescue. The environment persistently interacts with action (warnings, water seeping under the booth, water tapping pilings at the end), and the sea/arcade interface mirrors the theme of controlled wilderness. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, though one could imagine pushing the physical sensation of danger a hair further under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight garden is richly imagined and tightly integrated: its namelessness exempts it from the ban, its fountains and hedges speak in the idiom of tides, and it literally produces the keeper who sets terms. The setting constrains choice (anchoring to the bench, the need to dance seated) and supplies the crucial resource (brine-infused ink) that charges the tattoo and final image. Details like “brine language only dancers understood” and “obsidian grace settling over leaves” marry atmosphere with function. Very slight risk of decorative lushness keeps this just under the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor, prism atrium, mist, and lily pond are richly particular and always filtered through Ilya’s eye for light and surfaces, avoiding “tourist catalog” description. Setting is not mere backdrop: the glass roof, fog, and repaired pane literally shape what the inspector sees; the pond’s ripples physically embody the competing futures of efficiency vs motion. This environment decisively charges the final images, though the realism of the broader city politics beyond this pocket of setting is left largely offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge, pines, and distant constellations create a focused, tactile atmosphere that feels lived-in and tonally apt for reckoning rather than action. The porcelain box functions as a micro-setting anchor, repeatedly handled and visually recharged (“fractures so they looked like small rivers”) and crucially charging the final image as Jonah carries it. Environmental details are selective, filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lens, and never devolve into tourist catalog. While the ridge itself doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, the night lookout setting is believable as the only plausible site for this kind of vulnerable exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto, sea, and town are sensually and conceptually rich (“tide-polished,” “shops closing with apologies,” chalk proofs on stone) and strongly filtered through Mina’s mind. Setting is not postcard: the grotto’s thin stone becomes the literal/figurative membrane for data leakage across worlds, and the offshore updraft is a discovered environmental structure that enables the ending. The balloonist’s gauge as a recurring tool-object grounds the speculative element in tactile reality and directly charges the final communal scene. A slightly more tactile sense of physical risk aloft could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vividly rendered—salt fog, heat, ivy veils, soot-tasting air, ceramic plates—and consistently filtered through an acoustic professional’s gaze. The environment is not just backdrop: vents, plates, and bricked-up spaces directly shape what she can access and discover. The “after the climate shifts” city and abandoned academy feel textured without exposition dumps. While the climate-shifted world doesn’t tightly constrain her final choice, the academy’s physicality clearly structures the story’s action and discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“spring had opened the city like a wet book,” the canal, the prism parapet, echoing terrace—and all of it is filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The environment is not mere backdrop: the prism parapet, rainlight, and echoes recur and charge key beats, especially when the mirror is set against the parapet and when the rainlight “dims to ordinary stone” at the end. While the terrace doesn’t physically constrain options, it symbolically frames the movement from enchanted possibility to earned reality. Sensory detail is rich yet coherent, with weather and sound (echo, lullaby) shaping atmosphere and linking to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace, mosaics, solstice line, and rising celestial bodies are vivid and consistently filtered through Sera’s purpose, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Setting is not just backdrop: the solstice timing, the line on the stones, and the “indifferent waltz” of sky bodies all echo and charge the final image. Objects like the bowl and clipboard act as micro-setting anchors that organize action. While the environment shapes meaning more than physical options, it does so with unusual precision at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat, thunder, and dried riverbed cracks are vivid and particular, learned through what Inez needs from them (a readable map, a chapel-like solitude). Environment actively constrains choice: she must keep the drought going, walk barefoot across cutting salt, and use the basin’s emptied geometry to locate the spot. The recurring objects (egg, survey stake, stake-top as altar) charge the final image rather than sitting as décor. World rules about water control, dams, and cloud-leasing are consistent and spare.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and glass sanctuary are vividly specific and recur with shifting charge, framing both the oppressive gala and the liberating release of echoes. Setting details are filtered through Maris’s attentiveness—“alarming serenity,” “calm knives” of light—and support theme and tone rather than feeling decorative. The sanctuary’s design and rules (breath-lock, threads of light, stored vows) directly constrain tactics and enable the plot turn. Weather and environment (snow catching scattered syllables) effectively charge the final communal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    The decommissioned radar dome and seedy bars are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Ilya’s sensibility (“sky the color of cold tin,” “breath echoed… like a distant meteor hush”), creating a strong tonal field. The dome is not just décor; it literally stores the story stick, embodies listening, and becomes the final performance site, charging the last image. Environmental details (old equipment as “obedient puppets”) echo and enrich the puppetry motif. Spatial and sensory anchoring remain clear, and the recurring dome/”listening” imagery materially shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto above a “cloud sea,” thin soil, and the abandoned weather station are not postcard dressing; they meaningfully constrain what Arin can build (transient frames) and enable his signaling tactic (cloth above the clouds). Sensory detail is vivid yet selective—“moss dripped from basalt,” “sunlight came in slow blushes”—and always filtered through Arin’s purpose. The setting directly charges the final image (marigold cloth over the station door, empty grotto after migration). A small deduction comes only because the environment rarely pushes back beyond the single gust; it’s gorgeously rendered but slightly gentle as a source of real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The icebound sanctum under aurora is vividly rendered through multiple senses (breath “like filings in a bell,” seal-oil lamps, hissing furnace) and consistently filtered through the caster’s technical eye. Environment is not postcard backdrop: cold, ice walls, and auroral light all materially shape what’s possible (rope frozen in place, need to warm gloves, light as reader of knots, furnace hissing in ice). Recurring objects-as-setting—the rope, the bells in the ice, the bronze strip—charge the final image and thematically mirror thaw and preservation. Specific world rules (aurora reading knots, history in rope-braids) feel coherent and fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rewilded forest and vine-draped bunker are exquisitely realized and consistently filter through the narrator’s perception (“vines…like green fingers refusing surrender,” “map made of heartbeat lines”). Environment and object-as-setting actively constrain and shape events: the slot, the hatch, the rotting directive, the encroaching storm, and the forest’s ‘will’ all inform what is possible. The final image of the forest taking the narrator’s weight “like a handshake” directly charges the theme and reweights the whole setting relationship. Detail is dense but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “reimagined Babylonian palace of glass roofs and baked-brick arches” is vivid and economically drawn, with specificity like bricked-up stairwells, rubble, and circuit-like metal inlays that make the buried chamber feel both ancient and futuristic. Setting meaningfully constrains and enables action: the stripped treasury explains his frugality, the quiet interregnum permits his vigil, the bricked stair and hidden chamber physically shape the quest. The final contrast between the stirring palace above and the cool, veiled chamber below charges the last image. A slight ceiling comes from the environment not materially resisting him; it is atmospheric and conceptually rich more than tactically obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Soundless Sanctuary and the endlessly revising city are sharply evoked and meaningfully constrain tactics—the silence necessitates cellular memory as “sound,” and the shifting streets explain the refugees’ disorientation and forgotten songs. The glass-wall moment at the hardest shift externalizes inner instability and heightens panic. The music box and the stone floor function as micro-setting, literally channeling rhythm through bodies to resolve the conflict. World rules about silence and revision are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard district, frost, fog, terraces, and dead branches are vivid and idiosyncratic, and they are consistently filtered through Lio’s craft-focused eye. Environment is not mere backdrop: fog becomes manipulable material through his breathing, the ruined architecture supplies brass, and the terrace height and visible constellations are necessary for his final attempt. The contrast between the ruined, frost-bitten “real” district and its restored version within the mirror is central to the ending’s charge. Weather and glass-like imagery modulate tone and tactics rather than sitting as static description.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned cathedral turned orchard is vivid, specific, and filtered through Mira’s sensibility (“saints should have swept”), giving the piece a strong atmosphere. The pear tree at the altar, with its carved and crossed-out vows, elegantly fuses environment with theme. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, it does meaningfully charge the story’s conceptual space around deciduous promises. Sensory detail is rich without becoming touristic, and spatial relations (aisle, rafters, choir stall) are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard, mirrors, bathroom, logbook, and glass case are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s curator’s eye. Setting is not postcard: the orchard as family archive, the bathroom as thinking chamber, and the logbook as temporal frame all meaningfully charge the final choice. While the environment doesn’t constrain her physically, it constrains meaning and options conceptually, which is apt for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore, receipt-clerk, and botany stair with alphabets are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with action—books as seedlings, shelves as planters, and the mountain answering with a “chord” all constrain and enable choices. Setting rules (books kept, maze that avoids correction, payment in memories) are consistent and learned through behavior. Environmental features repeatedly create and solve problems (the fork and clerk, the botanical corridor, the vault of blank spines). The final image of the mountain’s fading shelves and answered symphony crystallizes the world as an active, responsive system rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the stakes: the fog walls, compass failure, welded ferris wheel, and silver filaments all constrain movement and options. Setting details evolve with the action (corrupted colors, awakening carnival lights, hidden greenhouse) and culminate in the garden of tags, which charges the final image. The environment is never a postcard; it actively shapes Mara’s path and methods. This is high-level atmospheric work with clear narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mechanism room, gears, pendulum, and impossible door are vivid and purposeful, with the environment literally listening and responding to her use of the seal and rope. The “archive made of gaps” is a striking, specific extension of setting that crystallizes the story’s conceptual stakes. Setting meaningfully shapes action: she must work within the cramped, gear-laced tower, use the ceremonial rope, and accept the tower’s temporal logic (door appearing when it “forgets its own shape”). The final image of the tower keeping perfect time ties environment directly to thematic resolution, charging the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: harmonic caves, ice fissures, the Forge of Listening, and the echo stone all constrain tactics and drive plot. Details are filtered through Sava’s acoustic bias, so environment and profession merge into a lived-in world. The final images (storms settled into the Forge, the bloom of hush renewed) are inseparable from place. World rules (sound as mapping, beings feeding on vibration) feel internally consistent and discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly specific—the salt flats, beacon-tower, and “glass humming pavilion” are tactile and atmospheric without bloat. Recurring objects (tower, prism, hush shard) function as environmental constraints and tools, not mere décor, and the meteor shower and ruined highway ground the post-collapse world. The pavilion’s hum/silence and the tower’s height directly shape the protagonist’s tactics and options. A slightly wider sense of the surrounding wasteland’s dangers could further deepen the setting’s pressure, but what’s here is already high-level.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    The observatory, solid fog, storm, and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered and consistently rule-bound; the environment is never generic. Setting directly constrains tactics: the hardened fog blocks return, the dulled sun forces conjectural measurements, and the storm’s rise literally threatens to drop the observatory and scatter memories. Recurring objects (monuments, shadows, lenses, crystals) are not mere décor; they’re the actual machinery of retrieval and the means of resolution. The final image of measuring the “first new shadow” under a still-solid fog charged with memory is tightly linked to these environmental choices.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fortress, famine camps, wall gardens, river gate, and starless sky are all vivid and integrated into how events unfold—the blocked river gate is a literal structural obstacle, and the blooming walls/bleak surroundings sharpen the thematic contrast. Sensory detail is rich but mostly purposeful, consistently filtered through a pyrotechnician’s eye (color, lift, fuse, powder). Environment constrains tactics (fireworks as diversion within enclosed courtyard; gate-clearing under cover of spectacle) and charges the final image of a sky that “no longer felt empty.” A slight abundance of atmospheric flourishes edges toward lushness, but they stay coherent and do not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: tide-locked grotto, starlight crack, trapped pools, and “wet stone at the turn of tide” are not just pretty but inseparable from the story’s logic and theme. The environment actively constrains action (low-tide access window, the grotto as an “older” repository of intervals, the future harbor threatening the shoreline ecology). Mara’s perceptions of the place are filtered through her chronicler’s eye, so details feel motivated rather than touristic. The final image of footprints erased yet the beach “unchanged” recharges setting into a conceptual statement about time and change.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “xenial trellis above the clouds” and inversion hour are vividly and economically realized, with sensory and spatial specificity (ropes, planks, scorched vines, jars). Environment genuinely constrains action: the inversion timing, rope crossings, and burned section all shape what the protagonist must do and fear. The jars, hushling, and gravity bells recur as charged objects/micro-settings that structure the experience. The final image of the room widened by the jar of gilded hush is powerfully rooted in these environmental details.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is rich, specific, and functional: the drifting prism terrace, glass-floored gondola, cables, storm glass, and rail yards beneath all shape what’s possible and how pressure is perceived. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s acoustic bias (noise meter, cable creaks) and directly affect choices, particularly how he modulates speed and reassures Mara. The terrace and valley become a kind of “vaulted chamber” that thematically echoes and materially enables the creation of hush. A hair under 9+ only because a few descriptive flourishes lean more to beauty than constraint, but the integration is still very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is richly specific and filtered through Ione’s sensibility—ozone and paper, cassette hiss, the waterfall sounding like radio static, bioluminescent orchard veins all reinforce “futuristic nostalgia.” The environment meaningfully constrains action: her badge bypasses drones; the waterfall is a literal threshold; the orchard and pavilion hide the map; the underground chamber’s design governs how she can respond to the throne. Details remain purposeful rather than touristic, and the waterfall/orchard recur to charge the final emergence at sunrise. The only small limit is that physical environment never quite pinches her options into visible danger, so its pressure stays more atmospheric than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The burned chapel, ash, starlight, and warm iron rings form a dense, coherent atmosphere that is both beautiful and functional. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the ashen threshold, the encroaching ash, and the imprint of Lio’s knees directly shape what’s possible and charge the final image of her alone in the charcoal sanctuary. Details are well-filtered through Mara’s ritualistic, grief-attuned perception. A minor risk is occasional image stacking that edges toward ornamental, though it rarely loses tether to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered and functionally integrated: its damp aisles, spores, and shed clinic are not just pretty backdrops but the stage and mechanism of transformation. The submarine bolt as a recurring, handled object anchors depth and pressure, and the sterilization drum plus spores physically host the climax. World rules about concepts becoming physical remain consistent and are discoverable through action, not exposition dumps. A slight visual dominance of description over other senses keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, gramophones, dust, and portraits create a coherent, tactile atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables action—the hidden notch in the portrait, the gramophone’s acoustics, the dust mapping standing waves, the balcony above the courtyard—and the environment meaningfully charges the final image when Leander returns the crank “to mark where the next builder should begin.”

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, endless night, and reality-shifting branches are vivid, integrated, and always filtered through Calven’s devotional, wary gaze (“a chapel where equations prayed”). Setting isn’t postcard backdrop: the midnight shifts, grafted coin/pear trees, brass roots, and leaded-glass door all directly structure what he can perceive and do, and the final image of luminous saplings bowing and chemical rain applauding charges the closure. The micro-setting of armor, compass, and marionette stage functions as a lived environment shaping his actions rather than static props. A hair shy of 9+ only because the physical constraints of the space are more atmospheric than tactically oppositional; nothing in the environment truly resists him.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The foster care file room is vivid and particular (“metal cabinets sweated in summer and sang in winter”) and more than atmospheric: its dust, cabinetry, and hum actively channel discovery and theme. The button works as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and tying bureaucracy to history and bodies. Sensory details (dust skin, sour smell of smoke and river mud) are purposeful and filtered through Mara’s archivist mind. The setting guides the sleuthing rather than sitting as backdrop, though it only lightly constrains physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The city, booths, and especially the auric lagoon are vividly imagined and integrated into action rather than serving as backdrop. The lagoon and its reflections literally constrain choices by revealing the mobile press’s path and then carrying the pages into the city, charging the final image. World rules around revisions and physical remnants (booths, watermarks) feel internally consistent and efficiently conveyed through concrete details. The sensory balance leans visual but is sharpened with tactile/olfactory touches in the press truck.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a major strength: the radiant grotto, river under glass, limestone, and prism atrium are concrete, sensorial, and tightly integrated with the premise. Environmental mechanics (dew formation, prismatic code, acoustics, leaded panes) directly shape the stakes and Lio’s options, not just the mood. The atrium and its glass evolve across the story—from mysterious architecture to active coding surface to the very material embedded in his vest—so the environment literally constrains and enables his tactics at the climax. Atmosphere remains consistent and charged throughout without slipping into a static “tour.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, seed trays, drifting branches, and root halls are vividly and economically rendered, always filtered through Lio’s occupational and emotional focus. Setting is not postcard: the arbor’s need for stories and its threatened descent directly drive the plot and shape every meaningful choice. Tools and micro-setting (needle, jars, monument shelf, seed vault under the buttress roots) constrain tactics and then charge the final image when the sky brightens and the tree steadies. World rules stay consistent and are learned through lived practice rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: ash-fall, the half-ruined conservatory, the trapdoor and tunnel, and the subterranean waterfall all feel tactile and lived-in rather than decorative. Environment repeatedly shapes tactics, especially at the waterfall where spray and slick rock force Mara to use gears as improvised footholds. The recurrent use of clocks, glass, ash, and water charges the final image of a town “beneath the ashes” beginning again. Detail density is high but remains legible and filtered through Mara’s obsessions with time and pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rain-washed foundry is vivid and functional: gutters, slag heaps, cold furnaces and puddles aren’t just pretty—they supply the quench pit where Orin’s name appears and the culvert where his body lies. Details are filtered through Mara’s sensibility (“as if grief itself were luminous”), anchoring mood and world-rules at once. The coin, the clay, the anvil, crucible, and repaired cup act as micro-settings/tools that constrain what she can do and how. The final image—coin on anvil in the dim foundry, “glowing like a small sunrise”—uses environment and object to charge the thematic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Echo Gorge is vividly realized and meaningfully active: it “loves echoes,” repeats hidden shame into a storm, moans back Elowen’s guilt, and gentles her laugh at the end, so the environment is effectively a pressure and then a balm. The cave-as-ribcage, pewter river, and “sliver of light” behind the ridge do specific thematic work without becoming heavy-handed. The crocodile tooth and misaligned harp function as charged micro-settings/tools that constrain Mara’s tactics. This is richly atmospheric and integrated, just short of the absolute top tier because the physical geography never quite forces a concrete tactical dilemma beyond mood and direction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered through metal-sap air, bruise-light sky, moss, glowing trunks, and pollen, all firmly filtered through the narrator’s body and history. Crucially, the setting isn’t decorative: only trauma-tuned bodies can read the “invisible ink,” the trees hold the computations, and the pollen surge at the end materially alters her state (burning away anesthetic fog, charging the strap). Environmental logic remains consistent and thematically aligned, turning the forest into both chapel and archive. The only ceiling issue is that spatial choreography stays mostly impressionistic rather than situationally constraining specific tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—the aerial alchemist’s market, laundry lines, copper chimneys, drowned stone city, lighthouse room—and all filtered through the translator’s sensibility. Environment and object-as-setting matter: the high walkways, hidden hatch, and paintings concretely guide her actions and constrain access to the seam. World rules remain consistent and are learned through tactile engagement (finger tracing spiral, unfastening latch) rather than expository dumping. The lighthouse lens as recurring object meaningfully charges the final image and functions as micro-setting that anchors the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is richly and precisely rendered—painted clown face cracking, rain-streaked brick, fluorescents, sugared peanuts—and every detail is filtered through his technician’s and medium’s gaze. Environment and tools constrain action: dust patterns and ceiling access shape his investigation; the facade crack literally exposes the mechanism and thematically figures the “leak between eras.” The setting evolves with his discoveries (ceiling void, hidden gears, modern cabinet) and charges the final image of the scarred building and quiet shaft. This is exemplary atmosphere that stays functional rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library and sea of clouds are vividly, specifically imagined and never feel like backdrop; frost, trunks, shelves, and cloud light all directly steer Lio’s actions. The frost patterns function as a live tool and oracle, and the glass tree physically receives the decisive imprint, charging the final image. The floating setting and mutable clouds underscore the theme of negotiable reality and instability without turning into on-the-nose symbolism. It’s rich and integrated enough to be unforgettable, even if not quite pushing into formally constraining 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: visible time as strata, the baroque asteroid, the Mirror Gallery, and the storm all shape action and choices (covering mirrors, staging the exhibition in a crater during a storm). Details are filtered through Len’s sensibility, so they’re never generic spectacle. The environment directly charges the final image, where the map is projected through visible time instead of being fixed in stone. A minor quibble: some world elements are so lush that a couple may feel ornamental rather than strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Clockspire, resonance chamber, brass reflections, pipes, and wire tether are vivid and integrated into action, not mere backdrop. World rules (chamber amplifying lies, bell breathing time, philosopher’s chip as light-token) are consistent and shape tactics. The environment constrains choices—he must carry the token, respect the Covenant, use the chamber’s acoustics—but never quite corners him into an agonizing, spatially-forced trade. Atmosphere and specificity are nonetheless excellent and carry much of the story’s power.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the post-factory town, loading yard, cliffs, caves, and lagoon are rendered with precise, character-filtered sensory detail (rain by street and season, “black water cupped in white”). The environment constrains and guides choice—Mara’s descent, the narrowing tunnel, the cold lagoon, and the placement of the expedition’s relics all shape her path and options. The recurrent objects-as-setting (jars, compass, hinge, lagoon) charge the final image, particularly the lagoon as a site of unbottled hush. A minor limit is that weather and terrain never quite endanger her or force tactical adaptation; they’re more facilitators of mood than hard obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting work is exceptional: the storm-tossed archway, turbine hum, rust and kelp smell, and driftwood knots all feel tactile and filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a sculptor. The environment isn’t decorative; the archway shelters her, provides a projection surface, and becomes the literal and symbolic gateway for the town’s convergence at the end. Weather and sea-wall context also constrain tactics and stakes convincingly. The closing image of both gatherings standing in the same light under the arch leverages setting to charge theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The settings—the amber pavilion, soot-dark cathedral, cloister garden, crypt vents, and etched window—are vividly realized and always filtered through Lina’s sensibility as an artist. Crucially, the environment is not decorative: the building’s stone mass, hidden vents, and window geometry literally explain and enable the night-blooming stock, directly charging the thematic revelation. Seasonal and atmospheric details (browned orchard, sleet on panes, melting last snow) support the emotional and structural turns without feeling clichéd. The final mural in the pavilion, incorporating the cathedral window and nocturnal flowers, fuses setting and closure in a single, reweighted image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptional: the zeppelin library, the dunes, and the obsidian lagoon are all vivid, sensorial, and tightly tied to action (“the water rose like a hand offering its palm”). Environment repeatedly constrains choices—the need to kneel in sand, to use debris as language, to reach into black water for the box—and charges the final image with the zeppelin’s thrum overhead. Details are specific and character-filtered (civil-rights courthouse attic, banned sermons, bus station beating) without feeling like a tour. It narrowly misses the very top band because the zeppelin, while resonant, exerts more tonal than tactical pressure on the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: posts for missing lanterns, cracked shrine steps, salt and fog, and paper frames “nested like bones” all ground the atmosphere. Environment directly shapes tactics—using seawater, salt, ash, fish oil ties solutions to place, and the lantern infrastructure becomes the scaffold for the new order. The amber bottle and lantern ring recur as charged objects, culminating in the council table image. World rules for wishes and their cessation are sketched through implication rather than dump, sustaining tone and plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor city, skyscraper, and glass-walled orchard are vivid and sensorially grounded, with details (“velvet disquiet,” “gnarled apple trees and quince”) filtered through Erem’s contemplative attention. The garden’s silence and seclusion are not just atmospheric; they enable private listening and later frame the final containment of the wax in the cedar box. The tower roof and intercoms arise naturally from the setting and directly shape tactics. Environment charges the last image, making the setting integral rather than postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “icebound atrium under starlight,” glass palms, frost, and caretaker-bots create a vivid, specific environment that feels lived-in and slightly ruined. Setting actively constrains and shapes tactics: the sealed service door, disordered routines, frost, and meltwater spiral all govern what Lio can do and how he closes the corridor. Environmental and object micro-setting (the acorn cap, the ice ring, the labeled planters) directly charge the final image and embody the theme of order vs. entropy. World rules around how time behaves (meltwater that won’t refreeze, corridor braid of yesterday/tomorrow) are consistent and conveyed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “windblown sanctuary above the clouds” is not mere backdrop: altitude, weather, and architecture directly constrain action (siren efficacy, microclimates, the cracked belfry, glue curing in the cold). Tools and objects-as-setting—the rope, siren housing, parapet sensors—are deployed in tactile ways that shape what Maris can do. The solstice hush and high, cloud-wrapped vantage charge the final image where a low hum and a single bell ring reweight noise vs. listening. The world feels particular and internally consistent without over-explaining its pseudo-technical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station on a basalt ridge, the closed domes, generators ticking “like bones,” and the yellow lantern glass all create a lived-in, atmospheric setting that is inseparable from the story’s mood. Environment constrains and enables choice (remote ridge, collapsed service tunnel, old dome, logbook entombed in pumice), and the glass functions as a micro-setting object that directly charges the final image. The sense of place is both concrete and thematically resonant without turning into a static “tour.”

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland are vividly evoked through selective, character-filtered detail: wax smell, ash on the tongue, cracked hives, dry spring. Setting isn’t postcard dressing; it’s bound to the covenant, to Mara’s entrance “inside the circle of hives,” and to the final act at the spring where the slips are read. The environment shapes what’s possible—ghosts gather at this locus of meaning, and the ruined oasis embodies the stalled covenant. The final line explicitly recharges the place (“a place that could be tended again”), so setting meaningfully charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the emerald silo, green glass, stored wind, and the garage sale all feel tactile and conceptually precise, with details filtered through Eli’s time-obsessed lens. Environment and recurring objects meaningfully charge choices—the silo as the last “numbered” place, the wind and green light focusing the ritual, the garage sale as narrative infrastructure. The final image of Eli in the green-lit silo, waiting in cycles, is strongly anchored in place and object. Slightly more direct constraint from the physical environment on his options (e.g., danger, access) would push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lagoon after rain is vivid and texturally specific, from “ink thinned with milk” to mangrove roots and the fishermen’s shed, and details are always filtered through Rian’s sensibility. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the storm damage, wet wind, and waterlogged kite directly generate problems and possibilities (torn net, snapped string, injured bird). The setting evolves with events and materially shapes what Rian can do—mend, rinse, paddle, release. The final image of drake on the lagoon, feather returned to water, feels inseparable from this place.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is richly particular and inseparable from the story’s logic: living stone pillars with water channels, the temple orchard, crabs, goats, and birds all participate in the narrative. Environmental details aren’t postcard garnish; the pillars’ channels, copper arches, and tide patterns directly shape tactics and outcomes (water flow, crab paths, pillar “sweating less”). The final image of her lying between warm pillars under the remodeled canopy is charged by everything we’ve learned about the place. World rules around the semi-living architecture and ecology feel consistent and organically revealed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower, rain, bronze, and overgrown sculpture path are vividly rendered and always filtered through the scientist’s sensory priorities (light, crystals, volatile terpenes). Environment actively shapes events: rain that “should” erase footprints, the garden detour, the bronze door, and the damp chamber enabling crystal growth. Pilgrim Salt as a growing, light-making substance is a superb fusion of setting and mechanism. A marginal increase in how the physical constraints hem the narrator in would be the only possible refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integral: the glassy dead sea, reef, and “jetty narrow as a spine” all constrain action and charge every choice. Environmental specifics (poisoned soil, salt crusts, dark silt, lanterns, blossoms in cracks) directly shape tactics and the final image of the jetty blooming against emptiness. World rules (submerged concord, reef-keepers, cave treaties) are conveyed through setting-inflected narration rather than expository dumps. The landscape’s narrowness vs oceanic vastness underwrites the theme and the ending without feeling over-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scrapyard settlement, catwalks over literal cracks, and phonograph “storms” are memorably concrete and deeply integrated into how people live, trade, and uncover secrets. The environment constrains tactics—barter pit for cylinders, catwalks to cross fissures, sunken antennas as the relay field—and the final image of the wasteland “closing” with voices is powerfully charged by all the prior textural work. Details feel filtered through Lio’s scavenger sensibility (metal, rust, smell) rather than touristic listing. A tiny limit is that the relay station itself is less sensorially developed than the scrapyard, so the climax’s physical setting doesn’t hit quite as hard as the opening locale.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and integral: the “unplugged lantern” station, black ocean, treated glass, and inert ring all feel specific and lived-in. The time dilation deck isn’t postcard scenery; its treated window and orientation govern how the protagonist can discover true north. Environmental details mirror internal state (echoed silence, slowing fans, double skies) without feeling forced. A touch more sensory variety from the body under stress might have elevated it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky, and chess-chapel are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action: ice stairs sing under boots; the height, wind, and storm constrain movement and make the leap genuinely dangerous. World rules (wrong sky nights, skyways that exist only then) stay consistent and sharpen the conceptual stakes of “stealing tomorrow.” The environment isn’t mere backdrop; it creates both the prison (spire, chains) and the solution (sky as key, airways map). A hair more sensory variety at the peak (beyond visual and tactile) could push atmosphere even further, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The palace, whispering gallery, and archive are concretely evoked and tightly linked to action—the curved stone carries whispers and heel-clicks, the hidden floor latch shapes tactics, and the cold, violet-scented archive reorients stakes. The pawnless chessboard functions as both object and micro-setting, charging several images and the final scene. Spatial and atmospheric cues are consistently clear, with no white-room moments despite the lyric density. The only small gap is that the broader city remains more conceptual than sensory, though this suits the piece’s tight focus.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain-bookstore setting is vivid, specific, and active: shelves as “cliff faces,” wet lower levels with mica-spined books, and hidden thunder all shape mood and choices. World rules (memories becoming aisles, reality shuffling nightly) are learned through action rather than exposition dumps and directly constrain tactics. The environment’s instability forces the protagonist to name corridors to pin them in place, so setting becomes a live mechanic, not just backdrop. The final quieting of thunder and exit through the atlas door recharges earlier atmospheric details into a clear sense of earned release.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth are vivid, specific, and integral, literally constraining Mara’s movement and tactics. Details like the inn’s mid-pour ale and snowflakes “hovered like pinned notes” are not ornamental; they reinforce the woven-hush conceit and her isolation. The environment evolves with events (hush tightening, labyrinth dimming) and directly shapes what is possible. World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and pale spire are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s artistic sensibility. Setting rules (echoes multiply words, canyon demands a price) directly constrain her tactics and shape the climax through prisms, rainbows on bone, and the final colorless touch of the tower. Environmental detail is economical yet rich, with the world logic learned through action (poems in crevices, light refracted at dawn). The final image—her colorblindness against bone and memory of echoes—feels inseparable from this exact place.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly realized and functionally integrated: the acid sea, pontoons, Lung, and gear-shop all constrain options and drive tactics. The Lung in particular is an elegant micro-setting that makes the underwater, breath-limited communion with the statue feel necessary rather than decorative. Worldbuilding rules (acid corrosion, non-corroding riverstone, gold-laced resin) are consistent and learned through action. This is publish-ready environmental work whose only arguable limitation is density—there’s almost more texture than a short piece strictly needs.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor room, quay, and especially the cave oasis are vividly realized with selective, tactile detail (the “pencil of afternoon sun,” barnacle “crown,” crabs patrolling) that feels filtered through a painter’s eye. Setting is not just decorative; the hidden chamber’s stillness and the tidal pool directly shape his actions and the symbolic placement of the shell at the waterline. The environment constrains choice—its secrecy and the tide’s rhythm enable his notion of “temporary eternity.” Strong integration of recurring objects (mirror, shell, pool) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the cobalt lighthouse, foghorn point, and cooled post–heat-wave harbor all shape what’s possible and what problem must be solved (distance, fog, sound). Environmental details like the tower’s tremor, the sea’s “exhausted anger,” and the garden of jasmine and basil are not postcard extras—they’re the physical channels for the magic and emotional tone. The final image of the cobalt tower and the tremble under their feet recharges the earlier world-building with thematic weight. This is a case where environment and recurring objects actively charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The signal station, salt flats, drained coast, and ruined aqueducts are vividly specific and always in service of pressure rather than postcard detail. The world’s physical rules (hydraulics, tides, sinkholes) consistently shape what routes are possible and why improvised tools are needed. The censer foot functions as a charged micro-setting object: its tide-memory constrains movement and literally points the way under the moon, then anchors the final “promise.” Atmosphere (lanterns as “a second sky,” dead satellite, brackish wells) tightly supports the melancholic, post-collapse tone.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hanging orchard in a storm-battered ravine is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s working knowledge, with details like cable-grown trees, swaying platforms, and truffle beds doing double duty as atmosphere and tool. The environment constrains and enables choices: storms drive people into her shed, rope bridges govern Ministry access, and the truffle bed becomes the burial site for the relic. Weather and geography shape tone and action rather than sitting as backdrop. This is publish-ready scene-building with strong object-as-setting use in the glass eye and truffle beds.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly particular—the “opal dock,” mist, and lighthouse beam are not just pretty but become investigative tools (the unscarred piling, the tied-under packet, the logbook as final resting place). Details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s working familiarity with the harbor, preventing a “tourist catalog” feel. The environment constrains and enables choice: the post’s missing rope scars and the under-dock geography are literally how the mystery is solved. The final image of the lighthouse as “a far star that could not warm him” crystallizes the thematic isolation through setting rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid, precise, and always doing work: the cedar-smelling map shop, the creek’s debris lines as live data, the ants’ crack in the rock, and the “blooming cavern at midsummer” with fungi and moths. Environment repeatedly constrains and informs choices—the rising creek, the narrowing sinkhole, and the wet vs. dry passages are literal pressures on Mara’s decision. Professional sensibility shapes perception (survey map, coordinates, compositor’s grid), giving a clear sensory hierarchy. The final emergence into “rain and evening” recharges all the earlier environmental motifs, so the world feels inextricable from theme and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the cobalt grotto, cloud-sea, ash-and-violet air, and ember fissure are not postcard backdrops but the physical conditions that enable the ritual and her descent. The geography and constraints (steep ascent, narrow ledge, rope, fissure heat) shape tactics and options. The final image of an “ordinary” night above the cloud-sea reweights the entire environment and charges the closure. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that some environmental richness trends toward luxuriant mood rather than additional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember nexus is vivid and functionally integrated: basalt ribs, fissures, and twilight not only create atmosphere but make this the one place where a ground-level constellation can become a visible protest. The nautilus shell and pocket suns act as tools shaped by the environment, and the final image of colored suns over vents recharges earlier sensory details. World rules (non-burning heat, light “insisting”) remain consistent and are learned by watching Lio work, not through exposition. A hairline knock is that the lushness of description occasionally edges toward decorative rather than strictly pressure-bearing, though it never loses clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is evocative and integrated: the ranger cabin, pines, potbelly stove, and birch bark scroll all feel tactile and mood-synchronous, not generic. The environment supports and mirrors the internal state (isolation, wilderness as witness, forest “expecting” him to write) without over-explicit symbolism. While the landscape doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, the scroll and cabin frame the only real tactic—writing—as an embodied, spatial act. The aerial dream-views over mountains and a cemetery-on-a-slope deepen the atmosphere and temporal motif.

    The settings—the fog-softened water clock shop and the steamy birthing house—are vivid, selective, and tightly filtered through Iris’s altered senses. Objects-as-setting (vials, water clock, clamp screw) and weather (fog) are not mere décor; they contour how she perceives and moves, and the clock’s drop at the end charges the final image. The world rules (water clock repair, midwife’s tools) feel coherent without exposition bloat. The only small limitation is that the environment rarely constrains tactics in a hard way; it mostly supports mood and perception rather than forcing different choices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly specific and fully operative: the suspended platform, humming chains, opposing storm fronts, and mineral-tinged steam all shape the ritual’s constraints and tactics. Environmental pressure (the gust, the platform tilt, the brief “breath between storms”) materially governs when and how Ila can act. Objects-as-setting—the table, the special ink, the quill—are tactile and charged, not postcard detail. The final image of the platform drifting into a clearing sky with rune-lines guiding future pilots ties environment directly into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sheet music archive and orchard are vividly and economically rendered, with tactile and sensory specificity (dust like pollen, fruitwood shelves, pear-and-smoke scent). Setting is not decorative: the shelves’ metal frames enable the induced currents and the orchard’s impending destruction charges the time pressure and final image. The cracked perfume bottle leaking onto catalog notes and distant chainsaws reweight earlier details at the end. This is high-level work, just shy of transcendent only because it doesn’t yet extract every possible constraint from the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient temple library is vividly realized and tightly integrated: shelves circling a central well, incense and dust, the softcover dictionary, and the mirror-lined descent all shape both mood and action. Setting meaningfully constrains choices—the stairwell and mirrors force a downward, inward approach, and the well is the literal and symbolic axis of the transformation. World rules (the corridor, the hiccup, the library’s temporal dislocation) stay consistent and are learned through observation rather than exposition dumps. The final image of emerging from the temple into the corridor of time shows the environment charging the closing duty rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fjord, the station, the regulator house, and the hydraulic apparatus are all concretely rendered and consistently shape options (e.g., the frozen intake, fog at the horizon, the choice not to chip ice from outside). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (“ice blooming…like white moss”; “fjord quiet that made even his thoughts seem to drip”) without becoming a tourist catalog. The tools and micro-setting (pipes, probe, telescope, clocks) function as constraints on tactics rather than mere décor. Setting strongly charges the final image—two “blades” of horizon and sun meeting, in a world of literal razor edges and fragile systems.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, multi-sensory, and tightly bound to character perception (“remember a corridor by the pressure of its corners”). Crucially, setting elements—mesh vents, plastic curtains, mycelium mats, laser lines—constrain tactics and are reinterpreted at the end as gradients rather than walls. World rules for the tech-farm hybrid remain consistent and are learned through Lena’s work rather than dumped. A touch more evolution of the macro-environment under pressure could push this into the highest tier, but as-is it is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rainwashed city, midsummer library, subway, overpass, and especially the lantern with its mica pane create a fully inhabited atmosphere that’s both tactile and thematically charged. Weather and environment meaningfully constrain and color action (power flickers, she needs the lantern, the rain shapes movement and mood), and the same objects/places recur at the end. The final image of the trembling mica-lit flame against the ongoing storm recharges the earlier setting details into a charged poise about grief and controlled risk. Setting is not postcard; it’s an active participant in the emotional calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subway utility tunnel and the humming streetlamps are vivid, specific, and filtered through Mara’s work-habituated eye—“trains rumbled like distant weather and the walls sweated rust” is both atmospheric and grounded. The environment justifies the secret line and her anonymity, and the micro-setting of the booth plus the glass disc constrains how she can connect. The disc and the tunnel’s isolation explicitly charge the final image when she has to create courage and a bridge from that very space. Setting and object are doing real narrative work rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The jetty, sea, archives, and walnut ink are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility as archivist, so setting and vocation blur into a lived environment. The “blooming jetty” and night-blooming lilies recur and evolve, charging the final ceremony and solo walk with a sense of living, recording landscape. The environment constrains action and meaning—the cracked seawall, the tide around their ankles, the salt-stained crate—all making the covenant feel materially rooted rather than abstract. The final image of sea smelling of walnuts and wet paper elegantly fuses setting with theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The disused ivy-covered station is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: neutral ground for non-recruitment, a plausible abandoned node for rumor, and the physical cradle for the suitcase-altar and the crowd. Setting details (“paper tickets along the platform,” ivy curtains, cracked clock) are filtered through the narrator’s loneliness and the story’s logistical magic, not touristic listing. The station’s neutrality and abandonment constrain choices (it’s where Mara can operate and where a new social order can tentatively form), and the final image of the humming platform charges the thematic closure. This is very strong environment work, falling just shy of transcendent because the setting guides mood and logic more than it directly blocks or enables a specific decision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    The world-building is rich, economical, and fully filtered through Iris’s nonvisual senses: ultrasonic pressure, leaves “like glass,” air-currents on her cheeks, and languages absorbed through skin. The ultrasonic forest and the stillpoint clearing aren’t just decorative; they physically and conceptually structure the quest and the ending (wave cancellation, un-rippled pool, paused constellations). The platinum ring and vellum function as charged tools that shape how she can navigate and what she can record at the end. This is immersive, coherent, and directly charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gravitational anomaly, listening room, mercury reservoir, and memorial garden are vivid and tightly integrated, always filtered through Mara’s work and guilt. The micro-setting of the fountain pen and mercury functions as both tool and constraint, charging the final image when the nib is unbent and the scratch looks “almost wet.” The anomaly’s behavior (time pooling, signal-bending, corridor lights compressing) actively shapes options and meaning rather than serving as backdrop. World rules (signals mapped to lives, edits via ledger) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor is vivid and specific—lanterns like commas, gulls, ropes, foghorn, street musician—without feeling like a tourist catalog, and every detail is filtered through the narrator’s preoccupation with pauses and absence. Environment actively shapes the plot: the harbor’s ordinary noise is the baseline they “disrupt,” the foghorn’s failure creates the crucial silence to be captured, and the public pier setting provides the musician and audience necessary for the climax. The final images (harbor listening, camera on the rail) are charged by all this prior environmental work. Description is lush yet purposeful, always in service to atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    The world is vivid and purposeful, from ash flats and basalt ridge to obsidian steps and a breathing seam in the rock, with details always filtered through Sera’s goals. The archive is not just pretty scenery but a constraint and a moral counterweight—“archives were just libraries that survived the fires” directly charges the central choice. Objects-as-setting (tapestry, spirals, tar, copper bird, clay hands) evolve across beats to guide tactics and deepen mood. The physical environment repeatedly narrows options and shapes meaning, especially in the ridge seam and archive interior.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vivid, sensorial, and fully integrated—reeds, resonant stone, conductive algae, and light all matter to how memory-sharing works. The environment constrains action (perching over conductive liquid, sound-activated light, alarms) and charges the final image of the narrator returning to drum alone. World rules feel consistent and learned through use rather than exposition. The setting’s mood (half-laboratory, half-shrine) mirrors and deepens the thematic tension between science and prayer.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shipping container labyrinth and storm-battered port are rendered with precise, functional detail—chalked corners, steel grating, aurora, frozen cranes—that continually constrain and enable tactics (whispers over shouts, hidden conduits, map-fold navigation). Setting is never postcard; it dictates acoustics, danger, and how information can move. The recurring objects (maps, coin, key) operate as micro-settings/tools within that world and directly shape choices and the final image. The only minor limitation is that non-auditory sensory textures are somewhat secondary to sound and sight, though the focus is thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canal, wet dock, oil film, petals, and crooked warehouses are not just pretty—they enable the light-net across water and the physical search with the mirror, so environment constrains and enables choices. The cobalt dock after rain and the under-dock blackness both charge the final image of the fisher’s face and the shimmering darkness. Object-as-setting (mirror, shutters, cord) is especially strong and deeply integrated. A tiny reason not to go higher is that time/era remain abstract, though not in a way that harms the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is rich, precise, and thematically charged: the misty Harbor Street, cobalt library, and magnetic grotto are all sensorially vivid and filtered through Eli’s quiet attentiveness. Environment meaningfully constrains and enables choices—the grotto’s magnetism becomes the timing mechanism, the library’s “amplified quiet” is his arena, and the windows across town are literalized as a chessboard. The recurring tin of magnets and the cobalt library both return in the final scene to charge the closing image with physicalized “gentle influence.” World rules feel subtly uncanny but coherent, and every locale feels lived-in rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The maritime setting is vivid, economical, and fully interwoven with action—“sublittoral fringe,” pilings, barnacles, chains, and coral all constrain what the characters can do. World rules like the Accord and cannon shot turning to sand are learned through concrete beats, not exposition blocks, and the scrimshaw and dock tools function as micro-settings that charge choices. The final image of stepping into the “sublittoral green” and letting the sea claim a “truest shape” feels fully earned by prior environmental detail. Minor limitation: the broader world beyond the harbor is gestured at more than embodied, which is fine at this length but keeps it just shy of transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The valley farmhouse and the turbine field are vivid, grounded, and filtered through the narrator’s grief (windows shut “not for warmth but to muffle the blades”). The turbines and their sound evolve from oppressive machinery to “distant surf” and finally a medium that takes the petals, so environment clearly charges the final image. Small objects and spaces—the kitchen table, the barn, the fencepost—are used tactically to stage emotional shifts rather than as static backdrop. This is highly effective, though environmental constraints don’t quite force choices so much as inflect them.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are not just decorative; they define the cosmology and literally constrain options (ban, border, pillars as the only crossing point). Environmental details (blue vault, mist threading through pillars, Soren’s hand phasing through her cloak) evolve alongside the magic and heighten the stakes of each choice. The lake-dead and the colonnade’s hum directly charge the final image of Lira and the shadow becoming “simply air.” World rules remain consistent and are revealed through action (tapping, paraphrasing carvings) rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, plants, glass panes, ash scent, and the reed tongue form a dense, lived-in micro-setting that constantly shapes behavior—especially the plant grammar and the final spiral mapped onto fractured flagstones. Environmental detail is strongly filtered through Mara’s sensibility (texture, fracture, wrong colors) and Joren’s craft, avoiding tourist lists. The setting directly constrains choices: their whole negotiation and the proof-of-trade hinge on movable pots, visible cracks, and hanging chimes that respond to the final note. Only a slight sense that the broader city remains more sketched than dramatized keeps this just under a 9-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds, velvet baffles, copper throats, and soot-clouded lens create a richly tactile, non-generic setting that perfectly matches the story’s concerns. Environment and tools aren’t decorative: the chamber and lens literally constrain what’s possible, making “refracted” sound and textured air the only way to tell the truth here. The recurring movement back into the golden-shadowed chamber charges the final image, where reporters meet their own doubts in that same space. World rules (post-blackout grid, analog lab within a stabilized city) feel coherent and efficiently sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    The observatory and its instruments, the curtains of intention, and the mutable sky are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Mara’s grief and craft-minded attention. Setting is not decorative: the curtains, telescope, starlight, and meteorite filings all constrain the method and shape what’s possible, especially in the climactic illumination of the basil. The timeless, rearranging-constellation atmosphere supports the themes of alternate histories and chosen directions. The final images of the dome’s shifting sky in the ring and the observatory as a place of carefully aimed light show environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, wet stone, old paper, pawnshops, murals, and water-truck queues conjure a vivid, coherent post-crash city filtered through a pattern-obsessed gaze. The measuring tape and skylight function as micro-setting anchors that charge the method and final image: the room’s physical dimensions become the key to decoding social history. Weather and environment (rain stitching dusk, damp streets) serve tone more than tactical constraint, but they are consistently integrated with action. Specific routes—pawnshops, murals, lullabies in queues—turn setting into a map of lived cultural adaptation rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive, the bronze vault, and the pagoda are rendered with tactile specificity (air “of old copper and wet stone,” bronze facets splitting light into “narrow, trembling corridors”) and are always filtered through the historian’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard dressing: the forbidden lower vault, the sweating walls, and the scale of the model pagoda all constrain how she can act and what she can risk. The environment directly shapes tactics (descending in secret, manipulating the pagoda) and charges the final image of a “new archive” that will function differently. This is top-tier scene-building with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Blooming Library, cloud sea, petal screens, and river stone are vivid, original, and tightly woven into both action and meaning; the stone in particular functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choices and charges the final image. Environmental details are filtered through Mara’s dusk-focused attention, keeping the atmosphere coherent and purposeful rather than touristic. World rules (dream sharing, ceremonies, conduits) are revealed through concrete practice rather than exposition dumps and remain internally consistent. The only reason not to go higher is that the physical environment rarely constrains tactics under pressure—it shapes tone and symbolism more than literal options.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop is sensuously and economically drawn—the “heat lamps glowed like small moons,” “air smelled of damp cedar,” mist and stars—and consistently filtered through Mara’s professional eye. The chameleon and its tail function as an object-as-setting, framing and then charging the final image above her desk with thematic weight. The environment doesn’t physically constrain tactics, but it strongly shapes mood, perception, and the regenerative metaphor that undergirds the ending. Overall, setting and atmosphere feel integral, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tower’s vertical architecture (greenhouse above, cellar foundation, rooftop, street below) meaningfully structures the story’s descent-then-ascent and the final act of pouring light into a street crack. Specific sensory details—the “meteor hush,” wet stone in the cellar, dust orbiting in the miracle’s chamber—create a coherent atmosphere that mirrors her surgical and spiritual work. Micro-settings (hourglass on the bedside table, coffee rings on the saucer, window-box ivy) act as tools and constraints, not mere décor. The final image of the pavement crack shaped like her scar is an exemplary use of environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The projection booth is exquisitely rendered and fully integrated: rain like “folding velvet,” the projector as shrine, beam path, rewind table, leader on the lamp housing. Setting and object-as-setting (the projector and strip) directly shape tactics—threading the blank leader, projecting an “open envelope” of light, and using the booth’s spatial logic to imagine coordinates for stored emotions. Environmental detail consistently mirrors and deepens the internal stakes without feeling like mere symbolism. The final image of her stepping into the alley after the storm, with the lyrics finally resting, is charged by the physical environment established from the first line.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit archway, unwritten calendar, vault, and winter sky are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Sel’s sensibility, giving the world a strong atmospheric signature. Setting elements actively matter: resting under the arch, the stones warming, and the hidden seam into the vault all constrain tactics and enable the climactic act. The astrolabe as a handled object functions almost like micro-setting, charging the final image of Sel resting with it. There’s minimal dead description; nearly every environmental detail either advances the method or mirrors the city’s deprivation/renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly original—the glowing dune as divergent archive, the rails, the guard shack with its nailed chess clock—and every major object is thematically and structurally active. The dune’s rules (everything “occasionally everywhere”) shape what’s possible, from the multi-shelf visions to the guard’s ability to act across branches. Environmental change under pressure, like the auditors’ boots dulling the dune’s glow, directly encodes conflict. The final image of nursing the bloom so light can spread is charged by everything we’ve learned about this place.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mechanical rainforest is richly particular—sheet-brass leaves, piston trunks, chain-vines—and always filtered through the narrator’s thinking, never feeling like a generic tour. Environment actively shapes tactics: the wind through different trees provides the method of navigation, the magnet ravine and bell-trees articulate fears, and the cathedral of roots and gears constrains the climactic choice. The recurring small gear and the re-timbred trees at the end charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate where setting and object shape closure rather than merely decorate it. Detail density is high, but it remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal night, fog, pier, ridgeway, and bracken hollow are vivid and tightly integrated with action—fog swallows the dog, scree affects descent, wire tangles him, the sea’s lullaby modulates tone. Setting constrains tactics (indirect routes, fallen fence, loose scree) rather than serving as mere backdrop. Recurring objects (lantern, ticket punch, cairn fire) feel tactile and consequential rather than decorative. It stops just short of 9+ because environmental constraint, while real, is rarely brutal enough to feel truly inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress, snow pressing “like a white palm,” ice tunnels, and the oil-and-varnish underchambers are vivid and tightly integrated with the premise that sound is dangerous. Environment and small objects (the spiral stair, thumbprint, bolt, piano bench) constrain tactics at each turn and directly shape the climax. Weather and architecture are not postcard backdrops; they are the machinery of the stakes. The final image of frost in Edda’s breath and the stable bench carries the fortress’s chill into a tentative, embodied hope.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient temple library is richly evoked—the cracked basalt roof, drifting dust, ash librarians, and sky-mosaic all feel specific and atmospheric. Setting consistently drives action: the stacks rearrange via the rune, cryptic notes in books structure the quest, and the mosaic star literally must be broken to reach the truth. The environment also constrains cost, with the collapse of the library as a direct consequence of revealing the truth. Detail selection is focused and in-character; nothing reads like generic fantasy dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sea-level station, reef, and tidal beacons are vividly realized and never feel like postcard dressing; they constrain choices (timed canals, skiff access, energy sources) and charge the final image of “drifting moored.” Professional detail (tide gauges, service visits, energy systems) is lean but convincing. The recovering reef under the glass well smartly mirrors her ethical position without heavy-handed symbolism. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical station during climactic beats could further heighten the environment-as-crucible effect.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay, thunderstorm, cracked skylight, and stone circle are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Ilya’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the circle is literally embedded in the bay floor and becomes the communication device, the opera glasses interact with the skylight and stars, and the storm’s thunder “keeping time” charges the decision beat. World rules around the circles and the occupied/abandoned status of the port feel coherent with minimal exposition. The environment doesn’t physically constrain her options much, but it meaningfully shapes both method and mood, especially in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic hot springs, ash, scaffolds, and rebuilt roads are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s gaze, giving the world a lived-in strangeness. Setting meaningfully constrains action: the springs’ heat and sacred status determine how and where the amber can be opened, and later provide a natural habitat for the salamander Rebuilder. Environmental details like steam “curtains,” sulfur bubbling, and black rock slope are economical but evocative. The atmosphere strongly supports the themes of repair and reconfiguration without tipping into over-symbolization.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum-on-a-cliff, salt wind, lighthouse lens, and fog create a vivid, coherent environment that’s always filtered through Mina’s attention. Setting actively shapes choices: sea-cliff acoustics trigger her, the lens becomes her grounding tool, and the exposed edge mirrors her project of “growing in public.” The final images—fog, dark lighthouse, labeled saplings with dates, photo buried at the cypress—are charged by all the earlier environmental work. There’s just enough weather and botanical detail to feel lived-in without becoming a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse and its forgotten library are vividly rendered and function as true constraints: the circular rib-like shelves, the trapdoor, and the lens mechanism all shape what Mara can do and how she can do it. Environmental pressure—the walls literally closing in—tightens her window for action, while the beam’s routes and prisms become tools in her redesign. World rules around light, threads, and alternate angles of reality stay internally consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition. The final stitched radiance of the beam recharges the setting details laid in earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Desert dunes, wind-carved encampment, and raider canyon are rendered with economical, concrete detail that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Tools and objects—the ink pool, the corridor of dust, the obelisk, the hummingbird drone—function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics and enable choices (e.g., portal travel, mapping seams). The eclipse-scar and canyon atmosphere meaningfully color the climax, and the return to the encampment perimeter charges the final quiet image. World rules around time dilation and ink-tech stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “echoing library under snow” is vivid, specific, and omnipresent, with snow, stained glass, nitrogen, and dormant copper veins all integrated into action and metaphor. The environment constrains options (isolation, cryo protocols, disconnected consoles) and charges the final image of a forum “humming beneath snow.” Weather and architecture mirror the thematic freeze/thaw of truth without feeling over-explicit. Detail density is high but controlled, consistently filtered through the archivist’s sensory and professional biases.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dome, desert, soot, copper gutters, and trained roses create a vivid, specific environment that feels lived-in and distinct. Setting actively shapes options: the glass dome mediates the confrontation, the roses’ behavioral training constrains Tarek’s access to violence, and the farm becomes the site of Lio’s hiding and future work. Environmental details are filtered through Maris’s priorities and align with tone and theme (continuity in a harsh world). The final image of planting archive seeds at the dome’s rim recharges the setting as a charged, ongoing constraint rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sound wave garden is vivid, specific, and constantly active in the scene—reeds, ponds, Wave Arbor, and sleepwalking constellations all affect tactics and mood. Environmental rules (sound as medium, patterns breaking, constellations dragging tides) are consistent and learned through action. Setting directly constrains choices (zigzag path, voicing silence at the pool, spike as tool shaped by straight tracks) and charges the final image of a quiet garden “as a held breath.” The world feels fully imagined and thematically tuned without slipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory above the clouds, the echoing domes, red-lit darkroom, and cocoa mug with moons create a vivid, tonally apt environment that mirrors doubt and isolation. Details are filtered through Celeste’s sensibility (e.g., charts “like laundry,” echoes rehearsing her doubts), keeping description purposeful. The setting modestly constrains action (remote location, controlled access to plates and logs) but serves more as atmosphere than hard tactical limiter. Strong, but the environment doesn’t quite bear enough causal weight to push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting details are vivid, economical, and always in service of mood and theme: the blank city sky, the laboratory of lost sounds, and the decommissioned observatory all feel specific and lived-in. The recurring objects—the lamplight, the wardrobe, the amber, the shelves of media—are filtered through Lio’s sky-obsessed perspective, keeping the world cohesive. Environment constrains and charges choice: the observatory-as-cathedral of recordings makes the time fold and the retrieval of the cry feel physically plausible in this world. This is just short of 9-band because while beautifully rendered, the lab could press on his options a touch more overtly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto, mist, lilac coloring, and echo-physics are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Inez’s sensibility. Setting isn’t decorative: the acoustics and mist-hush literally constrain tactics (using echo-fragments instead of direct speech) and charge the final image of a breathing cave over a mandala of doubt. Worldbuilding around the “unlearning” city is spare yet sufficient, and the opera-house tile folds macro-setting into a concrete object. A hair more spatial choreography of people in the circle could strengthen embodiment, but atmosphere and function are already at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plaza beneath a shattered sky, ash-rinsed stones, and the damaged mosaic all feel tactile and purposeful, not decorative. The stepping stone and tessera function as micro-setting objects that directly shape choices (retrocognition, route to the minaret, the renaming moment) and charge the final image. Environment and tool constrain action in subtle ways: the ruined urban space makes every act of naming and mercy visibly public. Detail density is high yet economical; nothing reads like tourist-list description.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the old pleasure theater, hedge maze, and mystic orchard are vividly particular and filtered through Mara’s synesthetic perception (“air tasted of green velvet and sounded…like distant brass”). The orchard garden is not just backdrop; its time-fracture and secluded, after-hours nature constrain what can happen and where, and the hedge maze frames the encounter as a deliberate descent. Environmental details evolve with the plot—the garden shifting eras, then holding steady at the end—charging the final image. The object-as-setting of the stage and coin also meaningfully colors the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and functional: the ozone-scented, half-broken city and the Harbor Street light-painting studio are not backdrop but tool and constraint. The muscovite sliver, darkroom, and long exposures are tightly woven into the plot and the final image-wall; they materially enable the mapping of “hidden pathways.” The sealed tunnel and sizzling cables concretely channel the stakes from abstract telepathy into infrastructure and hospital survival. Environmental and object details reliably carry thematic weight without lapsing into scenery-for-its-own-sake.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal cave network is vivid, tactile, and integral: tides trap her, vents supply moonlight, shell-lined tunnels and temperature gradients become the story’s grammar. The micro-setting (clay patch with jointed handprints) directly delivers the core revelation, and the environment constantly constrains or enables action. The fossil works as an object-as-setting, charging the final image where it is set into the niche beside alien handprints. A slight reason this doesn’t climb higher is that external physical navigation tension could be pushed harder against the rich atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber warehouse beneath the cliffs is vivid and tonally coherent, with the rock “set on the shelves,” dust, shelves, hourglasses, and canyon all filtered through Lysa’s attention. Setting isn’t postcard; it constrains choices—the jar must face the cliff mouth, the amber stores are the economic stake, the warehouse architecture shapes the nightly rituals. The recurring objects (amber, jar, hourglass, buttons) function as micro-settings that charge the final image. World rules (echo in a jar, prophecy as acoustic palimpsest) are fantastical but internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zephyr Bluff, the mist, the cliff path, and the tide cave are vividly rendered and constantly interacted with, not just described; the mist both obscures and muffles, paralleling and constraining covert action. The snow as coding surface and the sea wind as radio mask make environment integral to tactics and outcome, while the bluff and shed frame the opening and the final vow image. The pillbox itself functions as a micro-setting object that charges the last scene. Overall, place and weather are inseparable from both the plot’s mechanics and its emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog-bound river crossing, gutters, bridgehouse, and ferry are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Rowan’s working eye. Weather and environment aren’t decorative: the fog is literally inhabited, the current and gutters dictate timing and tactics, and the hill/lanterns frame the emotional geography. Recurring concrete details (gutters ticking, barley tea, lamp halos, the yarn needle) evolve and charge the final images. A slight density of description edges toward lushness, but it remains purposeful and never confuses spatial or situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The oasis and wasteland are rendered with tactile specificity—the broken hives like kilns, brackish spring, flattened refinery smoke—and every major object (lantern, chimney, combs) is spatially and functionally clear. Setting is not backdrop; it constrains tactics and closure, as the brick chimney becomes the alignment apparatus and the oasis’s stacked timelines are the mechanism by which it “resists change.” The beekeeping residue (comb scent, preserved wax) deeply charges the final image when those combs crumble into “honest dust.” The refinery smoke image recurs and flips—from flattened to rising—quietly marking the world’s reconfigured state.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fire escape, harbor, pier, and moonlight are all tactile and used as tools rather than backdrop—her knowledge of vertical stairs and reflective surfaces literally enables the lock-reading tactic. The “luminous harbor by moonlight” is not just pretty; the moonlight becomes a required resource to reveal the scratch, and then returns as a sliding presence down the iron steps in the final image. Occupational and spatial details (planters as a “thin green ladder,” customs cages, pilings) are selective but grounded, and always filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The only thing holding this just shy of 9+ is that environmental constraint is strong but not brutally tight; an artificial light workaround could exist in another version of this world.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Tidal Library and stone circle are exceptionally vivid and specific—the vapor surges, curling cards, and breathing floors are not postcard details but a working ecology that structures time and movement. Setting actively shapes tactics (leaving at low vapor, wrinkling pages) and charges the final image of imperfect, tide-warped notes that still hold meaning. World rules (the hum, the circle as instrument, the sundial as key) are internally consistent and learned via use rather than exposition. Environment and objects clearly constrain choices and deeply inflect the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, storm aftermath, and installation space are vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“pale and angular, as if folded from dawn”). Setting isn’t just backdrop: the pond platforms enable the installation, the reclaimed nests shape the centerpiece, and the monks’ bell physically punctuates the climax. The recurring spiral (nest, drawing, installation center) charges the final image and concretizes the “thread” idea. Environment shapes tone and closure so strongly that relocating the story would materially damage its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory dome / radio bunker and the split town (vigils vs rallies) are sharply evoked and feel lived-in rather than schematic. Technical setting (broadcast chain, subsonic tones, spectrum analyzer) is integrated with Mara’s actions and constrains how she can fight back. The alignment of the Perseus rift, university tower, and town fault line smartly fuses cosmic and local geography and directly informs her tactic. The final image of broadcasting a “prayer spoken through concrete” depends on this environment and would lose power in a different setting.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly particular—“shadowed nexus under starlight,” chapel above, Archive as an “inside out” cathedral over a star-void—and always filtered through the claustrophobic explorer’s priorities. Environment directly constrains choices: shifting floors tied to organ chords, walls hinging inward, shelves reorienting with breathing; the open sky above is not just pretty but psychologically necessary. The compass and organ function as tools embedded in the world’s logic, not arbitrary props. The final image of returning to the frontier under starlight, with the chapel silent, pays off the spatial and atmospheric motifs with a charged calm.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly economical: the wine-red ribbon with pond smell, the mist-draped quarry, the tin-roofed shed and hanging lance all feel specific and lived-in. Details are filtered through the narrator’s sensory and professional bias (calipers, gray paper, ledger-as-lab-notebook), which strengthens atmosphere. The quarry and mist aren’t just décor; they are integral to the backstory accident and give the visit an eerie pressure. It stops just shy of the 9-band because the environment rarely constrains on-page action in the present as tightly as it charges mood and backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and weather are vivid and purposeful: the experimental station, radar dome, fog, and storms all echo and pressure the investigation, not just decorate it. Mara’s professional gaze (“map librarian,” isobars, GIS lab) filters details in a way that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The cemetery on the cliff and the coffin nail function as micro-setting objects that literally and thematically constrain choices (you must go up there at night; you must use this nail-key). The final image of the instruments drawing “clean lines across a sky that, at last, had room for Elias Kline’s name” ties environment, tools, and emotional payoff together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bridge, river, scaffold-wrapped old bridge, and mountain pullout are all sensorially sharp and tightly sewn to action (e.g., wind-flutter revealing the arrow, the hidden box under the interpretive sign). Setting actively constrains choices and enables the plot, and the recurring scaffold wrap in the final image charges the ending. It’s rich without feeling touristic, fully filtered through the fiddler’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The circus train, the narrowing asphalt, chalk arrows, ribbons, and stones are vivid and purpose-driven, not just backdrop. Setting actively shapes action: the siding beyond the warehouse district enables secrecy; markers on the tracks structure both the threat to rivals and the later guided walk with Mara. The final hinge image of the train and the breadcrumb rail markers explicitly charges the thematic turn. A slightly broader sensory palette (sound, temperature) in key moments could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory above salt flats, the desert temple, and the pulsing stars are vivid and purposeful, not postcard backdrop. Environment continually shapes action—decoding via star catalogs, traveling to the temple, tracing lines onto fresh plaster, and the broken roof that lets the same stars oversee the final rite. The atmosphere (midnight watch, salt, wind, cooling air in the sanctuary) is tightly braided to the emotional register. The recurring stars and stone architecture explicitly charge the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and integrated: Lake Kestrel’s cursed “orchard of drowned trees,” the “swirling orchard vortex,” mirror shards, and bruise-colored moon all shape mood and tactics. Environment constrains choice—Thalen must row to the center, anchor to roots, use expanding circles to enter, and operate within an ice coffin and mirror cage—rather than serving as mere backdrop. Sensory detail (apple smell, cold seizing lungs, spinning branches) is purposeful and filtered through a druid’s attention to circles and roots. The final image of the flat lake “as polished stone” reweights prior imagery without feeling over-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt glade, metallic leaves, rain-taste air, and root-bound visionary form a vivid, coherent micro-world that shapes what’s possible: the glade is the only access point to the oracle and the dream-crossing. The maze hedge and clipped sprig act as spatial and conceptual extensions of setting, not mere props, literally structuring the corridors Lysa mentally walks. Environmental details (blue sharpening, black disk eclipse, cobalt soil) intensify as the conflict peaks, charging the final image of returning to a present that can now “wait.” The setting’s logic stays consistent and directly constrains choices, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—“skulls like pale apples,” trees growing from rib cages—and consistently filtered through Mira’s way of reading the world. Environment constrains tactics (dim lantern to avoid waking dead, navigation via bones and roots) and houses the literal destiny-thread that must be manipulated. The final image of her still walking those half-lit corridors makes the setting inseparable from the cost and ongoing vigilance. Line-by-line atmosphere is dense but controlled, never white-room.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quarry, echo valley, and office trailer are vivid, acoustically charged, and filtered through the protagonist’s sound-savvy perception. Environment is not just backdrop: the pit’s history as a concert venue and echo chamber directly frames his memories and Marla’s loss, and justifies the museum context. The pinned scrap functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Weather, machinery, and stone all reinforce the theme of echoes and absence without feeling overdetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is strikingly original and sensorial (“tastes like cold iron and apple skin”), and its physical rules (levitating boughs, magnetic currents) meaningfully shape tactics and options. The environment constrains and warns—“anything held too tightly becomes noise, and noise becomes madness”—directly informing Nerin’s climactic choice. Instruments, coils, ironwood trunks, and cloudsea are all used functionally rather than as postcard décor. World rules feel consistent and are learned in action, though a touch more interaction with practical constraints (e.g., danger, physical risk) could deepen the sense of lived-in hazard.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tidal atrium, titan-gear, and sea-tide mechanics are specific, sensorial, and fully integrated into action: the gear constrains movement, the flooding shelves dictate tactics, and the atrium is the ritual site. Setting details are filtered through the librarian’s sensibility, never reading as a neutral tour. World rules (tides, moon phases, memory fluctuations) are consistent and consequential. The final image of carrying the creel through waterlogged aisles under a changing moon is charged by everything the setting has established.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bunker entrance, maintenance shaft, and crystal caves are vividly specific and charged—“mineral spires” and the fossil seashell spiral feel lived and strange rather than generic. Setting is tightly integrated with action: the caves house the shell, the crystals become “listening ears,” and the pearl’s light literally reshapes the environment. World rules (bunker culture plus quietly fantastical radiance) stay consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition dumps. The environment influences ritual more than constraining physical options, which keeps this just shy of top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The disused station, ivy, rust, and river-scented air are vivid, but more importantly they constrain and enable action: the map lines up with the tracks, the tunnel links platform to river, the sheltered bathroom is where the graffiti and turning point occur. Objects-as-setting—the accordion, the taped bellows, the corroded latch—are spatially and emotionally integrated, altering choices. Environmental details evolve with the character’s movement (platform → tunnel → bathroom → riverbank → platform) and charge the final image of playing on the edge. The river/station as a kind of shared dwelling anchors theme without feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular, from the “old canal district” and mist-door to the library “shelved with bottled dawn,” and these are filtered through his cautious approach so they feel lived-in rather than decorative. Crucially, the environment constrains action: the glowing shelves and the timing of their pulses literally become the language he must decode, and the misted threshold defines the boundary of this world. The final image of “the mist on his window” glowing ties the library’s atmosphere back to his mundane space, charging the closure. At times the lush description slightly dominates over how the space physically restricts his body (e.g., fatigue, disorientation), which keeps this just short of utterly immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, sensory, and fully integrated with action: velvet that muffles steps, heat and cold vents, figs and ferns, terrace gardens and festival crowds all shape what Liora can do. Crucially, the observatory’s architecture and hidden vents provide the smuggling route, and the midsummer festival crowd offers cover, so environment directly constrains and enables tactics. Plant life is not just color but a living information network and moral barometer, charging the final alley-melody image with a sense of diffuse, propagated resistance. Detail density is high but almost always filtered through Liora’s professional and plant-attuned gaze, avoiding museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skyborne grotto under the aurora is vividly realized and integrated from first line to last; the light, ice, and altitude aren’t just pretty but frame the ritual as something only possible here. The environment constrains the premise—the static is clearest in this specific place, and the aurora literally receives the released spark. Physical details (frost-slick stone, rimed bier, colored water of the aurora) are selective and charged, not touristic. The grotto and light field decisively charge the final image of the green thread rising, which reweights the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sky vineyard, fig trees, and umbral grotto are vividly rendered, with strong sensory and imagistic specificity (“clouds looked like fermenting foam,” the pool mirroring seasons, loam threaded with old bones). Setting is tightly integrated with meaning: the grotto above the clouds and its cyclical pool directly enable her conceptual shift, and the hairpin-in-soil image charges the final return to the vineyard and new fig. Environmental logic is consistent and used, not just described. It stops just shy of genius-level only because the physical constraints never fully pinch her options in a way that adds additional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, cliff path, dawn light, and wind-chime system are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s practiced, morally alert gaze; details like the salt-and-oil smell of the stairs and the chimes “speaking in code” feel lived-in, not decorative. Environment meaningfully shapes choice: she reads the chime messages as constraints, the brass hook and lantern room become the arena of decision, and the cloak/shard operate as charged micro-settings. The world’s surreal rules (mirror reflecting light only, a cloak that breathes questions) stay internally consistent and integrated into action. It stops just shy of transcendent because the physical environment beyond the tower (sea, cliff, village/world) remains largely atmospheric rather than pressuring tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific—the floating rock, sycamore hush, magnetic grotto, and penny-tasting air all work together to build a textured, coherent world. Environmental details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s attention and support the meditative, eerie tone. The grotto’s magnetism and the pond’s geometry are not just decorative; they model and enforce the story’s rules about attention and disappearance. The final image of sycamore quiet and the notebook of ripple sketches feels charged by everything we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon of endless echoes and towers of bone is vividly imagined and consistently exploited: sound behavior, bone architecture, and dust-history all matter to how Oren acts and what’s possible. The bone tower organ effect and echo-lines on the arrowhead directly shape his technique and the story’s logic. Setting details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, always filtered through Oren’s reverent, sound-attuned perspective. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of guiding others “through dusted centuries by sound,” so setting and micro-objects function as a true stage, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the “city of guilds,” courier drones, mist-walking, and the icebound spire’s impossible geometry all feel specific and integrated. Environment constrains and enables action—the spire’s contradictions, the crack in the wall, and the terrace garden’s “impossible summer” directly shape Davin’s tactics. The garden folly and its bench, roses, and light are not just pretty; they charge the final image of a humble doorway “for whoever came with empty hands.” World rules (mist walking, idea-engines, the spire’s accommodation of impossibilities) remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the lamplit pier, the sky full of lanterns, the sunken Meridian and its silt-furred library—are vivid, sensorially varied, and always filtered through the protagonist’s obsessions. Environment repeatedly constrains and shapes choice: climbing down the ladder, moving through tilted corridors, the limited air, the glass cases preserving books, even the porthole framing the lanterns above. Recurring objects (skeleton tag, hooded lamp, glowing card) charge the final image of him returning to lamp lighting. It’s deeply atmospheric without drifting into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “ambered observatory deck” and bruised sky are vivid and persistent, with the observatory’s dish, bearings, and power constraints shaping what choices are even possible. The coins, amber light, and glowing panels at discharge form a micro-setting system that charges the final image and concretizes abstraction. World rules (contracting universe, split dish, capacitor burn) are internally consistent and always filtered through Mara’s priorities rather than touristic cataloging. Environment and object together constrain action and theme, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The observatory, lens, mirrors, and atlas are not backdrop but active apparatus: the environment literally enables the magic of scattering light and crystallizing sound. Sensory detail is rich yet selective (“smelled of cold brass and rain,” “dome,” “glass turned black”) and always tethered to the reaper’s focus and grief. The setting constrains choices—this specific place and time of day are required for his method—and the final image of leaving the darkened observatory with the hidden crystal depends on all those built elements. The world’s rules (crystals forming where beams overlap) are coherently taught through interaction, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor, the “sapphire viaduct,” and the dripping basin are vividly particular and always tied to action—he literally uses the drip’s rate to time his magic. The viaduct-as-prow image and the sea tilting like an ear both charge the final image and thematically mesh with guidance/call-and-response. World rules (lukewarm magic, civic rationing, last fish) feel internally consistent and are learned by watching him work rather than exposition. Environment regularly constrains tactics (he has to stop at the basin; he has no ship, so the viaduct must become one), satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reservoir, resurfacing town, Midnight Ridgeway, and mud-preserved bar are rendered with vivid, selective detail that always passes through Mara’s professional and personal lens. Setting isn’t backdrop: the falling water, exposed streets, and mud imprint directly enable discovery and metaphorically enforce the “audit” frame. Recurring micro-settings and objects (ridgeway guardrail corkboard, bar counter, wind chime) charge the final images. Weather/light (“mirrored hush of late summer,” twilight/dawn) supports tone without slipping into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the valley’s “newly washed” air, kaleidoscopic waterfall, hidden orchard, and relic laboratory all feel specific and filtered through an alchemist’s sensibility. Environment directly constrains action—the required place “where water and color fell together” literally makes the experiment possible and charges the final image under the fall. Sensory detail is rich across modalities (smell of rain on stone, sound shift behind the waterfall) and never reads like a tourist catalog. The only slight limitation is that the terrain doesn’t complicate her task beyond providing the needed conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is both atmospherically rich and tactically necessary: its height, forked branches, and thin southern crown directly shape the trap, the slowed descent, and how the capture can occur at all. The buckle functions as a micro-setting object that constrains perception and action, from counting nicks to physically locking the lines, and returns in the final image to charge the ongoing burden. World rules (air lanes visible only in moonlight, branch netting, sick-ward drops) feel consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition dumps. A hairline distance from perfection is that the broader city/aviation infrastructure stays suggestive rather than fully textured—but at this length, the chosen slice is extremely effective.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock dojo above an ash-colored sea, gravity ropes, wind bells with two tones, and the edge over cloud create a striking, cohesive atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting supports the thematic focus on balance and precariousness, and staging the trial at the dojo’s edge subtly raises stakes. The world-rule of history rewriting is clearly signaled and reappears as “history flickered,” though it remains more conceptual pressure than a concrete constraint on tactics. Overall, setting is vivid, purposeful, and tightly fused to mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The escape room warehouse, brookside shed, and storm-framed city are vividly evoked and tightly bound to Mara’s psyche: the space really feels like a nocturnal haven for misfit inventors. Details like the heated mat, wired camera, humidity valves, scent filters, and the vent to the “brookside night” make the environment tactile and instrumental rather than decorative. The setting constrains choice at the climax, as the room’s design and surrounding air determine the seed’s viability and thus the demonstration of her ethic. A touch more tactile, moment-to-moment interaction with the physical space during the confrontation could push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The echo chamber tunnel, laundromat apartment, and tools (leaf blowers, hourglass, radiator) are vivid, sensorial, and tightly bound to Bram’s worldview and work. The environment isn’t postcarded; it materially shapes tactics (he needs the tunnel’s acoustics to catch laughter, the blowers’ wind to stir it loose, the radiator to warm the pulp). Smell and texture (fuel, wet leaves, detergent mist) deepen atmosphere without losing clarity. The final image of the pull cord on the windowsill and the steaming bag by the radiator shows strong use of micro-setting as charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen garden and peeled-open library are vivid, specific, and constantly filtered through the dreamlike, homesick POV, giving the piece a palpable place. Setting components constrain and charge choices: the dream-only library, the hedge-arch boundary, the frost and mist, and especially the library-as-outdoor-stacks directly underwrite the idea of interiorizing exteriors. The recurring garden images evolve—from eerie to a “calm page” inside the mind—so the environment actively participates in the closure. There’s no white-room drift; every environmental detail is doing thematic and emotional work.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember nexus, slag dunes, and furnace pit are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action, not just backdrop: the nexus supplies the embers that enable reforging and then responds to the charter-burning with a “deep exhale” and final collapse into glass. Sensory detail (“iron, saffron, and old prayers”) is selective and character-filtered, reinforcing both world-building and mood. The setting materially constrains tactics—this work can only happen here, at this time, with this furnace. There’s no orientation debt or white-room effect; if anything, the atmosphere verges on lush, but never to the point of confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the suspended radio city, gorge, perigee moon, and ozone-and-copper atmosphere all feel specific and purposeful. Crucially, environment constrains action—the gorge makes the mast-drop meaningful, the chained towers read as a “dead instrument,” and the star fragment as a tool charges the final image. World rules about charms, spells, and council-enforced silence are sketched efficiently and consistently, never stalling momentum. The landscape and tools are not backdrop but active shapers of what Mara can do and what it costs.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and always doing work: foggy harbor with “sideways” clocks, the working ferry deck, and the spectral grotto under starlight all shape mood and choices. Environmental rules (sideways clocks, patterned water, hovering ferry) are consistent and learned through Lina’s encounters rather than infodumped. The grotto and harbor infrastructure (radio, berths, star chart) directly constrain tactics at the climax. The final image of dawn over a now-ordinary harbor, with Lina staying aboard for “whatever now was,” is charged by all that environmental strangeness having just reconfigured itself.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly and economically rendered, with bending lines, painted shadows, and the central chamber/maze all doing thematic and structural work. Environment directly constrains choice—the layered webs and floating maze physically and psychologically trap the narrator and shape the options at the climax. Recurring objects (sinew, nails, mirror) are embedded in the space and charge the final image of the stable lattice anyone can walk through. There is no white-room drift; every setting detail feels selected to mirror perception, illness, and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The benthic city, quarantine bay, and surface ascent are vividly evoked and tightly filtered through a professional navigator’s eye. Environmental constraints—pressure doors, depth, darkness, ruined buoys, a single tide window—logically shape what’s possible and why starlight navigation is radical. The anchor link and classroom dome function almost as micro-settings, physically demonstrating the geometry that later governs the sky test. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than infodump, though we stay largely in cool visual/kinesthetic registers rather than a broader sensory spread.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hospital, mist-clad atrium, fogged windows, and stairwell are economically but vividly drawn, always filtered through Mara’s waiting and tension. The hearing aid functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains action and attention, and the final image under fern shadows with the warm aid meaningfully charges the environment. Weather and twilight support the tone without feeling like clichés, especially because “when the dead call” is tied to this liminal time. The setting mostly shapes mood and perception rather than concrete physical options, but it’s integral to the story’s feel and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sea cave, cliff, and forgotten facility are vividly realized through selective, tactile detail (slick rocks, rusted consoles “like tired animals,” wet copper smell). Environment and tools directly constrain choices—the tidal window, the stone throat, the reactor coil, and the pressure lock define tactics rather than serving as backdrop. The phase-transition space feels consistent with the world’s rules as taught on the page. The final re-anchoring to surf (“crashing hush…soften into ordinary surf”) charges the closing image and reframes the opening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory under snow, the dome, the telescope like a “sleeping spear,” and the ink-soaked charts all contribute an integrated, vivid atmosphere that feels inseparable from the story. Environment and object-as-setting directly constrain tactics: observatory sensors make the ink alphabet possible, servers house Lyle, and the shard/ink/console choreography is spatially clear. Weather and building sonics (snow on the dome, drives ticking, speaker warming) mirror and modulate her internal state without feeling over-signaled. Setting strongly charges the final image of her stepping into the snow “correctly recorded,” though it just stops short of an unmistakable physical constraint in the last beat that would push it into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and inextricable from the story’s logic: bone towers, the tunnel of echoes, wind through stone ribs, and the diamond’s vibration all directly shape what Ilen can attempt. The canyon’s acoustic rules constrain tactics (no shouting, dependence on whispers and timing) and its architecture—tunnel, ribs, crack for the diamond—matters in the climax. Sensory focus on texture (stone, bone, hide, water) is thematically loaded and POV-filtered, never feeling like generic fantasy decor. The final image of travelers brushing the rock to hear translation is a charged environmental payoff that reweights the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underground garden is sensorially rich (“air tasted of iron, honey, and old grief”) and tightly integrated into the action as the chosen site where gravity can be anchored by driving the arrowhead into soil. Environmental details (lamps dimming, pots lifting, stairwell into warm earth) shift with the pressure, making setting feel active rather than decorative. The arrowhead functions as both object and environmental rule-stitch, directly constraining choices in the climax. A tiny step below perfection only because the town of Larkspur and the “thaw that still stung” frame, while evocative, aren’t as structurally exploited as the garden itself.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Gearford’s brass-and-clockwork skyline, the soot-streaked orchard, chained roots, and PROPERTY tags are sharply rendered and always tied to pressure or theme rather than decorative. The statues’ granite feet, rasping joints, and the sensory mix of sap and coal make the environment feel tactically and emotionally present. Setting constraints (bridge remoteness, guarded orchard, chains) explicitly shape Lio’s options and charge the final image of the walking tree and dust-softened statues. World rules around magic/technology stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt arcade, shattered skylights, sensor towers, and Mendery strip form a vivid, specific environment whose rules are learned through action. Setting meaningfully constrains options—the lone mail drop, the roof as launch site, the drone border’s codes—and charges the climax and ending. The thunderstorm bottle functions as a tool-object fully embedded in the world’s logic, not a mere flourish, and the arcade returns at the end to frame Ivo’s renewed crossing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, aligning with Ivo’s professional gaze and the story’s tension between ruin and fragile order.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned circus train, salt marsh, wind bells, and ribcage-like oasis are vividly specific and suffused with purposeful detail; they feel lived-in rather than decorative. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables choices: the tilted train and junction force the exit/wrong-turn decision, the engine’s hush shapes his relation to sound, and the ribcage oasis provides literal and symbolic water. Recurring objects (bells, crates, brass pipes) evolve meaningfully and charge the final stirring of the train. A slight trim of descriptive density in one or two spots could improve balance without sacrificing atmosphere.

    The library is vividly particular—“scientific poetry library where equations were shelved beside odes,” hyperbolic staircases, “non-Euclidean elegies”—and every detail is filtered through Mara’s occupational and mathematical bias. The environment directly shapes action and choice: her measurements, the impossible angle, and the pocket itself are inseparable from this space. The recurring scarf and the hidden gap function as micro-settings that charge the final image of the drawer/key. A marginal reason not to go higher is that environmental constraint never fully tightens into a no-turning-back spatial dilemma; it primarily serves discovery rather than hard limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Tideway Library, whispering archipelago, watchtower, and “minute the sea turned to glass” are sensuous and integrated, not postcard details; they shape her tactics (sunrise angle, tide bell, odd hours) and charge the tone. The environment’s whispering cliffs and wind “languages” mirror her attempt to decode longing without becoming over-explicit. The setting directly participates in the climax: the high window, stacked photographs, and the library door to the “waking sea” all frame the transformation and release. World rules around light, photographs, and geography feel coherent and lived-in, making the piece feel larger than its word count.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid, selective, and functional: the observatory steps into a ravine, the spiraling hall, the flame-less lantern, and the star-reflecting pool all shape what can happen. Spatial and sensory details (air tasting of “cold metal and distant rain,” stairs changing form) contribute directly to the emotional and thematic pressure of disorientation and unlocking. Objects-as-setting—the ribbon, rings, silver comma—are tightly integrated and charged. The final image of the “shadowed nexus under starlight” closing like a book effectively recharges the environment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid and indispensable: the sunken orchard, glass dome, wreck-ring, and painted constellations are not just pretty but structurally necessary to how she discovers and reclaims her memories. Sensory detail (“tasted rust and old apples,” algae-filmed panes) is sharp and filtered through a folklorist’s eye. The environment constrains options (must dive; the ring cages the Court) and charges the final image of her returning to repaint constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten library, swing, tribunal balcony, and shard-mirror tools create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically charged. Objects-as-setting (the glass pane with trapped shadow, the teacup, the brass EXILE tag) concretely constrain choices and charge the final image when the tag falls away and the door-shape opens. Details are selective and filtered through Lio’s archivist sensibility and Mara’s discomfort (“she flinches at the smell of dust”), avoiding tourist-catalog description. World rules around shard-mirrors and captured shadows are consistent and learned through action rather than dumped exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly realized and deeply functional: the parapet, waterfall, mist, jars, and crack-grown pear all participate in the magic system and the final rite. The waterfall seam as literal doorway and the seed’s replanting on the parapet directly charge the final image and the ongoing stakes. Details are filtered through an orchard-worker’s sensibility (buds, sap, bruised limbs), which keeps the world cohesive rather than touristic. Atmosphere and environment genuinely constrain action; this exact place and its properties could not be swapped out without breaking the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight is richly specific from the first line and never drops into generic backdrop; prisms, quartz stairs, salt mirrors, and net all feel tactile and integrated. Environmental rules (starlight splitting into prismatic threads, the hush thickening, salt mirrors) are consistent and evolve with the action, culminating in the sanctuary “stopped hoarding silence” and holding song instead. The setting actively participates in the ritual—the starlight threads wrap around the narrator’s wrists, urging her on—which both constrains and propels choice. The final sense that the sanctuary is “inhabited rather than haunted” recharges the entire space as a reconfigured setting.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the harbor shop, moor, henge, and rain-scoured vault—are vivid and tightly selected, each carrying thematic weight around margins, erosion, and what is hidden. The environment constrains action (locals avoid the henge after rain; water washes frescoes; the underground vault shapes how she moves and listens). Object and place recurrence (torn chart, henge, rain, vault) directly charge the final images of rain “applause” and framed maps. This is near top-tier atmospheric work, just shy of 9+ because the physical setting never quite forces a painful tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken book freighter turned library is vividly realized—“shelves now pitched like ribs around a drowned nave,” paper as lace, ink as bruise—anchoring tone and theme. Environmental constraints (depth, silt, tether line, pressure) are felt without fussy logistics, and the snow globe functions as a charged micro-setting whose properties are crucial to the final image. The setting details are tightly selected through the diver’s professional eye rather than touristic. The final scene with the globe on the surface clearly shows the environment/object charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds” isn’t backdrop; its altitude and graffiti-covered walls are the delivery system that makes routing possible, and the weather (lightning/thunder) literally gates the window of action. Objects-as-setting (floating sundials, bolt plate, machines in the eaves) are all used, not just admired, and the cloud-sea below is crucial to the final payoff with readers in the city. Sensory specificity is high but always filtered through Lio’s tinkering, balladeer sensibility rather than a neutral tour. The environment’s constraints and affordances directly shape the story’s options and its closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire, brass elevator, iced rails, and hangar lights are all vivid and integrated into action rather than postcard description. Environment and tools directly constrain choice: the ten-floor ascent, the maintenance hatch, the emergency brake cable in the spire’s “frozen spine,” and the way scattered light off ice enables deciphering. The final image of her adjusting the captain’s goggles atop the spire recharges both the vertical setting and the class ladder metaphor. World rules remain consistent and legible without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gondola, tether, airship envelope, and storm system are exquisitely realized and always tied to action—this is not decorative atmosphere but a lived-in, physical environment that dictates options (suspended under an airship, drifting toward a supercell, with a line she can literally unspool). The brass telescope and survey spool double as micro-settings/tools that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Weather is not just backdrop but mechanism and threat, handled with convincing professional bias. A 9+ would require the environment to impose a more explicit, on-page physical cost (injury, loss) rather than an implied narrowly-avoided one.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tree trunk library is viscerally rendered—“ladders and shelves spiraled upward like ribs,” “smooth as a closed eyelid”—and every detail (coin depression, window slit, demolition sounds) is filtered through Liora’s attention and used in action. Environment actively constrains choice: the heartwood panel, limited light angle for reading indentations, and the condemned status all shape her tactics and the closing image. The final contrast between interior painted sky and external demolition is charged directly by setting, making the place inseparable from the story’s meaning. Minor worldbuilding questions about the city’s broader context never interfere with the scene-scale integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The antique airship, brass ribs, chart room, atlas-sails, and murmurations create a rich, coherent environment, with details consistently filtered through Lio’s map-obsessed sensibility. Setting objects (lantern, phrasebook, hopscotch board, compass, porthole) are not decorative; they constrain tactics and culminate in the engines’ awakening and the ship’s turn. The world rules around “stranded luminance” and the “region of glare” are introduced through felt phenomena rather than exposition, giving the final image of the glowing chart room real charge.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library, mirrors, ice-encased table, and altitude above the clouds are rendered with rich, purposeful specificity that matches the lyrical mode. Environment actively shapes options: the frost-sealed doors require her specialized skill, the ice and warning note constrain theft, and the mirrors both disorient and then guide her exit. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her craft and emotional state rather than a neutral catalog. World rules feel internally consistent for this fantastical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard world with levitating rock arches, pear valleys, chalked sidewalks, and the butterfly garden is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the survivors’ needs. Environment directly constrains choices: the relay well is physically under an arch, thorns snag their work, and the arches are what ultimately “carry” their labor into the stars. The bell and garden act as micro-settings that charge both the ghost’s origin and the final image. World rules (relays in arches, sap turning bitter with moons) feel internally consistent and meaningfully tied to survival rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hidden lighthouse, sea, and basement clock are not backdrop but functional constraints: the isolation, the vertical journey between lantern room and basement, and the physical mechanism shape what Mara can do. The pane of hush and puppet head operate as micro-settings/tools that literally mediate sound and time and are central to the final image. Environmental details (“sea strike the rocks like a slow verdict,” “sea had chewed the steps”) are selective and pressure-laden rather than touristic. The final return to the decayed lighthouse and bench tightly recharges the opening setting.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and functional: the cliffside orchard, slate labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost each constrain choices and tactics at key beats. Details are filtered through the caretaker’s bias (curse, near-touch tending, design knowledge) rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. Environmental rules (frost turning corridors to mirrors and birds to knives; nut and waystones altering patrol patterns) stay consistent and matter to action. The final image—orchard seemingly unchanged while the path beneath has been altered—beautifully charges the world with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    The braided ravine, foam patterns, ruined abutments, and field station are vivid, specific, and always filtered through Mara’s chemist/musical eye. Setting is not decorative: the foam’s behavior directly generates the technical breakthrough, and the ravine under the new bridge charges the final image. The recurring rivers/foam/braid motif also elegantly mirrors the thematic concern with separation and reconnection. Environmental logic is consistent and tactically relevant throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard floating on clouds, shelves drifting like rafts, and moonlight distilled from “last night’s spill” create a vivid, coherent fantastical environment. The setting isn’t just decorative: it generates the job (clean slate vendor), the test (book-fruit shattering into fragments), the tools (bottled moonlight), and the final address at the root of the orchard. Spatial and rule-level consistency hold, and the setting’s logic meshes with the story’s themes of growth, fragmentation, and beginnings. It could press on immediate tactical choice a touch more, but as world and atmosphere it’s exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid, original, and functionally integral: desert fortress after rain, sinkhole patterns like tidal pools, and the coral-frost pavilion all shape what is possible. Weather and environment directly drive the plot (storm reveals the sinkhole; cold, frost, and resin jars define the mechanics of remorse storage). Sensory detail is consistently filtered through Safi’s culinary and gustatory lens, which keeps description focused rather than touristic. The final broth scene recharges earlier environmental motifs (salt, dates, seawater, coral) in a way that clearly charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astronomical clock tower, brass planets, speaking tube, and grain dust create a highly specific, atmospheric setting that is consistently filtered through Mara’s musical and archival sensibility. Environment shapes tactics—the tower’s tube is how she converses with Nine, the bell pattern brings farmers, the physical height and mechanisms literally and figuratively mediate communication. The cuckoo clock weight and tower dial are strong micro-setting elements that constrain choices and then charge the final image of “counterweights” moving structures. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual detail over tactile grit in the repair scenes keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit canyon, dream-mines, and rusted instruments are not mere backdrop—they’re tied to the history of dream extraction and Nira’s present task. The broken periscope and copper helix function as micro-setting tools that constrain her options and drive the magical mechanics. The final image of her descending into the canyon to “excavate every abandoned dream” is charged by the environment established from the first line. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the silver light and shale reinforcing tone without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, inverted gravity, and prism compass are all vivid, specific, and tightly integrated into action rather than described as backdrop. Environment constrains choices (low tide, the one-hour inversion, slick stone, narrow throat, calcite door) and charges the final image of the mist reclaiming its secrets. Sensory detail is economical but memorable (water dripping upward, books hung like bats, kelp cords, green shimmer), clearly filtered through an archivist’s sensibility. World rules around the grotto and its inversion are consistent and shape tactics at every stage.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    The siskin alder grove, the moss-buried monument, and the porcelain insulator are richly specific and always filtered through Lysa’s tactile, music-seeking sensibility. Setting is not postcard backdrop; the flexibility of alder, the root pressure in the cracks, the birds hopping on wires, and the insulator as “pale moon” actively shape what is possible and charge the final image. World rules around the “Great Muffle” are economical but coherent, and the environment constrains tactics (no sound, so everything is via vibration and touch). The final choice to leave the insulator and grove humming depends entirely on this environment’s established properties.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The magnetic nexus and iron-dust field are richly imagined and function as more than décor—they dictate method (magnetism as language), stakes (maps and memory warping), and the means of closure (renouncing use of that site). Details like the city bells, council hall, and the board as a star-map are precise and filtered through Sable’s sensibility rather than reading as a tourist catalogue. The environment constrains tactics (no armies summoned, reliance on subtle field responses) and the recurring objects (board, worry stone) materially charge the ending tableau. World rules for the nexus and covenant stay consistent and are learned through Sable’s experiments rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the shadowed workshop, riverbank diary, dusty square, and crates of rockets are all filtered through Lio’s sonic attention (hushes, harmonics, hisses). Tools and objects—the resonator, metal clasp, crates—function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and carry thematic charge, especially when the clasp rests open in the final image. The contrast between “pre-ignition silence” and “post-firework silence” uses time and environment to mirror Lio’s inner shift without feeling schematic. A slightly wider sense of the town’s physical layout might deepen stakes but is not strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    The treetop village, rope nets, canopy gardens, compost shrine, and mudflats below are vivid, sensorially specific (especially through scent) and always filtered through Jun’s priorities. Setting is not postcard: the ecology of the corpse flower, moths, and rot directly underpins the village’s safety and the terms of the seed. Environmental constraints (height, sway, tide-timed bloom) shape how she moves and breathes, and charge the final descent image. This is close to exemplary, though one could imagine pushing physical risk from the heights a bit more to deepen constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: inversion gravity, floating arches, irrigation ribbons, and terraces all shape how Lysa moves and decides, particularly navigating “by water flow instead of trusting the horizon.” The canyon ring of arches and the stone-grown tree are strong, concrete images that charge the climax and visually encode the theme of stitched-together resilience. Environmental rules stay consistent and are taught through action rather than exposition; details like loose fruit orbiting in slow arcs make the inversion feel embodied rather than decorative. The only reason this doesn’t quite reach the very top band is that environmental hazards never counterpress her in a way that would further intensify choice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The container yard as a “towering labyrinth” is vivid, spatially coherent, and deeply integrated into the premise: it literally becomes the resonant structure that can “swallow an aircraft whole” and generate the singular convergence. Environmental details (air behaving like liquid, lanes narrowing and folding back) are filtered through the investigator’s technical eye and drive tactics like mapping eddies and opening specific doors. The refrigerated container, cylindrical stack, and airflow corridors all constrain choice at the climax. Setting is not decorative; it’s the machine and the maze, and it charges the final image of sound rushing back.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, aurora in the ice, and later the shuttered Council hall are vividly particular and deeply filtered through Lio’s synesthesia, giving the piece a textured, lived-in atmosphere. Environment and objects (ice, marble, bells, amber sheet) genuinely constrain and enable choices, especially in the hush-as-prison sequence. The shift from under-glacier luminescence to the Council’s lightless hall sharpens the thematic contrast without needing exposition. A hair more spatial choreography during the crisis with the hush would push this toward absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Thunder-echo range is vividly rendered and functionally integrated: the “avalanchingly quiet” canyon, muted storms, and ash-frozen clouds all shape how sound, risk, and the flute’s magic behave. Details like the driftwood carried up by spring floods and the split boulder “throat” feel both tactile and symbolic without becoming heavy-handed. Environment constrains choice—the hush and echo corridors are the medium of travel and understanding—while the driftwood and boulder anchor key beats. One could tighten slightly by letting the physical peril of the landscape bear more directly on her tactics, but as is it’s deeply atmospheric and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: topaz workshop, thinning starlight, halo metal, and the press all interlock with the story’s mechanics of printing/emotion. Environmental details (topaz dust, sky being “typeset and erased”) are not postcard flourishes; they mirror and charge Kestrel’s work and the final image of the blank broadside on her door. The press and fragment function as micro-setting tools that literally constrain what actions are possible. It’s hard to imagine the story transplanted from this specific physical and cosmic environment without losing most of its power.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and cairns are not decorative; they frame the villagers’ skepticism, Mara’s concern about ridge tales, and the final act of leaving the pendant in the mountain’s care. Environmental specifics—the frozen scree, aurora “leaning closer,” buried iron—are sharply rendered and directly involved in the relic’s sympathetic vibration. The ridge’s lore and physical cairn system charge the closing image and enable the solution Rook and Mara choose. Setting, object, and atmosphere interlock to shape theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salvage yard, quartz arbor, mist, frost, and car interior are vivid and tightly selected, with details like “boots caked in river clay” and “windshield filmed with frost though the night was mild” doing double duty for mood and world logic. The car and its mirror function as micro-setting that materially shape events and closure: their glass literally stores and releases emotional residue. The quartz arbor and mist support the liminal, ritualistic atmosphere and the “shifted hush” that signals altered stakes. It falls just shy of higher because the quartz arbor itself doesn’t directly constrain any specific choice beyond tone.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are not postcard backdrops; their isolation and quiet are the enabling conditions for the “raveling silence” to exist as material. The loom, orchard, bead, and puzzle pieces function as a micro-setting cluster that constrains options (no conventional travel, only this intimate magical technology). The setting evolves with events—the orchard fading when the puzzle frame closes, the bamboo shivering at Jun’s return—so environment and motif charge the final images. The specificity of pears, mulberry bark, and salt-crusted clothing keeps the lyrical atmosphere grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and bruised-fruit tremors are vividly imagined and filtered through Lio’s workmanlike gaze, giving the setting both lyric texture and functional constraint. The arches’ mined-out anchors and the abandoned shafts directly shape tactics (hidden workshops, new anchors) and the conceptual understanding of the crisis. The recurring silk and stone form a micro-setting at the end when he buries the strip in the mine, charging the final image with the world’s rule-set. One or two descriptive flourishes skate close to ornamental, but they rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned repair bay feels tactile and lived-in—grit, oil, coolant, humming conduits—and is filtered through the narrator’s unusual sensory priorities. Environment and tools (bay, hatch, workbench, log terminal) directly shape tactics and the final act, and the shard functions as both object and micro-setting in the way it redirects light/seams. The science-fictional world-building is economical but internally consistent. A hair more evolution of the bay across universes could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse, fog, “haunted” lantern room, and shoreline are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Noah’s professional eye and superstition-aware pragmatism. Setting directly constrains tactics—dead mast and weak skiff lamp make cairns and physical repair necessary rather than decorative. The lens, sea glass, and stones recur as charged objects that shape choice and charge the final image. Weather and sea conditions matter to action (trawler’s horn, reef avoidance), not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, sea, and post-grid coast are not mere backdrop; they directly constrain tactics (light as communication system, height as vantage, newspapers as physical media in a world without screens). The emerald lens and glass wick function as tools whose specific properties matter at the climax. Environmental conditions—storm, tide, dunes, harbor mouth—shape what is possible and give the warning system concrete stakes. The final image of people climbing the hill for “the smell of wet ink” beautifully fuses setting, history, and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly particular—floating rock tea house, shawl of mist, brass prisms, salt road—and consistently filtered through a dye master’s sensibility. Environment and objects aren’t postcard: prisms, mist, and moving sunlight literally control access to the hidden map, and the underside of the rock forces Maru to confront “emptiness” at the final discovery. The jar of dye and morpho wing function as charged micro-setting tools that drive the climax and final image. Weather/light (mist, dawn, sun trails) actively shape what can be seen and chosen, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exceptionally integrated: the storm, tower, labyrinth, moonlight, and pines are not backdrop but active constraints and resources (e.g., the sextant only heals and functions in moonlight; the shifting maze and numbered bends literally determine movement and data). World rules (quantified sorrow, dream flakes, maze shifts when a pin is heard) are clear and consistently enacted through action rather than exposition dumps. The final image on the storm-swept parapet with the leaning pines retrofits the entire environment as a network of witnesses, charging both the tower interior and the coastal exterior. The specificity of municipal, almost banal infrastructure around grief keeps the atmosphere vivid and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is highly distinctive—the mirror world, backward rivers, alchemical orchard, and mica window all feel integrated and specific rather than decorative. Endless night and the glasshouse’s artificial noon directly pressure the premise: the environment is literally killing the realm and dictates what must be done (weave dawn inside this constrained space). The mica window’s physical properties (layered, light-splitting) meaningfully constrain the final tactic of aligning the cloth to open a seam. A slight overabundance of atmospheric detail verging on density is the only thing keeping this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The museum-over-library and the “lamplight pooled like honey” atmosphere are vivid and thematically apt, especially the aisles labeled with contradictions (“Silence Speaks,” “Departure Returns”). The hidden-in-plain-sight architecture concretizes the idea of nested paradoxes and misdirection. However, the environment rarely constrains choices in a tactical way; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than active pressure. Still, the setting is specific, coherent, and integrated into the story’s logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly particular and thematically loaded: bricked-over bakery, the closed palace with fig trees and salvaged-door tables, thyme in a dry fountain all mirror and resist erasure. Environment meaningfully constrains action—resistance takes the form of planting in cracks and abandoned courtyards, and the secrecy of the overgrown palace makes the tea house and its work possible. The recurring spatial motif (from the palace courtyard plantings to the sprout in the bakery wall) directly charges the final image. Detail is selective and filtered through Mina’s noticing rather than touristic cataloguing, supporting both mood and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Archive above the clouds, the frozen windows, the Lumen Room with its lattice of crystals, and the cloud sea/auroras form a vivid, fully integrated environment filtered through Ilian’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard-like: the cold, the frost on lenses, and the altitude isolate him and make the Archive’s mission feel precarious yet elevated. The “quartz hush” and crystalline architecture directly charge the final image and his new vow, so environment clearly shapes tone and closure. World rules around mirage jars and luminous vows are consistent and learned through action rather than dump.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The under-pier market is vividly and economically rendered—tar-sweating pilings, lantern glass, wet coin—and the environment directly constrains tactics (vibrations through wood and chain, darkness, the hush, the tide). The recurring details of wax, boards, pilings, and water all feel lived-in rather than decorative. The final images (tide rinsing blood, first gull cry, retrieving the fob) reweight the earlier sensory work and charge the earned stasis. There’s little wasted description; nearly every detail either grounds action or echoes theme.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Worldbuilding is rich yet economical: forests voting via leaf voltages, lavender terraces over basalt cliffs, and aurora as both backdrop and system signal a coherent eco-tech polity. Setting is deeply POV-filtered through taste, smell, and light, supporting atmosphere rather than feeling like a catalog. Environment and tools (e.g., the ring; election night at Lavender Bluff) do real work: they constrain where the narrator can find the carriers and how the vote manifests. The final image—the circle under aurora, lavender, and calm dome of weather, ring settling—beautifully charges the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and specific (“walls glitter like frozen music,” “auroral sorrow”) and clearly filtered through an artist’s perception. Environmental features meaningfully constrain choices: the broken dressing-room lock, the quartz door, the crystals (as light source, emotional register, and literal wedge), and the pigments that enable the climactic mural. World rules stay coherent, and the fairground frame ties surface and underground spaces into a single ecology. A hair less description in the fairground opener and a touch more tactile interaction with the cave under pressure would move this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “sprawling greenhouse city under a toxic sky” is not just pretty dressing; the glass structures, vents, and toxic atmosphere literally frame the stakes (air and water) and feed into the Dead Letter Conduit’s function of composting words into breathable air. Details like algae canals, glass orchards, and the ECHO CONDUIT are filtered convincingly through Mara’s professional, observant eye and evolve with the plot. The micro-setting of the fern on the desk and the tubes of murmuring paper constrains choices and charges the final realization about how honesty might reopen the cistern. The final image of the toxic sky and an “answerable” city reweights all earlier environmental detail with thematic force.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering bluff, cloud sea, cedar frames, and high wind are not decorative; they actively shape the bells’ behavior, the kinetic sculpture’s function, and the communal gathering, and they charge the final images. Objects-as-setting are exemplary: the iceberg fragment and later the tuned basin constrain choices and define how truth and wonder can be conducted. Environmental details are precise and purposeful (e.g., “pale rainbows onto the cloud sea like fish beneath ice”) and consistently filtered through Lysa’s vocation and stakes. The world rules (seasonal muteness, post-verbal society) stay internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the glass dome, desert night, and desert roses all actively constrain options (no easy venting, risk of “slow oven,” sand-jammed hatch). Environmental systems—the guidance field, heaters, irrigation, and ancient vent protocol—are not just backdrop but the physical logic of the plot. Objects-as-setting (the dome, the box, the bead, the hatch, the dune) tightly interlock with his tactics and the final image of bead-burial. The only reason not to push into 9+ is that some world rules (e.g., how often north shifts, wider colony infrastructure) remain gestural rather than fully textured, which is fine at this length but keeps it just shy of maximal richness.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtyard is vividly and economically rendered—murals, basil, pigeons, fountain, and the idling developer truck—and it feels like a real, socially dense micro-world. The environment meaningfully shapes the story: the bolted mailbox, the brick seam, and the communal tables all matter to how events unfold. The “sandstorm calm” tone and small intrusions (sirens, drones) let setting mirror the thematic balance between sanctuary and threat without heavy-handed symbolism. The final sense of the courtyard “brighter than dawn” is charged by prior detail, though one could push environmental constraint on choice even harder for a truly top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken laboratory is richly and economically realized: “saltwater pressed against cracked glass,” “door scabbed with coral,” “waist deep water,” and drowned acoustic sensors all shape tactics and constraint. The environment directly affects choices (can’t cut power, must avoid triggering broadcasts, rerouting alarms into acoustic sensors) and charges the final image of the abandoned journal and web. The spider, water, glass, and corroded tech form a coherent micro-ecology that mirrors the layered codes and pressures. A slightly clearer spatial sense of the lab’s internal geography would be the only possible refinement.

    The harbor, the beached whale, and especially the salt crystal chamber are sensuously and specifically rendered, with details (silence “that sounds like light,” floating tools, gravity pockets) that feel both tactile and purposeful. Setting repeatedly constrains or enables choices: Lysa ties herself off because of gravity shifts; the sealed salt drain and chamber architecture dictate how the council can store memories. Environmental motifs—light, salt, rot, glittering silence—return in the final image, charging the closure. A minor note is that the broader town remains more sketched than lived-in, but for this length the chosen micro-settings work exceptionally well.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The haven, brook, and “terrestrially cosmic” stones are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the magic system. The brook isn’t backdrop; it is the literal carrier of the prophecy and later “refuses to repeat itself,” embodying the altered stakes. The stones’ grounding property participates in the solution when the crane carries the prophecy upward. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful, never reading like a tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop garden, meteors, parapet carvings, and the building’s interior all feel tactile and specific, with details like tremoring herb pots and steam-script that carry mood and worldbuilding simultaneously. Setting is not mere backdrop: clay from the planters and the parapet marks are functional tools that enable communication with the building and discovery of the cavity. The meteor shower and rooftop recur to charge both the wax/clay scene and the final image, deepening the sense of cosmic yet intimate change. A slight bias toward the visual over other senses keeps this just shy of perfection but does not impede clarity or effect.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the velvet garden, lanterns like quarantined light, and the glasshouse of humming jars all filter through Mira’s perspective and echo the memory-contagion premise. The Conservatory’s physical rules (jars, frequencies, cracking jars as danger) directly reflect the emotional and social stakes. The shell as object-setting carries through to the final “silence in her pocket,” charging the last image. A slight tendency toward ornamental lushness in early descriptions keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and ice cave architecture are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Liora’s perception, with concrete tactile use of space (basin seam, rotating altar, hidden door). The environment constrains and enables her tactics—the key fits the stone rather than a literal door, meltwater replaces ink, and the sanctuary itself “turns” to open a way out. Recurring sensory anchors (stalactite drips, auroral light in stone) support tone and thematics without feeling like a catalog. A hair shy of the very top band only because some lush description borders on decorative rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly particular and integral: the Hollow Canyons, the serpentine nexus, and the spiral chamber of luminous threads all arise from the world’s acoustic logic and constrain what’s possible. Lira’s echo-singing into stone, Jaro’s shadow-echo, and the way the chamber turns sound into threads that can be snapped are all world rules learned through action rather than exposition. The environment directly shapes tactics and closure—Lira’s song manipulates the chamber’s acoustics to free captured voices, and Mael is finally betrayed by echoes of her own footsteps. The selective, poetic detail (e.g., “star-silver rocks,” “starlight… where many canyons met like interlaced snakes”) serves mood and mechanism rather than reading like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glacier shrine, candles tinted blue by starlight, and the underwater wreck are rendered with striking specificity, and these details are not merely decorative: the ice lens literally conditions how Mara investigates and ultimately witnesses Fen. The recurring objects—the globe, the alcoves, the altar—directly charge the final image when the globe becomes a “gentler window of connection.” Sensory focus leans visual, but the few tactile and auditory cues (regulator, cold, candle flicker) keep the space from feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    The parapet after rain, river, fireflies, and moonlit puddles are richly rendered and consistently filtered through Jiro’s craft-trained attention. Setting is not postcard; wet seams, abandoned nets, and moon pools directly shape how Jiro teaches and how Ren moves and perceives, and the moon’s light is essential to deciphering the smugglers’ cuts. The bamboo whisk and parapet return in the final tea-brewing image, charging the ending with the same environment and tools reweighted by new understanding. Weather and season (rain, firefly season) are integrated into action and tone rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and functionally integrated: “sky tasted like pennies,” “concrete ribs of the city,” and the dust-wall storms all feel lived-in. The Stillpoint orchard is not only an image but a rule-bound space that constrains movement and concealment and then recharges the final image when apples return to the city. World rules about the storms, radiation, and the calm pocket stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. Environment and recurring objects (the orchard, apples, the diamond) clearly charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the cloud ocean, the cobalt glass portico, and the storm itself are vividly rendered and more than decorative—they enable the cloud projections, color Mara’s entrance, and charge the final dawn image. Tools and environment (antennas, telescope mount, stormlight) are used tactically, not just described. The world’s rules feel consistent within its lightly speculative frame and the setting’s recurrence from first line to last ties atmosphere directly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The seaside village, dunes, cannery, church bells, and “feral loft” are vivid and economically rendered, always filtered through Sato’s sensibility. Setting and recurring objects (loft, jars, music box, church bells) are not mere backdrop: they feed the jars, structure the ritual at dawn, and charge the final image of jars “like lanterns.” The environment subtly enforces his liminal status (beneath dunes, scavenging shorelines) and thus the thematic work. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical environment doesn’t tightly restrict his tactical choices in any one beat; it’s more atmospheric than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action—the dock’s groan provides the vibration Lio matches, and the ice, floes, beeswax-warm chapel, and turning lens all shape options and emotional charge. Sensory detail is rich but purposeful, with sound and temperature repeatedly foregrounded in ways that matter to Lio’s sonic method. The final image—the lighthouse beam and the shared hum of dock, ice, and breath—charges earlier environmental details into a cohesive closing chord. Setting feels indispensable rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are not mere backdrop; their material properties (iron filings, basalt cold, ice thickness) directly constrain tactics and enable the rebels’ strategy. The environment’s harsh, lunar-inflected atmosphere is consistent and charged, and the sanctuary’s vantage point is essential to Irena’s mapping and to the thematic horizon motif. Weather and temperature—sleet, thawless mornings, deep winter cold—matter to both timing and outcome. This is elite-level integration, with only minor room for clearer tactile immediacy during the heist itself.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel is richly realized through sound, moisture, brick, alcoves, carts, and the emergency shaft, all of which constrain her tactics (moving in darkness, using echoes, needing a shaft for a safe signal). The post-drought wetness versus still-dusty tunnel sections feeds directly into her observational method and time-of-death inference. The lantern functions as both object and micro-setting, charging the final image when its extinguished warmth “lingered in her palm.” World rules feel consistent and lived-in without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Marrow Street shop, its tools, and the music boxes are specific, tactile, and always in play, never mere backdrop. The environment directly enables the restorative-justice tactic (repairing victims’ boxes) and the clockwork heart’s role as a testing rig. Recurring details—the brass teeth, bellows, storm-light—subtly mirror the moral recalibration without over-declared symbolism. The final walk under clearing skies, recalling the earlier “light breaks through storm clouds,” charges the last image with thematic weight rooted in setting.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and integrated: the acid sea necessitates the floating workshop and non-melting glider, while gears under floorboards, the dead coast, and rusted towers aren’t postcard details but machinery that literally wakes and transforms in the climax. Sensory specificity (“smelled like pennies,” “steam,” “green sigh”) is strong and POV-filtered through Mara’s wry lens. Environment and recurring objects (bell tower, socketed stone, acid sea, gears) directly shape what’s possible and charge the final images. A hairline restraint is that we seldom see the environment directly obstruct or force micro-tactics under pressure, since her passage across the sea is relatively untroubled.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is sharply realized and integral: the social network archive, humming server choir, the Chute, and the digital detritus of posts all shape what Mara can do and how. Details are filtered through her archivist sensibility (threads like roads, metadata as weather) and the company’s infrastructure directly constrains and enables her investigation. The mission patch and buoy, as recurring objects in this techno-corporate environment, charge the final image. World rules around deletion/exile are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse orchard over ice floes, the lantern room, and the vintage store of mirrors are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through function rather than mere decoration. Environment directly constrains choices: shifting ice, boats, and the vantage of the lighthouse shape the stakes and make the map’s guidance concrete. The recurring objects (shard, mirrors, apples) meaningfully charge the final image of safe channels and shared harvest. Setting/world rules for the semi-magical Accord Bureau and mirrors feel internally coherent and unobtrusively taught through action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly realized and consistently functional: the ice, pontoons, wind, and storm all shape what’s possible (tapping for hollows, the skiff’s net-snag, the rescue under bad conditions). Sensory detail is selective and biased to the narrator’s concerns (sound and resonance of ice, metallic air), enriching both mood and theme without slipping into cataloguing. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object, constraining her tactics (probing ice, cutting the net) and charging the story’s atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the vineyards, tracks, and amber pavilion in autumn are filtered through the sentinel’s occupational eye, and the sensory details (crushed skins, smoke, humming wires) feel lived-in. The pavilion’s warmth and glass directly enable their shelter and conversation, and its amber light reweights the letter-reading moment (“turned each sentence into something tender rather than accusing”). Vineyard specifics (trellises, grafting) feed key metaphors that influence how they interpret their relationships. The environment doesn’t exert harsh constraint, but it quietly shapes both mood and choices through the whole piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert, dunes, ropes, and buried parapet are not just decorative; they constrain behavior (peripheral gaze, line-walking) and directly shape the ritual’s risks and tactics. The kinetic parapet aligning “like ribs under skin” and the vanishing/returning wind embed atmosphere in physical stakes. World rules (echoes as vibration, parapet twitching under speech-pressure) are internally consistent and discovered through action instead of exposition dumps. The pavilion is slightly less structurally crucial than the dunes/parapet, keeping this at a very high but not flawless level.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are vividly rendered and recur as charged anchors—the scent vs. metallic taste, the vines climbing ruins, and the placement of acetate on the fence all knit environment to emotion. Setting is not postcard-static; it evolves (vines rising, storm, power outage, candles) and actively shapes the form and feel of the memorial-walk. Specific details like the chain-link fence, broken windows, and pallet scanning table keep the space tactile and legible. The environment clearly charges the final image of communal walking and candlelight-infused photos.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library is richly evoked as both physical place and ecosystem of language: “windows still held night like ink,” vines along spines, botany alcove sunlight, maintenance stair and compost corridor. Setting is always filtered through the scholar’s sensibility, integrating world rules (no more dictionaries, language as growth) with tactile images (damp earth, paper skins shedding). Environment and objects constrain choices—the chandelier, crystal, maintenance stair, and vine-marked door all determine available actions and the final image. The only minor limitation is that we don’t see much physical risk from the space itself; the pressure is more conceptual and ethical than bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fog sculpture garden, landfill of art and shipwrecks, fog bell, and unwatched videotapes create a highly specific environment whose rules and textures are consistently exploited. Setting isn’t postcard; low tide, fog that “rearranges everything,” shadowless sculpture, and the shed of tapes all tangibly guide tactics and charge the final image of copying voices onto cassettes. The environment and its recurring objects (driftwood, fog bell, tapes) decisively shape what meaning is possible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and integrated: the lunar observatory’s altitude, rail-launch infrastructure, and the quake-ridden mountain directly shape what’s possible and what’s at risk. Details like “domes breathed slow vapor,” “bright as a scar,” and cloud seas below are not postcard flourishes; they reinforce the isolation and precariousness of the work. Tools and micro-setting objects (clock, pier, leaf cylinder, rails) constrain tactics moment-to-moment and charge the final image of listening to leaf-ticks as the pod climbs. A hair under top-band only because a few atmospheric turns lean more toward beauty than added constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “Radiant Haven” above the clouds, the skybridge, and the garden-scented vents form a distinctive, coherent environment that’s consistently filtered through Mara’s sensory and professional bias. The shard of vinyl and the turntable function almost as micro-settings that literally and emotionally stage the climax. The cloudline and terraces don’t aggressively constrain physical choices, but they charge the final terrace-bound death and the drone dock arrival with an earned, otherworldly calm. Detail is selective and purposeful, rarely lapsing into catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the nocturnal observatory, floating isle, star-maps, crack through the mural, stair into the underside, suspended mirrors, and reservoir of noon-light all feel necessary rather than decorative. Environment and objects (chalk circle, runes, mural, mirrors, glass over the white pool) repeatedly constrain or enable choices—she must use the observatory’s secret architecture and tools to solve the noon-shadow problem. The tone of slightly estranged, rule-bent reality is carried consistently through spatial logic (false noon in the dome; the isle depicted in the mural hiding its own underside). This is near top-tier work; the only small limit is that weather/physical world don’t impose additional pressure beyond the metaphysical puzzle, so there’s a touch less environmental resistance than the absolute highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the hedge maze, secret garden, sundials, hybrid roses, and refurbished fountain all echo the story’s past/future and myth/medicine concerns. Environment directly shapes action—the maze map, hidden stone and tin box, and branch-door through the hedge materially constrain Rowan’s choices. The sensory specificity (reeds, crushed mint, polished-seed eyes) feels filtered through his sensibility as a bone setter and reluctant believer. This is close to exemplary; a touch more pressure from the physical environment (weather, darkness) at the final step through the hedge might push it into truly rarefied territory.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto, surf, mist, and tide pools are not just scenic; they supply the crucial resource (sea glass) and shape the method (wet sand, powdered shell) by which he works. Environmental texture (“surf as if it were a slow sky,” “serpentine grotto”) is filtered consistently through a star-watcher’s sensibility, and the sea’s role as collaborator charges both the process and the final admission that “the sea had done most of the work.” The final image of the pearl’s light in the meeting hall is inseparable from its oceanic and cavern origins, so setting actively charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated with action—the icicles and foil create the encryption method, the remaining power enables the plan, and the place’s neutrality explains why Jun will come. Details like “servers lay like tombstones under green quilts” and the “honeyed hush” do double duty for atmosphere and theme. Environment constrains choices (off-grid, no drones, limited power), satisfying the high-band gate. A slight trim of lush description in one or two spots might sharpen urgency, but overall the setting work is publication-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The feral nexus of mist, shredded chapters, and the ink river is vividly realized and tightly tied to Mara’s artistic struggle. Setting elements actively constrain choice—the current threatens to carry her to the “mouth of light,” the bank of broken metaphors must be climbed, and the shell physically cuts her—so environment is never postcard-only. The recurring shell functions as a micro-setting tool that charges both the crossing and the return to the desk. Atmosphere is immersive and tonally aligned with the theme of resisting narrative gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The verdant arbor, dawn light, dew, moon, vine, and circle of stones are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the ritual’s needs (moonlight in dew, vine as wire, the oldest trunk’s scar). Setting elements constrain and enable choices: the temporal alignment with dawn and the harvest moon dictates when the remedy can be made, and the environment literally supplies the materials of the tool and the wound to mend. The final image—sun clearing the canopy, the arbor alive, songs anchoring the rite—recharges those early environmental details without feeling overdetermined. This is rich, purposeful world-building that supports both action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is richly specific and constantly active: the frozen sap as a metronome, the capped well, the unmoving aurora all shape how Eira works and what she can do. Environmental constraints drive tactics—she must work with discarded camp items, ice as seal, and the crater’s remembered starlight—rather than decorating the prose. The final image of the aurora shifting a fraction over the crater, above the sealed well in the orchard’s center, shows the setting directly charging closure. World rules (breath-holding, safekept starlight, the crater as observatory hollow) stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The marble cavern is richly specific and consistently filtered through Ivo’s observational habits, with strong sensory and conceptual integration. Environmental properties (polished marble, reflection angles, echo behavior) directly shape his tactics and make the final solution—using a sliver of marble as escapement—feel inevitable. Details evolve (thawing/freezing entrance, tremors, lens-like behavior) rather than static postcard description. The setting decisively charges the final image of the cavern’s “relief” and the stored chorus in his pack.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptional: bronze grotto as whale rib, shingled hush, thawed moss, river “unbuttoning” the valley all feel precise and lived-in through this sensibility. Environment shapes options and tactics—the grotto’s sound-swallowing bronze necessitates the lamp, the spatial curvature traps the narrator, and the crack of starlight is required for the alignment escape. The lamp burner functions as micro-setting as well as tool, constraining the escape method and returning in the final soot-mark beat. There’s almost no wasted description; every environmental detail either charges mood or supports the mechanics of the escape and burden-carrying.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, single burner, ash blank, brass whip handle, and kettle collectively create a tightly bounded micro-setting that feels tactile and lived-in. Environmental elements actively shape the beat: the kettle time-boxes the work; the steam enables the crystallized-time visions; the ring-door placement of the future panel links the quiet loft to the public arena. Sensory detail is rich but focused—smell of wet metal and tea, rust-hued light—mirroring Miriam’s state without resorting to blunt symbolism. The final lifting of the ash wood into that light charges the closing image with place-specific meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a standout strength: the kinetic lagoon, frozen horses, cloudlight, and the park above the clouds are all vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the plot and theme. Environmental rules (the lagoon mist affecting chronology, water looping without spilling, the lagoon’s rotation keeping the park aloft) are consistent and materially constrain options. The final image—the lagoon turning slowly “not to entertain anyone, but to keep the park aloft and the stories from sinking into silence”—reweights the entire environment as a living system Mara must tend rather than a spectacle she must control. Details are consistently filtered through Mara’s priorities rather than reading like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly realized with purposeful detail: dust-filmed glass, sugar-and-grease smells, mechanical rooms, cistern, turbine, and antenna all matter to the plot. The environment directly constrains tactics—her ability to route rainwater and repurpose emergency systems arises from this specific architecture. Carnival residue (confetti, glitter in drains) deftly ties past use to present function. The final image of revived lamps reflecting like a constellation shows the setting charging the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and thematically integrated: glacier, quartz veins, bell-less cloister, smells of cedar and petrichor all shape mood and stakes. The soundless sanctuary’s rules (no weapons, no shouts, bells removed) directly constrain his options with the bear and underwrite his internal conflict. The crystal forecourt and glacial hush charge the final image, where sunrise “did not crack the silence, only colored it,” making place inseparable from meaning. Details feel filtered through his clockmaker/composer sensibility rather than like a neutral tour.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight barge canal is vividly realized and not just scenic; it shapes the entire sociopolitical ecology (canal folk, floating relay shack, half-sunk barge) and constrains tactics (tide charts, wedges under piers, guards who nap on night shifts). The pocket sundial functions as a micro-setting/tool that literally constrains her timing deduction and then charges the final image of moving shadow vs fixed marks. Environmental details are selectively chosen and filtered through Mara’s investigative focus, maintaining atmosphere without white-room moments. The world’s rules (engineered silence, broadcast infrastructure) feel coherent and lived-in at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor in snow and fog, the golden dock, the bell, and the meltwater crack are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through Lio’s attentive, almost ritualistic perception. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain action: the dock lamp and fulgurite create the knot-shadow-reading method, the bell’s timing governs the weaver’s appearance, and the dock crack with meltwater becomes the only viable place for the black lotus. Weather and physical setting aren’t postcard backdrops; they’re stitched into how information is accessed and how the final symbolic act occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting work is superb: the harbor, chained shut, and the palace hill as a “dark lantern” immediately anchor mood and world, while the shadowed garden, black-netted roses, and river create a tactile, melancholic microclimate. Details are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility and profession, so description feels purposeful rather than touristic. The garden and carpet-thread function as charged environments/objects, literally and symbolically shaping how absence is mapped and how presence is projected. The final image of leaving the autumn garden with the red thread in hand shows the environment and object recharging stakes and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—the suspended palace, Archive Vats, and Foundry Cradle are all tactile and visually striking while also thematically loaded. Environmental details are POV-filtered and purposeful (“lantern of cold plasma,” “dust chose corners,” “chained to giant stalactites”) and avoid feeling like a tourist catalog. The palace’s physical suspension and ticking mechanics charge the final image when it “creaked against its stalactite anchors, as if testing a new balance,” directly mirroring the story’s conceptual shift. World rules feel internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    The volcanic beach, black sand, obsidian lagoon, dunes, and kelp are vividly rendered and always filtered through her firefighter’s and daughter’s gaze. Environment and recurring objects constrain action (engine bogged in sand; hiking in with packs; fieldwork on the black sand) and richly charge the final image where the lagoon’s calm and sand’s absorptive quality reweight everything we’ve read. The coin functions as a micro-setting object that shapes multiple choices and culminates in the last act at the rescue post. Sensory detail is economical but lush, and atmosphere (migration of clouds, “kelp-drift peace”) supports theme without slipping into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The city of forgotten fountains is strikingly rendered—“chalky moons” in dry basins, limescale chips, stacked fountainheads like skulls, the cold wet smell below ground—and consistently filtered through Mara’s task-focused perception. Setting is not just decorative: the dry city makes the underground dampness uncanny, the limescale is both clue and key, and the constellations tie sky, city, and mechanism together. The environment meaningfully constrains what’s possible and charges the final image of her carrying light back toward the fountains. A slightly broader sense of the city’s current inhabitants beyond Archivists and listeners to the geese would deepen the stakes but isn’t strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Nebula Garden is richly specific and inextricable from the story’s logic: sight failing in dense violet dust necessitates sonar, the “wall that approximates infinity” defines both navigation and theme, and petals as memory embody generational repetition. Setting constraints concretely shape tactics (moth harness, sonar reed, following gear-scratched grooves) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The final image of the Garden “watching” the first communal wheel glow recasts the environment as an observing, pattern-keeping presence. A slight abundance of lush description edges toward ornamental in a couple of lines but rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse, cemetery, storms, and butterflies are vividly realized and tightly woven into action and theme rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental elements constrain and charge choices—the greenhouse as the only living space in the cemetery, storms as a thinking aid, butterflies as temporal and symbolic markers interacting with the ribbons. The final image of the stone at the gate at dawn with butterflies lifting is strongly anchored in prior setting detail and reweights earlier scenes. At an elite level, a touch more concrete interaction with space during the family dinner (movement, small physical inconveniences) could deepen the sense of embodiment even further.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The environment is vivid and functionally integrated: the obsidian ridge, tidal flats, tower height, and tide marker all constrain what matters and how she can act. The ridge is not just décor but the lethal hazard that gives the clock moral weight, and the final image of the wave meeting the new notch exactly charges both setting and theme. Tools and objects (pendulum bob, rake handle, tide marker) function as micro-settings that govern tactics. Weather and physical textures (heat from black stone in cold air, corrosion flaking) deepen atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, chess table, and ash trees are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through the gardener’s sensibility, with details like “velveteen gloom, blue walls swallowing sound” doing both atmosphere and thematic work. Setting meaningfully shapes action: the silo’s history explains the tapestry’s existence and the ash trees provide the physical hiding place and final act of planting. The recurring objects (sovereign case, clock, ash) directly charge the closure. World rules and spatial relations stay clear.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are not just pretty; they embody the tension between stasis and flow and concretely matter for sled routes, trade, and the Black Winter backstory. Environmental details (ice singing, fishers’ lights, thaw water around the spire) are selective, evocative, and filtered through Jora’s professional eye. The recurring kingfisher quill and the ice/spire contrast charge the final images of thaw and adaptive infrastructure. A slight increase in how the harsh environment directly impedes or shapes on-page choices could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: soot “like snow,” the ember alcove, fog, bread lines, and the central square all feel lived-in and are filtered through Mara’s artistic attention. The environment and objects (dust, coal, radio dial glow, black cloth) constrain tactics—she needs secrecy, specific light, and public acoustics—and charge the final image as mist “held the stories like seeds” and the ember glows in time. World rules about the “story famine” and Censors of Noise remain consistent and are learned through action, not exposition dumps. The space is never a backdrop; it continually interacts with the stakes and the magic of narrative returning.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, with its narrowing walls and painted horizon, is both vivid and thematically fused to disappearance and distance; Lira literally pins the portrait where the perspective lines converge. The rocking chair and cracked skylight operate as lived-in environmental details that constrain and shape beats—the chair becomes an uncanny actor that halts the inspector’s hand. Curfew, boots on pavement, and the furnace trucks evoke a plausible, oppressive world with minimal exposition. The final image of ash scattered into the gallery’s “vanishing light” elegantly recharges the setting as both physical space and thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken city, sewer-throat, silt layers, and half-drained library district are vivid, sensorial, and tightly filtered through Orin’s priorities, especially when he names each layer for a lie. Environment and tools (the auger, pipes, broken spire) constrain tactics and make the search physically and conceptually legible. The world’s rules—plague, pumping, salvage—feel internally consistent without over-explanation. It falls just shy of the very top band because weather and physical risk in the waterlogged ruin could pressure choices even more directly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “velvet library in autumn” is richly and economically evoked—the cold windows, warm rugs, borrowed cases, and dust-memo imagery create a distinct, lived-in space. The setting is filtered through Mara’s sensibility, so the library’s archival quiet and institutional presence echo the themes of preservation and erasure. The zither as a handled object and the final hush in that specific room charge the ending image rather than feeling like postcard description. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it meaningfully inflects tone, stakes, and the final verdict-like silence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.2)
    The rusted greenhouse and collapsed rail yard are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a chef and gardener. Setting constrains and enables choices—hidden from the Ministry, glass for skylights, bent ribs for the tree to tangle, patrol lights sweeping outside while a luminous garden grows within. The final image of the pruned tree as an open canopy inside this ruin powerfully charges the theme of beauty-as-defiance. Environmental detail is economical yet rich, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific, from “nectar dusk” at the tollbooth to thunder nets and jars of storm charge in the tower. World rules around the lightning collection tower and drone hives are clear enough to feel lived-in without bogging the story down. Crucially, place and objects constrain choices: the tower is the only plausible destination; the queen core and its sap seal dictate the method of resolution. The final images of lit street lamps and revived drones directly arise from and recharge these environmental details.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    The quiet bay, streetlights, tide line, and empty houses are vivid and filtered through Mara’s sensibility; they never feel like generic scenery. The orris shard and house interiors function as micro-settings that constrain her tactics (she can only sense and “sanctify” by moving through specific rooms and objects), and the storm/blackout forces the pivotal communal gathering into the Alderwick House. World rules around “aliveness” remain consistent and are learned through her experiments rather than exposition. The final image at the tide line, with hush spreading “like cool fragrance” over the street, is inseparable from this spatial and atmospheric groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater garden and ruined city are vividly particular (“salt roses grew from broken mosaics,” algae as curtains) and consistently filtered through Ilyan’s perception. Environment isn’t just backdrop; structural cracks, pressure-buckled hinges, and the submerged nursery dictate his path and tactics and become the literal means of accessing truth. The recurring objects/places (garden, crack, altar) all reappear charged with new meaning by the end, with the city itself feeling like a body whose weaknesses are being threaded. Setting logic is internally consistent, and the final ascent with the corded path behind him is powerfully environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The staircase, landings, and machine are vivid and conceptually tight—“boundless confinement made architecture” is both atmospheric and rule-setting. The environment constrains options (no top or bottom, only the current landing) and forces the protagonist toward internal rather than spatial escape. Objects-as-setting (dice, notebook, wheel) are integrated into action and final image. The surreal but consistent physics of the space deepen theme without causing confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vivid and functionally integrated—smog explains the greenhouse and moon dependence, and the rooftop glass becomes the literal canvas for language and memory. Saffron crocuses, citrus trees, and toxic dawn couriers all feel concretely lived-in rather than decorative. Environment constrains tactics (they need a clean moonbeam and glass panes) and charges the final image of the glowing rooftop. A touch more tactile interaction with the greenhouse (e.g., physical discomforts, maintenance) in the active beats could add even more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto city, waterfall, museum, and ice-door are richly specific and consistently filtered through Maris’s sensibility (smell of clover replaced by wet stone and rosewater, museum lamps and kilns as tools). Environment and recurring objects constrain choice—waterfall spray creates the ice door; the kiln and bread become the method of thaw; dampness, mold, and confined caverns shape both tactics and mood. World rules feel coherent without exposition, and sensory detail balances visual, olfactory, and tactile impressions. The setting decisively charges the final image (thunder, damp boots, steam and scent under the waterfall) so it’s thematically integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rocky island lighthouse, receding tide, barnacled flats, and lantern room are all tactile and specific, and they’re used as constraints (low-tide window, climb, isolation) rather than mere backdrop. The hunger stone and yoyo function as environment-charged tools that literally shape options and the final image. Weather/sea state underpins the ticking clock and closure (“traced the retreating sea and then the returning tide”). A slight reason this doesn’t crack 9+ is that the external environment could bear one more direct, tactical effect on his choices in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated: fungus-bloomed mirrors, squealing rubber tiles, and coffin-like photo booths all mirror and channel the protagonist’s curse. The environment directly shapes tactics—the Hall of Snapshots and powered booth are not wallpaper but the mechanism of both danger and solution. The setting’s grotesque atmosphere amplifies and constrains her choices, framing the advisor’s voice and the final act in the booth. The last image—the funhouse going dark “as if even the shadows had lost interest”—charges the environment into a resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is striking and integral: the driftwood orchard, bell buoy, kelp roots, and shipping lanes all materially constrain tactics and furnish instruments. Weather and sea state are not mere backdrop but active pressures that shape choices (reading gusts, matching wind pulses, riding eddies), and the final image under pear leaves with the mallet ties environment directly to character and theme. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—“sky began to bruise,” “fruit thudding like drumbeats”—without feeling like a tourist catalog. The world rules are clear enough that the surreal premise feels lived-in rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and under constant narrative pressure: the fossilized turtle shells aren’t just backdrop but the medium of her mapping and the literal substrate of the mystery. Environmental features (spiral streets, fractures, cisterns, rusted gate, salt light) all inform tactics and discoveries, and the final image of a mirrored turtle-city beyond the gate beautifully recharges earlier details. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. This is near top-tier setting work, only slightly shy of transcendent because atmosphere sometimes outpaces direct experiential stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station, ivy, and rosebush are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s sensibility (“nameboards looked like graves with green hair”). The overgrown, disused space and hidden ivy directly motivate why this meeting can occur here and resonate with the theme of buried history and enforced silence. The final return to the bare rosebush and cold wind meaningfully charges the closure image. A touch more interaction with the physical environment in the negotiation itself could push this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The riverside and submerged pavilion are sensuously and specifically rendered—mist, silt “boiling up like smoke,” tilting pillars, weed-curtains—always filtered through Lira’s surveyor’s and daughter’s eyes. Environment meaningfully constrains choices: the raised drawbridge governs timing and escape routes; the half-drowned structure dictates how she navigates, hides, and manipulates silt to blind Beran. Recurring objects-as-setting (the inkwell, lantern, foundation stones) tangibly charge the final image of hidden words binding pavilion and memory. The density of detail is high but earns its place by continuously informing mood, movement, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library is richly and efficiently realized—the “pale tunnel through silted water,” collapsed shelves, drifting paper, and sediment all read as specific and lived-in. Environmental factors (darkness, flickering headlamp, currents tugging the suit, soggy catalog) subtly shape how she moves, searches, and decodes. The lighthouse stamp and toppled globe deepen atmosphere and theme without feeling like museum-tour details. While the setting could impose even sharper tactical constraints, it already feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings are vividly and economically rendered—the floating tea garden, skittering ink-fish shadows, and the glass basilica all feel specific, sensorial, and purposeful rather than touristic. Environment meaningfully constrains and charges choices: the descending-while-ascending stair produces vertigo that echoes her emotional unease, the basilica’s crystal apparatus shapes the method of retrieval, and the tea garden’s mobility ferries her into the plot. Recurring objects (lantern, cranes, dream-gem, shadow-bird) act as micro-settings that decisively charge the final image. A small fraction of the descriptive richness edges toward decorative rather than tactical, which holds this just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory, ash-colored sea, and bruised clouds are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: drift, thrusters, balloon valves, and altitude all shape what’s possible. The geode and waveguide function as micro-setting/tools that constrain his options and charge the final vision of the alternate wedding branch. Environmental details feel filtered through a traumatized scientist’s eye rather than touristic, with the weather and physical platform directly affecting the clock and tactics. This is atmospheric and functional, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vivid and specific—the stones “drinking” light, soot-dark lenses, the slit in the dome, the secret masonry notch—and these details constrain and enable action (the slit allows drone use; the notch hides the passage; the observatory houses the fonts and tuner). The description is filtered through character and purpose, not static tour-guide prose. The motif of “brilliant dimness” and dusk ink infuses both atmosphere and thematic charge, especially when the dimness “brighten[s] from within” at the end. Setting is integral to both plot mechanics and final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt terrace, bruised-ink sea, and forgotten shore are vivid yet selective, always tied to emotional or narrative stakes rather than decorative. The driftwood-carving shore functions as an alternative archive whose rules drive plot, and the terrace wind threatening to take the watch hand physically pressures her confession moment. Recurring sea and shoreline imagery subtly mirror the story’s concern with what gets carried, buried, or washed back. The final plan to return the watch hand to the carvings charges place as an instrument of restitution, satisfying the object-as-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fort, parapet, mist, and crack in the stones are not just atmospheric; they concretely stage neutrality and the knife-edge tension of the meeting. Weather and height shape behavior (hushed voices, careful movements on the “knife edge”), and the crack becomes a literalized border everyone fears to cross wrongly. The micro-setting detail of the drawer pull as a tool in this harsh environment deepens the contrast between home and war. The final image of the boy stepping “onto Ridge ground” with that domestic object is charged by all the prior environmental framing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal town, eelgrass shallows, utility poles, and squall all feel lived-in and integrated with his tactics—he literally navigates by poles and hugs calmer water. The astronomical compass functions as a tool-as-setting, constraining his inner work at pole seventy-two and charging the final museum sequence. Weather and shoreline shape his options (inland vs open water), and the gleaming poles in the last image reweight the environment with his new stance. Sensory detail leans a bit more conceptual than physical in places, but the world remains coherent and pressure-relevant throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The world is vivid and purposeful, from rain-soaked city streets to the “bioluminescent lake” that “answered by turning on.” Setting repeatedly constrains and guides choice—the labyrinth’s quoted placards literally dictate paths, and the lake at the climax “like a jury” charges the moral stakes. Details are filtered through a noir-tinted, tech-noir sensibility without devolving into generic cyberpunk gloss. The recurring objects (newspapers, baseball, lake) all participate in the final moral calculus, not just in atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fairy-tale orchard and permanent moonlight are not mere backdrop: they supply the spices, the oldest tree as corridor, and the rules by which bridges between life and death operate. Environmental specifics (star anise bowls, bruised cardamom, moonlight thickening like milk, blossoms showing “small, private universes”) are vivid, POV-filtered, and recur to charge the final image and scent the world with the ritual’s consequence. The setting directly constrains tactics—this bridge can only be conjured here, this way—which elevates its role. Atmosphere and worldbuilding are tightly interwoven with stake and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting and objects are vividly rendered and structurally crucial: the linen tablecloth, cracked saucer, sigh-stair, and vapor-tree all both image and constrain choice. The midnight glade above the clouds changes what is possible (she must tether herself, negotiate with the tree) and charges the final domestic image when the cloth reappears on the kitchen table. Worldbuilding is efficient and consistent, teaching its rules through action (cartomancy, onyx ink, labeled pouches) rather than exposition. The recurring crack motif—saucer, tablecloth, scar—exemplifies environment-as-meaning at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The recycled spaceship Orison is vividly particular—patched hulls, municipal scrap, chapel remnant, solar-tile panels—and the environment meaningfully constrains tactics (limited oxygen, welded hatch, narrow chapel space). Micro-settings and objects (archive of photos, hydroponic bay, maintenance hatch, quilt, vial) are tightly integrated and recur to charge the final image of a mist-corridor and stitched-silver sky. The world’s rules (spin gravity, joy-lightness, tears as dimensional seams) remain consistent and are learned through Mara’s goal-directed activity. Setting and atmosphere strongly support the ghostly, devotional tone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is lush and purposeful: black sand, active volcano, double moons, and the mineral-threaded lava tube all feel lived-in and distinct, with details filtered through Amina’s sensibility. Environment shapes choice and outcome—the exposed stone path, the cave, falling ash, and the lava meeting the sea—so it’s not just postcard backdrop. The bottled lightning bugs function as a micro-setting object that literally lights the way and thematically charges the ending. Occasionally the descriptive richness verges on decorative, but it rarely stalls momentum and consistently supports atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich and functional: the luminous fort, blackout city, Archive Door, Cradle of Sparks, and half-painted sundial all constrain or enable specific tactics. The environment shapes choices—the blackout blinds Overseers, the terrace lamps and sundial shadow enable coded communication, and the fort’s locks and corridors determine how the revolution must proceed. Details are purposeful and filtered through the sentinel’s professional eye (“brass tumblers nested like sleeping birds,” “ring of raw wood”). The final image of an intact fort with secretly claimed locks and an empty Cradle of Sparks is strongly charged by the established setting.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frictionless world, tidal bluff under aurora, and sliding sea are not just pretty; they dictate tools (rope harness, iron pegs, sledge), movement (“move like skaters on dry stone”), and the central ritual on the “water that behaved like glass.” The aurora and star dust interaction is a functional map, not decorative, and the bluff’s sheer danger explains his isolation and methods. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned via action. The final image—borrowed dawn, helix, sea door, and recovered rope—feels inextricable from this specific setting.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit observatory above the cloud sea is vividly rendered and never ornamental: the storm, height, and darkroom all shape what is physically possible and emotionally charged. Environmental details (“domes wet as black pearls,” “roof slit,” thunder rolling under us) are consistently filtered through the poet’s sensibility. The setting constrains the entire method of resistance (photographic plates, timed exposures) and charges the final image of carrying “measured light” back into the city. World rules feel internally consistent and learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with action: the sundial enables the puzzle and the atrium’s duel strip governs tactics. The brook’s potential to become a river meaningfully charges the final revelation, tying atmosphere to stakes. World-building details (civic art, council anthem, mechanical arm tech) feel selective and coherent rather than touristic. The setting could impinge a bit more tactically on the duel itself, but it already functions as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is richly specific and always doing work: the old penitentiary corner, the mildew-prone prison library, and especially the “rusted library under stars” whose roofless state literally exposes them and symbolically fulfills Mara’s dream. The coffee tin, cracked planters, bent shelves, and plywood OPEN sign all function as environmental constraints or tools that shape tactics rather than as static décor. The city’s riots and sirens, and the contrast between lockdown and open ruin, saturate the atmosphere and support the theme without slipping into generic dystopia. The final image of two libraries—one locked, one roofless—mutually rebuilding is powerfully grounded in place.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal arbor, cloud-tides, and arbor heartwood room are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Lio’s musical and temporal obsessions. Setting is not postcard: the arbor’s hollow trunk and condemned projection room directly enable the hidden-map device, and the heartwood room’s stillness materially tempts him with refuge from time. Recurring tools-as-setting (compass rack, clock, piano) constrain choices and charge the final image of the calm compasses and revived clock. World rules (reversing cloud-tides, flickering navigation) stay stable and enrich atmosphere without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: the ancient ridge in bloom, salt air, orchids and stone lilies, and monsoon weather create a coherent, sensorially rich environment. The ridge’s height and blooming behavior materially matter—it’s chosen as a place to plant the seed so the monsoon can’t wash memory away, and its blooms mirror collective dreams. Environmental elements like the jars (rainwater, ash, breath) and the ridge’s warmth/cool mist interface constrain the ritual choices. The final image—the young tree on the ridge listening through the storm—depends entirely on the environmental logic established.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—“kelp and wet basalt,” rain beads on cedar, the lagoon’s banded colors—and these details are filtered through the narrator’s regret, not as neutral scenery. Environment and objects (islet, reef, ghost ship, compass, bonsai) constrain choice by steering the character physically and emotionally to the Wanderer and to the pruning act. Weather and sea imagery echo and deepen the inner state without feeling purely decorative. This level of sensory control and integration is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are evocative ("morning frost," "singed hair"), creating a vivid visual texture. However, the setting's physical reality is broken by the magical logistics of the canyon furnace, treating the environment as a malleable backdrop rather than a true constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, using tactile and visual precision ("panes iced from within," "frost flowers") to effectively substitute for sound. The atmosphere is cohesive and evocative, grounding the fantastical heat-mapping premise in a tangible, specific physical space. The environment actively shapes the mood and the "silence" is felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist; the "impossible spaces" and "drowned ribs" of the library actively constrain Marek's movement. The environment is not merely a backdrop but a physical pressure cooker that necessitates the story's specific surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details like the "warm clay smell," "chalk stars," and the specific "dull chime" of the bell effectively ground the fable-like tone in physical reality. The arbor serves as a consistent, meaningful anchor that evolves from a hiding spot to a stage for public declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, with the "twilight viaduct," "wisteria," and "fog" integrated tightly into the camera obscura metaphor. The physical environment actively shapes the visualization of the internal state (ribs as corridor), grounding the magical realism in specific, tangible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is an active participant that constrains the plot; the bridge's "dreaming in loops" necessitates the specific hyperbolic geometry of the maze. The contrast between the organic "tremor of green" and the archival "syrupy air" of the paper maze creates a distinct, pressure-filled atmosphere that shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific, successfully juxtaposing the carnival's "sunbleached plush" with the gravity of the seed vault. The atmosphere is palpable, though occasionally dampened by abstract descriptors ("hush of sleeping trees").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is an exceptional setting that physically manifests the themes of growth and ruin. The environment is active; the salt-tolerant roots and hull dust are utilized in the fabrication process, grounding the fantastical elements in concrete, tactile labor.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmospheric specificity is excellent; the "emerald station" and "green fire" create a cohesive, dream-like texture that supports the magic realism. The setting actively constrains the characters, with the specific door and lighting conditions dictating the timing of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is active and distinct, functioning as both a physical constraint (melting ice, sighing tiles) and a metaphorical echo of the protagonist's state ("ribs around an empty heart"). The shift from cold opacity to warm transparency is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and distinct, with strong sensory details like "iron shelves bled orange dust" and moths like "shredded film" anchoring the gothic-industrial tone. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist’s decayed sense of self, though the library's convenient preservation of specific production codes is a minor stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sensory environment is visceral and active; walls "sweating salt" and the "broken mosaics" ground the fantasy in tactile reality. The setting actively pressures the characters, with the storm and the fort's acoustics directly serving the central conflict and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sensory detail is exquisite and strictly filtered through the robotic POV (clicks of crystals, maintenance logs), turning the setting into an extension of character. The ice violin serves as a perfect micro-setting that constrains the central choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sensory details of the silent conservatory—the whispering stones, the texture of the tickets—create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that functions as a constraint on the characters. The physical props (lens, stubs) are integrated excellently as micro-settings that drive the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting acts as a constraint and a character; the maze's "rosemary and rot" and the specific interplay of light and shadow ground the abstract concept of measurable luck. The sensory details are precise and purposeful, with the physical environment of the garden directly shaping the ritual and the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is atmospheric and functional, with details like the "frost filmed" dome and "radiator grids" grounding the sci-fi elements. The environment actively constrains the climax on the roof, where the "magnetic lines" and twilight directly influence the repair action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional because it acts as both atmosphere and the primary mechanic; the floodwater is literally the tool used to decode the plot's central object. This integration of environment and agency (using the destructive element to create meaning) fulfills the high-band requirement where setting constrains choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is inextricably bound to the character's psychology; the weather station provides the lexicon (pressure systems, rime ice, fronts) for the emotional conflict. The botanical illustration and the "blue hour" serve as tangible anchors for the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is visceral and specific, with details like "wet iron," "throat of brick," and the "warm" beads grounding the supernatural elements. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, and the shift from the physical tunnel to the "ghost shift" is handled with excellent sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with tactile details like "moss stitched the shelves" and "sheen of old bone" grounding the metaphysical concepts. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the theme of decay-as-creation. The "obsidian refuge" and "black glass" river provide a stark, memorable contrast to the loam of the library.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; Sage Ridge and the "Dreaming Roots" are rendered with specific, sensory detail ("smelled of sage and cold sap," "dim blue hush") that actively shapes the atmosphere. The eclipse creates effective situational pressure, turning the grove into a "room without walls." The physical environment grounds the otherwise ethereal therapy session.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the silo's geometry acts as the compass that validates the "displaced axis." Specific details like the "concrete remembered the loom's rhythm" and the "sunlight poured through the warp" tightly integrate the physical environment with the central conflict, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.4)
    The lighthouse is not just a backdrop but a tactical tool; the beam's direction and the "groove like a stair" are essential to the plot's resolution. The atmosphere successfully blends noir spycraft with mythic fatalism ("single white tooth," "familiar enigma").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the basalt ring and the tactile nature of the sound (loops, vibrations) ground the metaphysical conflict. The artist's palette acts as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains the climax to a single choice. Score capped at 8.8 due to the Q2 global gate (closure requires higher felt cost for 9+).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but structural; the glass spire and the mirrored horizon are the active mechanical tools that enable the climax and resolution. The specific geometry of the memory map aligning with the ice creates an exemplary integration of place and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is utilized as a dynamic constraint rather than a backdrop; the "glowing viaduct" necessitates the gravity skills, and the "bead of water" acts as a visceral ticking clock. Sensory details like "boots ringing on wet glass" and "charcoal" clouds firmly anchor the surreal elements. The environment actively pressures the protagonist's choices throughout the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the tactile descriptions of sound ("vibrations thin under her boots," "skitter like startled mice") which ground the supernatural elements in the protagonist's POV. The cavern setting is not just a backdrop but an acoustic container that shapes the conflict. The atmosphere is cohesive, though the "turning seasons" bookends feel slightly ornamental compared to the visceral dampness of the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Atmosphere is exceptional; the "barometer ticking" and "wet match" similes ground the surreal elements in visceral sensory experience. The environment actively constrains choices (lateral movement through gaps) and charges the final image (the jasmine's calm vs. the watcher). The setting is not just a backdrop but a participant in the protagonist's tradecraft.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is integral to the action; the specific constraints of the "ultraviolet revealing" and the need for shallow breathing shape the protagonist's tactical choices. The sensory details of the conservatory effectively bridge the gap between the magical mechanism and the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frayed rope serves as an exceptional micro-setting and tool, acting as the physical interface for the metaphysical climax and meeting the 9+ standard for constraining choice. The grotto’s stratified clay walls mirror the thematic layering of time, integrating setting inextricably with the method of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "sunken orchard" and "glass ribs like a whale's skeleton" grounding the fable tone beautifully. The environment actively constrains the characters (speech feels rude in the hush), integrating atmosphere directly into behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is not just backdrop but the engine of the plot; the amber fumes and the grotto’s dusk create the physical constraints for the transformation. Specific details like "bottled honey" and the "chemist’s blotter petal" ground the fantasy in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with details like "salt and music" and the "library under stars" effectively supporting the fable-like tone. The environment feels lived-in and distinct, though the "breezy library" leans slightly into romanticization.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral, acting as a constraint that shapes the plot; the contrast between marsh reeds and crystal/obsidian is used effectively to drive the solution. Sensory details like the "fruit ringing softly" and "smell of rain on stone" ground the fable-like atmosphere in specific, tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Overgrown library, obsidian wall, and paper loam are tactile, odor-rich, and filter through the keeper’s archivist bias. The obsidian wall’s sound-drinking property directly shapes the final silence that reconfigures memory; micro-setting (swan creases) doubles as map, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sage Ridge is sketched via lived sense—cold sap smell, sharpened shadows under totality—yet every detail filters through Liora’s musical ear (pines as “low strings”). The Dreaming Roots micro-setting literally shapes the final acoustics that coax Mara’s hum; eclipse light change governs tempo choice. Proper-noun economy kept; no geography drift. Just shy of 9 because weather/eclipse physics is accurate but not quite constraining a later tactical choice—it’s more backdrop than lever.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The basalt ring, ash-blue well, and body-as-micro-setting constrain every tactic: only one color can be used, only one circle drawn. Sensory selection is urgent—“air felt like a cloth over a bell”—and filtered through Selo’s priestly perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, palm, stone, circle. The final image is charged by the palette’s single color repurposed as boundary, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell function as micro-settings that literally constrain gesture: mapping on glass, conducting silence at the sill, folding paper into shell curve.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern’s acoustic anatomy—dripping hush, mirrored echo, stone that drinks vibration—functions as both environment and tool, directly constraining tactics: Mara must conduct through the wall to re-introduce resonance. The antique phonograph’s brass horn and snapped needle act as micro-setting that charges the final image when the scored record becomes a blade. One minor drift: “seasons outside turning from dry to wet in a single scented breeze” edges toward atmospheric shorthand, but it’s brief and serves as causal confirmation that the filament has snapped.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jasmine, rain barrels, lantern-short light, and chlorine-rot grain create an olfactory-visual scorecard that guides stealth: the courtyard calm vs. warehouse stench signals hidden danger.

Final image of lanterns hung among resurrected vines recharges the opening “crystal shadows” with living light.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terra-cotta grotto is not backdrop; its collapsing strata directly enable the “uncovering layers” method that reweights time. Starlight on clay becomes the private sunset the poet needs to coax the beings into the rope. Micro-setting—the rope fibers pressed against geological bands—functions as the story’s laboratory bench. Spatial choreography stays exact: rope spread, knots traced, beings poured in, exit path preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is lived-in and choice-guiding: salt-dust on leaves dictates the raised-bed greenhouse, shipwrecks form a physical ring that funnels Mara inward, the cistern’s unrippling surface is both metaphor and plot lock. Sensory hierarchy is violinist-specific—sound before sight—so “glass ribs rise from tidal mud like a whale’s skeleton” arrives as haptic echo.

Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from crater rim to council fire to arbor interior.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rooftop canals, backward-flowing clay canal, throat-iron bars—each detail is tactile and choice-limiting. The pendant’s warming metal and the throat’s rising breath act as micro-settings that constrain timing. Final image of the child-shaped echo looking at the looped pendant recharges the opening sketch of brass in a specimen drawer. No sensory checklist; every detail either pressures action or reappears reweighted.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will Rin uncage the Echo-Forge without waking the Giant?”—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is measured in stolen heartbeats; each borrowed second visibly raises temperature and risk. The decisive tightening occurs when she withholds the resolving tap, trading certainty for access; the price is immediate (pendant white-hot, Giant stirring). Cost is legible and compounding, not abstract.

    Calcite trees, dripping stalactites, and fox-eye lenses are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lysa’s taxonomic gaze. The orchard’s spatial choreography stays coherent—ladder, mosaic, seam tracked without drift. Micro-setting (quartz shard) directly charges final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather and world rules remain consistent; no exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library infrastructure (ducts, atlas table, pipe chase) constrains every move; the flashlight, inhaler, and card are not props but environmental extensions that alter Lio’s path. Sapphire hush and copper smell recur with shifting emotional valence, charging the final image. Micro-setting (tin, tape shard) functions as mobile terrain that finally presses back against the skin. One hairline slip: the “eastern windows blued” line edges toward postcard, but it is immediately re-grounded by the child’s palm on metal.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Salt-rinsed air, gutter dripline, and the trellis’s wet crack function as micro-setting that actively steers her rebuilt design. The leaf itself becomes portable setting, constraining choice when its taste delivers foreign street-maps she can’t unknow. Storm season timeframe is tracked by sign-loosening and final loosening of her joints, locking atmosphere to body. One minor drift: “office” first appears unlocated, but greenhouse context repairs it within two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brinehook’s tidal causeway, ruined chapel, and sinkhole are tactile and selective; rain trails function as both setting and plot engine, constraining route choices. The cracked baptismal font and brackish reeds mirror the haggard awe tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and tools track across the chapel floor and sinkhole rim. Environment does not yet constrain the final image enough for 9+, but the cold mineral exhale of the sinkhole charges the compass activation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cave geography is threaded through action—crystals chime underfoot, overlapping shadows braid bodies—so setting actively constrains the final exorcism. Micro-setting (pearl, calcite pedestal) doubles as tool that channels intention. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to Sera’s listening POV; no white-room lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harbor’s wet salt, crushed lime, and rain-bright stones are filtered through Mara’s professional gaze; the corroded trumpet valve acts as micro-setting that ultimately constrains the final sounding. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from quay to bell tower. Weather (after rain) is used to affect footing and scent, never mere backdrop. One proper-noun anchor—“ivory harbor”—is reused efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Starlit vault, mist lanes, and tile-counting embed the body in tactile navigation; the phantom punch serves as micro-setting that constrains the honesty test. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual angles, smell of ink—mirrors Mara’s cartographic gaze without tourist excess. Environment actively guides the choice to kneel and descend; the final platform of silent stone is charged by prior arrow imagery. Meets 9+ gate: the punch-as-tool shapes the final tactic and image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower’s brass rail, ink-blotched pages, and moon-path on water constrain every writing turn; the pinned sheets become the final image. Whale breaches are timed to row-sums, merging sea and sky into one instrument. Micro-setting (cold ceramic tile pressed to palm) alters breath and handwriting pressure, charging the climax. Salt rust and ink smell thread every beat, never backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prismatic glass that “shifts as if trying to remember another spectrum” doubles as external terrain and psychic mirror; the hexagon of spinning prisms literally votes on his fate, so environment constrains the final choice. Sensory triage favors magnetics, ozone, salt-veined metal—selective, urgent. Spatial choreography is clean even during 90° tilts. The field of suspended farewells could use one more tactile anchor, keeping this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stainless table, drain gurgle, and disinfectant/roses fusion create an immediate, tactile crucible; every object (Mercy, toe tag, scalpel tray) is handled, not displayed. Spatial choreography stays clean—Mara pulls the ink from the towel rack, slides the tag, caps the pot—so bodies and props never float. The “formaldehyde inhale” as agents enter is a sensory tightening that mirrors stakes. Only the corridor outside remains a white hole, but the story never needs it; the prep room constrains every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fluorescent hum, cedar shavings, and lantern-moss bonsai are tactile constraints that shape Haru’s method and final insight. The maintenance-shed bulb literalizes the “indoor time” he must transcend; the lightning-scarred oak embodies silence as “pause waiting to be scored.” Environment directly governs his ability to chart and refract, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The container maze functions as micro-setting: its shifting corridors force the narrator to navigate by chalk ghosts and vocal texture, and the final corridor where he whispers names is spatially coherent and charged. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—diesel breath becomes burlap on skin, a whisper becomes wet silk—guiding both movement and emotional stakes. The tide clock is a lived constraint, not backdrop; it determines when 9H can be opened and when footprints vanish, directly shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Observatory, cliff, sea fog, and broken dome are not backdrop but instruments: the wind physically pushes his smile, the dome’s “eye” aperture forces the upward compass reorientation. Salt, varnish, rain smells layer into the cello’s hum, binding body to place. The micro-setting of the cello belly—“open like a held breath”—constrains the final listening act. Missing only a kinesthetic jolt: we never feel floorboards creak or telescope metal bite, keeping the score from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is filtered through Ira’s occupational eye—she notices hand signs, mooring lines, camera blind spots—so detail never feels touristic. The carnival’s physicality (lantern flash on quartz, swing-bridge confrontation) constrains tactics: graffiti can hide under bunting, decks can be unbolted. Micro-setting (the chip, the bridge) doubles as tool and symbol. One slip: “anchor pier” vs. “foundation stone” momentarily blurs which came first, but spatial choreography stays trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Summit geography is tracked without drift—gate, road, dome rim, crater shadow, wind drop—each spot licenses a specific act (tripod placement, strip priming, shared sky-gazing). The hourglass grain and iodine vials serve as micro-setting that constrains choice: pocketing the grain, waiting for color change. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—scorched pine, glitter of melted metal, hush sensed through birds and towers. Final image reuses the summit’s sleeping-eye dome to refract the theme of surveillance; no environmental detail is ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist, slate channel, and refracted light are not backdrop—they are tools Lio manipulates to measure and repair. The depot’s condensation system and the fountain create a micro-setting that literally enables the climax; remove the water-light apparatus and the repair logic collapses. Sensory selection is POV-true: sound of solder, warmth of beam on knuckles. Meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rusted outpost, cracked pane, and black-stone field are filtered through Riven’s cartographer gaze; every sensory pick (fogged glass, warm mist) doubles as survey data.

The final glowing pear recharges the setting-as-tool.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory triangulation—salt-kelp air, orchid perfume, dust on lashes—grounds every shift from sea to stone. The loom-shed, tide-scent, and ankle-high thread turn environment into tactile interface: characters navigate by smell and toe-touch rather than sight. Canyon walls “like waves frozen mid-crash” externalize the town’s stilled dread and later release. Micro-setting (ceramic plate warmed by moonlight) functions as portable map and emotional thermometer, constraining route choices until it becomes the final window-frame.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Catacomb-orchard is not backdrop: root corridors dictate excavation tactics, child-niches force escape route, clay from orchard beds becomes new mortar—setting constrains choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt dome, autumn wind, brass orrery, and eternal flame are never backdrop: the flame’s twin shadows literally reveal the chosen conspiracy route; the orrery’s half-tooth slip rewrites the lieutenant’s badge log. Sensory hierarchy obeys Liora’s chart-maker eye—starlight, thread tension, metallic smell of lamp oil—so every detail pressures choice. Micro-setting (linen over gears) functions as the pivot object that constrains the final sync.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mangrove roots “clasp ankles like questions,” the salt-filmed window, and the moon’s tactile polishing of stone all constrain action: she can’t move fast, must breathe on glass, must wait for light. The shard functions as micro-setting that evolves from weapon to reconciled token. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara notices wet, salt, song, not tourist geography. Spatial choreography is clean—skiff nudges roots, breath meets glass, hands exchange shard.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass-roof twilight, pond mist, and ink-blotted plaster create a micro-setting that literally steers choice: the atrium is neutral ground where both sides will sign a child’s arm. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lani’s translator ear—footsteps “like a prayer,” graphite blur, lotus-hearted ache—never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: gurney, chair, pond edge, radio corner all hold their places. The coral fragment functions as portable setting; its ridges mirror the cast’s labyrinth, charging the final grafting image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thick fog, splintered sheds, prism lamp, and linen-wrapped fragment are tactile anchors that constrain movement and enable light-painting.

Spatial choreography is clean: every clap, tap, and footstep is traceable across the garden geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse’s humidity as anti-surveillance tool is not just atmosphere—it disables the auditors’ lenses at the climax, so environment directly shapes outcome. Insect motion against mesh becomes punctuation, turning setting into syntax; the spiral of pinned butterflies is a mutable signboard that the POV (entomologist) can read and rewrite. Spatial choreography stays clean as retirees, students, and auditors move through fern aisles without drift or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shell’s calcium ribs, off-key wind, and pearl-colored cistern are tactile, selective, and directly constrain Mara’s path and song; the postcard-as-micro-setting charges the final image when its star-field dissolves into roots. One decimal off perfect only because plankton-drought causality is asserted, not witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library’s vitrified petals, upward fountain, and cloud surf are selective, tactile, and filtered through the caretaker’s custodial gaze. Environment directly constrains action: only the museum’s bamboo can repair the chime, forcing the crossing into the Hall of Apologies where “air sweet and poisonous” almost topples the lamp. The final image of cloudbanks rolling like “slow surf” recharges the opening altitude and signals an ongoing, living archive. Spatial choreography is clean—ladder, case, silk-wrapped join—and the recurring chime object alters tactical possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archive is not backdrop but instrument: cedar air, quartz lamp, sealed drawers that hiss when opened constrain how sound travels and vows are heard. Micro-setting—the ink well, tuning fork, snarled vellum—functions as geography inside the vault, determining ritual choreography. Weather (last summer storm) is more than mood; its rattling windows cue temporal urgency and acoustic cover. Only the brief corridor mention drifts toward white space, barely nicking the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The breathing volcano—warm vent, ash exhale—acts as living tool rack: the vent heats the slide, the ash cloud cloaks the accord. The antique chain is handled, measured, and finally transferred, its links constraining the gate settings. Spatial choreography is immaculate; only the mill owner’s spit lacks sensory follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)

    The ivy is not scenery; it hides the breach she slips through, muffles footfalls, and finally swallows the secret again. Ceramic plates in the vent chamber act as tuning forks, translating wind into ancestral speech—setting literally voices the dead. Spatial choreography is immaculate: fireplace → passage → bricked door → narrow chamber, each move tracked without drift. Environment constrains the final choice: only the ivy-covered ruin allows covert access to seal the vents undetected.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rain-slick prism parapet is returned three times, each time re-weighted: first as glittering bait, then as the mirror’s frame, finally as “ordinary stone” once grace is spent. Terrace acoustics and canal hush ground spatial orientation without cataloguing the city.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Terrace, bowl, smoke, and shifting-star mosaics are woven through action, not backdrop: the celestial line literally positions the parties, the bowl forces the sacrifice.

The camera-body tap and crate-as-music-stand show tools re-purposed by setting. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track wrists, lens angles, accordion bellows without drift. Final image—camera on rail beneath returning gulls—recharges every prior absence with audible quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment is never backdrop: warm air breathing from the ridge seam literally guides her body inside; obsidian steps force cautious descent that mirrors her slowing heartbeat. The canvas-on-frame in the central chamber functions as micro-setting—she scrapes it with the fragment, so the object’s texture alters the revelation pace. Ash flats, copper bird, clay hand mosaic—all filter through her pattern-seeking gaze, never tourist catalog. Final image of “volcano turned outward” reuses the geothermal motif to rewire her destructive gift into illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sound-wave garden, conductive lagoon, and drumming body form a single instrument that constrains every tactic: only tap-frequency can steer the hallucination.

The final solo night-return recharges the same gate, bench, and water as sacred relics now outside institutional ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The container labyrinth is never described in bulk; instead we get “alleys that still breathed,” seams that “carry whispers like gutters,” and the slit where the brass key nests—details that matter because they enable the climax. Geomagnetic storm is more light-show than physics, but it freezes cranes and radios, so it passes the “affects choice” test. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track Mara from hatch to ARIES to conduit to SCORPIO/CANCER to LIBRA without drift.

Environment is not backdrop; it is the tool that makes the final image possible, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and mist-drenched street are filtered through Eli’s tactical attention—every sensory note (ore tug, star hush, paper squares) constrains timing and concealment. The magnetic walls literally set the metronome; the mist amplifies quiet, enabling stealth. Spatial choreography stays clean from cliff path to council steps. One tiny gap: the exact distance between grotto and town is elastic, but it never affects choice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Sublittoral fringe” and “knee-deep belt of green water” are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly constrain the action of wading out to unshackle. The disappearing island’s coral roots lifting from sand is an image that reconfigures the world in the final beat. One hairline slip: the exact distance of the skiff relative to the swimmer at night is momentarily fuzzy, but it never breaks spatial clarity enough to dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Turbine shadows as “slow clock hands,” the cedar shavings “pale ribbons,” and the goat’s warm milk splatter anchor every beat; the fence-post becomes the charged micro-setting that constrains the final gesture, passing the 9+ gate.

    Glass concourse filmed with dust and confetti, dry fountain smelling of cold metal, skylight frames braiding shadows—each tactile detail is filtered through Lina’s civil-engineer gaze and either enables or records her retrofit. The terminal itself functions as tool: roof gutters become intake, tile map becomes schematic, balcony arc becomes sextant’s missing curve. Environment constrains every move—she wedges carnival signposts as downspouts, reroutes cistern to cool transmitter—so the final beacon is inseparable from the place’s physical logic. One hairline slip: “constellation” reflection inside windows is pretty but not grounded in a measurable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stone, cedar, lichen, and quartz are filtered through an ex-clockmaker’s eye—gear-care motion describes the bear-bandaging, not generic tenderness.

One hairline slip from 9.0: spatial choreography inside the underground hall is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nebula Garden is no backdrop: drifting petals meter narrative time, condensed-starlight wall blocks sight and forces sonar tactics, glassy-bark observatory supplies the decisive exchange. Gear-as-micro-setting constrains action—teeth must spin against stone to become map. Sensory triage favors touch and hearing under violet haze, matching POV’s trained engineer-sentimentalist bias. Spatial choreography is clean: moth flight, boulder dodge, wall approach, observatory entry track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse glass sweating after heat, vines swallowing benches, butterfly weight trembling ribbons—each detail is filtered through Jonas’s carver-eye and finally constrains the memorial design; the dusk river flats remain slightly generic, keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)

Micro-setting (folded sackcloth, broken clock flag) anchors each beat without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen lake, obsidian spire, and wind-cut measurements are not backdrop but data sources that constrain the model and thus the charter. The kingfisher quill recurs as both tool and tactile reminder of risk, its blue-barred flash charging the final dip. Spatial choreography is immaculate: threshold, chart room, shore loop, threshold again. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and final image—no 9+ only because the salt-shed locations are named, not walked, so the micro-setting’s bodily pressure is slightly less visceral than the abstract grid.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Soot drifting “like snow,” the coal-breathing tin, and the archive loft’s reused paper create tactile scarcity that constrains Mara’s methods. The ember alcove returns at climax, its glow unlocking the black cloth—setting actively reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quiet bay, salt-grass, and lantern-lit interiors are filtered through Mara’s scent-oriented perception; orris and cedar carry plot function, constraining her choices like a dowsing rod. Weather (storm blackout) forces the communal climax, proving environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting—the orris shard in her pocket—literally charges the final image. One hairline slip: “streetlights daydream” is lovely but re-used three times without re-weighting, a faint static echo.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Salt roses, cracked dome ribs, and algae curtains are filtered through Ilyan’s lamp-lit urgency; every sensory note guides the next move—crack location, door yield, ampoule cradle. The garden’s pressure-forced architecture literally shapes tactics: structural weaknesses become the only path. Final image of “every empty fountain a throat” re-weights the city from ruin to witness. Micro-setting (foxglove-stained ampoule) charges the closing beat; only the surface court remains off-stage, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The staircase’s recursive geometry and the brass wheel’s click are tactile constraints that shape tactics—he climbs because the steps supply the energy his expectation feeds back into.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Waterfall mist, kiln heat, and rosewater steam interleave to create a living climate that directly enables the thaw tactic. The emerald lens acts as micro-setting: its green circle literally refracts what power wants to sell, guiding Maris’s clandestine moves. Spatial choreography is clean—ice door, alcoves, stage left, exit tunnels—bodies move without ghosting. Only the beekeeper’s absence is asserted, not sensed, a minor blank.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Low-tide geography, barnacled flats, and the lantern’s cracked lenses are tactile and POV-filtered. The hunger stone and yoyo function as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual; removing either collapses the climax. One hairline slip: “weed-dark water” mixed with “teeth of stone” is nearly mixed-metaphor but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is not postcard backdrop; the fungus-breathing mirrors and flash-bulb "swollen like a maggot" actively narrow options and supply the only tool that can defeat the curse. Micro-setting—the twisted-swan clasp pressed to skin—functions as the hinge that reconfigures the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → Hall of Snapshots → Tilted Corridor → booth, each zone feeding the next beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: taste of pennies, squeal of rubber, cold perfume, then the burn of the flash—details selected, not inventoried.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating orchard is not postcard exotic; its kelp-rooted trunks and iron bell buoy supply the very materials that become the orchestra, constraining every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—Leeward notices cloud notes before color, barrels before pears—keeping description purposeful. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the squall: spar arcs, ropes catch, bell hammered in wind-time. Micro-setting (the cracked chest, tarred mallet head) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate; only the slightest over-adorning of “bruise” for sky keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kel Varo’s nautilus streets and fossil-turtle pavers are never backdrop; the fracture Lira traces literally steers her to the cistern stair. Salt light, reed dust, and rust petals are filtered through cartographer perception, so every sensory note doubles as map data. The mirrored city at the end reuses the turtle-shell motif, turning setting into recursive code—an image that constrains the final choice. Only the watchers remain slightly generic silhouettes, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy-choked station is not backdrop; its hidden alcove enables the clandestine meeting and the ivy literally screens them from street view, constraining their tactical choices. The rosebush’s bareness recharges the opening image at the end, reweighting the city’s cycle of silence. Sensory selection (cold wind threading the ivy, lamp by the ticket window) is filtered through Mara’s archival gaze. Micro-setting—the oilcloth satchel handled twice—functions as the story’s mobile “room” and charges the final transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned pavilion is not backdrop but antagonist: weed-curtains snag oars, trapped air pockets dictate lantern flutter, silt clouds blind Beran. Micro-setting of the brass inkwell—warm against ribs—charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; every oar-stroke, pillar, and stone stack is trackable. Environment literally constrains the final choice: only by wedging the note underwater can she guarantee mortar will entomb it.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sunken library constrains every move: silted water slows gesture, velvet rot limits safe grip, headlamp tunnel narrows perception. The card catalog’s scrambled order directly forces the indexing tactic that cracks the code. Micro-setting (stamp in velvet rot) becomes the hinge object. Environment is never backdrop; it shapes tactics and final image of the “new lantern inside.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating tea garden, mirrored priests, and glass basilica are sketched with scent and prismatic light, but the micro-setting is the lantern itself—its brass throat, gem lens, and final projection—whose evolving states constrain every tactical choice. The basilica’s spinning isle and gravity-defying stair are not decorative; they gate entry and later echo Mira’s disorientation. Environment directly shapes the climax: the crystal dais focuses the dream and literally splits her.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating observatory is no postcard: groaning balloon skin, cracked glass, cooling relays—each item constrains action or signals time. Ash-colored sea and bruise-clouds externalize internal state without overt symbolism. Micro-setting of cracked waveguide & hand-built coil turns geode from memento into calibration tool that alters tactics. Spatial choreography clean: knees, workbench, screen, thruster controls track throughout; environment reacts to perturbation pulses.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory stones “drink the last light and give it back as brilliant dimness” fuses sight and paradoxical concept in one stroke; every later gleam—lantern circle, brass case, copper coil—echoes that first alchemy. The broken dome slit literally shapes how the drone exits and where star trails point, so setting constrains action. Micro-setting (matrix drawers, wall notch) supplies the final puzzle piece. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual, some metallic clink—but selective economy suits the twilight hush.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt terrace, bruised-ink sea, and wind-buffeted rail actively pressure the final confession; the watch hand and driftwood dolphin function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory selection narrows to salt air, ticking, and the grooved wood—details filtered through Mara’s guilt-sharpened attention. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies track from balustrade to rail to descending steps. The shore’s carvings evolve from archive to communal grave, reweighting the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mist-wet parapet crack functions as micro-setting that literally guides the exchange step; the brass handle acts as embodied “setting” constraining the wire-removal tactic.

The final image of steaming sand where "lava met the sea with a hiss that was almost applause" charges the entire thematic ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is filtered through the POV’s professional eye: brass tumblers “nested like sleeping birds,” the sundial’s “ring of raw wood,” the fort’s skin “glowed alone like a wink.” Each detail doubles as tool and metaphor, guiding the hand that picks it. The blackout compresses perception to immediacies—sound of tumblers, slit of lantern light—so environment actively constrains choice. The final image of daylight returning on a neutrally-guarded fort recharges every prior glow and shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frictionless bluff under aurora is not postcard scenery: the inability to grip stone mandates the harness, dictates Eren’s sliding gait, and charges the final walk on glassy sea. Painted rocks, meteor plates, and dust map function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Sensory selection skews to shimmer, slip, and silence—matching precognitive flashes. Environment and recurring objects jointly charge the ending image: the revealed rope and rocks re-anchor both setting and conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stormlit observatory is no postcard: wet domes “black as pearls,” the building “suspended as if the mountain had been cut free,” and the timer dial as “small altar” all constrain ritual action. The telescope, glass plate, and timer form a micro-setting triad that literally shapes the poet’s tactic—stop exposure mid-bloom. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, enter, load plate, snap dial. Environment charges the final image: dawn sky “scrubbed raw” mirrors the poet’s stripped stance. Meets 9+ gate: the timer/tool constrains the decisive choice and reappears in the closing metaphor of measured light.

Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome or generic placeholders.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The subway utility tunnel isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its isolation enables Mara’s role, its acoustics shape how voices travel, and its liminality mirrors her emotional state. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting—its grooves, sound, and physical handling directly charge the climax. Sensory details (sweating rust, sodium hum, train rumbles) are filtered through Mara’s professional familiarity, never touristy. The recurring streetlamp hum ties surface and tunnel, making the final imagined image of Lena walking above feel spatially and emotionally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.4)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its planks pulse with “living record,” barnacles hide evidence, and spatial choreography (steep path up, lantern light) guides action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s archivist priorities—tannin smells, paper-hiss reeds, riverbed-dark ink. Final image ties environment to theme: sea smells of “walnuts and wet paper,” merging natural and archival textures. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ivy-swallowed station functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: neutrality permits unrecruited meetings, baggage room houses the altar-like suitcase, platform becomes stage for emergent community. Sensory detail is selective (“wind pushed paper tickets,” “gray as ash and oddly warm”) and filtered through the narrator’s urgency. The moon rock’s warmth/coolness charges the final image, and spatial choreography remains coherent as characters move from platform to baggage room to shared departure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.6)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting: its pressure-of-sound above hearing constrains Iris’s movement (she reads air-currents like raised ink), and the observatory stone channels her brother’s panic into actionable language. The platinum ring and vellum are tools that charge the final image—Iris traces the pool by touch alone, mapping currents without borders. Sensory hierarchy reflects her blindness: scent, vibration, temperature dominate; visual details serve only when filtered through others’ perception (“ordinary to sighted travelers”). Environment, body, and object cohere as inseparable navigational instruments.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as both setting and constraint—it pools time, bends signals, compresses light—and directly shapes Mara’s method and stakes. The dried fountain pen acts as micro-setting: its bent nib forces physical and conceptual recalibration. Final image of stars shifting constellations charges closure by showing cosmic approval of modest human repair. Every detail serves pressure or theme—no white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    The harbor isn’t backdrop but active collaborator: moonlight enables visual precision for signing, foghorn failure creates the rare emptiness to capture, and dock rhythms sync with the accordion. The vintage camera and bollards anchor spatial choreography, while “floating commas” of lanterns mirror textual structure. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the quay’s acoustics and social density shape how silence is mapped. Final image (camera on rail) charges the entire environment as an altar of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ash flats, basalt ridge, and obsidian steps aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. The archive’s “ribs of a patient beast” and warm-breathing seam fuse setting with theme, while the tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting, enabling decryption and final action.

Spatial choreography remains precise: perching opposite across water, ripples breaking mirrors, feet dangling above liquid.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.4)
    The container labyrinth isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource: alleys “breathe,” seams carry whispers, grating reveals identity, and the acoustic conduit enables survival. Sensory hierarchy shifts with pressure (aurora light on zodiac coin vs. thunder during whisper). Tools (folded maps, brass key) and body (footfall recognition) function as micro-setting, directly shaping tactics. Final image—Mara refolding maps as the maze “listens”—charges the environment with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt dock, oil-slicked canal, and crooked shutters aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable: the wet boards reflect starlight, the shutters become an instrument, the water hides then reveals. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (petals on oil, silt on tongue), filtered through the girl’s guilt and the guardian’s precision. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, its reflective surface altering perception and action. Final image charged by environment: starlight fractures into a net that coaxes darkness to shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.4)
    The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and mist-stained windows aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge. The grotto’s ore aligns pieces like a metronome; the library’s “amplified quiet” shapes Eli’s method. Final image—windows as chessboard forming a tree—is inseparable from setting. Sensory hierarchy (sound swallowed, mist as watery stars) reflects POV urgency without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s where barnacles bite, chains are found, and transformation occurs. Coral roots lifting, knee-deep green water, and whale breath charge the closure. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven: “lantern shaking,” “iron links running into the dark,” “hair streaming like kelp.” The scrimshaw’s warmth and etching (“whale eye and a keyhole”) recur with evolving meaning, directly enabling the climax. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves tactic or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    The wind turbines are not backdrop but active constraint—they dictate the protagonist’s shut windows, shape Orin’s bow, and become “distant surf” through reframed perception. The dried bouquet and cedar bird function as micro-settings that charge the closure when wedged into the fence post. Sensory detail is selective (papery petals, pale ribbons of cedar) and filtered through grief’s narrowed attention. The farmhouse’s isolation under rotating shadows mirrors internal desolation without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the blue light deepens as carvings melt, the mist threads between ribs, and the quartz hum vibrates through boots. These details shape Lira’s tactics—she reads, taps, speaks—and culminate in the final image where setting and self dissolve together. The “lantern-moth hush” isn’t mood but physics: sound folds like wings, enabling whispers to unmake decrees. Environment charges every choice and the ending’s vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.6)
    The glassblower’s courtyard functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: flagstone fractures guide Mara’s spiral, hanging chimes respond to the reed tongue, and potted plants become syntax. Sensory detail is exquisitely filtered through Mara’s POV—she notices soot in Joren’s beard, tremors in his hand, not hues. The ash-and-resin atmosphere mirrors the thematic tension between destruction and renewal. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the vibrating chimes reveal “shades of wrong that feel strangely right,” tying environment directly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: velvet baffles, copper throats, and prism bells shape what can be heard and saved. The soot-clouded lens becomes a focal tool that literally and metaphorically concentrates meaning. Final image—“golden shadows pooled around the soot lens”—charges the closure with visual and conceptual weight. Sensory detail (glass prisms breaking silence into colors) is purposeful, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.6)
    The observatory functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its brass instruments, untarnished and timeless, constrain choice by offering only symbolic tools (stencil, meteorite filings) rather than real solutions. The curtains of intention physically shape Mara’s actions—she must pull them into a corridor to align light. The final image of the sprout rising under starlight is charged by the setting’s rules, making environment inseparable from closure. Sensory detail (cool stone, muted glow, inked petals) serves pressure, never stalls it.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting: its wet stone smell, beams, and glass ceiling directly constrain choices (measuring distances, aligning sketches) and charge the final image.

Body-as-setting is masterful—the bandaged abdomen aligns with coffee rings, the scar becomes both wound and map. Dawn light evolves from hush to active participant, illuminating rings and sealing the miracle’s return. Final rooftop and pavement crack are spatially coherent extensions of the tower’s vertical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: Mara maps emotions to physical coordinates, incubates film on lamp housing, projects onto wall as ritual space. Sensory specificity—grease-pencil hands, sprocket clatter, rain on roof—grounds the metaphysical in tactile reality. The booth expands spatially only after emotional breakthrough, proving environment shapes cognition. Final image of “quivering rectangle of light” reweights all prior description as sacred container.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Sel must rest beneath it to sync breath with sky, and the vault seam opens “below” its stones. The astrolabe-as-tool charges the final image—placed on birch bark crossings, it warms the stones. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: stardust tastes like “grit,” creativity knocks as “pressure,” auroras shift from green to violet. Every environmental element (arch, vault, meteors) alters tactics or outcome; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glowing dune functions as micro-setting: its “occasionally everywhere” physics constrain the guard’s tactics (sparks vanish when blinked at) and charge the final image (auditors’ boots dull its glow). Sensory detail is purposefully skewed—visual luminescence dominates, reflecting the guard’s freight-watch priorities—but touch (“glassy ember seeds”) and sound (“hummed in my bones”) deepen immersion. The chess clock and bloom dune recur with evolving meaning, never static. Environment directly enables the climax: only here can wave functions split the guard to reroute crates and plant seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.6)
    The mechanical rainforest isn’t backdrop but active crucible: brass leaves refract logic, ironwood lattices groan paradox, fan-palms laugh answers.

The cathedral of root-gears culminates in a setting that charges closure: turning the crank shifts wind from metal to rain-on-skin, proving perception has transformed. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-filtered; no museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shingle beach, fog, veiled ridgeway, and scree slope aren’t backdrop but active constraints: fog obscures, scree demands careful descent, bracken hides the dog, and the tide swallows footprints—each shaping choice. The lantern, oilskins “faded to moonlit kelp,” and star-stamped punch fuse object and environment into a coherent mythic texture. Crucially, the shoreline lullaby and sea’s “breathing” charge the final image, making atmosphere inseparable from emotional resolution. No detail is ornamental; all serve pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt fortress isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: snow muffles sound but also hides hunters; the wobbling bench impedes therapy; the spiral staircase’s hidden door channels rebellion. Crucially, the bolt functions as micro-setting—its absence disables healing, its presence enables risk. Sensory detail is purposeful (“oil and old varnish,” “humming pipes”) and filtered through the bellhop’s professional attention. The final image (“frostbitten hope”) ties environment to emotional stakes without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.3)

Final image—steel bathed in light, hum steady underfoot—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.4)
    The volcanic hot springs aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice: the amber must be opened via heat-and-shade sequence only possible here; steam carries voice and memory; sulfur burns palms during ritual. The black rock slope, tamarisk tree, and bathhouse form a tactile micro-setting that guides action. Final image—the salamander crawling toward garden beds—charges food-growing as sacred repair, directly opposing the old temple’s logic. Environment is active agent, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    The seaside cliff arboretum constrains every choice: salt wind dictates sapling selection, the glass pavilion houses the lens that enables Mina’s “pearl of stillness,” and the drone’s buzzing violates the space’s sanctity. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—copper taste, wet palms during panic; gravel paths, reed mats during calm. The setting evolves: fog rolls in as she labels plants, merging past (dark lighthouse) and future (dated saplings). Final image charges closure: realism includes mistaking gulls for drones, yet choosing to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.6)
    Setting is active crucible: the lighthouse isn’t backdrop but antagonist and tool. Stone walls pressing inward raise stakes; the forgotten library’s “ribs” and glowing dust mirror Mara’s fractured psyche. The lens mechanism’s knotted filaments directly enable her method—untangling light to redesign reality. Final image of “stitched radiance” through dust ties environment to closure, proving the lighthouse charged every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    The wind-carved encampment, dunes, and canyon aren’t backdrop—they constrain tactics (ink must be spilled on stone, drone maps in slowed time).

Every detail serves plot or theme; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    The body (Lio’s tattooed wrist), tool (translator unit), and recurring object (amber) function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the amber must be pressed to the port, the fresh ink serves as antenna. The observatory’s shelves sighing and ceiling opening like “night water” charge the climax without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress—Lio notices only the insect’s flash, the wail’s translation—while lamplight and train silences ground early atmosphere. Final image (cooled amber, slackened tether) irreplaceably embodies closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.3)
    The whispering grotto isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: its echoes enable forgetting rituals, then, via the tile flake, transform into a space for softened remembrance.

Every detail serves pressure or closure—the “zephyr bloom of salt and fern” returns as “zephyr-light” in the village. Tools (scale, sand pad) and body (breath syncing with waves) are woven into setting logic. Final image (“light resting like morning on water”) is charged by the grotto’s reflective properties.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is not backdrop but active crucible: server foil catches drips, coolant pipes yield rhythmic code, wet cables frame silence. The setting constrains choice (no drones hover here) and supplies tools (foil, residual power). The amber pendant—micro-setting—charges the final image when pressed into resin. Every detail serves the Accumulative lens, with sensory hierarchy shifting from visual (tombstone servers) to auditory (honeyed hush, thaw percussion) as tension resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    The feral nexus functions as micro-setting: mist, shredded chapters, and ink river directly constrain choice (ankles tugged, knees wading). The shell fragment—a recurring object—charges the final image when cooled but kept. Sensory detail is selective (chalky pink, yeast scent, wet leather) and filtered through exhaustion and obsession. Environment doesn’t just mirror—it actively resists and rewards, culminating in dawn softening the “mouth of light.”

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    The verdant arbor isn’t backdrop but active constraint: lightning-scarred trunk, dew-moon alignment, and stone circle dictate timing and method. The vine tendril as “living wire” and brass spool transform setting into tool. Final image—sun clearing canopy while keepers sing—charges the arbor as newly holy through human action. Every sensory detail (clinking pockets, quivering tendril, damp moonlight) serves the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.4)
    The withered orchard functions as micro-setting: its frozen soil stores starlight, its blackened trunks frame Eira’s metronomic pacing, and its center houses the capped well that becomes the story’s gravitational core. Sensory detail is purposeful—ash-sketch branches, unmoving aurora, snow between rows—and filtered through Eira’s alchemical attention (she hears sap failing, feels joint ache). The environment constrains every choice: discarded camp items become ritual tools only because the crater rim yielded them; the ice cap must be softened with lantern-wax. The final glow of safekept starlight charges the setting with earned luminescence, transforming desolation into sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    The marble cavern functions as both setting and micro-setting: its reflective seams, echo-lensing properties, and cracking walls directly constrain Ivo’s tactics (e.g., timing gear cuts to dawn angles). Sensory detail is purposeful—lanternlight warped in veined marble, footfalls returning twice—and filtered through Ivo’s locksmith POV (noticing surfaces as “sound, light, and the uneasy gap”). The environment charges the final image: the timer anchored to a reflective seam so ticks “open a narrow window for an echo to settle.” No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent despite lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its shingled hush constrains movement, its cupped shape echoes whalebone, and its reflective surface demands alignment.

Environment directly shapes tactics—orientation only works because bronze mirrors constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting: light filters through water to illuminate carving, steam from the kettle activates memory-crystals, and wet-metal/tea smells anchor emotional shifts. Every detail constrains action—the single burner dictates timing, the worktable confines creation—and the final image glows *because* of this saturated environment. No white-room syndrome; space is lived-in, pressurized, and causally active.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)
    The kinetic lagoon isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting that constrains choice (Mara must wait for “midnight and noon” stillness) and charges closure (its slow rotation post-repair keeps stories aloft). Sensory detail is purposeful: water “clicks like gears,” cloudcoat implies weather logic, brass-wire axle grounds the camera wheel. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal elements—platform, lagoon, and clouds form a legible vertical axis. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism (e.g., stalled horses = held breath).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned terminal functions as active micro-setting: gutters, cistern, and dead pumps constrain Lina’s choices and enable her experiment. Sensory details (“smell of sugar and grease,” “cold metal,” “confetti”) filter through her engineer’s attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. The skylight frames, queue rails, and tile map evolve from relics to resonant tools, culminating in the sextant arc’s alignment with the balcony—a spatial echo that charges the ending. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.6)
    The setting functions as active crucible: the quartz veins constrain choice (only here can silence “speak”), the glacier’s pressure shapes temporal stakes (“blue breath filled our hours”), and the wet forecourt enables the bear’s injury and healing. Sensory specificity—petrichor nostalgia, brass dust, matted pine needles—filters through the scribe’s profession and trauma. The environment charges the closure: the quartz’s vibration becomes the score he writes, and the rising sun “colors” but doesn’t “crack” the silence. Every detail serves character or theme; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    The twilight barge canal isn’t backdrop—it pressures every choice: water’s stillness mirrors enforced silence, stilted warehouses imply fragility, and the floating relay shack enables Mara’s infiltration. The pocket sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining her verification method and charging the final image where its shadow measures shifting truth. Sensory detail is selective (oilcloth-sealed tape, lavender light) and filtered through Mara’s myth-hunting expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    The golden dock under snow isn’t backdrop—it constrains action (knot shadows read on snow), supplies resources (fulgurite lens catching lamplight), and charges closure (seed planted in meltwater between boards). Fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting: its bubbles and refraction enable the central act of reading. Weather affects perception (fog softens sound, thickens distance) and tightens focus to tactile immediacy. Every sensory detail serves pressure or theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.4)
    The shadowed autumn garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible: black-netted roses, leaf decay, and crooked pear tree constrain mood and method.

Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—perfume, breath, warmth over visual detail in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.3)
    The suspended palace isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its ticking halls dictate rhythm, its stalactite chains limit movement, its vacuum-sealed vats preserve the flawed genesis. The egg’s warmth and the Cradle’s wire nest directly shape Lorian’s choices. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (soot, condensation, burnt sugar), then expands during release (living pigments, rosy brass). Every detail serves pressure or closure—the palace creaking “against its anchors” mirrors Lorian’s internal recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and kelp-drift peace aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge. She judges wind/moisture from sand grains; the lagoon’s calm mirrors clouds and contrasts fire; the dunes whisper as if absorbing buried stories. The volcanic beach functions as micro-setting: its black sand becomes both diagnostic tool and thematic vessel (“each grain was a note”). Sensory hierarchy reflects her firefighter POV—smell of kerosene, texture of thread, sound of sirens—never touristy or generic.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” isn’t backdrop but active constraint: dry basins, stacked fountainheads, and wet-stone breath below ground shape every choice. The stained glass box and limescale crumbs function as micro-settings that charge the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s profession—she notices pipes, valves, hinges—while avoiding tourist cataloging. Final image of carrying light toward fountains reconfigures setting from tomb to threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.6)
    The Nebula Garden isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint: starvines coil predictably, nebula gas strains the moth, and the wall of condensed starlight forces sonar navigation. Key objects (gear, reed, rootfiber harness) directly shape tactics, and the final image—glowing wheel in black soil—charges closure by contrasting inherited fire with collaborative luminescence. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: early calm admits petal-whispers; transit narrows to bone-felt echoes. No detail is ornamental; even “glassy bark” observatory enables the automaton’s integration.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: vines swallow benches but shelter living plants, making it the only place “echoes felt willing to answer.” Weather (thunder, rain) modulates perception and memory, while spatial choreography—potting table, cemetery gate, orchids—tracks Jonas’s arc. Final image charges the setting: dawn light on the tablet at the gate reweights the greenhouse’s liminal role. Sensory hierarchy reflects his profession: touch (limestone dust, chisel marks) dominates over visual spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian ridge isn’t backdrop—it gnaws, heats, and receives the plumb bob’s recalibration. Tools (rake handle, pendulum bob) function as micro-settings that constrain choice: corrosion reveals a scratch, lead weight distorts time. Final wave meeting the notch charges closure with environmental precision. Sensory detail (salt-veined glass, green corrosion) filters through Mara’s professional attention.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt silo isn’t backdrop but crucible: its sound-swallowing walls enable covert communication, and its repurposing (salt storage vs. refugee haven) charges every object within. The sovereign case, chess clock, and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain knowledge and action. Final image—planting an ash sapling under the “star-cold roofline”—transforms the silo from shroud to velvet, proving environment shapes closure. Sensory hierarchy (click of rook, breath before confession) filters through the gardener’s professional attunement to “uncharted echoes.”

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher quill aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge. The spire’s height enables observation; the ice’s song informs data; the quill’s mythic properties are tested through action, not asserted. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: wind cuts, fishers’ lights, frost in the Warden’s beard—all filtered through Jora’s cartographer POV. The final image of thaw water around the spire ties environment to transformation, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ember alcove, soot-drifted loft, and fog-choked square aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the alcove hides the radio, the loft enables secrecy, the fog masks the concert’s subversion. Recurring objects—the shortwave dial, the coal in a tin—charge the final image as the ember glows “in time.” Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early focus on touch (reused paper, scarred hands), later on luminous sight and whispered sound. Setting never stalls momentum; it’s woven into every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: perspective lines converge where Lira pins paper, the cracked skylight drafts the rocking chair, and illusion of endless space disarms inspectors. Porcelain mask, ash envelope, and charcoal tools function as micro-settings that charge every gesture. Final image—ash scattered into vanishing light—reweights the entire space as liminal archive. Sensory hierarchy (sound of chime-breath, river smell in clues) filters through Lira’s trauma-bound attention.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken city isn’t backdrop but active constraint: silt layers dictate Orin’s method, fish swim through library windows to mark decay, and the sewer outfall “opened like a throat” frames his existence. The hand auger and cog function as micro-settings that charge the climax—the cog’s “green with age but sharp as a fresh decision” ties environment to theme. Salt-stink of drained ruins and lanternlight memories filter setting through Orin’s priorities. Final image of the pipe-fitting rig embodies the drowned city’s legacy reborn in darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet library functions as micro-setting and tool: its rugs hold warmth, its stillness becomes “traveled,” its drapes frame rehearsals. The zither rosette—a broken object within the setting—constrains choice (Mara repairs it instead of discarding) and charges the climax (its shadow on sheet music). Autumn’s chill and window-breath aren’t cliché but active counterpoints to bodily warmth and vocal vibration. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite multiple singers.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rusted greenhouse functions as both setting and micro-setting: its broken glass provides light, its vines must be cleared, its bent ribs support the growing tree. Environment constrains choice (cooking in secrecy, planting in cracked pots) and charges the final image—patrol lights outside vs. luminous seeds in tin cups inside. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: wet soil, old iron, honey-glazed roots, nettle disinfectant. The rail yard’s collapse mirrors societal ruin, yet specificity prevents allegory; this place feels lived-in, not symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lightning collection tower isn’t backdrop—it’s a pressure chamber where storm charge jars, fused wings, and thunder nets constrain choice and charge the climax. The lacquer box, matchbox, and nectar dusk function as micro-settings that evolve: the box moves from curiosity to key, the match ignites truth, and “nectar dusk” returns as scent and metaphor. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (scorched shell, glimmering jars, warm scent), filtered through Maro’s toll-keeper perception. The final image of street lamps blinking on ties setting directly to thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    The quiet bay isn’t backdrop but active constraint: saltgrass, tide lines, and bay winds shape tactics (e.g., wind moans when clock is misplaced). The orris shard functions as micro-setting—its weight guides Mara’s choices and charges the final image when sanctified with saltwater. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s perfumer-adjacent perception: violets, radiator hum, plaster warmth. Every detail serves the central question of aliveness, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic spring tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater garden isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: plankton stirred by the lamp, algae fronds holding still “like curtains,” the crack where dome meets rib guiding the cord. The setting charges the final image: petrified seedlings in skeletal planters mirror Ilyan’s barren certainty, while dissolving coral wax releases violet truth. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis—limited visibility, muffled sound, tactile reliance on cord and stone—and details are filtered through Ilyan’s guilt-ridden focus. Salt roses from broken mosaics fuse beauty and ruin, echoing the theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The infinite staircase functions as both setting and micro-setting: its identical steps and turns constrain tactics (proof-writing every tenth landing) and charge the final image (confinement becomes “honest rather than hopeful”). The dice and machine are tactile extensions of environment, handled repeatedly with evolving meaning. Sensory detail is selective (stone’s hush, chip’s stutter, brass arms’ click) and filtered through mathematical obsession. The setting’s logic remains consistent and integral to the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it’s crucible. Citrus trees frame Mira’s easel; smog drowns streetlamps, justifying her moon-chase; glass panes become canvases that alter tactics (painting before dawn erases). The saffron crocuses recur as sensory anchors, culminating in tea that disarms Ro. Final image: the greenhouse glows with script, transforming architecture into beacon—environment directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto city functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting—the waterfall’s spray freezes into a door, the museum kiln bakes loaves, the ice seals art. These elements constrain choice: the ice must be thawed with heat from bread, not force. The emerald lens and rosewater recur not as decoration but as tools that alter perception and tactics. Final image—steam rising like a warning—charges the setting with moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting and crucible: the lighthouse’s salt-smeared gloom, barnacled flats, and cracked lenses aren’t backdrop but active constraints. The low tide creates urgency; the hunger stone’s cradle and corroded contacts demand tactile precision. Final image—beam tracing sea’s retreat and return—charges the closure with environmental reciprocity, embodying Orin’s hard-won equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The funhouse isn’t backdrop—it’s active pressure: mirrors “breathed,” tiles “squealed,” booths leaned “like coffins.” Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the Tilted Corridor funnels the protagonist to the final booth, and the fungus-mottled mirrors frame the transformation. The body functions as micro-setting (“lungs tasted of pennywater”), and the opera clasp—a recurring object—charges the final image by altering how light behaves. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through panic (“cold perfume,” “repulsive allure”), never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.6)
    The floating orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains every choice: kelp-rooted trees limit mobility, driftwood joints become instruments, the bell buoy is both hazard and voice. Sensory hierarchy shifts with pressure: calm blue hour admits visual bruising skies; storm narrows perception to “fruit thudding,” “loose spar swinging.” Final image—mallet repaired with tar under pear leaves—charges closure by fusing tool, body, and environment. Every detail serves the sonic thesis without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The turtle-shell city isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and code. Shell ridges guide Lira’s path; cisterns and rivets become lexicon. Final image charges the setting: the mirrored city reframes all prior shell imagery as dialogue, not ruin. Sensory detail (salt light, reef-like lock) serves pressure, never stalls it. Micro-setting (whistle, stylus) alters tactics repeatedly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    The disused station functions as micro-setting: ivy hides meetings, cracked tiles mirror fractured history, and spatial choreography (lamp near ticket window, benches split by weeds) grounds tension. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“weeds rose through the tiles like slow smoke”—filtered through Mara’s historian gaze. The rosebush isn’t decorative; its petal drop triggers the scene and reappears bare at closure, charging the final image with seasonal finality. Environment constrains choice (secrecy demands this location) and embodies thematic decay.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    The submerged pavilion isn’t backdrop but crucible: water pressure resists stone-setting, mist swallows arches, silt boils like smoke during conflict—all constraining choice. The inkwell (micro-setting) charges the final image, warm against ribs as if approving. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: at climax, perception narrows to lantern flare in fog, then widens post-confrontation to city silhouettes. Every detail serves pressure or POV bias—no museum-tour cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sunken library isn’t backdrop but active constraint: silted water limits visibility, sediment buries clues, bronze doors require physical effort, and the drowned atrium’s collapsed shelves force tactile searching.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating observatory functions as micro-setting: its failing systems (cooling breakers, freezing valves) directly constrain the protagonist’s actions and timeline. The geode, ash sea, and bruised clouds aren’t backdrop—they’re active sensory filters that shape perception and calibration. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the observatory drifts into the “pool” accidentally, but the protagonist steers it deliberately toward the gradient’s steepest point, using thrusters whose bursts perturb the very field he measures. Environment and tool co-constrain tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: its dome slit launches the drone, its western wall hides the notch, its service passage stores the type chips. Dusk’s “brilliant dimness” evolves from atmosphere to thematic texture, culminating in light that “brighten[s] from within” when the frequency aligns. Tools (drone, tuner) and body (Mara’s eyes tracking grooves like wind) function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early quiet punctuated by chain sounds, later tactile focus on pitted metal edges.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt terrace, bruised-ink sea, and driftwood carvings aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the shore’s archive forces Mara’s reckoning, and the terrace rail becomes the stage for truth-telling.

Sensory specificity (bruised cardamom, saffron for funerals, moonlight like milk) filters through Mira’s beast-whisperer perception. Every detail serves pressure or closure—no white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting through recurring objects: the saucer crack, the linen tablecloth, and the vapor tree all constrain choices and charge the final image. The midnight glade isn’t mere backdrop—it pressures the protagonist with its “painfully clear” air and jeweled grass, choking her with beauty that mirrors the suffocating weight of lost time. Spatial choreography remains coherent across earthbound kitchen and cloud-glade, with tactile navigation (sigh-stair, ribbon tether) grounding the surreal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: patched hull plates, repurposed solar tiles, and vacuum-seal thread directly constrain Mara’s actions and materials. Her gravitationally light body interacts with the ship’s spin gravity, forcing behavioral adaptation (gripping rails, suppressing joy). The chapel remnant—once a meditation space, now storage—charges the final image when the quilt activates beneath its altar. Every detail serves theme or tactic; no white-room syndrome or generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.4)
    The black sand beach, volcano, and mineral-lit cave aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice (the warm stone path, the safe crack revealed by lantern light) and charge closure (steaming sand embodies transformation’s texture). Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “coal-dark grit,” “ash like gray pollen,” the bugs’ “soft equations” on glass. The setting evolves causally—lava meets sea just as they emerge—and spatial choreography remains precise even in darkness. Environment directly enables the final image’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    The luminous fort, Archive Door, bronze quill holder, and half-painted sundial function as micro-settings that actively constrain choices: the blackout isolates the fort, the sundial’s coded angles dictate tactics, and the quill holder’s hidden sparks enable silent sabotage. Sensory detail is purposeful (“lantern-glow,” “brass tumblers nested like sleeping birds,” “soft blue pulse”) and filtered through the sentinel’s professional attention. Spatial choreography remains coherent across terrace, archive stairwell, and corridor dimming. The setting charges the final image—the empty Cradle smiling—making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal bluff under aurora functions as micro-setting: its frictionless stone constrains movement (requiring harnesses), shapes ritual (painted rocks must be placed precisely), and charges closure (the sea opens only along the helix traced from bluff to surf). Aurora and borrowed dawn aren’t backdrop—they refract star dust into maps and modulate perception of time. Friction’s absence isn’t abstract; it dictates physics (sliding boots, gliding sledge) and emotional stakes (Lysa’s rope couldn’t grip). Environment actively enables and obstructs every key action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stormlit observatory functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its suspended architecture, wet domes, and darkroom tools directly constrain choices (timing exposures, listening for rarefied air). The body becomes setting too—breath, pulse, and vision guide the ritual. Weather isn’t backdrop but active pressure: thunder rolls “under us,” lightning reveals mask seams, dawn scrubs the sky raw. Final image charges the setting: the observatory “remembers our pause each time a shutter clicked.”

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. The tiled duel strip dictates spatial choreography; the brook’s future flood stakes the overture’s urgency; the unfinished sundial’s temporary gnomon allows the needle card to function as protractor. Even Lysander’s mechanical arm cools in the morning air, tying body to environment. The final image—sunlight casting a clean line like a baton—charges the setting with directive force, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining the closing action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coffee tin, rusted library, and cracked planters aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable action. The false-bottom tin smuggles poems and seeds; the roofless library becomes both refuge and tactical site for hiding pamphlets under bread recipes.

The final image of nasturtiums in cracked planters charges closure by fusing decay and growth, environment and ideology.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    The tidal arbor isn’t backdrop but active constraint: root-bridges rise/sink with currents, cloud-tides reverse compasses, and the hollow trunk hides geometry only film can reveal. Setting charges the climax—the hidden room’s silence enables the clock’s tick, and the sheet-draped piano demands performance. Final image ties environment to theme: compasses point skyward as Lio plays, merging station mechanics with emotional release. Micro-setting (clock, piano) consistently shapes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.6)
    The ancient ridge isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible: its orchids and stone lilies frame Tavo’s ritual; warm stone meets cool mist at the crevice where the seed is planted, enabling growth. The monsoon’s arrival isn’t just weather—it’s the “mouth storm” that would erase memory without the bone canoe (dream logic) carrying the seed upward. Final image charges setting: the ridge draws villagers by “scent,” and leaves shaped as ears root memory where “water could not steal it.” Every sensory detail—salt air, chalk marks, ash—constrains or enables action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the compass, lace, and bonsai constrain choices and charge the final image. Kelp, wet basalt, and rain pearls establish atmosphere without stalling momentum; sensory detail narrows appropriately under stress (e.g., rigging creaks in “slow syllables”). The western reef and fog-bound Wanderer evolve causally from compass tremors to physical destination. Final sea-glass hue emerges directly from environmental interaction, satisfying the 9+ gate.
