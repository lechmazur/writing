  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "delicate crystalline veins," "cold sand," "thin mountain air." The canyon setting recurs across beats and the frost patterns return at closure, charging the final image. However, the environment never materially constrains a choice—Mira's sanctuary status is told, not tested by proximity or access limits. The ledger strip and frost function more as symbolic anchors than as tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting (body, recurring object) is present but does not foreclose a path, capping the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered (frosted panes, frozen ferns, frost-covered windows) and its thermal properties directly enable Elara's method. The performance hall's "pulsed warmth" and layered histories constrain her sensor readings and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (corridors, eastern wing, central hall) remains clear. The conservatory qualifies as micro-setting that shapes the climactic beat, meeting the 9+ gate in principle; small lapses in economic detail (e.g., "frosted palm trees" twice, "frozen ferns and frosted palms" near the end) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered ("Bookshelves rose like ribs from the seafloor") and the impossible throne-chair provides a concrete constraint for the ritual work. Sensory details—sand that "smelled of salt," water to his waist, "gray-green and forgotten" light—are specific and filtered through Aldric's professional lens. The lens itself functions as a recurring object that charges the closure. However, spatial choreography in the underwater scene could be tighter, and the transition mechanics (how he moves between worlds) remain vague, limiting the setting's pressure on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge elevation, and settlement layout are anchored early with purposeful detail ("clay pillars baked in a color that matched the region's stubborn earth"). Sensory specificity is strong—the silver bell's coldness, the breathing patterns of exhausted sleep, the shuffle of feet on clay paths. The arbor constrains the final choice by serving as the visible gathering point and altar of resistance, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct, wisteria, twilight mist, and fireflies create vivid, layered atmosphere that modulates with Mei's internal state. Sensory selection is purposeful: scent thickens with mist, the stone's texture grounds her apparatus, and the viaduct "exhales beneath her feet" at closure. The Kwan Yin's tear functions as micro-setting, warming and pulsing to guide her discovery. These details constrain her positioning and charge the final image, though the viaduct itself remains more stage than active constraint on her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly particular: vines that "walk across the rusted irrigation channels," hawthorn spirals, the root-cellar with cedar boxes. The halo fragment and photographs function as micro-setting, returning with shifted meaning. The garden constrains Elara's final choice by providing the geometric logic she must complete, elevating the setting beyond postcard detail. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent to the greenhouse and root-cellar.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The carnival setting is vivid and purposeful: rusted dispensers, cracked rubber balls, and the piano-bench mechanism all constrain access and anchor Mira's clandestine network. Micro-setting works well—the arrow's synthetic-fiber fletching and the bench's horsehair stuffing ground sensory detail in decay and improvisation. The vault's "green scent of dormant potential" charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment directly shapes both secrecy and the final planting strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken greenhouse with apple trees rooted through shipwrecks and the ashen forge burning without fuel create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception (aurora sounds, wood-creaking green) and the setting charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice; it remains a richly described backdrop rather than a tactical pressure point, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The emerald station, golden-hour light, and moonbeam jar are vividly rendered and recur across beats, charging atmosphere and anchoring the accumulative design. The camellias function as a symbolic object that Mira decodes, and the setting's "emerald-tinted glass roof" and "wooden bench" offer concrete spatial anchors. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics; she moves through it with "careful reverence" but no friction. The station functions as a backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned control room is anchored early with rusted consoles, cracked windowpanes, and the glory hole, establishing a specific micro-setting. Sensory detail (icicles weeping, amber glass catching light, ice cascading from the overhang) is filtered through the glassblower's craft-focused POV. The glory hole constrains the glass-working action in the middle beat, and the melting ice parallels the internal thaw. The bookmark and cooling glass function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library supplies vivid sensory anchors—"metal cold through her film-slicked jacket," "moonlight poured through holes in the ceiling like spilled milk"—and the child's cast on the reading table provides a concrete object that charges the ending attempt. Spatial choreography remains clear (shelves, skylight, stacks, table). However, the setting does not constrain Maya's final choice; she could deliver her declaration anywhere. The phobia-inducing enclosure is noted ("shelves pressing closer, air thickening") but never forces a trade-off or tactical shift, remaining atmospheric rather than pressure-driving.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ridge fort, storm, pebble shore, and gold booklet are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (flaking gold, gray fury, marbled hush). The booklet is handled across beats and its physical decay matters to mood. However, setting does not constrain a tactical choice—the oracle's action proceeds without spatial friction. The storm pauses conveniently for her work, reducing environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen courtyard is established early with consistent sensory detail (frost-stiffened leaves, bare branches, emerging stars) filtered through robot perception. The ice violin's impossible geometry and the transparent strings charging the final image provide micro-setting that shapes the closure moment. The bench, maintenance closet, and courtyard layout remain spatially coherent. The setting does not actively constrain a mid-scene choice, keeping it shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal forecourt constrains the final choice: its "resonant hush" and refractive surfaces charge the closure image, making transparency literal and environmental. The projector lens functions as micro-setting, handled twice (polishing habit, pocket-weight shift at closure) and charged with meaning that alters the narrator's stance. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional bias—glass surfaces, water droplets, mist, bells—filtered through the registrar's waiting. Spatial choreography stays clean across the counter, forecourt, and garden stones. The setting's recurring crystalline imagery accumulates pressure and pays off when "a thousand hopeful refractions" visually embodies the thematic stake.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    The maze's intricate hedges, weathered stone bench, and northern ridge constrain past choices (the misdirection) and anchor Elara's daily ritual. Sensory detail is selective and grounded: "sweet decay of autumn's first fallen leaves," cloth molded to palm. The maze functions as crucible for the protagonist's identity, and the final villager's hesitation at the entrance charges spatial choreography with meaning. Micro-setting (the bench, the marbles, the cloth) all participate in the ritual that defines closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting anchors early (research station, methane seas, twilight shift) and the magnetic nexus physically returns in multiple beats. The lever's "worn smooth by years of obliging service" seeds tactile history, and the containment bay's curved walls and observation panes provide spatial grounding. The station's cold climate contrasts with Kira's "mechanically warm" body, charging the final image of "hush" and "suspended moments." However, no environmental constraint narrows her tactical options—she pulls the lever unimpeded—preventing the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The flooded opera house is vividly anchored with selective detail (gilded balconies reflected in black water, drowned lobby, piano on raised platform). Water level and lantern light track consistently across moves and supply spatial logic for the discovery. The pit as "liminal hollow" and the stage as "vast wooden plane" are generic elevations that don't constrain a micro-choice, but the raised piano platform does enable the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: Elena notices water creep and flickering rhythm during the playing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain weather station constrains Mira's choices materially—she must stand at the console, read the displays, issue warnings—and the aurora's green light charges both the frost patterns and the final image. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, its paper texture and Elena's thumb-smudge becoming the physical anchor for Mira's emotional turn. Sensory hierarchy is strong: under lingering fever she notices cold, light, and the station's "chittering" instruments. The setting is woven through action (moving to the console, typing the forecast) rather than described statically.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned train tunnel is vividly rendered with selective, atmospheric detail (weeping walls, rusted hatch, kudzu-choked ruins) that charges the final moment. The beaded valve wheel returns with reweighted meaning, constraining Marcus's recognition. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (headlamp carving pale tunnel, pressure in ears, radio crackle). Spatial choreography is clear; the tunnel's oppressive atmosphere directly supports the drowsy alertness and liminal pressure that culminate in his confession.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail in the overgrown library (vines, dripping water, ecosystems from decayed texts) and obsidian refuge (volcanic glass absorbing light, "moment before dawn"). However, no environment, body, tool, or recurring object constrains a choice or charges the final image, capping the score at 8.8 per the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the origami swan is handled tactilely, but the swan does not alter tactics—it is a static transport device.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sage ridge, the eclipse's visual transformation, and the "ancient oak" are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (honeyed light, sharpened shadows). The ukulele and silk pouch anchor micro-setting through tactile presence. The eclipse setting directly enables the shared moment and charges the atmosphere, constraining Elara's session to this liminal window and shaping the children's receptivity, which elevates setting past ornamental use.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The silo library is vividly rendered: curved concrete walls, wheat-smell residue, the half-burned fireplace "like a mouth that had spoken too much." The tapestry fragment (gold thread shifting at eye-corners) and the brass tools used to lift fragile pages supply tactile micro-setting. The setting constrains Elias's work—he must use "tools of brass and patience" because the diaries are ash-fragile—and the tapestry's warmth in his hands charges the final image, directly shaping the closure moment. Sensory detail (bronze quiet, faint wheat smell, cold ashes) is filtered through Elias's perceptive awareness without catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse and island are vividly established with selective, purposeful detail (white finger pointing toward nowhere, gray map of the sea, tide rhythms). The microdot specs in the drawer function as micro-setting that charges thematic contrast. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The lighthouse beam recurs and modulates meaning across beats, and the specific paper and fortune-writing supplies reflect occupational particulars filtered through Elias's POV. The final image relies on the lighthouse beam to charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, vestry, and palette create a specific ritual environment with vivid sensory detail (alizarin crimson catching last light, chant multiplying). The church's seven-century history and stripped sanctuary convey Matthias's practice convincingly. Spatial choreography between sanctuary and vestry remains legible. The palette's single color and the loop pedal mechanism constrain his method, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the setting does not charge the final image since the story ends before threshold-crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and nautilus shell are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (crystalline transparency, amber spiral, ginger-and-snow scent merger). The nautilus shell appears in two beats (desk touch, pulse recognition) and charges the final image by suggesting home-recognition, meeting the micro-setting threshold. Spatial choreography is clear within the single location. However, orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per global rule.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The viaduct's rain-glow and stone-by-stone pulse establish vivid sensory grounding, and the "between the drop and the ripple" timeframe creates a distinct atmospheric constraint. Mira's hovering "a breath above the ancient stones" anchors body-in-space detail. However, the setting does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics—she floats through it without friction. The childhood fracture and corridor imagery remain abstract spatial metaphors rather than tangible environments with props or distances that shape action, preventing the micro-setting from charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: skins hanging, shafts of pale light, nested chambers that guide Maren deeper. Spatial choreography is clean. The phonograph's wooden body becomes the tactile anchor for her transformation, charging the climax. Minor gap: autumn forest details frame the piece but do not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure; they remain atmospheric rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The courtyard anchors opening and closing with purposeful sensory detail (jasmine, fountain, copper aviary roof). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—the pigeon could launch from any location, and the space doesn't pressure her tactics. The "layered tranquility" is described but not tested; we never see how the courtyard's peace conflicts with her danger or how its features enable her evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto's starlight, pool, and curved walls create a vivid liminal space. The rope—frayed fibers, rough texture, faint luminescence—functions as both tool and recurring motif that constrains her choice (marking patterns) and charges the final image. Sensory detail (silver threads, rust-colored clay) is purposeful and filtered through Mira's contemplative POV. The setting supports the threshold theme without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and scorched orchard constrain Marina's acoustics and choice of location; the mendicant's bowl vibrates with resonance, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear: center of orchard, bowl on moss-covered concrete, hulls reflecting sound. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—dripping water as "small bell," ash-coated silence. The setting is not mere backdrop; it shapes the music's behavior and the final image of walking through the shipwreck ring.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber grotto is vivid ("honeyed whiskey," "ethanol and old secrets") and the blotter petal's dampness and static charge become tactile anchors. Micro-setting qualifies: the workbench, the paper, the olfactory trigger all constrain her method and charge the transformation beat. Dusk deepening to night tracks the emotional arc. The compound's scent description ("amber and grief, a melancholy that tasted of autumn leaves and letters never sent") is lush but does not materially alter a present choice; it mostly enables introspection, so setting pressures mood more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the symphony hall lobby, salt air with jasmine, the inverted-ship architecture of the library, the domed skylight pouring starlight. The library's sensory palette (paper, lavender oil, "something indefinable") and Elias's lamp-lit office create atmosphere that supports the contemplative mode. However, the environment constrains no choice—Maren walks without resistance, finds the envelope without obstacle, and locates Elias easily. The setting enriches tone but does not pressure decisions or charge the final image with physical consequence, keeping it in the strong-but-not-essential band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: kneeling at its base forces Yara to see her reflection and confront her past pattern, directly enabling the closure realization. The crystalline orchard recurs across beats with specific sensory anchors (geometric shadows, molten copper lake, glass-powder marks) that guide her physical search and charge the final image of spiral marks "leading her deeper into the web." Spatial choreography is clean (crater rim → arbor descent → climb back toward orchard lights). The glittering environment mirrors her internal "luminescent ache" through concrete detail rather than overt symbolism, and the "hollow promise" of marsh-reeds gains tactile weight when contrasted with the orchard's "frozen quartz" fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop canal system is vividly anchored: narrow waterways, towers pressing close, flat-bottomed boat, whispered rhythm that stutters. Sensory detail (pale moth, cold pendant, water moving beneath) is selective and purposeful. The domed chamber with carved notations vibrating with suppressed sound constrains the final choice—Sera must press the pendant against those walls—lifting the setting into the 7-band. Small deduction for the canal "symphony of water, wind bells, and distant market chatter" being told in summary rather than shown through lived action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (phosphorescent glow, dripping stalactites, chipped mosaic). The mosaic stepping stones constrain her ritual method and charge the closure image when she places the eyes at the exact dovetail point. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does more than backdrop—it supplies the pattern-finding framework central to her practice—but the stalactites' dripping functions mostly as atmospheric recurrence rather than altering a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and sustained (pipe chases, emergency lights, sapphire hush, infrastructure language), but most description ornaments rather than constrains choice. The "floorboards creak to warn away those who need solitude" and heating failure details establish expertise without affecting the present action. The tape fragment's location in "deeper pipe chases, where the infrastructure converges" does not alter Maren's tactics or create spatial friction—she simply moves there and finds it. The micro-setting (body, tool, or recurring object) does not shape the closure image with constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: Vera places the leaf there in an active release, and the damaged vines' new growth supplies the conceptual scaffold for her final realization. Storm season pressure is present but could tighten further. Sensory detail is purposeful (wet earth, "particular perfume of transformation") and filtered through Vera's professional lens. The trellis reappears at closure to anchor the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal island, causeway, and pavilion are rendered with specificity and guide Mira's journey; the water trails function as navigation and world-logic. The telescope found "in the ruins below the pavilion" ties setting to the exchange, and the island's convergence-point history charges the final image. Micro-setting (bare feet on black stone, ancient pillars) constrains movement and supports tone without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The musical crystal cave is rendered with high sensory specificity—crystals singing via temperature shifts, bioluminescent moss casting green-gold light, shadows that "pool and move" when attention shifts. Cave pearls warm in cold depths, creating tactile contradiction that charges Varen's failed vision attempt. The cave's distributed awareness and "breathing stone" function as micro-setting that pressures his epistemological stance. Spatial choreography remains clear across his descent. The setting directly enables the closure: nine days of inhabiting the cave's "overlapping shadows" and "steady unpredictability" teach the lesson that alters his relationship to seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ivory harbor after rain is vivid and recurring, framing both opening and closing images with the "ivory stones gleaming after rain" reprise that charges the final moment. Sensory details are filtered through the archivist's professional lens (salt crystals on notebooks, corroded brass). The micro-setting of the archive and the trumpet valve as object-as-setting successfully constrain the archivist's attention and shape the final recognition. Spatial choreography between harbor, archive building, and window remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The starlit vault in mist, cobblestones, and train station are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail. Setting guides Aria's path via the cracks-as-arrows, meeting the constraint test. However, the station's "dozens of pillars…cracked in patterns that spelled words" is never used—Aria "almost" reads them, then moves to confession without spatial interaction. Micro-setting (the punch, the air) charges the final image, lifting the score. No spatial coherence breaks, and the vaulted ceiling motif bookends effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower's open roof and the whale songs below create a coherent spatial pressure that charges the final image effectively. Sensory detail is purposeful (salt winds, cool stone, distant songs) and filtered through Mira's scientific lens. The tile as micro-setting object constrains her action (transcription work) and returns at closure with reweighted meaning. The bay and whales function more as atmosphere than as elements that directly narrow her choices, but the setting coheres well with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with fractured light and dimensional tears, and the amulet's warming pulse grounds the body in the storm. However, neither environment nor object constrains a tactical choice; they function as atmospheric intensifiers. The spatial choreography remains abstract ("spaces between spaces") without concrete micro-setting details that alter Elian's options or charge the final image through physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prep room is vivid and specific—"humming lights," "strange deathly vitality"—and directly pressures Elena's stance by framing honesty as ceremony for the dead. The unclaimed woman's body serves as a concrete prop that Elena handles, making the waiting active and lending physical grounding to the ethical calculus. Darius sitting in the corner while she works gives spatial choreography that integrates setting into character choice. The final image (flowers by the ink pot, resuming work) charges the closure with the room's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bonsai forest, mountain workshop, gilded-leaf emblem, and fluorescent lamp anchor the setting with vivid, selective detail. The lamp's "faint tremor" and the prism scattering light are sensory and purposeful. The bonsai forest functions as both atmosphere and constraint (providing "perfect quiet"), and the prism charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and specific ("corrugated walls forming corridors that shifted with the tides"), and the label's physical state (soft as cloth, ghost marks) is textured. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the containers do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in any beat. The label discovery happens because the tide reveals it, not because the protagonist navigates the maze under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory is vividly anchored: copper dome, salt-and-sawdust smell, dust motes, weather-beaten table. The cello and painted seashell constrain Elena's investigation and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (her "professional curiosity," "familiar mixture of melancholy and purpose"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting pressure reaches the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but some description lingers in postcard mode ("bruised twilight sky," "dark as dead eyes") without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The raft city carnival is vividly anchored with sensory detail—creaking rafts, glass platforms, gilded barges, clicking shoes. The setting's duality (old wood vs. new glass) mirrors the thematic tension and the canals function as both literal and metaphorical channels. The foundation stone chip constrains Mira's emotional geography and the graffiti locations (ferry dock underside, food stalls, flickering lantern) are specific enough to feel inhabited. The carnival's music modulates with her emotional state in the final beat, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The moonlit Tycho crater summit is vivid and specific: regolith tracks, frost sublimation, earthlight warmth, the chronometer's countdown. The camera and its chemical timer constrain her method and charge the final act. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (lens adjustments, developing chamber checks). The setting directly enables the closure image when sunlight transforms the frost into "scattered diamonds."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-coated depot, water basins, and workshop are rendered with purposeful sensory detail that filters through Elias's blindness ("light's fracture through the rippling surface"). The water features constrain his diagnostic method and charge the atmosphere. However, the ship itself remains an off-stage abstraction—its "preparations echoing across the water" are told, not shown—and spatial choreography of the release lacks concrete grounding. The micro-setting (water basins) does more work than the larger depot frame.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting detail is vivid and filtered through Miriam's cartographic expertise: condensation patterns, ice-buckled railing, corrugated walls. The frozen lake and outpost constrain movement and supply clues (yellowed papers, the falcon's arrival point). Sensory selection (frost as clock, droplets tracing like rivers) reflects professional bias. The phrasebook and map function as micro-setting elements that enable key interpretive beats and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway, cobblestones, and ironwood fork are vivid and purposefully detailed; sensory selection (humidity, velvet moss, buzz through boot soles) is specific and filtered through Eliorn's professional attention. The micro-setting (tuning fork, cobblestones) constrains her method and charges the final image when the stones respond. Spatial choreography is clear across her repeated circuits, and the world rules (resonance, blight, mute bells) remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater temple, kelp curtains, altar with extinct sea creatures, and rusted gears create vivid spatial anchors. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's urgency: "icy water," "burning lungs," "dim flashlight," "warm vial." The temple's architecture (collapsed entrance, vaulted ceilings in memory, walls blooming soft twilight light) constrains her descent and choice to unsnarl the mechanism. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The vial's warmth and the perfume's spiral constrain the final choice and charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight repose anchor setting vividly and consistently. The narrow door's scuffed frame and the confessional lattice function as micro-setting that charges the final image: Marcus kneels where his father knelt, the lattice glows, and setting constrains his ritual of testimony. Sensory detail is filtered through Marcus's urgency (iron railing, brass-woven screen, "heating the lattice in his hands"), though some phrases lean abstract ("membrane between what was and what might have been"). The lighthouse keeper's climb in the final paragraph demonstrates spatial tracking and integrates environment into the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse—luminous coffin, artificial moons, iron rafters, propagation chamber glass—constrains Elara's manifestations and supplies the alchemical scions whose transformation is the pivotal event. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (frost and ferment, glass catching cold radiance), filtered through the ghost's post-mortal perception. The carved stone bead pressed against glass becomes a micro-setting element that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara drifts between rows, appears at the grafting station, lingers at the propagation chamber where the gardener approaches. The endless-night frame and winter-cracked fields recur to reinforce tone and charge the dawn mention at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The red canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective detail (worn by departed waters, purple twilight, stone holding threads). Spatial choreography remains clear across Maren's nightly walks. The setting constrains choice by offering hidden springs she must find and paths she must navigate, and the copper plate is placed against the rock face in the closure beat, charging the final image. Sensory selection tilts toward the visual and tactile (needle glinting, threads of light, still water) without overloading; the canyon's response to her sewing ("stones holding each thread") subtly mirrors her internal work.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: roots curling around skulls "with something approaching tenderness," the apple tree's trunk visible through a ceiling crack, the mineral-rich soil feeding the living. The setting constrains Mira's choices (the collapsed passage traps her, the sundial base's location determines her excavation path) and charges the final image (she places the gnomon where roots emerge "like arms reaching for sky"). Sensory hierarchy is consistent with Mira's archaeological focus (she notices carved runes, clay vessels, woven shrouds) while emotional urgency narrows perception at key beats. Spatial choreography remains clear across the week-long excavation and the final moonlit placement.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arcade setting is vivid and purposeful: neon tubes, concession-stand popcorn, golden lights anchor dawn atmosphere and "futuristic nostalgia." The ebony clipboard is handled multiple times (flipping through codes, gathering it at the end), constraining Maren's ritual. Sidewalk codes and the arcade's conversion to post-office-shrine supply micro-setting texture that reflects her mission. However, no environmental constraint alters a choice or charges the final image; the setting decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt observatory, copper-stained windows, and autumn frost provide vivid sensory anchoring. The eternal candle constrains perception ("synchronize her perception with that flame") and the galaxy charts function as micro-setting that alters her tactics (encoding records via stitching). However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure; the final beat ("the flame burned on, patient and eternal, and Elara listened") reprises the setting without demonstrating how it narrows options or charges cost. Spatial choreography is coherent; no float or impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with crooked roots, black water, salt and mist; it functions as a liminal space that pressures Maren's choices. The gargoyle shard becomes a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it glows and draws out her apology. Sensory detail (cold glass, condensation shifting, silver moonlight) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The clearing "that shouldn't have existed" and the window in the trunk charge the stakes without feeling touristic. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium and anesthetic haze anchor orientation early and filter perception throughout. The brain coral fragment is handled twice (opening and close), constraining Elira's reflective stance and charging the final image with "living architecture that built itself from damage." Spatial choreography (atrium → bedside) remains clear. The setting does not pressure a middle choice directly, but the recurring coral motif and twilight-mist frame shape the closure image, meeting the 9+ test narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fog-bound district is vivid and recurring: "settled like sediment over five centuries," "twisted stumps...like broken teeth," walls with "empty windows." The fog constrains Mira's work ("would not hurry for her") and supplies the charged atmosphere that makes "the walls glow in ways that seemed almost deliberate." The fresco fragment and projector function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure. Minor slip: the knowledge network is named but not spatially grounded, and the shift from setup to performance could track distances more clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sound wave garden's parabolic curves and seven-echo mechanism are vivid and specific. The garden constrains her work rhythm ("timing her brushwork to the echoes") and the nickel's presence alters the acoustics, directly affecting her perception. The final image charges the space ("the garden's reflected sound washed over her, patient and playful"), integrating setting with closure. Spatial choreography (pool's edge, fountain, mortar, terraced walls) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gourd seed, garden plots, and greenhouse are vivid and purposeful, establishing the resistance's spatial logic. However, the convergence point where Maren plants functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint—she encounters no obstacle at the site and the "soft" soil is conveniently pre-turned by anonymous hands. The setting describes a coherent world but doesn't pressure the central action or force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gargantuan shell spiraling inward/outward is a vivid, purposeful anchor that shapes the poet's dual orientation. The garrett as greenhouse, the off-key wind, and reef-shadow imagery create a coherent atmosphere of isolation and bioluminescent beauty. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting, charging memory and desire. Spatial grounding is clear; the shell's spiral metaphorically constrains and extends her world, contributing to the final image of directionality ("both directions at once").

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal library, marble-into-glass architecture, and clouds with non-earthly colors are vividly rendered and thematically coherent. The wind chime's cracked bamboo is handled twice (finding it, using it at cases, returning it) and the fracture pattern is specific. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—the caretaker moves freely, unimpeded. No micro-setting element charges the final image or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive, manuscript, and glass ink well anchor the setting with vivid sensory detail (glyphs "like braille written for the dead," amber lamplight, crystalline walls). The extinct-language archive functions as both location and thematic container, and the ink well recurs with shifting resonance (gift, pulse of borrowed light, warmth after writing). Spatial choreography is coherent, though the archive itself remains somewhat abstract—thousands of shelves whisper, but no specific access constraint or physical layout pressures Elara's final choice. The ink well charges the final image weakly (still warm), just enough to lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amphitheater's volcanic setting is vivid and purposeful: geothermal heartbeat, trembling stones, thermal currents shifting. The surveyor's chain returns in the penultimate paragraph as a concrete anchor for her future work, constraining her next steps. Sensory detail is selective and integrated (breath cycles, heat exhale, stone shudder), filtered through an engineer's lens. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The environment charges the final image—dormancy negotiating with pressure—but does not constrain a pivotal choice on the page; it supports rather than forces the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The attic skylight, workbench, and meteorite chip create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Eleanor's mapping method and charges the final transducer moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: vanilla-and-forgetting smell, dust motes tracked in pencil, crystalline structures. The skylight's "single" constraint directly shapes her practice of stillness and the accumulation of light-particle trajectories, meeting the 9+ gate criterion by constraining choice and charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prism terrace supplies vivid color-fracture and grain-pattern detail, and the wood-reading method briefly constrains Elara's search (she kneels, traces knots). However, spatial choreography blurs—how the terrace drifts, its scale, and the peninsula geography remain vague. The final village materializes "like a diagram" without prior anchoring of distance or terrain. The setting does not pressure a choice at closure; Elara simply steps off when the village appears.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater facility is vividly realized with specific details (crystalline towers, bioluminescent corridors, glass-domed observatory, pressure lock's groan) that constrain Marek's movement and frame his discovery. The amber specimen and archive cabinet anchor micro-setting choices. The ticking clock (sunrise flood deadline) and the spatial choreography (moving through corridors to the heart-chamber observatory) remain coherent. The fireflies' impossible ascension through water charges the final image. Sensory selection favors the visual and tactile (copper-touched air, cold floor), though urgency-driven narrowing is minimal since Marek moves with "careful patience" throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The geode's iridescent walls and crater glass pedestal anchor the single scene effectively and are integrated into the recollectionist's method ("amplified her perception, refracting her awareness"). The seeds arranged in spirals and the glass humming under effort provide tactile, specific detail that supports Maren's work. The micro-setting (glass surface, translucent walls) constrains her process and charges the final image ("iridescent walls held their light steady, patient witnesses"), meeting the 9+ gate test for setting participation in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade, mechanical games, starlight, and worn blanket anchor the scene vividly and filter through Marek's professional gaze. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt-thick air, rhythmic bings, star-scattered sand—and the setting's liminal quality directly supports the conceptual frame. The bishop and billiard balls function as micro-setting elements that constrain his choreography. Setting does not force a choice at closure but charges the atmosphere throughout, narrowly missing the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The twilight garden is lyrically rendered but functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no spatial detail shapes the tide dancer's choices or tactics. The moonstone speck and the woman's shoulder are handled, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is vivid ("pale flowers," "small sounds of evening insects") but remains decorative; the garden's edges, distances, and physical layout are vague. The setting charges the final image but does not narrow options during the verse-writing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the warped windows, the still pond, the mist-caught light all reflect the glazier's perceptual signature. The pond functions as micro-setting, constraining her communion ritual and charging the final reflection. Harbor geography remains coherent across moves. Occupation-level detail (glass as refraction/reflection, prism atrium effect) enriches without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ridge path, blackened stumps, new saplings, and moonlight create coherent atmosphere and filter through Mira's professional/survivor lens. The cracked box functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory detail remains mostly visual; other senses are underutilized, and the environment's constraint on tonight's choice is implied rather than acute, preventing entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly described with sensory specificity (sound of water, smell of salt, rippling light patterns) and its erosion metaphor is thematically purposeful. However, orientation anchors arrive late—spatial layout and relationship to the sea remain vague until deep in the text—and the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The grotto functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than an active pressure on Elara's work, keeping it in the functional but non-essential band despite strong descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ivy-veiled passages and ruined office function as micro-setting that constrains Mira's choices: she must work carefully around shattered windows, half-filled fireplaces, and encroaching green. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (leaves "like curious animals," ivy rustling "like audience members"), and the building's dreaming becomes a recurring anchor that charges the final image. The setting participates actively in the closure by embodying the legacy she maps, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prism parapet after rain is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (water droplets, fractured rainbows on weathered walls) and anchors the terrace setting early. The villa's spatial choreography remains clear across rooms. However, setting does not constrain Aria's choices or complicate her method; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The borrowed heartbeat and mirrors exist as metaphysical furniture without physical consequence. Solid descriptive work, but the environment remains passive.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ancient terrace and midsummer light are vivid and purpose-driven, grounding the gathering spatially. The celestial dance (Jupiter, Venus) and the stone's antiquity supply atmospheric weight, and the ebony clipboard is handled twice with shifting meaning. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome—characters could shake hands anywhere. The setting charges tone and theme but remains backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below the 9-band gate despite strong sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.7)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail (cracks as a map, synthetic warmth of the container, translucent veins in the egg). Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional focus on environmental engineering. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the salt flat enables the action but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The egg's placement "where the afternoon sun would warm its shell" shows environmental use, lifting this above pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The silver courtyard and frozen fountain are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (prisms, fractured moonlight, snow). Spatial choreography is clear and the environment charges the final image when dawn transforms the prisms into rainbows. Capped at 7.0 due to orientation penalty applied in Q2. The setting constrains access (a secret sanctuary) and the prisms respond to her purpose, but these effects remain metaphorical rather than altering a concrete tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The radar dome's curved acoustics and axis-marked platform constrain the ritual's staging and charge the final image when the stick remains planted. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's calligraphic precision ("white fiberglass skin weathered to the color of old bone"). The "meteor hush" atmosphere modulates from anticipation to recognition, supporting tonal coherence. Micro-setting (the circular impression, the hatch, the platform) guides choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with mineral deposits, ferns, condensation cycles, and tectonic instability that reinforce the theme of transient rootedness. The moth wing functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Elara's signal-building by providing an angle template. The cloud layer, pumice, and wind patterns shape her work spatially and temporally. The final image of the monarch vanishing into gray clouds charges the ending by mirroring the grotto's own impermanence, making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and purposeful: frost-laced floor, cracked dome, prisms of light at dawn. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting—its braids constrain Yara's technique and the punched card scrap guides frequency. Sensory detail is filtered through craft attention (breath fogging, numb fingers, fibers' tension). The setting charges the final image (ice remains, aurora circles, rope waits). No occupational depth issues; the lost-wax casting background integrates without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vine-draped bunker and storm are vivid but function as backdrop; neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with tactical consequence. Sensory detail is selective ("copper scent," "walls vibrating") and POV-filtered, but the wafer seal's geometries and the pedestal grooves remain ornamental rather than problem-solving tools. Spatial choreography is clear within a single room, meeting baseline expectations without leveraging environment to shape outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The palace observatory, rooftop, archives, and magic-square tile arrangement provide concrete spatial anchors. The candle arrangement mirroring the tile's pattern and the "subsonic frequency" of the tiles underfoot offer purposeful sensory detail that constrains the ritual action. The "twilight atmosphere" and "dusky accord" create consistent tonal texture. The setting does not materially constrain a difficult choice—Maruk's access to archives and observatory is uncontested—but the tile pattern and candlelight do charge the final ritual image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sanctuary's soundless property and shifting boundaries are vivid but function as backdrop rather than constraining choices—Mira and Kael converse freely despite "all vibration" being consumed. Spatial choreography is impressionistic (corner "ceased existing," garden "suddenly" appears) without consistent rules that shape tactics. The music box as micro-setting object does charge the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the larger environment remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ruined orchard district is vividly realized through selective, purpose-driven detail: "gnarled branches holding the mist in permanent embrace," "twilight frost...lattice of tiny crystals." The fog functions as both atmosphere and conceptual anchor, consistently filtering perception and shaping the work's texture. The broken sextant and the conservatory wall serve as micro-settings that constrain Mira's process and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (shed, workbench, conservatory wall, window) remains coherent throughout, and sensory selection reflects the protagonist's professional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid, specific, and purposeful: fallen pears mingle with quartz shards, the decayed sweetness charges the atmosphere, and the vaulted ceiling frames the statue in the apse. The micro-setting (the bag, the tools, the shards on marble) constrains Mira's repair work concretely. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The quartz eye—both Mira's prosthetic and the statue's broken one—functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image when the repaired eye "blinks" in moonlight. The orchard recurs at closure ("constellation of leaves") to reweight the deciduous-vows motif.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard's crystalline rows, humming fruit, and "in-between" space create a vivid micro-setting; the bathroom's sealed door and fluorescent lights ground the peak moment. The cameo's "impossible weight, lighter than air yet dense with significance" and its warming in her palm constrain the final beat—she must hold it to receive the vision. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the orchard's radiation "sometimes made the trees sing"), and the bathroom as a sanctuary for "profound realizations" charges the closure space. However, the orchard itself does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore supplies vivid images (spiral ramp, nautilus chamber, infinite shelves) and the mountain's shifting geography is noted, but these details remain atmospheric rather than constraining Elara's choices. The botanical diary as micro-setting object is handled twice (opening and translating near the end), and its specimens frame her vocabulary of loss, which does modestly charge the final approach. Spatial choreography is loose—chambers and passages are named but distances and access points do not shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carnival ship, fog, emerald card, and bay create a coherent liminal atmosphere. The card's rippling surface and green glow function as micro-setting that charges each beat and the final image. Spatial choreography (prow, fog thinning, step forward) tracks cleanly. The ship's "drifting monument to abandoned joy" motif recurs with purpose, and the fog's lifting pressures Mira's stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mechanism room is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (machine oil, cedar, three-story cogwheels). The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Elena's final action, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting earns its high score by shaping the protagonist's method and participating directly in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    The harmonic caves constrain Mira's search, and the frozen pool's crack patterns become the method through which she locates the bloom. The echo chamber stone functions as both tool and micro-setting element, its warmth guiding her to the spiral formation. Sensory hierarchy reflects her mapkeeper training (fingertip temperature discrimination, vibrational currents). The ice at the spiral's heart is the pivot for the final act, charging the closure image with concrete physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass humming pavilion is rendered with vivid sensory specificity—vibration, amber filter, ambient light—and functions as both setting and recurring anchor. The prism's placement (eastern wall corner) and its light-scattering effect are concrete and purposeful. Spatial choreography between pavilion and beacon tower is legible, though the tower remains exterior and unvisited on the page. The post-collapse world is signaled through "scattered remnants of humanity" and "vanished age," but remains high-level; the pavilion's persistent systems and Elara's eleven-year tenure imply maintenance routines not shown. The setting shapes the discovery beat and charges the final image, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal forecourt, fog-made-solid, and stormlit observatory are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (droplets tracing channels, lightning pulsing across crystal). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The environment subtly charges the archivist's reflection ("being above the clouds...clarified the nature of her work"), and the storm's rhythm modulates the scene's cadence. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric crucible rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fortress blooms with evening primrose and creeping thyme, and the mosaic floor's phoenix is purposefully incomplete, charging the closure when Mira lights the spiral at its center. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's craft-oriented lens (the kerosene rag knot, the courtyard flagstones). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves—gates, inner courtyard, great hall, courtyard. The setting constrains Mira's choice to perform the ritual in the fortress courtyard rather than the villages below, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto setting is vivid and multi-sensory ("ancient water had carved these walls," "stars through the entrance," "mineral coolness"), with the jade cicada functioning as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (two people, tidal pools outside, grotto interior, stars above). The cicada constrains Mira's gesture at closure—she places it between them as a physical bridge—meeting the 9+ gate test. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's chronicler lens (texture, transition, mineral) rather than generic catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    The xenial trellis, inverted gravity, and clouds-beneath-feet create a vivid, purposeful frame that charges Mira's choice to climb through the doorway. The porcelain doll and the sprouting plant anchor micro-setting details that reappear at closure, and sensory selection (gilded hush, susurrus of invisible growth) reflects the POV's bias toward silence as texture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the trellis's constraint (the one-hour gravity window) shapes the final decision to descend.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prism terrace, storm glass vial, and acoustic properties create a vivid micro-setting. The glass constrains Maren's timing (she watches its color shift and adjusts trajectory), and the prism light is woven into the comfort beat. Sensory detail (scented vapor, light spectrums, train whistle echo) is filtered through Maren's professional attention. Spatial choreography is clear and the vial functions as both tool and symbolic anchor, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and pavilion with fossilized paint layers create vivid, specific images filtered through a scholar's eye. The ruby flake pulses and grows "炽热" (a stray Chinese character breaks immersion), and the grass "hums with harvested starlight"—purposeful otherworldly detail. However, the orchard functions as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices, and spatial choreography across waterfall-to-pavilion remains vague. The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary is vividly anchored and the doorknocker ring's "cold like recognition" is sensory and specific. The threshold's physical erosion—"fading," "boundary growing indistinct"—pressures the protagonist's stance. However, spatial choreography inside the sanctuary is vague; we do not see her handling tools, moving between defined zones, or using the environment to alter tactics. The starlight at the end charges the final image but arrives late without prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered ("blue-green twilight," "frozen waterfalls") and the bolt returns with tactile presence ("threads digging into her skin like tiny teeth"). The farm constrains her path and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate materially. Minor: the farm's interior layout and the "third junction" appear without earlier spatial setup, creating a brief choreography gap.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sepia reading room is established early with purposeful sensory detail ("scent of paper, leather, and something faintly sweet") and the gramophone becomes a tactile constraint that Elara handles. The "first yawn of evening" recurs to mark time's passage, and golden light filters perception throughout. The wisteria-claimed terrace and marble entrance hall anchor spatial progression cleanly. The setting doesn't quite constrain the peak choice because the text truncates before that choice lands, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemical orchard is vivid and purposeful, with phosphorescent fruit and eternal night anchoring atmosphere. Spatial choreography remains coherent (benches, central beam, hooks). The marionettes as vessels constrain Aldric's final action, and the greenhouse's fading ties directly to the closure image, charging it with cost. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; the setting's mystical logic is consistent and dramatized through the marionettes'animating response to the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The file room, plantation house history, and the button itself supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Mara's archival lens. The button constrains her interpretation and charges the final documentation beat, satisfying the 9+ gate mechanically, but the environment does not force a tactical choice—it enables reflection rather than pressure. Sensory hierarchy (dust, light through windows, button's weight and worn edges) is selective and voice-consistent. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The auric lagoon is vivid and purposeful, its mineral glow and stubborn reappearance mirroring the theme of memory's persistence. The city palimpsest—redesigned twice, ghost-structures beneath new facades—is filtered through Mira's professional eye and constrains her route. The phone booth key and stone slab function as micro-setting that enables the final descent. Spatial choreography is clean (desk → service entrance → streets → lagoon → tunnel), and the setting charges the final image with stars watching "through every revision." The lagoon's repeated draining attempts add specificity that enriches atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, mist, and dewdrops are vividly rendered and constrain the ritual: the saxophonist climbs worn steps, positions himself by the shallow pool, and the prismatic light scatters through mist in a sensory tableau that charges the final image when "the sun finally broke through the prism atrium in full radiance." The grotto functions as both stage and pressure vessel—sound fills the stones, the mist swirls in response to his playing. Spatial choreography is clear, and the micro-setting (platform, pool, ceiling shards) directly shapes the ritual's mechanics and the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, whispering birch, and seed vault supply atmospheric texture, but no environmental feature constrains a choice—Seraphina moves freely from table to vault without spatial friction. The moonstone speck and antler tool are described vividly yet remain inert props; neither alters tactics at a decisive beat. Sensory detail ("woodsmoke and ember," "spiral staircase") is selective and voice-filtered, lifting the category above placeholder description, but the micro-setting does not charge the final image or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and selective: "rusted to the color of dried blood," "swirling leaves...creating patterns that seemed almost deliberate," "worn smooth by countless footsteps now forgotten." The greenhouse environment shapes Maren's path and the underground stairwell provides spatial constraint. However, the waterfall remains auditory only and does not charge the final image or constrain a choice. The micro-setting (body, debris underfoot) is present but does not alter tactics at a closure beat because no closure beat exists.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The foundry is concretely rendered (corrugated roof, cooling forge, rain-washed windows) and the coin's physical restoration—sorting pieces, pouring gold—grounds the abstract work in tactile detail. The scales "collecting rainwater instead of rare earths" efficiently establishes abandonment and profession. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the repair sequence, and the rain's return at closure provides atmospheric closure participation. The setting constrains her choice to work here, "the one place her brother had loved," charging the locale with emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Echo gorge functions actively: its acoustics "amplified the frequencies of the unfinished" and "turned grief into something audible," directly enabling Mira's work. The harp's misalignment and the crocodile's tooth are integrated as tools with mechanical specificity. Spatial choreography is clear (gorge rim, heart, walls). The sunrise charges the final image ("luminous ache itself") and the gorge recurs with evolving pressure. Strong setting work that constrains method and charges atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ultraviolet forest supplies colors "she had no names for," charging every sensory detail with otherworldliness while the body itself functions as micro-setting through proprioceptive awareness constraining movement. The pewter mask strap's hum felt "in her teeth and the base of her skull" pressures the protagonist's trajectory. The clearing where ultraviolet light "gathered like water in a basin" and "existed outside of ordinary geometry" directly charges the final image, making environment indispensable to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's market "strung high above the city rooftops" in "liminal hours" creates vivid spatial and temporal grounding. The painting hung sideways, the lens fragment's light refraction, and the stall's position between map-seller and musician provide concrete sensory anchors. The micro-setting of the fragment itself—pocket, palm, chest—tracks cleanly and constrains the final choice to let it hang free. The market's elevation above an "unaware" city charges the closure image with vertical and social distance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office supplies vivid, selective detail (faded posters, collapsed shelf, cracked plaster) that constrains Marcus's investigation and charges the closure image—the hidden hatch becomes legible only through dust-pattern analysis. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, a tactile object whose "stored energy" mirrors narrative tension. Spatial choreography remains clear (counter, back office, ceiling) and the fluorescent failure creates urgency. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus's professional lens: structural wear, air movement, particulate evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass orchard, floating floors, and cloud-sea are vivid and purposeful—sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens ("raised type," "platen," "form"). The letterpress functions as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice: "Metal did not dream. Ink did not waver" grounds the resolution in tactile certainty. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (workshop → frost panes → shelving rupture → press). The post-Negotiation world rules are consistent and felt through action (scholars "half-phased," reality "negotiable"), though the bottle's sudden appearance in "a section that had not existed before" verges on convenient spatial expansion without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque asteroid's crystalline walls, amber-honey time pools, and brass warning pipes create a tactile world. Mirrors function as more than decoration—they constrain Vespera's storm protocol and concentrate temporal force, directly shaping her methodical covering actions. The vase shard's physical sharpness ("edges still sharp enough to draw blood") anchors both setting detail and thematic weight. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the eastern wing sequence. Minor gap: the "excavation quadrant seven" detail feels like a token nod to archaeological setting without further grounding the dig site's spatial relationship to Archive Hall.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection: vaulted ceiling catching whispers, candles guttering near dishonesty, the orchestrion's collapsed bellows. Spatial choreography is coherent—Cassian at the workbench, the orchestrion at the chamber's center. The chamber's honesty-enforcement rule constrains his narration habit ("he always spoke his work aloud"), and the final image of dawn lightening the windows charges the closure. The micro-setting (wristwatch, chip, tools) functions effectively as tactile anchors that shape his tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The factory floorboards, limestone fissure, and subterranean lagoon constrain Elara's descent physically and charge the closure image with phosphorescent stillness. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "ghost of rain on concrete, on wool" reflects her professional lens; the lagoon's "impossible blue" and lack of scent anchor her final realization. The micro-setting (vial, compass casing warmth) functions as tactile pressure. Spatial choreography is clean across all beats, and the environment's post-industrial silence enables the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway functions as micro-setting that constrains her shelter choice and charges the closure image (the sculpture reaching toward it). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "horizontal sheets," "turbine-hum," "salt and sawdust." The storm's progression from rolling arrival to spent fury tracks coherently. The lantern slide's tactile presence (palm-sized glass, woven light) and the driftwood's grain-as-braille specificity ground the accumulative design without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber pavilion is vividly realized—etched glass panels scattering October light, frost tracings over floral motifs, the salvaged cathedral window—and these details constrain Mira's discovery (the "certain angles of light" that reveal hidden layers). Sensory hierarchy is strong: the "soft, umbral tenderness" of early morning and the ice crystals glowing "like scattered diamonds" filter through Mira's artist's eye. The postcards and garden beyond the pavilion supply recurring anchors that reweight the final image (green shoots "preparing their own quiet performance"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the closure by making the revelation location-dependent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    The zeppelin, obsidian lagoon, and arranged beach debris are vivid and purposeful. The lagoon's stillness and the cipher made of shells/driftwood constrain Miriam's approach and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"black water," "salt of ancient tears," "crystalline" apparition—and filtered through Miriam's POV. The zeppelin as floating library supplies atmospheric pressure but does not alter tactics at closure, keeping this in mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cove, lanterns, and ruins are evocative and consistent. The amber bottle's texture (warm, porous) is specific. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a causal way; it remains backdrop. The "working memory" method uses the sand and water, but the mechanics are told rather than shown altering tactics. Sensory detail is present but decorative, not purposeful to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop orchard is vividly particular: "gnarled apple trees growing from concrete and determination, suspended forty-three stories above." The foghorn tower, wax shaving, and salt-wind detail are purposefully layered and recur with shifted weight. The amber wax's "faint grooves" anchor tactile immersion, and the final image—apple trees stirring, distant shipping lanes—charges the closure by grounding mystical fulfillment in concrete sensory markers. The garden constrains Seraphine's ritual (she must climb to this specific threshold) and the tower's skeletal presence enables the silence-as-opening motif, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly rendered with frost-numbed palms, misting breath, and constellations wheeling overhead. The acorn cap functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the ritual's anchor. Spatial choreography remains clear as Elara moves through plant aisles, and temperature drop correlates with her focus intensification, making environment pressure visible at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The windblown sanctuary, microclimate sensors, and testing array are integrated purposefully and constrain Elara's actions (the three-hour glue cure gates the test sequence). The soldering iron detail, worn bell rope texture, and cascading green lights on displays create a lived-in technical space. Sensory selection reflects professional attention (temperature differentials, humidity, air trembling), and the western ridge storm front charges the final image. The setting directly enables the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but spatial choreography remains simple and some details (the parapet, the speaker array) serve atmosphere more than immediate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "shooting star tracking station" and "yellow lantern glass" anchor setting and tool effectively. The station "floated in the hollow between celestial currents" and the "observation deck" provide spatial grounding, but these remain postcard descriptions without constraining a choice or shaping the final image. The fragment lodged in the corner is found without search friction; its location does not alter tactics. The micro-setting (body, lantern, fragment) is vivid but ornamental rather than pressure-applying.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The apiary ruins and wasteland are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—"ribs of some ancient, docile creature," "pools of amber and rose"—that establish mood without catalog listing. The buried stained glass box and its physical properties (lightness/weight paradox) constrain and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting evolves causally (collapsed shelter, scorched soil, cracked foundation). Minor deduction: the "weight of unspoken words" pressing against ribs risks metaphorical overreach, but it remains legible within the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The emerald silo's "concentric rings of green glass" and "equations that no longer resolved" create vivid, concept-serving atmosphere. Spatial choreography is vague—her "workspace" appears suddenly in paragraph five without prior anchoring. The urn fragment charges the final image moderately, but the environment itself does not constrain a choice. Cap applies due to Q2 orientation debt: 7.0 ceiling enforced.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lagoon functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "cobalt lagoon's edge," stones "slick and dark," the water's surface reflecting "the bird, the feather, the half-made kite, all held together in the image." The reflection becomes "somehow more real than the original," grounding the conceptual move at closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the poet's attentive stance (iridescence shifting bottle-green to midnight blue, water droplets "like small scattered suns"). The recurring object—the feather—constrains the poet's action (gathering, working it into the kite) and reappears in the ending as bridge between broken and flight. The post-rain atmosphere modulates appropriately as light increases and the hush lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: living stone pillars, mosaic paths, copper-wrapped branches create a micro-ecology that constrains Maren's work and charges the final image ("copper-wrapped branches into a subtle music"). The orchard's architecture supplies both resources (wire, pillars directing water) and metaphor for her life's work. Spatial choreography is coherent (ladder, elevated view, concentric rings). The setting drives choice: her interventions must "increase respect between species," and the pillars' relationship to roots shapes her remodel tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rainwashed tower, spring setting, and amber specimen are vividly rendered with sensory detail (shafted light, dust motes, bronze quiet). The tower and amber are present across multiple beats and the piece filters setting through Elena's scientific lens. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics or forecloses an option—it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring. The micro-setting test (amber as object-as-setting) is attempted but the amber is handled passively, described rather than used to force a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    The jetty, reef skeleton, and twilight water are rendered with vivid specificity—"narrow vastness," "ribs of some colossal beast," bleached coral as "bone-white and empty as an ancient tomb." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the coachman's professional lens (mediator between endings and beginnings). The jetty's edge constrains the planting action, and the waterline's proximity enables the green thread's emergence, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice. Spatial choreography (edge, planks, waterline, shallows) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scrapyard wasteland and metal labyrinth ground action throughout; the cylinder as micro-object constrains the final beat (fingertip decoding). Sensory hierarchy is strong—bloodhound nose, tactile grooves, bruised sky—and filtered through scavenger priorities. Spatial choreography is clean and the post-war idiom ("harvests," salvaged chest, phonograph tech) remains consistent. The autumn leaf and cylinder return to charge the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting or recurring object constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observation deck, containment fields, and glass window provide spatial grounding. The compass rose and sketchbook recur with purposeful constancy. However, the setting remains postcard: "liminal space between stars" and "great curved window" describe atmosphere without constraining a tactical choice. The final sketching beat charges the space modestly, lifting it above pure backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire, violet sky, and churning atmosphere are vivid and filter through Caelius's attention ("the cold bite into his bones"), but the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The "bruised purple" sky recurs but remains decorative; it does not charge the final image or force a decision. Spatial choreography is clear (railing, observation deck, staircase), and the spire's height and exposure are rendered with sensory specificity. The micro-setting option is not leveraged—no tool, body constraint, or recurring small object shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering gallery functions as both setting and constraint: the dome's acoustic properties enable Mira's archival method and charge the final release of her sister's name. The chessboard's fire scars and missing pawns ground the interregnum in tactile detail. Spatial choreography (gallery center, dome curves, corners) remains clear, and sensory selection (footsteps scattering into whispers, "luminous absence") supports tone without catalog excess. The setting directly shapes the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore offers vivid details ("wound through the mountain's core like a digestive tract," "infinite shelves," "electric lamplight") and the stone tablet's feather-texture recurs across multiple beats. The mountain setting anchors the isolation stake. However, spatial choreography remains vague—where exactly is the seer seated, how does the keeper watch "from the shadows," and what does "rising from the floor" imply about her position? The bookstore constrains through isolation but doesn't visibly shape her tactical choices within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen village with suspended merchants and children creates vivid situational constraint. The platinum labyrinth is rendered with light-capturing detail and spatial placement. The tapestry's "woven hush" and frayed threads are tactile and focal. Sensory selection (breath curls, frozen leaves, rain drops) modulates with the thunder lull's pacing. The labyrinth's gleaming presence charges the final paragraph, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrain choice or charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bone towers are vividly rendered with synesthetic detail ("surfaces smooth as skin") and the canyon's acoustic properties (echoes, mist carrying words) directly enable Sera's tactical choice to use poetry sessions. The pale spire pulses at a key moment, suggesting it registers the truth-spreading. The forged hush and endless echoes recur with shifting valence, charging the final image where silence is broken. Strong micro-setting work: the environment doesn't just frame but actively constrains and enables the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea supplies vivid, purposeful constraint—the rising corrosive water functions as a literal deadline that shapes every beat. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the alchemist's priorities (copper hull, smoking surface, pressure seals). The statue's specific pockmarks anchor the ritual and charge the closure image. The key ring charm as micro-setting constrains choice and returns with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with tide-carved passages, vaulted chambers, and bioluminescent water. The pool's stillness and the shell's placement in stone directly shape Marcus's final choice; removing the setting would collapse the discovery structure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("echoing darkness felt closer to the silence he'd made inside his chest"), and the cave's liminal quality charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, salt-worn granite, night garden hollow, and great lens are vivid and selective. Sensory detail—jasmine scent "sweet and green as a promise," thermal currents, flares "like wounded stars"—filters through Mira's urgent attention. The cork carved from the ancient oak and the vial's scent function as micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, lens housing, keeper's quarters) tracks cleanly. The environment subtly constrains: the hollow protects flowers, the lens channels intent, the heat wave's end enables the garden's bloom—all pressuring Mira's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The signal station cupola, rusted ladder, and marsh with black water and twisted cypress create a vivid micro-setting. The bronze censer foot functions as setting-as-object: its warmth and weight anchor Mara physically and constrain her method (she carries it as tether). The marsh moonlight guides the final walk, charging the closure image. Sensory selection is strong (green patina, starlit silver water), and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hanging orchard is vividly rendered with specific detail—trees rooted in granite, storm damage, the hollow in the trunk. Sensory selection reflects Mira's forager expertise and the ravine's precarious physicality. The setting does constrain her route and provides the hiding place for supplies, giving it mild tactical relevance. However, the spatial choreography is somewhat abstract; we don't track her body's precise movements through the wreckage, and the setting's role in the final image is more symbolic than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal dock and mist establish atmosphere effectively, and the lighthouse functions as more than backdrop—it frames Aldric's role and serves thematically at closure ("gathering place for lost things"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (violet-grey trading, golden beacon eye), though the boutonnière's wax-paper preservation and hidden note are described rather than handled in action. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming cavern and rising creek constrain the final choice with visible urgency: water at her ankles forces the decision. Sensory details are selective and pressure-appropriate (pale flowers in darkness, cold creek, warm brass chip). The limestone walls, creek voice, and doorframe-in-stone all function as active setting elements rather than postcard description. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and chamber discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly rendered ("walls ran with bleeding starlight," "dripping patterns on the ceiling"), and the fireflies function as micro-setting that charges the final image through the shared exhale moment. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the climb, and sensory detail is filtered through the queen's POV (air "tasted of frost," tears "smelled of copper and wonder"). The cobalt grotto constrains her path and participates in the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember nexus supplies ambient warmth and visual texture, and the columella is handled across multiple beats, meeting the micro-setting threshold. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics; they serve as symbolic props for the lecture rather than shaping action. Spatial choreography is vague—friends are "in loose clusters" without clear positions or distances.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cabin, mountain, scroll, and grave function as micro-settings that constrain perception and charge imagery. The birch bark scroll's "crusted sap and faint heartbeat" and the cabin's frost-covered window ground tactile engagement. Spatial choreography remains coherent across dream and waking frames, and the final image ("The mountain holds its breath. The cabin exhales its shadows") charges closure without postcard description. The scroll as object-setting constrains the act of chronicling and appears at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop is vivid and purposeful: silent bell, worn pine floors, copper pipes, brass gears create a sensory-specific environment. Fog functions as both atmosphere and constraint, pressing "like something wanting in" and lifting to mark Elena's internal shift. The birthing clamp screw—a small, worn object—charges the final image and links setting to theme. Micro-setting (workbench, tea cups, the screw itself) constrains attention and enables the climactic realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform constrains choice: it's a ceremonial space that demands sacred stillness and is suspended "between violence," charging the setting with thematic weight. The crow quill's "trimmed tip" recurs across multiple beats, grounding the inscription action in tactile specificity. Sensory details—ozone, rain, churning clouds, platform tremor—modulate with pressure and reflect Elara's internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout and the platform's trembling under her knee becomes a body-as-setting cue that charges the crystallizing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    The orchard and archive are well-anchored early and create atmospheric pressure via the chainsaw threat. The sheet music manuscript returns as a tangible link to their mother, and the perfume bottle recurs with sensory memory. However, the archive itself remains largely backdrop; no tool, spatial constraint, or environmental feature meaningfully alters Eleanor's tactics or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0 per the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Archive is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (spiraling galleries, stones predating light, golden helix). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara moves through it without friction. The dictionary is carried but not opened or used. Spatial choreography remains coherent, but setting functions as postcard description rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The horizon measurement station, fjord, glacier wind, and hydraulic apparatus are vividly specific and purposeful. The cold wind that makes her "eyes water" and the "razor quality" of the horizon line ground sensory experience in the present task. The mantle clock key's physical weight and the vibration of water in the vessel provide tactile micro-setting that charges the final image. The station's location "where the curvature of the earth became most measurable" constrains her seventeen-year devotion and isolates her from university colleagues, shaping the stakes of her choice to remain.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed library is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (wet stone, old paper, amber quiet). The candle lantern's mica pane recurs and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the setting does not constrain a choice in the middle—Elara's walk and subway ride are narrated in summary, and the hospital room functions primarily as backdrop. The lantern's light "catching the last of the midsummer sun" offers a purposeful sensory convergence at closure, but the environment remains more atmospheric than tactically instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The utility corridor is vividly anchored with concrete, copper, fluorescent light, and ventilation shifts that trigger the harmonica's resonance. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's eleven-year familiarity and professional lens. The harmonica disc functions as a charged recurring object whose singing marks the threshold hour and primes the ending, constraining the temporal rhythm and charging the final image with atmospheric pressure even though it does not alter a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming jetty at twilight functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: blossoms close "against the coming dark" as the archivist makes her new promise, physically mirroring the act of preservation. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through archival consciousness ("walnut ink," "mineral tang," tea-steeping metaphor). The purple light "bleeding into the water like an old photograph developing" integrates setting with professional lens. The grandmother's historical presence on this same jetty creates spatial constraint that shapes the ritual return and resonates at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crumbling platform overgrown with ivy is vividly established and returns in the final line ("this station reclaimed by ivy"), charging closure. The shattered station roof and fading light create sensory atmosphere filtered through the logistician's exhaustion. However, spatial choreography remains somewhat vague—where exactly the woman stands, how the glass container is exchanged—and the "forgotten corner of wherever they were" sidesteps concrete geography. The setting functions as liminal space thematically but does not materially constrain a mid-scene choice beyond providing a meeting point.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (tree rings read as Braille, insect vibrations) filtered through Elara's blindness, and the setting constrains perception in ways that shape her navigation. The platinum compass ring functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the environment evolves from humming frequencies to silence to the stillpoint. However, the setting does not force a consequential choice—Elara moves through it without environmental friction altering her tactics or imposing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as both setting and constraint: it distorts signals, requiring Mira's patient unraveling method and ultimately filtering noise to reveal the essential response. The pen and monitoring station are handled concretely across multiple beats, and the amber light detail adds sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location. The anomaly's properties constrain her interpretive choices and charge the final image when she realizes it "filtered" rather than "broken" the signal, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor gap: the outpost itself remains somewhat generic beyond the anomaly's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harbor's moonlight and boats function consistently as stage and witness. The vintage camera recurs (chest, heart, "empty and patient") with shifting weight, constraining nothing but charging the final image as a symbol of unrecorded memory. Spatial choreography is clean (Marina at edge, Elena in boat, approach, hands held). The "luminous" quality modulates from beauty to "presence," purposefully elevating tone at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    The Archive is described with vivid sensory detail (marble halls, burned-out lanterns, ancient smoke) but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. Mira's movement through corridors is abstract; no spatial choreography or tool use alters tactics. The vandalized portrait is a set piece rather than an environment that pressures decisions. Micro-setting option (tapestry fragment, portrait mechanisms) is mentioned but not used to force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with purpose-driven sensory specificity (harmonic ferns, bass moss, crystalline trunks); the body and the observation platform constrain Elara's perch ritual. The auric lagoon anchors the final image and reweights prior description. One minor spatial question: the lagoon is "beyond the garden's boundary" yet Elara's drumming directly affects it without clear mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly particular: "which doors stuck in humidity, which floors accumulated ice," violet storm-light on corrugated steel. Micro-setting through the annotated maps and the catwalk constrains her choices—she uses memorized routes when GPS fails. The geomagnetic storm pressures every tactic. Spatial choreography remains clear across multiple locations. The setting charges the final image: Mira on the catwalk, watching container walls shudder, embodying mastery of a space that demanded "old knowledge."

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt dock, canal water collecting fading light, and warehouse shutters with partially closed slats provide vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, constraining the guardian's method and charging the final reflection of emerging stars. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (rain-slicked surface, streetlight flicker, spiraling illumination on brick) without catalog excess. The shutters enable the light-weaving action and directly shape the boy's perceptual shift, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are introduced with vivid sensory detail ("emerged from the mist," "under starlight") but remain postcard backdrops; neither location constrains Eleanor's choices or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The window displays across town are described (teacup, door ajar, compass with two norths) but spatial choreography is absent—no bodies, distances, or movement track across the scenes. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image; the ending invokes "the amplified quiet between one starlit evening and the next" without grounding it in a concrete place or object that matters to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as active setting—"neither shore nor sea but something that contains the truth of both"—and constrains her final choice by offering a liminal space that mirrors her transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "cold, but not unkind," bioluminescence, the dock's wooden beams resonating with whale song. The harbor and water are filtered through Maren's labor-trained perception. The scrimshaw as micro-object charges the final image when laid down, and the water itself becomes the crucible that receives her.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turbines function as micro-setting, constraining choice (their hum triggers speaker interpretation of her narration) and charging the final image (she watches them turn while holding her blank face). The farmhouse's embedded speakers create tactical pressure—her dramatic narration games the system by producing "required tonal frequencies." Sensory hierarchy filters through her performer's lens: "raucous crowd," "patented expressionless smile," "rhythmic shadows." The wooden rose and knife anchor tactile, present action. Minor gap: the happiness mandate's mechanics (weekly quotas, joy centers) are told rather than pressuring an on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, humming quartz colonnade, and stone floor create vivid spatial grounding with purposeful sensory detail (cobalt light refracting, hum resonating through bones). Sensory selection reflects the poet's aesthetic priorities. However, the environment never materially constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The frozen lake's reflection in the final paragraph charges the image without enabling tactical change, sufficient for mid-6s but shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard is vividly rendered with selective detail: furnace roaring, discarded glass, the old oak. The pile of imperfect glass pieces constrains Mira's subject matter and the courtyard's spatial layout (easel near the discard pile, apprentice's workbench, her pocket) remains coherent across beats. The broken glass and fallen leaves function as micro-setting that enables her plant-language communication. However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure—the apprentice kneels beside her arrangement, but the courtyard itself does not alter tactics or charge the final image; it remains backdrop rather than constraint in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory is vividly realized through specific details (amber glow, west/east wings, acoustic historians, crystal arrays) and Elara moves through it purposefully, collecting resources. The carbide lamp lens functions as micro-setting, throwing golden shadows and remaining tactilely present across beats. Setting supplies resources that shape her work (recordings, synthesized sounds), though it does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off. The golden shadows return at the ending to charge the final image with "liquid courage," achieving a purposeful reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's marble, starlight through windows, and curtains of intention are vivid and consistent. The vellum stencil (tucked into belt, examined) functions as micro-setting and recurs at closure with tactile presence. The garden "where nothing grew because nothing needed to" supplies purposeful constraint. Spatial choreography (workshop → spiral stairs → entrance hall) tracks cleanly, and the pendant's withered flower is handled on the page, charging the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight and loft anchor the scene early and sustain atmosphere throughout. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, handled twice (Soren pulls twelve feet; later rolls it) and its numbered markings catch light, charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: rain percussion, refracted light, worn wooden floor. The broader post-crash city context is sketched but remains backdrop rather than constraint on choice in this single-room scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bronze prism pagoda is vivid and central, its prismatic facets scattering light and responding to the dance. The archive's inscribed walls and "hollow shell" metaphor establish atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The pagoda charges the final image but does not impose a spatial or material limit that the protagonist must work around.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, grounding Mira's work in a space where "blossoms grow from the ether itself, petals glowing with stored memory." The river stone functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats and charged with tactile memory. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, suspended dream-frames, footage viewer). The setting constrains Mira's role and charges the final image of her walking the aisles, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her dusk-noticer perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The misty workshop and constellation roof anchor who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. Sensory detail (mist curling, scales catching starlight, terrariums' sleeping inmates) is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens. The setting does light work at closure—mist lifting to "shimmering stillness, full of possibility"—but the body and tool (hands, needles, cloth) constrain her reconstruction choice more concretely than the atmospheric frame does. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the micro-setting (workbench, terrariums, thank-you notes) layers in purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower setting is purposeful: cold stone, spiral stairs, hidden tunnel, and the brother's handprints create spatial pressure that guides Maya's descent. Dawn's suspended quality ("neither here nor there") mirrors the threshold theme and the frosted hourglass anchors sensory detail with purpose. However, the ivy's voice and the impossibly frosted glass in autumn lack physical grounding that would make them feel materially constraining rather than symbolic conveniences. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    The projection booth, dressing-room mirror, and canister function as micro-settings that charge the vision sequences. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's gift: "hum of unused love," "jagged edges of the reel," "rotting seats and shattered glass." The booth's false floor and the act of hiding the canister supply spatial specificity that constraints the sisters' final gesture, and the lobby stairs anchor Mira's exit. The setting does not, however, constrain Mira's own choices—she navigates the space without friction.

    The aurora-lit archway is vivid and recurs, anchoring tone and the protagonist's emotional state. The astrolabe is handled across multiple beats (pressed to chest, laid across knees, grows warm), giving tactile grounding. Spatial choreography is clear (standing → lowering to stone). However, the archway never constrains a choice or alters her tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The astrolabe's "brass teeth bite into her palm" and later warmth suggest symbolic function without mechanical or causal pressure on her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "glowing dune in bloom" supplies vivid, purposeful sensory grounding and recurs with shifting meaning (opening landscape, closing mending lullaby). The bioluminescent moss functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (cart, staff, merchant's fold-entrance). The post-forest world is rendered through selective detail (glass plains, iron ruins, fungal forests) that filters through Mira's practiced route rather than encyclopedic catalog. The chess clock and archive as objects-in-motion add tactile weight.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mechanical rainforest is rendered with vivid, specific detail—silicon bark, hammered tin leaves, bronze ferns—and the sound-based navigation (trees playing melodies) is both inventive and filtered through Cyrus's philosophical attention. The tangle of rusted springs and fractured cogs functions as a spatial barrier that must be overcome, charging the closure moment when it unravels. Micro-setting (the gear in his palm each morning) recurs and gains weight. The environment constrains choice at the tangle and provides the final doorway, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    The veiled ridgeway and shore anchor the journey spatially; mist, cotton-and-shadow, and salt wind filter through the woman's urgency. The forking path and the leash's fall into the void charge the closure by constraining her final choice to one of three routes. Micro-setting (the wooden token, warm in her palm) supports the ending image. No occupation or interior-space detail is needed at this length; the ridgeway's winding indirection becomes a tactile constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, spiral staircase, and nerve-regeneration physicality create a coherent micro-setting. The bolt's weight "against his thigh" and the bronze dust trail constrain Marcus's choices: he pockets the bolt and follows the trail rather than reporting it, a micro-decision that charges the ending. The sensory hierarchy (tingling nerves amplify the bolt's "clink") filters detail through POV priorities. The fortress "settling into its winter sleep" provides atmospheric closure without forcing symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library is richly described with vivid, POV-filtered detail ("marble softening into organic curves," "moss that traced the paths of readers long turned to bone and name"). However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains postcard backdrop. The "endless corridors and forgotten chambers" are mentioned as "mechanism" but never used tactically on the page. Fails the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    The monitoring station "drifting at the confluence of two currents, anchored to the seabed... floating above the waterline" functions as both literal setting and thematic constraint, embodying the "tension between fixed and free." The console, buoys, and atlas page are handled concretely. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "bone-white beneath her," "three kilometers further inland," "too deep, too dark, too cold." The torn atlas page charges the final realization by showing the vanished bay whose redirected currents now nourish the new colony. Spatial choreography and world rules remain coherent. Setting pressures choice by revealing the unexpected formation and enabling her communicative shift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: "cold metal floor," "rusted scaffolding," "cracked skylights," and the warm stone circle create a layered environment. The stones constrain Kira's choice by offering the hum as a resource, and the "margin of daylight" filters perception ("last orange light slanting through broken windows"). Spatial choreography is clear (repair bay → circle's edge → center → exit). The piece meets the 9+ gate requirement (recurring object/environment charges the final image), but one small friction: the abandoned spaceport feels slightly generic as post-apocalyptic backdrop rather than irreplaceably specific to *this* rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse setting constrains choice (Yara tends it, plants chorus recognition) and volcanic hot springs appear at closure to underscore geologic transformation. Sensory detail (ash clouds, mineral-rich steam, foggy panes, amber fragment) is purposeful and filtered through Yara's plant-awareness. Spatial choreography remains clear despite multiple objects (kite, embryo, greenhouse). The setting participates in the final image, though the hot springs mention feels ornamental rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse and cliff-edge setting constrain multiple choices: salt-crusted isolation enables her retreat, the workbench anchors daily ritual, ceramic pots and misting tools are handled across beats. The night-blooming cereus in her palms at closure charges the final image with its ephemeral properties (one-night bloom after four years). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through trauma-aware perception (grey quiet, sea rhythm, soil resistance). The arbutus and sea thrift left wild versus the managed greenhouse wilderness creates meaningful spatial contrast that mirrors her stance toward grief.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse interior—spiraling shelves, floating books, breathing walls—constrains Mira's descent and pressures her choices; the walls' contraction teaches the pattern early and is paid off when she realizes "they had simply required her to go somewhere smaller to find something larger." The central table and the box function as micro-setting that anchors the untangling action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "salt and time," "luminescence," "light became something softer." The space evolves causally as she descends, and the "chamber where the walls curved inward" directly supports the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wind-carved encampment is vivid and purposeful: centuries-old structures smoothed by air, stone table with ink stains, perimeter marked by the drone. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through the tracker's trained perception. The ink's movement in fading light and the glowing patterns at the end charge the final image, and the artificial hummingbird drone provides a recurring anchor. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains the tracker's investigation and supplies the medium (spilled ink, stone table) for the climactic dissolution, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cryogenic library under snow is vividly established early with selective sensory anchors: "pocket of silence," "footsteps echoing...like stones dropped into a frozen well," "towering shelves of cryogenic vaults." The snow and silence recur purposefully to frame the ending's held-breath moment. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Kira faces no spatial or environmental obstacle, and the interface functions as pure enabler. The micro-setting (crystalline interface, vaults) is present but ornamental; the library's vastness and cold charge atmosphere without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass dome and desert roses create a vivid, coherent micro-setting with purposeful sensory detail (amber and rust petals, sand that "remembered water"). The setting charges the thematic contrast between enclosed sanctuary and chaotic wasteland. The ballast sandbag scrap functions as tactile anchor with historical weight. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment meaningfully frames Mira's choices, though it does not constrain a present-scene decision.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized through concrete details (crystalline spires, concentric rings of light, humming ground) and constrains Morwen's choices—he must find spots where ground hums most purely, move in zigzag patterns. The rail spike functions as micro-setting, its changing weight and temperature guiding action. Sensory hierarchy is strong: sound becomes visible, emotions transliterate to metal. The garden's disappearance by morning and return to rocky coast charges the closure image with the contrast between magical and mundane.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is vividly rendered with strong sensory anchors (cedar smell, brass telescope, rosewood texture, copper dome) and the glass dome/clouds create a charged spatial metaphor. The setting constrains her movement (seventeen flights climbed, descent with purpose) and the pen nib functions as a tactile anchor across beats. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor issue: the city "spread out like an unfinished story" at the end feels slightly ornamental rather than tactically relevant, but the body and object details do charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    Vivid atmospheric details ("amber light," "velvet pedestal," "frequency that seemed to predate sound") create texture, but the laboratory remains a collection of evocative phrases rather than a space that constrains choice. The amber piece is described but not handled across beats—it's pressed to a console once, then abandoned for coordinate-following. Spatial choreography breaks: Mira moves from door to pedestal to console to "deeper into the laboratory" to a chamber, but distances, thresholds, and the physical layout never cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (mist, ancient tiles, acoustics, central pool) and micro-setting elements (eastern tiles pooling mist differently, water stains aligning with spirals) that guide Elara's mandala work. The tile flake—its lavender glaze, warmth against her thigh—becomes a charged object that constrains her choice (interjection into the mandala center) and carries the closure resonance. The setting is body-scaled and purposeful, shaping perception and action without catalog excess. Elevates to high-8s because the environment actively charges the final image (hush rising like water, exhaling with Elara).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, and fire-scarred cityscape anchor the story's atmosphere early and consistently. The tessera—a small, handled object—functions as micro-setting that constrains Lysara's choice: she must decode its chipped patterns to perform the renaming, and its tactile presence ("weight settle into her palm like a verdict") pressures the closure beat. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("smoke-tinged dawn," "soot-blackened finger"), though some images veer toward stock lyricism ("water finding its path through scorched stone"). The spatial choreography between Lysara and Soren at the fountain's collapsed edge remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The emporium, courtyard, and orchard garden are vividly named and textured (boxwood walls, silver-tinged apples). The tarot coin is handled twice (Elara raises it, Mira touches it) and the garden's "impossible colors" charge the final image. However, the hedge maze is mentioned once without affecting access or choice, and the "hand-painted" detail remains static description. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The light-painting studio is anchored early (RGB LEDs, velvet-lined case, cold metal table) and the geode's fractal refraction under colored light provides specific sensory texture. Spatial choreography is clean (coffee on table, crystal at temple, child three rooms away, stranger three floors below). The studio does not constrain a choice, but the crystal—treated as micro-setting—does: Mira presses it to her temple and the bodily response (warmth, pulse synchronization) enables the epiphany that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, tidal pools, and mineral signatures, establishing atmosphere and voice early. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at closure; Maren floats and reflects without spatial obstacles or resource pressures that shape her final stance. The elm leaf fossil is described in exquisite detail but remains a static object of contemplation rather than a tool or constraint that charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse beneath cliffs, the honeyed glow, and the button tactility are vivid and selective. The jar's "Canyon Echo" label and the archive shelves create a coherent micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elara handles artifacts but spatial details remain atmospheric rather than causal. Sensory hierarchy fits the archival focus, but the cliffs and canyon remain postcard anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Zephyr Bluff's mist, cold stone, and snow drifts anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The snow codes constrain Elena's knowledge and the bluff's exposure pressures her choice to come into the open. The pillbox is handled twice (examination, extension) and the environment charges the final image of spring thaw. Spatial choreography is clean: Elena against stone, ally three feet away, mist enveloping both.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    The fog-bound river crossing is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the coachman's professional eye. The rain gutters provide a concrete timeframe, and the yarn needle functions as micro-setting (body/tool). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The final image charges somewhat—mist, barge, promise—but the setting's role is more symbolic than causal, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oasis (stone walls, well, dust, scorched wasteland) is vivid and purposeful, anchoring Mira's quest and supplying the lantern glass. Sensory detail is selective and layered (flattened smoke, honeyed vibration, clouded glass), filtered through Mira's perceptual priorities. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and charging the final image with its thrum. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting's resistance to fire directly mirrors theme. No occupational depth issues at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harbor, fire escape, and moonlight are vivid and purposefully filtered through Maren's professional gardener's eye. The bitting gauge tooth functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged with memory. Spatial choreography (ladder, landing, pots) tracks cleanly. The rosebush's bare branches and the oar-rhythm anchor sensory detail to the POV's grief-tempered patience. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it beautifies rather than pressures. This caps the category shy of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal library is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: ghostly volumes floating, water carrying knowledge, shelves appearing with receding tides. The brass sundial functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's discovery and charging the final image. Sensory selection is strong ("cool metal warm beneath her touch," "marble floors," "water now reaching her knees") and filtered through Elara's custodial familiarity. The environment shapes the closure image when the sundial's shadow points toward the eastern stacks, directly enabling the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and layered: "wet stone and something greener beneath," lotus petals "bruised gold," lily pads holding rainwater. The nest—a micro-object—constrains the final choice by offering architectural metaphor that shapes the installation concept. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, pond, rocks, temple courtyard). The post-storm atmosphere charges the reflective tone and recurs in the final "wet aftermath."

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The radio station is anchored early (soundproofed booth, ancient equipment, transmission array) and the astronomical charts return at key beats, qualifying as micro-setting. The charts constrain her method (she spreads them, calculates in their margins) and charge the final sequence ("trembled slightly on their hooks"). However, spatial choreography is thin—no tactile handling of dials, no sweat on the console, no embodied interaction with the equipment during the climactic counter-broadcast. The setting pressures her intellectually but not physically.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nexus chamber with "impossible geometry" and the compass point constrain Elara's navigation, shaping her final approach to the alcove. Sensory detail is vivid ("cold stone," "amber light," "wound in the stone") and filtered through her urgency. The organ sound charges the atmosphere and the compass physically warms, contributing to the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the surreal geometry claim.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The quarry in mist is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("fog rolled across stone faces," "gravel," "hollowed-out crater") and the ribbon fragment is handled twice (pressed against palm, held for emotional signature). The portable canvas and pigments appear but do not constrain choice. The fog modulates from opening to "began to thin" at closure, charging the final image with atmospheric shift that supports the ending without dictating it.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting elements (basement archives, coastal cliffs station, shipwrecked journals) are purposefully integrated and the copper nail functions as micro-setting, returned with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective (verdigris smell, waterlogged pages, wind howling) and filtered through Maren's archival priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The experimental weather station pressures the stakes thematically but does not constrain an on-page choice—Maren never visits it, uses its equipment, or navigates its layout under pressure. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is narrowly missed: the nail is held and reweighted but does not alter her tactics; the wind charges the final line but arrives as external atmosphere rather than a constraint she must work around.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain pullout, Douglas firs, and scaffold-wrapped billboard supply vivid anchors, and the glass flake's iridescent surface constrains the final reveal. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("last copper light," "luminous beads on a dark string"). The pullout itself enables the climactic discovery and the rearview-mirror closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image. However, the tunnel mouth where the hitchhiker vanishes is spatially vague—no anchors for distance, light, or the fiddler's sightline—dropping spatial choreography clarity at a pivotal beat (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and serves as both physical setting and thematic anchor; Marcus's hand along the weathered wood and the shift to dusk create sensory specificity. The train's interior divisions (lion's cage, performer's quarters) supply the territorial-marker metaphor that directly shapes Marcus's argument at closure. Spatial choreography is clean, though occupational detail (venture capital, app development) remains generic and does not constrain tactical choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory dome, spiral staircase, and research desk anchor spatial movement cleanly. Sensory detail is selective (copper gleaming, Variable Star 47 pulsing) and filtered through Elara's astronomical expertise. The daylily-pressed telegram functions as a recurring object that charges the final reflection, and the observatory setting provides professional context. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a backdrop for interiority rather than shaping action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The swirling orchard vortex, cursed lake, and ice dome are vividly rendered with specificity ("moss-slick rocks," "petrified apple trees," "fragmented rainbows"). The seed pressed into mud and the emerging green shoot at closure both constrain the druid's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (heart of vortex → water's edge → orchard path). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kaelen's focus on the magical geography.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt glade is vividly rendered—"violet earth," "silver-stemmed birches," "dusk deepened toward cobalt"—and the recurring topiary clipping is handled twice (received, then planted). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; the "static charge of the dusk air" and "humming beneath her ribcage" anchor perception in the body. Spatial choreography is clear (glade center, maze beyond, tree line). The clipping's spiral geometry and the scar on her chest constrain the final choice by providing the ritual mechanism, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized with sensory specificity (silver-white roots, golden apples glowing, damp walls) and spatial coherence maintained throughout. Micro-setting elements—the burned tarot card warming against skin, roots weaving through ribcages—constrain Elara's path and charge the final image when the card falls to the roots. Sensory selection reflects the contemplative pace appropriately. The orchard functions as both physical space and symbolic terrain without becoming postcard description; it directly enables the barter transaction that drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    The quarry office trailer is anchored early with crooked credentials and thin walls, functioning as a contained space of professional isolation. The serpentine chest and its dovetail joints provide tactile micro-setting that constrains Marcus's present focus. The speaker grille cloth scrap and its sensory residue (smoke machines, amplifier heat) anchor his past. However, the setting doesn't constrain a pivotal choice—Marcus could make the same decision in any isolated workspace. The final image references the chest's completed assessment but the trailer itself doesn't charge the closure or alter his options regarding Elko.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic arbor is vivid and constrains the narrative—its "crook of the lowest branch" provides the seed, and the suspended-between-worlds setup charges the closure image. Sensory details are selective and thematically weighted (mist, amber, pulsing warmth). The body as micro-setting (palm against bark, seed opening in her hand) effectively narrows focus and ties physicality to the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal atrium is rendered with consistent, evocative detail: brass candelabras, marble channels, wintersun through skylights, seawater rising with lunar devotion. Sensory texture is distributed across senses (salt air, soft whir of gears, shifting light patterns) and filtered through the librarian's patient gaze. The bamboo creel is handled across beats, but the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The foundry chamber appears late and functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal cave constrains Margret's choice—she must descend through the gap, handle the pearl in the pool—and charges the final image (pearl "threaded through with the colors of every abandoned hope"). Micro-setting (pool, shells at its edge, quartz floor) is purposeful and layered with prior ruins (bunker, dead orchard). Sensory hierarchy shifts from rust/resignation to crystalline silence and luminescence, reflecting her professional to emotional reorientation. The "cathedral of crystal" metaphor works; spatial choreography tracks cleanly (ladder → gap → floor → pool center). One small slip: "decades of undisturbed darkness" then "confessions etched" by "hands long dust" implies the cave was sealed, yet shells line the pool—minor logic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Vivid, purposeful detail: ivy as "green veins carrying life into old bones," graffiti as "sediment of human presence," bellows as "palimpsest of repairs." The station's decay mirrors the protagonist's state without overt symbolism. The bathroom setting constrains the discovery (graffiti can only be found here) and charges the final image (she maps the station with the same precision as rivers). Micro-setting (bellows, bathroom walls) functions as setting and drives the closure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing library supplies vivid sensory detail (mist, luminescence, humming volumes) and the watch's backward-spinning hands anchor one tactile beat. However, spatial choreography falters: the opening "library's marble steps" versus "the library where she now stood" (paragraph 3) creates unclear geography. The untitled books and door visible only through the watch constrain the final approach, lifting the score slightly, but the setting never forces a trade-off or alters her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer light, and wisteria are vivid and purposeful. The ice violin's tactile cold and the coffee grounds provide micro-setting detail. The wisteria's agency (pressing against the window, holding breath) arguably constrains Elena's attention and charges the final beat. Sensory selection is effective throughout, filtered through Elena's research lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The skyborne grotto under aurora is vivid and specific, with iridescent shadows and cascading lights creating strong atmospheric texture. Sensory detail is purposeful but leans visual; the emerald's warmth and the stone's luminescence are noted. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices—she moves freely and completes her task without spatial friction. The setting charges the final image but does not alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's particulars (limestone arches, storm clouds beneath, mist-fed succulents, ash tree) are vivid and purposeful. The scallop cloud formation charges the final recognition. The tree functions as micro-setting that enables Elara's thinking and constrains her physically ("branches thinned to twigs"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting directly enables the climactic realization, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but sensory density remains visual-dominant and the grotto's pressures are more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wind chimes function as a constraint-tool in the Thomas beat (discordant pattern cracks his defense) and return at dawn to signal "something new," charging the final image. The lighthouse, cliff edge, and dawn setting are vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (pink fingers of light, damp grass, breeze). Spatial choreography is clean. The mirror shard and chimes constrain tactics and supply resources, lifting this above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock, pond, sycamores, and starlight are vividly rendered and establish clear spatial relations. The stone—handled twice, first by researcher then Mina—serves as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains the teaching method. Sensory detail is purposeful: "mossy bank," "mountain wind," "darker than the sky it reflected." The magnetic grotto is named but remains abstract, never grounding how it relates to the visible platform or altering any tactic. This keeps the piece shy of 7.5+ where environment would more directly shape a mid-scene choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, dust layers, and bird flights are vivid and selective, filtered through the protagonist's centuries-long vigil. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the tower interior, hollow windows, and ledges track cleanly. The arrowhead in her palms and the settling dust constrain her stillness and charge the navigation imagery. The environment subtly mirrors her stasis and expansion of awareness, meeting the 9+ gate criterion (environment constrains choice and charges the final image) but pervasive ornamental description in the final third lowers momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spire's "crystalline walls etched with frost," "perpetual stratus," and "climate-controlled precision" ground the setting early and contrast sharply with the unmapped garden's "geometries that shouldn't have been possible." Lingering luminance and the keystone's warmth constrain Mira's attention and prime the mist-walking choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the corridor, platform, and final garden descent. The icebound spire charges the closure image by offering the antithesis—organic folly architecture—that completes her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken library is rendered with vivid specificity: "cathedral hush," "Cerulean Promise," water "impossibly still," books on shelves marked with captains' names. The setting constrains Elias's visits to low tide windows and supplies the physical space where the synesthetic vision occurs. The meteor visible through the collapsed ceiling triggers the pivotal shift, making environment causally active. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the pier lamps in the opening/closing frame the search with occupational texture. Minor deduction: the library's interior could be more tactilely grounded—Elias floats and observes but rarely manipulates objects or navigates obstacles that test his movement.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ambered observatory deck is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (honeyed gold light, weathered table). The contracted universe provides an intriguing frame, and the coins function as a tactile micro-setting element. However, the setting doesn't constrain Kira's choice at closure—she could perform this ritual anywhere. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the atmosphere consistently supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory at cliff's edge with shattered dome and brass table is vividly rendered and constrains the action—Melencolia spreads the atlas there, the scattered light charges the monsters' reweighting. Sensory detail (amber light, violet sky, rainbows on stone) is selective and reflects her perceptual priorities. The recurring object (atlas page) charges the final image when she names the creatures, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sapphire viaduct is visually vivid and spatially coherent (center, railing channels, stone basins, blue glow), and the setting's moisture (morning dew, dripping water) directly enables the repair method. The viaduct's ancient light is absorbed by the bell, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (irregular drip intervals, blue-to-noonday-sky color shift), filtered through the mage's patient observation. The micro-setting (body, bell, water droplets) constrains the repair choice and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ridgeway, exposed foundations, and emerging street signs create a coherent spatial stage. The sapphire label functions as micro-setting—its vivid blue "refusing to be washed clean" charges the final image and constrains Elara's interpretive choice (evidence that memory endures). Sensory detail is selective: "cracked spine of asphalt visible beneath dwindling shallows," "whitewashed and painted in colors she had forgotten." The wind chime falling silent provides a concrete time marker. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout theночь traverse.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard, waterfall, and starlings anchor setting vividly with recurring sensory markers (rainbow light, mist, twilight). Spatial choreography is coherent—Mira kneels, raises the crystal, watches birds overhead. However, the environment remains largely descriptive; it does not constrain her choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The crystal's transformation responds to her internal shift rather than a spatial or temporal pressure, keeping setting in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The noctilucent observatory is vivid and specific: "no walls, only a railing of weathered wood and a roof of open night." The arbor anchors the narrator's isolation and the cold front's visibility. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, handled twice with evolving charge. The setting pressures the narrator's helplessness (can see but not reach) and the storm cell's position drives the heading revision, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating rock dojo, upward-falling leaves, and ceremonial blade establish vivid atmosphere and are filtered through the protagonist's post-ego-death lens. However, the environment remains decorative; no spatial constraint or tool property pressures a choice. The blade "cuts through pretense" metaphorically but never encounters resistance or physical consequence that would narrow options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is named and its acoustic function explained, but spatial choreography remains vague—how far, what materials, how the household connects to the tunnel are never anchored. Sensory detail leans heavily visual/aural without embodied particulars (temperature, texture, exertion). The setting does constrain the method (amplification) but does not alter a choice or charge the final image with new meaning, capping the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen garden in mist is vividly rendered and consistently maintained (mist thickens/thins, ice-covered bench, fog). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though weighted almost entirely toward the visual and abstract. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the protagonist's final action; it functions as backdrop and symbol rather than tactical pressure. The pendant's warmth contrasts with the cold, but this does not shape the guardian's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus at twilight is vivid and atmospheric—"constellation of dying coals," "frozen bloom," frost creeping across stones—and sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The embers function as micro-setting, constraining Mara's method (she must breathe life into them, place fragments at their center), and the "frozen bloom" motif returns to charge the final image as warmth radiates outward. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where is the ridge, how far is the mountain descent?), and the transformation of the nexus into "a new star" leans toward symbolic convenience rather than grounded physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The radio tower city and observation hut are vividly anchored with sensory detail (rusted ladder, swaying platform, copper wiring) and the fragment's hum functions as a tangible constraint. The lunar perigee tightens the atmospheric window, and the gorge depth is felt. The setting does not, however, force a spatial or resource-based choice at closure—Mara's descent at dawn is transit, not a constrained decision shaped by the environment's properties.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.7)
    The spectral grotto, sideways stars, and flickering hull create vivid, purpose-driven sensory anchors filtered through Maren's familiarity ("particular electricity," "quality of silence between stars"). The empty hourglass, ferry rail, and radio function as micro-setting elements that recur and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. Deduct −0.2 for the grotto fading into "ordinary night sky" at closure, which undercuts the world's established instability without causal explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The optical illusion gallery pressures perception throughout: mirrors lag and anticipate, walls breathe, light fractures into questions. The sinew thread's phosphorescence and the gallery's recalibration are not postcard details—they alter her perceptual field and shape the weaving action. The final image charges when "optical illusions around her resolved into perfect clarity, showing her not what was there but what was possible," making environment a co-agent of the closure reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The benthic city setting is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent haze, crystalline research tower, amber laboratory light, miles of filtering ocean. Spatial choreography is clear (descent → lab entrance → calculation chamber → journey home), and the environment pressures Mira's project by transforming starlight into scattered, edge-softened photons. The anchor-link object recurs with tactile grounding (cold metal against ribs, secured to belt, taken in hand), charging the final image. The setting's constraint on navigation—dense water folding stars into distant memory—directly shapes the central conflict and method.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight anchors mood and stakes effectively. The observation room with "equipment sensitive enough to register frequencies" functions as micro-setting that enables the plot turn. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the final beat ("the place where the girl had last stood") introduces an unmarked location. The hearing aid as object-setting charges the closure attempt, lifting the score above pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    The flooded facility, dry laboratory paradox, and copper cables create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The codex with gold flecks constrains Maren's choice at the climax, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear through the swim and lab discovery, with sensory detail filtered through Maren's claustrophobic POV effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal observatory, snow-blanketed valley, and frosted window are rendered with specificity and constrain Mira's isolation effectively. The ink on the central table functions as micro-setting, shaping the ritual action. However, spatial choreography within the observatory remains vague—Mira moves from window to table without clear intermediary staging—and the Comforter constellation feels ornamental rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon, towers of bone, and tunnel of echoes create a vivid, purposeful environment. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara moves down the path, the birds descend, she stops at the tunnel mouth. The diamond's changing temperature and the birds' formations integrate setting with action. The environment charges the final image—echoes accumulate, birds respond—qualifying for mid-7s; it does not strictly constrain a choice with visible trade-off, capping further upward movement.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underground garden's gravitational playfulness (water trickling upward, floating soil) constrains spatial choreography and charges the final image when Mira rises off the ground. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (bioluminescent moss, frost-tasted air), filtered through Mira's scientific lens. The flint arrowhead and cordless phone are handled as tactile anchors. However, the herbalist and the "first peoples" backstory remain expository gestures without spatial or choice pressure, and the creature's emergence from walls lacks clear physical staging.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The orchard, sky-bridges, and locust shell are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("honey and forgotten storms," "translucent amber"). The orchard setting supplies the statues and constrains Elara's path, shaping the closure image when the statues step aside. However, spatial choreography within the orchard is vague—we never learn how far she walks or what physical obstacles she navigates—and the body as micro-setting is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered with its "tinted glass catching the last copper light of dusk" and functions as neutral ground where families gather, grounding the border tension in concrete space. The fence visible through windows and the scarred wooden counter that has "served as a mail drop for three regimes" anchor the setting's history and current function. However, the arcade's game machines and the bottle's miniature storm remain descriptive rather than constraining—Marcus's movements and choices would play identically in any neutral meeting point. Sensory detail is selective and POV-appropriate, though the dusk lighting does not pressure the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The train-as-workshop anchors early with sensory specificity (sawdust, aged velvet, wind bells). The hidden oasis—moss, spring, ancient pines—provides a spatial constraint that isolates the discovery beat and charges the halo fragment with otherworldly luminosity. The halo's filigree detail and pulsing response to song constrain the carpenter's reverent handling and signal its sacred function, shaping his final commitment. Micro-setting (the fragment itself as object-setting) charges the closure image when he "simply held the fragment and let the silence speak."

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hyperbolic library is vividly particular—walls curving inward, parallel lines meeting, Stack Section 7.14—and Miriam's profession filters detail through decades of learned observation. The circular reading room constrains the ritual spatially, and the scarf's glow casts geometric patterns that charge the ending image. Micro-setting (the treatise on folded space, the scarf's placement) supports the closure moment, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate criteria by shaping the final image, though the library's impossible angles remain more decorative than decision-forcing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archipelago's whispering corridors, the cliffside library, and the sunrise window all anchor Mira's odd-hour schedule and supply the recurring light that enables vitalization. The watercolor palette functions as a micro-setting object, constraining her work to sunrise and charging the final image when morning light finds the hung photograph. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("wind carried voices through stone corridors," "palette whose wells held colors that seemed to absorb light"). Spatial choreography across the library stacks and her desk remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The garden setting is vivid and purposeful: "temperature shift...denser," the dry fountain with "small bones," and the crumbled wall anchor the locksmith's choices. The nocturnal timing (dusk to dawn) and the first star guide her spatially and symbolically. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—she kneels, opens the pouch, and finds the sentence without obstacle. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a patient, observant POV; the recurring star and ribbon-wrapped hair charge the final image without forcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken greenhouse, kelped wrecks, and drowned orchard create a vivid, particular setting with strong sensory detail (cold water, pale mushroom glow, scattered starlight). The fairy ring and Heron constellation constrain Elias's method—he can only recover memories when the constellation aligns—giving the environment functional weight. However, the setting does not visibly complicate his choice at closure; he retrieves what he came for and exits without spatial or environmental friction reshaping his final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library, afternoon light, dust motes, and the shadow caught in glass create vivid anchors. The tea-table setup and too-big chairs function as micro-setting that grounds the children's vulnerability. However, none of these elements constrains a pivotal choice or charges the final image with necessity—removing the glass shadow or tea would not break the closure logic. Sensory selection is purposeful (light, creaking swing) but remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall mist, and stone alcove are vividly anchored and sensory-specific ("worn smooth by centuries," "ash from a fire...where dragons had once dreamed"). The setting pressures Elara's work through its liminal geography (worlds overlapping) and the alcove becomes the necessary vessel for planting. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The waterfall's "song" charges the final image, swelling in recognition, which elevates the setting's role at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary, crystal shards, and starlight anchor the setting vividly and texture the mood throughout. The net itself functions as micro-setting: Mira handles it, works the knots, and the object's physical state constrains her night-long labor. The final image of prisms casting fractured light charges the closure by linking light's transformation to the spirit's unmasking. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere is strong, though spatial choreography could be tighter—where exactly is the net in her lap relative to the vaulted ceiling and eastern aperture?

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fresco vault is vividly rendered ("faces and patterns running like tears through the plaster") and the rain-scoured detail anchors the setting in sensory specificity. The henge's geometry and the hidden passage constrain Elena's access, shaping her tactical choices. However, the environment functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a force that pressures the final image; the ascent and dawn light close the piece descriptively rather than charging the closure with spatial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Montserrat library and submersible setting are vivid and purposeful: bookshelves "softened by decades of gentle decay," pages "fluttering in slow motion." The snow globe as micro-setting constrains Miriam's choice to unseal it and charges the final image. However, the setting does not meaningfully narrow options during the descent or discovery—Miriam's actions would read nearly the same in any wreck. The deep-ocean specifics are rendered with care but function more as atmosphere than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The misty courtyard, tower servers, and phosphorescent graffiti are vivid and atmosphere-rich, filtered through Mira's balladeer attention. The flower press bolt plate—handled twice (pressed to ear, recognized as heirloom)—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image by linking past and present singers. Spatial choreography remains clear (courtyard, walls, server heart). The "liminal place where earth dissolved into ether" and "between lightning and thunder" timeframe subtly tighten the window for ghost communication, constraining when Mira can encode and sing. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (sound-focused POV), though some details ("theink from crushed cloudberries") feel ornamental rather than tactically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The brass elevator, frosted glass panels scattering light, and the observation deck's "frozen splendor of the clouds" create a coherent airship-era atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clean: Mira holds goggles, pries open the compartment, reads while ascending, then steps onto the deck. The elevator's groaning cables and the shuddering at the sixth floor embed tactile detail without postcard excess. The setting constrains choice via the ascending timeframe and the light shift that enables cipher-breaking, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gondola, telescope, and mountain pass are vividly anchored and purposefully deployed. The suspended platform mirrors Miriam's liminal state; the telescope filters perception through her father's legacy. Sensory detail ("dusty starlight particles," "cable connecting this floating platform") is selective and POV-filtered. The telescope and gondola constrain and enable her work, charging the closure image with spatial symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly rendered with internal spiral staircases and the smell of dry knowledge, and spatial choreography remains clear as Mira climbs to the ceiling. The coin's worn surface and faint indentations constrain her perception and guide her brushwork, charging the final image. Setting detail is filtered through Mira's pattern-recognition lens rather than tourist catalog, and the demolition equipment creates time pressure that affects pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The airship setting is vivid and purposeful: brass porthole, creaking timbers, iron stairs, observation gallery, and running lights all ground Mira's movements and discovery. The hopscotch board—etched into the floor, "dusty," "faded but unmistakable"—provides the geometric key and charges the final synthesis. Sensory detail is selective and integrated into action. The starlings, rigging luminescence, and chronometer constrain and enable her work, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape choice and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library and hall of mirrors are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("solidified mist," "hauntingly bright," "frozen light"). The mirrors function as more than backdrop: they reflect her past, accept the gears, and open the passage, directly enabling the closure beat. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles → spiral stairs → central mirror → passage). The "hauntingly bright" mirrors charge the final image and constrain her approach, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating arches, silver-leafed canopy, and mist-shrouded valley edges create a vivid, alien orchard world with purposeful sensory detail (tarnished brass bell, chapped lips, broken stone paths). The bell tower and garden constrain the community's final action—ringing the bell summons clouds—satisfying the 9+ gate for setting pressure. However, spatial choreography during the restoration montage remains vague (who carries water from where, which paths are cleared), and the setting feels more postcard than lived-in toolkit.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hidden lighthouse and clock mechanism are vividly rendered with sensory and mechanical specificity. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The "pane of hush" is described but never manipulated or used to shape the final act. Spatial choreography is clear, and the purple-hour dusk creates coherent tone, but the environment remains ornamental to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cliffside path, white stone labyrinth, and mechanical birds create a vivid micro-geography that constrains movement—Mira's boots find purchase "where the stone had worn smooth from generations," grounding her expertise in erosion. The nut's textured surface ("offhandedly exact in its geography") and the stone depression shape the climactic choice. Sensory selection stays sharp: brass eyes catching light, frost threat, warm darkness of the opened stairway. The orchard itself reads more symbolic than spatial, slightly reducing total integration, but the labyrinth's texture-and-temperature navigation (each stone "a different texture, a different temperature, a different age") charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The braided ravine functions as both literal setting and thematic anchor, with foam patterns providing the concrete stimulus for Miriam's insight ("spirals within spirals, geometries that seemed deliberate"). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her chemist's lens ("surfactants created these temporary structures"). The chrysalis, handled twice (pocketed at opening, examined at water's edge, re-pocketed at close), constrains her pilgrimage and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (coordinates, six-hour drive, kneeling at water's edge), and the molecular language (polymer chains, surface tension) reflects POV priorities without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: crystalline branches, obsidian trunk, frosted quartz counter, bottled moonlight casting prismatic shadows. These elements constrain the vendor's movement and perception throughout. The bottles function as micro-setting, present in multiple beats and reweighted at closure when she arranges three on the counter. The swirling sea of clouds and perpetual twilight charge the final image of impossibility and potential.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coral pavilion's impossible architecture—ice formations beneath desert dunes, pools holding "liquid moonlight"—is vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the three-day sequence, and the tidal pool formations function as both setting detail and interpretive tool that constrains Miriam's method. The pavilion's weight and brittleness directly shape her final understanding, charging the closure image. Sensory selection (touch, temperature, visual coral branches) fits the POV and advances pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The grain elevators, clock tower, and silos anchor the setting with purposeful detail that reflects community barriers. The astronomical dials and Ukrainian handkerchief carry specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining on-page choice—the tower's mechanics are told in summary ("The repair itself required...") rather than dramatized with spatial or tool-based friction that would push this into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit canyon is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("enormous fault," "fine red sand," "silver and shadow") and the periscope mirror's "multi-layered quality" and "depth" constrain Mira's attention effectively. The switchback setting shapes the discovery beat (object half-buried at the turn). However, the environment doesn't constrain the climactic transformation—Mira kneels and works "through the night" without the canyon's geometry affecting her tactics or the modification's difficulty. The final image uses the canyon to visualize abandoned dreams but doesn't charge the closure with spatial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The inverted grotto is vivid and purposeful: moisture falls upward, markings emerge only under inversion, three mouth-shaped passages create spatial decision points. The setting constrains choice (she must act within one hour, choose a passage) and charges the final image (markings retreat into stone). Sensory selection is strong—silver ribbons, stone warmth, mist forming letter-shapes—and filtered through Calyx's archivist lens. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the serpentine ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The siskin alder grove is anchored early with specific flora, moss-covered earth, fallen logs, and a natural amphitheater formed by three close-growing alders. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "white surface dulled by decades of weather," "loam," "hairline fractures," wind-sculpted trunks. The grove's structure directly constrains and enables the climactic choice—Elara positions herself at the center where the alders create acoustics. The insulator as micro-setting object also qualifies: its stress cracks become the mechanism for sound production, charging the final image. Scope fits; no occupational systems are forced beyond what the scene requires.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered through sensory detail—"invisible forces compressed and expanded like breath held too long," "stones beneath his feet hummed." The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image ("magnetic currents shift beneath his feet like an exhalation finally released"), creating a coherent spatial and metaphorical anchor. However, the nexus does not constrain any on-page choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric mirror rather than active pressure, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop under stars is anchored early and returns with sensory detail (frosted glass, red firework light on walls). The brass dial and frequency resonator function as micro-setting tools that Mira manipulates across multiple beats, constraining her method and charging the final moment when she tunes to the clasp's note. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional bias (auditory focus dominates), and spatial choreography is clear. The setting does not evolve causally—no object state changes or environmental shifts alter tactics—but the recurring tool (resonator) and the fireworks' temporal pressure meet the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mosshaven's treetop setting constrains Kalia's work (hanging gardens, greenhouse for the corpse flower) and the olfactory environment pressures her sensitive nose throughout. The corpse flower itself functions as micro-setting, its evolving scent forcing her to "breathe through aversion" in concrete ways. Sensory hierarchy is strong: smell dominates perception, filtered through her herbalist training. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (platform, healing house, greenhouse). The setting charges the closure by providing the physical greenhouse space where transformation occurs, though the "mysterious" village remains somewhat generic beyond its verticality.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock arches, water spirals, and porous stone create vivid, selective detail filtered through Cora's professional attention. The arrow tip embedded in ironwood constrains her physical choice (reaching through viewport) and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the inversion sequence. The "whirling silence" and sensory hierarchy—ache in inner ears, pressure in teeth—ground the surreal in body and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with rust streaks, numbered paint, and wind-tunnel acoustics that ground spatial choreography. The amphitheater convergence point functions as both discovery site and physical constraint that shapes Mira's investigative path. Sensory selection is strong (fog pressing instruments, metal groans, particulate density) and filtered through professional priorities. The environment directly enables the plot turn—stacked containers amplifying airflow into a weapon—elevating it beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered ("frozen lung," "fossilized snow," crystal-bell architecture) and sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The aurora functions as both setting feature and mechanism, constraining Yara's synesthetic method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (bell, amber sheet on ice altar) participates in the ending, lifting Q3 above mid-band despite the lack of on-page tactical pressure from the environment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Thunder-echo range actively constrains Kira's choices: the "constant reverberation made ordinary speech impossible," forcing solitude and reflection. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("dust motes that floated… like tiny suspended worlds"), filtered through Kira's grief-laden attention. The driftwood markers, canyon convergence, and "filtered light" create a micro-setting that charges the final image when Kira arranges markers "in a pattern that mirrored the constellation." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The environment earns high marks by shaping both tactics (silence, marker placement) and the closure beat (constellation pattern as orientation act).

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    The topaz workshop, amber light, and roofless space are vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through Maren's seventeen-year familiarity and the cosmic event. The halo fragment as micro-setting object constrains her final choice (she holds it, borrows from it, becomes transparent). Spatial choreography is clean within the single location, and the vanishing stars create a temporal-atmospheric frame that charges the ending. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is met by the fragment's dissolution, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridgeway, aurora, and pendant anchor setting vividly; frost-dusted pines and patchwork valley provide spatial grounding. The aurora actively constrains the encounter—Mira steps "out of the northern lights themselves"—charging the closure image with visual specificity. Sensory detail is selective (wind tugging cloak, cold seeping through gloves) and filtered through Elara's courier eye. Minor: the overlook functions as stage rather than tactical constraint; no physical choice (climb higher, retreat, handle the pendant differently) is shaped by the environment's affordances.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quartz arbor, mist, moss-covered stone, and abandoned car are vividly rendered and texturally specific. The prism refracts light to reveal "interference patterns," and the frost feathers contain "tiny bubbles of sentiment"—concrete details that anchor the mystical practice. The arbor functions as micro-setting: it holds grief and joy, constraining Mira's practice to this single charged location and shaping her final realization that she has merged with the architecture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and sensory selection (cold seeping through bones, milky quartz catching grey light) reflects Mira's attentive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    The orchard and loom are described lyrically but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is absent: we never learn the loom's position relative to the trees, the workbench layout, or how the spinner moves. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and abstract ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") without grounding in smell, temperature, or tactile immediacy. The bamboo forest and apple trees are postcard elements that do not pressure the action. Capped at 7.0 per Q2 orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock arches are vivid and repeated, their "indifferent drift" bracketing the story and charging the final image with "azure defiance." The mine shafts, Magician's Silk lattice, and downward-growing roots supply concrete constraints that shape Cael's tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"blackened fingers reaching," "roots that sang when struck"—and the setting evolves causally from ruin to recovery. The arches' role as both motif and atmospheric anchor elevates the score, though they do not directly constrain a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The repair bay is rendered with strong sensory specificity: "residual vibrations," "grief embedded in a corridor," the crane's empty cradle. Spatial choreography is clear through Kira's ascent of the catwalk. The green shard pressed against the control panel becomes a micro-setting element that enables the membrane-thinning, directly shaping the closure beat. The setting constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the murmur of half-remembered dreams as timeframe/setting overlay remains abstract and ornamental in most beats, capping the score in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lantern room's feverish stones and "ghost of the great lamp's heat" supply atmospheric pressure. Sea glass and stone stacks recur with spatial coherence (dock, supply room, stairs, lantern room). The lighthouse-as-mourner conceit colors perception but does not constrain a tactical choice at the closure beat; Maren's final stone placement unfolds without environmental obstacle. Occupational detail (supply skipper, weekly provisions) anchors plausibly but remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and star-sea setting constrain the keeper's ritual and charge the final image with purposeful specificity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("velvet case," "green fire," "black water"). The lighthouse's ancient purpose and post-newspaper timeframe frame the keeper's isolation, though the setting does not force a single pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock tea house is vivid and specific, with valley mists and mountain winds anchoring the spatial frame. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting: Yuen tilts it, watches light shift across it, and the iridescence charges the final image. The tea house itself, however, remains descriptive backdrop—it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The body (his new heart) is mentioned but never embodied in a way that shapes a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower parapet, sextant, and moonlight constrain her method and charge the middle beat when the labyrinth "comes apart in her vision." Storm, scent of wet earth, and the treeline anchor mood and guide her attention. The sextant's transformation under moonlight enables the key action. However, the final descent is untethered to spatial or environmental friction—no locked door, no weather cost—so setting does not constrain the closure choice as tightly as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific sensory details (mica windows, phosphorescent roots, silver bark). The mica windows function actively in two beats: they "trembled" and refract impossible light, then shatter to release dawn. The setting constrains Elara's work (the greenhouse is the last light) and charges the final image when the windows break inward, suspending shards that amplify the dawn. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bookbinder façade, Thai restaurant, Philosophy of Errors section, and the midnight transformation provide clear spatial and temporal anchors. The crumpled invitation functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and is physically handled (unfolded, smoothed against knee), constraining Mira's present attention and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (dust motes, amber lamp, dimming lights at midnight) and filtered through Mira's reflective POV. The setting enables her withdrawal and frames the Society's ritual pressure, meeting the bar for one scene's grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The overgrown palace courtyard, tea house, jasmine vine, and flagstones are vividly rendered and reflect Elara's priorities (trained vines, woven broom, restored fountain). The butterfly chrysalis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her restoration lens. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library is vividly anchored with frosted glass, frost-etched marble, quartz hush, and the perpetual twilight. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the archivist's professional attention (the "gentle hum of the mechanism," the slides' glow). The environment constrains her movements ("even the smallest disturbance could send ripples") and charges the final image (clouds beneath stars, the archive holding its breath). The setting functions as both pressure and resonance chamber, elevating the piece into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    The pirate market setting is vivid and purposeful: "salt and kerosene," "rotting pier," "hidden exits" create coherent spatial logic and the thinning crowd signals the approaching deadline. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, its physical presence ("cold against her palm," then "warming against her thigh") charging the final image. However, the market itself does not constrain Mara's choice at closure; she could conduct this exchange anywhere. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency appropriately as the market empties and dawn approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and compass are vivid and recur across beats. The compass constrains Mira's method (tasting tin) and charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's luminescent perception. Spatial choreography (Mira descending stone, Seren emerging from tree line) remains clear. The forests' elections supply atmospheric pressure but do not directly shape a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with prismatic light, cathedral columns, and mineral rain atmosphere that mirrors both sorrow and creative potential. The platform, dried petals, and unfinished canvas are concrete and discoverable. The crystals shift to cast light directly onto the canvas, supplying the moment for Mira's choice. Micro-setting (charcoal beneath fingernails, the lock's weight and fused tumblers) adds embodied texture. The environment constrains and enables: Mira must descend to this hidden space to find the portrait and face the remedy Elena left.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse city under toxic sky is vivid and purposeful: "growing upward, growing inward," succulents that "learned to survive on memory of water," gold leaf catching light "like small suns." Micro-setting details (zinc plate, oilskin, warped timber, candlelight in tunnels) are filtered through Mira's calligrapher's attention and constrain her journey. The final image—"the room became a garden again"—charges the closure by transforming the setting's barrenness into a space of renewed growth. Spatial choreography (workbench, lower levels, tunnels, hidden room) tracks clearly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Whispering Bluff is vividly anchored with sensory specificity: "wind pressed against the rocks and returned transformed," "clouds drifted past like thoughts," iceberg fragment "blue as preserved midnight." The fragment itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the sculpture's design and charging the final image with its preserved color. Spatial choreography is clean; the bluff, the sculpture, and Juniper's arrival are legibly staged. Sensory detail is consistent and filtered through Elara's priorities as a tuner, though the piece leans heavily on visual metaphor and occasionally drifts into abstraction ("quality of attention in their gaze").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass dome, desert roses with tangled roots/cables, and Cara's rebuilt hands all constrain choice and charge the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered: the humming glass, nighttime fragrance, curling petals seeking lost north. The roses' nutrient regulators corrupted by magnetic shift drive the central crisis. Micro-setting (the maintenance alcove, the box buried beneath circuits) functions purposefully. The dome standing intact at closure bookends the spatial stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with "sandstorm calm" and "worn stone tiles," creating a coherent spatial anchor. The mailbox with its scratched lock provides tactile detail that matters to the mystery. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—the courtyard never pressures Elena's choices or supplies resources that alter her tactics. The body and tools remain underutilized; Elena's physical interaction with objects is mostly observational.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    The flooded laboratory supplies vivid sensory anchors—black water, rusted stalactites, submerged corridors—and the draining chamber provides a physical marker of progress. Spatial choreography is coherent; Mira's descent and dance positions are legible. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint (pressure, oxygen, structural collapse) forces a tactical choice. The spider's web recurs but remains ornamental until the final paragraph, where it mirrors the encryption theme without altering Mira's options.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.4)
    The salt crystal chamber is vivid and specifically detailed (jagged formations, fluctuating gravity, "gleaming silence"). Spatial choreography is coherent through the descent and movement between gravity pockets. The setting constrains Mira's route (she must read coffee grounds to navigate) and the densest pocket pulls her toward the final crystal, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the whale on the beach, the flooded cemetery, and the dockside lanterns remain ornamental backdrops that do not pressure the present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal brook setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ghost-mote breath, water whispering to stone, frogs falling quiet). The environment subtly constrains the summoner's method: she kneels at the water's edge, uses the brook's rhythm to guide her ritual, and the wing's movement on the current provides spatial closure. While the setting shapes the ritual's texture and charges the final image, it doesn't force a tactical choice under pressure, placing it just below the essential band.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the antique desk with its seal-impression, the third-floor corner window facing east, the rooftop garden under the meteor shower all recur and charge the final image. The piece filters environment through Elena's architectural lens, and the buildings themselves "lean inward, eager to hear" at the climax, functioning as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The accumulative mode means environment reweights meaning rather than physically blocking paths, which the piece executes well enough to pass the 9+ gate test (recurring object charges the final image).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet garden is anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("jasmine's blossoms already surrendering their fragrance"). The shell's "interior curves" and "tiny acoustic chambers" ground the fantastical premise in tactile specificity. However, the garden itself does not constrain Mira's choice—she could conduct this listening anywhere quiet. The timeframe (twilight to dawn) tracks cleanly but the spatial choreography within the garden (kneeling among roots, adjusting grip) remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.4)
    The marble sanctuary and aurora are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("pearl twilight," "stalactites dripped their patient measure"). The heritage rose thorn functions as a charged micro-object in the final image, and the eastern apse's crumbling wall constrains Yuki's approach. However, spatial choreography during the night's work remains vague—no concrete detail of brush, ink, or physical document handling grounds the restoration process. The setting's beauty risks postcard description in the opening, though the crumbling wall earns a constraint point.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine nexus, three riverbeds, starlight, and seashell are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and POV filter (forty seasons of listening, canyon echoes). The seashell constrains Elara's method (listening device) and returns warm at the climax, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment structures the ritual timing. Micro-setting (body, shell, stone markers) functions purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with candles, ice walls, and "borrowed starlight," and the physical setting (diving through wreck's "cathedral ribs," the snow globe on the plinth) anchors the reader in a specific, textured space. However, the environment remains largely descriptive; it does not constrain her choices or shape her investigation tactics—she could conduct this work anywhere with access to dreamers and the globe. The shrine functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that pressures decisions or charges the final image, keeping it mid-band despite strong sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The whispering parapet, flooded paddies, and moon paths anchor setting vividly with sensory detail filtered through Yuki's philosophical attention. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its weight and split prongs carry her mother's hidden effort and charge the whistle moment. The parapet's coolness and the fireflies' dance constrain her midnight vigil and her final act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; no tourist-catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard-as-paradox (thriving canopy amid radioactive dust) recurs and charges the final image when Mira watches the trees sway without breaking. The flawed diamond's inclusions constrain the investigative turn by encoding data. Micro-setting of shredded letters provides tactile detail ("archaeological rhythm of reconstruction, matching paper fibers"). The wasteland perimeter and dust storms frame pressure but do not alter tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt glass portico is vivid and specific, anchoring the space and returning with reweighted meaning (glowing, humming, cracking). The observatory setting—storm below, obsidian sky, lightning—creates palpable atmosphere and the portico constrains Elara's perception and final revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold brass, electrically-charged air, veins/rivers metaphor). Minor: the storm's "deliberate" shape and "communicative" quality veer toward anthropomorphism without tight POV anchoring, but the portico as micro-setting object charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral loft and coastal setting are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (rusted ladder, broken windows framing the sea, sand and salt reclaiming the shed). The music box's swollen wood and rusty key provide tactile grounding. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the loft's "wild energy" does not constrain the poet's movements or choices in the key beats. The jars are described but not handled or opened on the page in ways that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting details are selective and purposeful: the drift-ice marina, the copper cradle, the sunset's molten gold all anchor the scene and create atmospheric pressure. The crystal's housing and the key's "precisely machined surface" constrain Maren's choice by requiring vibrational tuning, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (breath crystallizing, ice groaning, sonic absolution rippling outward), and the frozen sea foundation integrates with the plot. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the spiral stairs and lamp room.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("warmth that rose from deep within the earth," "ice spoke in groans and cracks"). Spatial choreography is clear and the lake's reflective properties function in the moon-path tracking. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Kira moves freely, and the setting remains decorative backdrop rather than a pressure point that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tunnel setting is vividly rendered with specific detail (watermark twenty feet up, failed support beam, tile walls) and constrains Elena's physical movement and investigative access. The lantern functions as both tool and historical anchor, though its brass surface and flame work primarily as atmospheric detail rather than tactical constraint at the closure moment. Sensory hierarchy is maintained (clinical headlamp vs. lantern's dancing shadows) and the post-drought water transformation credibly motivates the discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair shop is anchored early with micro-setting details (west-facing window, worn workbench, tools in diminishing order) that constrain Thomas's ritual and rhythm. The clockwork heart—"no larger than a walnut"—functions as object-as-setting and charges the final image when its ticking "fills the shop with sound like light breaking through storm clouds." Sensory selection is purposeful: afternoon light shifts "in ways that reminded him of confessionals," filtering Thomas's POV and priming the thematic turn. The prison corridors are named but not used to pressure a choice, functioning more as backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The acid-sea workshop is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail (brass fittings, canvas sails, acid mist cycles) and the kaleidoscope constrains the protagonist's method throughout. Sensory selection is filtered through the cart glider's mechanical perspective, creating a coherent perceptual signature. The arrow tip's physical interaction (holding it "at just the right angle," fitting it into the scope's base slot) shapes the climax directly, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: the workshop's cathedral-of-motion grandeur is described more than it pressures choice in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sublevel server farm and its "echo of forgotten songs" establish atmosphere and constrain Maren's investigation spatially. The patch image (seven-star constellation) recurs and charges the final beat when Maren "understood that the numbers were not a code to break but a door to leave open," linking object to closure decision. Sensory detail (humming servers, forty-seven-second loops) is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through Maren's archival focus. Micro-setting (the archive itself) acts as a character constraint, shaping where she can look and what she can find.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the orchard in impossible soil, ice floes that "shifted and groaned like sleeping giants," and the vintage store materializing where bones once lay all anchor Mira's world. The fragment charges the final image, and the ice softening for safe passage ties environment directly to closure consequence. Spatial choreography inside the store is clear—upturned crate, mirrors, fragment—though the lighthouse-to-store transition elides distance and time without signaling the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid and purposeful: ice grinding "like distant bells," the harbor's edge as "the edge of the world," the wind carrying "a quality of acceptance." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the protagonist's transformed perception. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor that charges the final image when she turns away. The setting constrains her attention and supplies the "patient teaching about release" that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vineyard setting is vivid and sensory (amber light, burnt honey leaves, tight-skinned grapes) and filtered through Elias's professional knowledge. The pavilion watchtower recurs and frames both opening and closure, and the burned letter edge functions as a tactile micro-object. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics; it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The final image of the pavilion charges mood but does not hinge the ending's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("bone-white columns," "whisperfield calm," "oscillations through the sand"). However, these elements remain largely atmospheric; the parapet's kinetic motion does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page, and the pavilion functions as a meditative backdrop rather than a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting is purposefully selective.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lavender field, rusted factory ruins, and archival tools (map case, tape) are vividly anchored early and sensory details (scent, metallic whisper, golden light) are selective and voice-filtered. The environment frames Maren's ritual but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source. The final image (light through gates) charges mood but does not reconfigure options, leaving the setting purposeful yet not indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library is rendered through specific, purposeful detail: chandelier crystals throwing fractured rainbows, oak panels, eastern windows with seasonal angles, timber joists and stone foundation. The crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's attention and charging the final image when returned to the chandelier at sunrise. Sensory hierarchy reflects scholarly priorities (auditory focus on "sonically reflective" surfaces, visual attention to light patterns). The seventeen unnamed colors at closure depend on the established setting elements. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: mossy videotape towers, unspooling magnetic ribbons, driftwood markers, and the dry fountain basin. Spatial choreography is clear (Mira follows markers to the center, stops at the final marker, sits on the fountain edge), and the garden's atmosphere of abandonment directly serves the theme of echoes and forgotten moments. The fog presses "like a question she didn't need to answer," charging the final image, and the garden's "misty arms" provide the embrace that completes her arc—setting constrains and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting constrains choices: thin air and altitude, fragile glass architecture, the seismic tremor that triggers the climactic shift. The spinning clock hand and the camera function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image—the hand's motion captured photographically without halting it. Spatial choreography is clear (workbench, viewing platforms, clouds outside). Minor deduction: some descriptions lean decorative ("luminous ache that bleeds through every window") without directly altering a tactic, though they do anchor tone.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hospice's floor-to-ceiling windows, amber light, and "height above the city" establish a distinct radiant setting that mirrors the story's tone. The vinyl shard, coffee mug, and spoon function as micro-setting tools that constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when the shard catches light "like a small golden moon." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's calm professionalism. However, the "radiant haven above the clouds" phrase reads slightly stock, and spatial choreography within Room 412 remains general—no specifics about bed placement, window proximity, or Margery's reach that would further ground the final grip.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating isle, nocturnal tower, and meridian telescope anchor vividly. The clockwork automaton key with shifting runes is handled twice (discovery, circle-walking) and its warmth signals progression. Sensory selection is strong: "phosphorescent fish," "soft click," "warm in her grip." The key constrains the closure choice (she must use it to close loops), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography (archive → platform → window) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden is vivid and purposeful: calendula, forget-me-nots, the Triton frozen mid-song anchor memory and the mother's sanctuary. The tooth's luminescence and the fountain's channels constrain and charge the final image, shifting from inert object to active constellation. Spatial choreography (archway, hedge, fountain basin) tracks cleanly. The garden's particulars (her mother's herb patterns, the gap in thorns) filter through Elara's selective attention and directly enable the closure ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is rendered with vivid sensory particulars—mist pressing "like a living thing," cold stone walls traced by touch—and micro-setting (the deepest chamber where passages narrow) frames Elira's polishing practice. The sea glass arranged along walls to scatter the pearl's glow demonstrates purposeful spatial choreography that charges the final image. However, the grotto itself does not constrain a key choice; Elira's transformation would proceed identically in any isolated space, limiting the setting's causal role to atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned data center is vividly rendered (moss on server racks, collapsed ceiling, thawing icicles) and charges the final image through the water/moss metaphor. The amber pendant is handled twice (received, worn) but does not constrain a choice. Micro-setting works: the moss and water function as recurring texture that supports the closure stance. No orientation debt. The setting shapes atmosphere but does not pressure a tactical decision, capping higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The feral nexus—river, forest, mist, stone—is vivid and constrains the encounter spatially. The shell fragment returns in her palm at the closure beat and charges the final image with its spiral metaphor. Sensory detail is selective (emerald moss, damp embrace) and filtered through the protagonist's reflective state. The nexus functions as more than backdrop; it enables the ghostly visitation and the solemnizing ritual, though the mechanism by which ghosts appear remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant arbor at dawn is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail: mist, harvest moon in amber and pearl, ancient stone bed, tools clicking at her hip. The circular stone bed and the alignment of moon and sun constrain the ritual's timing and positioning, shaping Elara's micro-choices (when to kneel, where to place the vine). The final image of luminous leaves with inner fire charges the closure moment, elevating the arbor from backdrop to active participant in the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The withered orchard, crater setting, and subarctic cold are vivid and selective, filtered through Elara's ritual purpose. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling among fallen leaves, objects arranged in a spiral). The storybook illustration plate and the found debris (bottle caps, gears, thimble, button, chain) function as micro-setting elements that constrain her pattern-making. The cold and skeletal trees charge the final image of safekept starlight against decay, meeting the 9+ gate criterion (environment charges the final image).

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble cavern's acoustic purity and the light-reflecting mirrors are well-integrated: mirrors enable the reverse-engineering method and the cavern's echo-holding property reappears in the final paragraph to charge closure. Spatial choreography is clear (Elira kneels, positions mirrors, works as light fades). The setting constrains method and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bronze grotto is vividly anchored through starlight filtering through fissures, kerosene flame oriented toward draft, and fractal patterns covering every surface. Sensory detail (metal-rich glow, shingled hush pressing against skin, calcification creeping like frost) is selective and POV-filtered. The grotto's architecture—patterns spiraling inward, burdens pooling at the heart—constrains her ritual positioning and charges the final image when the whalebone song rises "through stone and soil and root." Micro-setting (her body orientation, the lamp's flame direction) functions as setting and alters her work's mechanics, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rain-beaded skylight, ash wood, and loft are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (wood dust, arena sawdust ghost, rain's "patient conversation"). The carving blank constrains her hands and charges the final image when she picks up the chisel again. However, spatial choreography is minimal—no clear layout of the loft, and the kettle's position is never established. The skylight functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a constraint that alters choice; it provides light but does not pressure her decision to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kinetic lagoon—water defying physics, light without sun—constrains Mira's scavenging and charges the final image with fractured stillness. The camera wheel's plastic teeth catching sourceless light recurs purposefully. Spatial choreography (lagoon center, edge) remains clear, and the setting's paradoxes (motion without current, chronological confusion) mirror the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The spaceport's ribcage polymer walls, cracked tiles, and mineral-sealed tunnels are vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's engineering lens. The sextant piece and ruptured drainage pipe constrain her middle exploration, and the trickling stream at closure uses setting tactilely. However, spatial choreography in the tunnels remains vague—three junction chambers are mapped but never individuated—and the carnival's residual popcorn-and-sawdust sensory layer, though atmospheric, doesn't pressure her choices. The final hall image is static description rather than environment that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sanctuary's "glacial hush" and "soundless" quality constrain the protagonist's emotional processing, and the crystal forecourt's whispered song provides sensory texture that charges the final sunrise moment. The clock as micro-object anchors choices and reappears with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (protagonist, bear, stones, forecourt), and the petrichor/old-stone scent ties to the grandfather's workshop, creating purposeful sensory layering. The setting does not actively block or enable a physical choice, keeping it just below the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the twilight barge canal, black glass water, amber warehouse lamps, and brick walls showing older construction all anchor the scene effectively. The sundial functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final third with its "precise line across the curved dial face." The environment does not constrain a choice at closure—she simply steers toward the next location—but the recurring object (sundial) and the layered canal setting contribute atmospheric weight that supports the thematic investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dock, fog, snow, and fulgurite glass ground the scene with vivid sensory anchors and coherent spatial choreography. The fulgurite's hollow channels and the rope's worn fibers are purposefully detailed and shape the final revelation. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining Elias's choices; the dock and weather do not alter his tactics or impose a resource limit. Micro-setting (the glass and rope) charges the closure image, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The shadowed garden is vividly rendered—dry fountain, birch bark peeling like pages, flagstone patterns like writing—and the autumn light creates a temporally specific atmosphere. The weft thread in her pocket is handled twice (purchase backstory, tactile anchor) and carries thematic weight. However, neither the setting nor the thread constrains a choice or alters tactics; they function as evocative backdrop rather than active pressure. The garden's role as "a place designed for departures" frames the conceptual stakes but does not supply a resource or obstacle that changes the protagonist's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites, rusted chandeliers, and bioluminescent panels create vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "air tasted of copper and nostalgia," the egg's warmth and golden veins. The egg as micro-setting object charges the final image when held up to the ceiling panels, constraining the prince's realization. Spatial choreography remains clear across the journey from threshold to chamber to floor to standing. The setting subtly mirrors the theme of preservation versus living beauty without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon and black volcanic sand are vivid and recur with shifting meaning (mirror-still to molten gold), and sand is handled twice (scooped, pressed to cheek, clings to boots at the end). The environment subtly charges the final image—sand as volcanic glass marking passage. Sensory detail is strong and POV-filtered (firefighter noticing heat retention in the sand). The lagoon functions as micro-setting that enables reflection and reweights the protagonist's stance, meeting the 9+ test narrowly, but does not constrain a choice in the moment, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The city of forgotten fountains is detailed with specificity (Meridian Plaza, Basin of Unfinished Conversations, serpents green with algae) and the recurring fountain structures guide Mira's journey spatially. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image when it opens. However, the fountains themselves do not constrain choice—they are waypoints rather than obstacles—and the setting reads more atmospheric than tactical. The city's texture supports but does not pressure the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nebula garden is vividly particular: bioluminescent petals that fall despite zero-gravity, crystalline trees drinking diffuse matter, violet haze with sonar-permeable texture. Spatial choreography is clear (outer rim → center clearing across seven breath-cycles). The garden constrains choice subtly—fire cannot kindle here, pressing Vael's mission to "share light without using fire"—and the final image (sonar rippling through petals, trees, machine heart) charges the closure by integrating environment into the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and anchored to Vael's non-human perception (sonar, translucency, proximity warmth). The micro-setting (gear against chest) and recurring petals meet the 9+ gate by constraining stakes and charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—rusting iron, amber light, humid green breath—and filters through Elara's grief-laden perception. The setting actively participates in the ending: the golden light and gathering butterflies charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment's evolution from twilight to violet dusk mirrors the emotional arc. Minor: the moss-covered table and flagstone path are mentioned but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a way that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian ridge, clock tower, and pendulum are vivid and selective, grounding the ritual in concrete detail. The broken rake handle functions as micro-setting, constraining Marcus's remembrance practice and charging the final image when he tucks it into his coat. Sensory detail is filtered through Marcus's professional and grief-colored priorities (brass gears catching light, the vertigo of the suspended instant). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ascent and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt silo and starlight opening provide vivid spatial grounding; "velveteen gloom" and "shadows that had the texture of deep velvet, absorbing sound and time alike" charge the atmosphere. The setting constrains the gardener's physical descent and frames the discovery, and the starlight functions as "an audience of distant witnesses" that subtly pressures the final act of interpretation. The tapestry and sovereign case anchor micro-setting choices. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (iridescent feather, ice shards as timelines). The setting functions primarily as backdrop and metaphor rather than constraint; Elara's choices are not pressured by spatial access, cold, or the spire's properties. The quill's riverine provenance and the lake's future spring thaw enrich atmosphere but do not alter present tactics. Sensory hierarchy and POV filter are consistent. The frozen lake charges the final image as a constraint metaphor, lifting the score toward the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful: the ember alcove, mist, shortwave radio glow, and dust all contribute atmosphere and texture. The radio's "secretly luminous" glow and the dust's memory properties are distinctive and integrated into Mira's work. However, none of these elements constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics or outcome; they remain evocative but not causal. Strong for atmosphere, but just short of the 9+ gate because the setting does not force a decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gallery is named and anchored early ("tall windows," "empty walls," "worktable," "rocking chair") and the vanishing-point concept subtly mirrors the thematic work. The mask and ash function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("scattered light," "diminished heat," "texture of the paper"), filtered through Mira's meditative stance. The rocking chair's cessation and final creak provide spatial and temporal texture that supports the ritual frame without dominating momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken harbor setting is vivid and purposeful: coral-encrusted streets, silt-filled plazas, water-stained walls with charcoal marks establish a concrete, post-catastrophe world. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the scholar's archaeological lens. The chronometer cog and sediment function as micro-setting elements that anchor the thematic work. However, environment does not constrain a present choice or charge the final image with new pressure—it remains atmospheric rather than tactically essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet library and autumn light supply vivid, selective anchors filtered through Eleanor's musician's perception. The zither's soundhole rosette functions as micro-setting, recurring across beats and charging the final image. Sensory detail (amber leaves, leaded windows, worn petals) reflects urgency and familiarity without catalog padding. The rosette constrains Eleanor's ritual gesture and becomes the story's final anchor, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for object-as-setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (orange tears, clouded panes, withered plants) and its decay anchors Elena's thematic stance. The setting participates in the final image when she begins to prune and envisions the kitchen. However, the celestial alignment—which should tighten spatial or temporal constraints—functions mainly as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressuring her choices. Micro-setting via the seed and pruning shears does engage her hands, lifting the score, but the environment could constrain more actively.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The copper spire, nectar dusk, and internal tower stairs provide vivid atmospheric anchors. The lacquer box and matchbox are handled across beats, constraining the reveal sequence. However, the drone beehives and "great reservoir" remain abstract set-dressing without spatial or mechanical specificity that would allow the reader to visualize how static charges move or what "cracked like an eggshell" means in physical terms. The setting does not constrain Elara's choices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bay setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity: sea lavender through dune grass, orris root scent lingering in rooms, salt-worn clapboard. The streetlights function as both atmospheric anchor and temporal frame, modulating from "daydream" to "full wakefulness" in parallel with Mira's awareness. The orris root shard serves as micro-setting, recurring across beats and warming in her pocket to signal intensification. While the house interior constrains movement and supplies objects for observation (coffee cup, attic shard), the setting does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics under pressure—it supports rather than tests.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater garden is vividly rendered with specific, functional detail: barnacles, kelp forests, coral as "both animal and mineral," anemones as "both predator and symbiont." Setting constrains Thalassor's perception (dim light, brine, his stone ribcage housing fish) and the garden's contradictions directly charge his thematic shift. The ampoule's foxglove-purple stains and the spatial anchors (his open palm, the ruins) are concrete and consistent. The garden's dual nature (memorial/living system) directly enables the closure insight, meeting the 9+ environment-constrains-choice test.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    The infinite staircase is anchored early and returns with functional purpose: the "seven hundredth step" landing provides a workspace, and the paradox of "bounded infinity" frames the conceptual puzzle. The dice—one whole, one chipped—constrain Maren's measurement method and charge the final realization ("both had been necessary to see the whole picture"). Spatial choreography (climbing, spreading papers, rolling dice) remains clear, and the setting pressures the central question, though the staircase itself does not alter tactics in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse micro-setting is vivid and selective: "saffron quiet," "night-blooming jasmine," "mineral warmth of damp earth." The rooftop and moonlight constrain the creative act (moonlight is necessary for the daydreams) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The city smog below contrasts the clean moon above, grounding the theme. The brush and greenhouse door reappear at closure, reweighting prior material. The setting is more than backdrop; it enables the discovery and frames the decision to leave paintings "by the door."

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto city, waterfall, and mossy chambers are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (emerald light, roar becoming thunder, rosewater scent). Spatial choreography is coherent as Maren leads the group through narrow passages. The bread and lens function as micro-setting objects that recur and charge the final image, though the environment itself does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it pressures indirectly (thaw = discovery risk) rather than forcing a tactical trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, workroom clutter, hunger stone, and tide cycle create a cohesive atmosphere. Sensory details (salt, sawdust, cold string, granite scars) are vivid and purposeful. The yoyo as micro-setting object constrains Iris's analysis and charges the final image when it generates "cold fire" and reverses the clocks, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and workroom sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The carnival and funhouse are vividly rendered with specific images (rusted gates, painted smile peeling, mirrors weeping condensation) and the setting participates in closure (mirrors as the site of confession, the funhouse "collapsing mouth" where she leaves the dictionary). Micro-setting qualifies: the brass clasp functions as a tactile anchor that shifts from cold to warm. The lingering luminance and photograph changes filter through Clara's perception, creating atmospheric specificity tied to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The driftwood orchard is vivid and specific ("irregular ring floating on the open sea," logs "chosen specifically for their acoustic properties"), and the blue-hour timeframe anchors atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or shape the ending's charge; it functions as a backdrop for demonstration rather than a crucible. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, but the final image does not reprise or reweight the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly particular—bioluminescence dimmed, cracks spreading, settlement into mud—and the setting constrains Mira's toolkit (spiral-roads, hum-of-origin, pattern language) throughout. The marsh watchers and the rusted gate frame spatial pressure that shapes her inquiry. The whistle, tied to marsh reeds and the lost expedition's last campsite, functions as micro-setting object that charges the final beat when pressed to the shell. Sensory detail is filtered through cartographic bias (spirals, frequencies, tremors) and the "sunwashed dread" of relentless light. The setting drives the climactic choice: Mira kneels at the spiral intersection, listens, then acts—environment and tool converge to ignite closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    The station setting is vividly described (ivy curtain, cathedral light, century-old tiles) and anchors the reflective frame, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The rosebush and station function as thematic anchors rather than micro-setting elements that shape tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful but remains ornamental to the reflective monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pavilion is vividly particular: octagonal, stone pillars, kelp-draped railings, raised drawbridge bleeding rust into evening light. The rising water functions as a live constraint, forcing Maren to work quickly and climb to the highest bench. The cold seeping through her clothes and the smell of wet limestone anchor sensory selection to present urgency. The crumbled foundation directly enables the inkwell discovery, and the structure charges the final image—Maren carries its story as the pavilion "settles deeper into its long forgetting."

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged archive, candlelight, and blackout constrain Mira's perception and discovery method, charging the closure image with "reclaimed stillness." The ink stamp functions as a micro-object that anchors her authentication work and connects past to present. Sensory detail (darkness, density, quiet) is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through her patient attention, and the false panel discovery integrates setting into plot without postcard padding.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating tea garden, crystalline bushes, and crane paper anchor the setting vividly and filter through Mira's grief-saturated perception. The workbench, gem, and lantern constrain her physical actions (polishing, folding, watching), and the final image—lantern dimming to ember—charges the ending with sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling among bushes, workbench nearby, lantern core). The detail is selective and voice-filtered ("cloud-sea below," "eternal twilight"), fitting the accumulative lens. The micro-setting (workbench and lantern) effectively functions as environment here, meeting the 9+ gate condition, but the tea garden itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop rather than actively shaping tactics, capping the score just below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory is vivid and purposeful: electromagnetic cables, artificial light scattering through the geode, the ruins below. The geode itself functions as micro-setting, charged and handled across beats. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's philosophical lens (scorch marks "like deliberate camouflage," crystals scattering light "into geometries that feel almost like answers"). The body and object constrain choice minimally—holding the geode is contemplative rather than instrumental—but the setting charges the final image and sustains tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: brass instruments, copper dome, the mechanism itself all anchor the action and constrain Mira's choices (she must align the mechanism with the stars). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("violet burn of the setting sun," "boots ringing on the copper floor") without becoming a catalog. The mechanism functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the setting's ancient machinery directly enables the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt terrace and driftwood-strewn shore anchor place, and dusk's fading light recurs to frame mood. The watch hand is the one environmental detail that constrains choice—it triggers the memory—but its discovery is passive, not goal-directed. Sensory detail tilts visual and abstract ("light bleeding," "bruise spreading") with minimal tactile or olfactory grounding. Spatial choreography is legible but the "forgotten shore" remains generic; no micro-setting element (tool, terrain, body position) alters Maren's tactics or final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The parapet, mist, and storm-worn stone create a vivid stage and the brass pulls function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—wind, mist curling like breath, silvering moonlight—without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography is clean: two people across from each other, arms extended, objects falling into darkness. The setting constrains symbolically (neutral territory, between-spaces) but doesn't pressure a tactical choice on the page, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    The coastal launch details (weathered ramp, granite boulders, cedar poles, osprey nest) are filtered through Elara's memory and constrain her new navigation method. The compass pressed against her thigh recurs with shifting emotional weight, and the utility poles function as micro-setting waypoints that alter her tactics from celestial to terrestrial navigation. The final image of the current pulling her seaward and her gravitating back toward the poles charges closure by grounding the emotional recalibration in concrete spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid and purposeful: "delicate robust colonies...pulsing in patterns that seemed almost conversational" filters setting through Vera's wonder. The lake constrains her path (maze of choices, branching tunnels) and charges the final image where bioluminescence concentrates "into something almost bright enough to read by." Spatial choreography is clean (maintenance entrance→concrete steps→cavern→deepest chamber). The baseball warming in her pocket and the newspaper clippings held to bioluminescence integrate setting into action. Minor gap: the industrial sector and maintenance entrance receive minimal texture beyond "rusted," and the lake's effect on tactics (patience, not rushing) is told more than shown through micro-movements.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fairy-tale orchard, moonlight, and stone circle anchor the ritual space with vivid, purposeful detail. The spices are handled concretely and their scent functions as the mechanism of transformation, constraining the ritual's form. Spatial choreography is clean. The orchard and spices charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting participation in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The midnight glade above clouds is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("moonlight that turned the mist below into rivers of molten silver," "choking beauty pressed against her throat"). The cracked saucer and the birthday tablecloth function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image: the crack catches moonlight "like a silver vein" and becomes the instrument of the blood-ink ritual. The spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the glade's liminal quality—"where earth surrendered to sky"—directly supports the thematic stakes of boundaries and release.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The recycled ship is vividly particular—"patchwork of salvaged plating," "dust motes...where gravity pools gathered like sleeping cats"—and the observation deck with its faded photographs becomes the crucible for the final action. The stitching needle threaded with salvaged optical fiber is a micro-setting detail that charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Seraph's perspective. The "starless void" and emergency lighting create coherent atmosphere, though spatial choreography within the observation deck could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    The black sand beach, volcano, and eclipse are rendered with vivid sensory specificity and anchor the scene effectively. The jars function as recurring objects handled across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than tactically essential. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping at 8.8, and execution falls short of that band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fort, armory, and half-painted sundial are vivid and specific, with the courtyard's spatial choreography remaining clear throughout. The bronze quill holder's "faint resonance" and the sundial's coded angles constrain Elara's approach and enable the discovery, grounding the mechanics in physical interaction. However, the blackout itself—the timeframe element—never pressures a choice; emergency lights return without forcing a trade-off, and the setting becomes more backdrop than crucible in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal bluff, frictionless world, and aurora form a coherent micro-setting that charges the final image: Mira's bare feet finding purchase on stone "that no longer posed any threat to her balance" demonstrates lived adaptation, and the painted rocks' placement and the eels' geometry are spatially legible. The frictionless world subtly constrains tools (nets can't grip) and rewards her mathematical approach. The aurora's "borrowed dawn" recurs with reweighted meaning in the vision at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image. Minor gap: occupational detail (eel herding mechanics) remains abstract, though the story's length and conceptual focus justify brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly rendered (glass dome trembling, thunderheads churning below, mist gathering) and the setting applies pressure through the approaching storm that mirrors Mira's internal reckoning. The darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-setting objects that anchor her past. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain a choice—Mira could have this realization anywhere above the clouds. The storm intensifies atmosphere but doesn't alter her tactics or options; it serves as backdrop rather than forcing condition.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are described but remain postcard scenery—none constrains a choice. The sundial's "coded angles" are mentioned three times but never decoded or used in tactics. The brook "continues its quiet flow" as ambient texture without affecting action. The mechanical arm is the only object with tactile presence ("caught and redirected"), but its function is asserted rather than shown constraining Varn's moves under pressure. Spatial choreography is vague: "circled each other" and "the opening" lack concrete positions or distances.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted library's skeletal beams and "fractured light" recur meaningfully, charging the final image ("rusted library held them both in its fractured light, luminous and incomplete"). The coffee tin's false bottom is handled on-page (clutched, opened, displayed), constraining Mira's choice to reveal her private work. Spatial choreography is clean (shelves, philosophy section, fiction section, the tin "between them"). The moon clearing the skyline provides both temporal anchor and atmospheric layering that supports the tone. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through vagrant-poet and pianist perspectives.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    The station setting is grounded early with strong sensory anchors (ivory keys, vaulted hall, rush-hour echo). The tidal arbor is vividly rendered—"flowers bloomed in colors that had no names," "clouds beneath him rolled in slow waves"—and the ghost piano made of "cloud-density and longing" is a memorable image. The arbor does not, however, constrain Elias's choices or shape the closure; it serves as backdrop for his ritual rather than applying pressure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the contrast between cold station and impossible garden supports the thematic current of refuge versus reality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and layered: seventeen shades of sky, memory-moths, bloom-flower spirals, terraces with forgotten crops. The ridge and bloom-flower participate directly in the climactic beat—Mira presses the seed into the flower's heart—satisfying the 9+ gate test. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the ascent, and sensory detail (wild thyme, luminous scent, gold light) reflects urgency and POV bias without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The islet after rain is not mere backdrop: wet stones, drying wind, and changing light through east/west windows directly enable Marek's study of the lace and anchor his emotional state. The bonsai tools and the specific sensory detail (smell of wet earth and salt, palm fronds' whisper) ground the reflective mode in tactile reality. The setting's post-storm calm mirrors and pressures the protagonist's movement toward forgiveness. The final pruning gesture uses the micro-setting (tree, shears, bench) to charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly specific and filters through Mira's POV, but while it supplies the crucible for her epiphany, it does not actively constrain a choice; the butterfly's dust and the rosemary bush more directly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    The canyon setting is not backdrop but an active agent that constrains and guides choice. The "patterns in morning frost" are a micro-setting that directly shape tactics and charge the final image.

    Mountain weather station and botanical illustration are indispensable constraints that pressure choice and charge the final image; sensory details (wind, auroral light, copper taste) are selective and filtered through Mira's professional and emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through Marcus's POV ("brick walls weeping decades of groundwater"). The tunnel and the beaded valve wheel function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice and charge the final image—the wheel turns without his touch, and the tunnel's atmosphere presses his rational dismissal. The environment is integral to the plot's causality and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Settings are lush and immersive, serving atmosphere well, but they don't actively constrain choices, preventing the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse, cracked tiles, drowned seedlings, and salvaged rosemary create a vivid, specific atmosphere that’s thematically charged without feeling like a generic stage. The environment directly supports the core metaphor: a space of cultivation and slow cycles ruined by sudden violence, hosting a tiny, fragile survivor. The recurring dust on her thumb and then on the leaves functions as a micro-setting element charging the final image. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes perception and tone in a way that feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon, sandstone warmth, encroaching frost, and star field are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail filtered through Mira’s artist’s eye. Setting is not just scenic; frost patterns literally reveal hidden paths and will guide her pursuit, and the canyon as quiet sanctuary deepens the emotional stakes of leaving. The interplay of heat, cold, and light aligns environment with inner state without feeling forced. Spatial and temporal anchoring are clear and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The winterglass conservatory and its frozen plants, frosted panes, and breathing-heat performance hall are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with the premise. Setting isn’t postcard décor; it directly houses the emotional residues she reads and shapes what is possible (music can only be accessed via these charged spaces). World rules around the Quieting and thermal traces stay consistent and are learned via her practice rather than dumped. The environment charges the final image—architecture as living archive of feeling—though it stops just short of constraining a concrete tactical choice in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The settings—the modest house on Pemberton Street and the drowned library-city—are vivid, specific, and tonally unified; details like bookshelves “like ribs” and sand that smells of salt do real atmospheric work. The lighthouse lens as object-setting recurs and meaningfully charges the final image. The underwater environment, however, rarely constrains his options or behavior (no real sense of physical risk or limitation), which keeps it from fully integrating with character choice at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the terra-cotta arbor on the ridge, guards in the valley, drought-struck gardens, and the “particular grief of proximity” to distant lights all feel tactile and thematically integrated. World rules about sanctions, rations, and gardens as “lifeline and laboratory” are conveyed through lived detail rather than exposition dumps. The arbor and the ridge meaningfully shape the final act—ringing a bell at a visible high point, in curfew-like quiet, charges the risk and symbolism. The environment constrains more at a conceptual than tactical level; we rarely see bodies forced into or out of choices by physical conditions in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct, wisteria, fireflies, and mountain mist are rendered with vivid, selective detail that feels fully inhabited by Mei’s sensibility. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it responds to the ritual—the wisteria leaning, fireflies pausing, the viaduct “exhaling”—which charges the final image and fuses setting with the metaphysical stakes. Sensory breadth (scent, touch, light) is strong and purposeful, though there’s a mild risk of saturation that stops short of true purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific, from “living bridge garden” vines that “breathed and flexed with the seasons” to cedar-smelling boxes in the root-cellar, and these are always filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment is not decorative: the non-Euclidean geometry of the garden directly explains the temporal anomalies and shapes the solution (designing a maze within those rules). The recurring objects—the halo fragment and photographs—are fully embedded in place and charge the final image of the garden “leaning forward to listen.” A slight overreliance on visual and conceptual detail over other senses is the only small restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned carnival is vividly realized—ticket dispensers, toppled stuffed animals, the prize wall, and the piano bench all feel tactile and repurposed rather than touristic. The setting does more than decorate: it provides the physical concealment of the vault, tools like the bench and prize wall, and later the “souvenir” cover for smuggling seeds back out. The tonal contrast between ruined frivolity and sacred preservation reinforces the thematic tension without becoming didactic. Environment, body (chains), and objects together constrain tactics and charge the final image of a liberator in a charnel house of past pleasures protecting future gardens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken greenhouse/orchard and ring of shipwrecks are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s sound-color perception, yielding striking, specific images (“apple trees that had no right to survive underwater,” “flames the color of things unsaid”). The setting does more than decorate: shipwrecks and “Echoing Orchard” mirror the story’s obsession with absence and memory, and the greenhouse becomes the charged stage for her final stance. The ashen forge at the center spatially and thematically anchors the narrative. The final paragraph’s return to the “battered marvel of the Echoing Orchard” lets environment charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald station, golden-hour light, and moon-threaded glass are vividly rendered and tightly tied to Mira’s perception. The setting functions as more than backdrop: the golden-hour constraint, the emptying station, and the final image of the moonlit, travelerless space all charge the ending. The jar, the camera, and the station form a coherent micro-ecosystem that frames what’s possible in the scene. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it meaningfully shapes tone and the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned control room and the melting ice are vividly realized and deeply fused with the protagonist’s sensibility: we feel the hum of old consoles, the “icicles weep,” the sanctuary of disuse. Setting is filtered through his craft and temperament, avoiding generic description and giving the environment emotional charge. The room’s abandonment and the season’s thaw both subtly justify and color his need for unsupervised, liminal space. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it crucially shapes tone, theme, and his central motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned library under the shattered skylight is textured and purposeful, from rusted shelves and water-damaged books to stars “humming” overhead. The environment does mild but real work: the pressing shelves and confined stacks concretize her claustrophobia, and the stars’ vantage returns in the final image, charging the ending. Details are filtered through her stunt-background and fear-state in a way that feels lived-in rather than touristic. While the library could be swapped for another decrepit, enclosed space, the specific star-shot roof and rust motif contribute to tone and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ridge fort, storm-tossed valley, pebble shores, and dimming sky create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly fused with the oracle’s vocation. Details like “flaking gold leaf,” “marbled hush,” and the fort of giant stones feel selective rather than touristic and filtered through her oracular lens. The environment doesn’t much constrain her choices beyond providing isolation and a final vantage point, but it does strongly charge the ending image of the booklet waiting in the dark fort. World rules are implicit yet consistent, suiting the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight and the crystalline violin are vivid, integrated images that sustain atmosphere and mirror the robot’s liminal state. Details like frost-stiffened leaves, bare branches, and “visible frost-sounds” feel selective and purposeful, charging the final tableau of playing as twilight deepens. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain action, but it consistently shapes the mood and the robot’s attention, making setting a genuine participant in the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystal forecourt after rain, glass surfaces with trembling droplets, and misted garden stones create a vivid, coherent setting that strongly supports tone. The environment does more than decorate: the crystalline walls conduct sound, letting the registrar sense new arrivals, and the refracted light parallels the story’s emphasis on ambiguous transparency. The lens in his pocket functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it is thematically indispensable to the piece’s atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The garden maze is vivid and specific—the weathered bench at the center, thick hedges nursed from near-death, autumn’s “sweet decay” all deepen mood and theme. Setting is tightly filtered through Elara’s professional eye and history, avoiding tourist-list description. The maze’s nature as a remembering, almost willful place charges the final choice to let the villager navigate alone, but it rarely constrains concrete options in the present scene. Rich atmosphere and integration lift this high, though not to the point of environment-as-active-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “three kilometers above Veridian IV's methane seas,” the magnetic nexus, the cold research air against her “mechanically warm” body, and the twilight filter all build a distinct atmosphere. Details are strongly filtered through her technical sensibility, especially how she “feels” machinery and reads the velith-wings like instrument panels. The research station and nexus meaningfully constrain action—the whole experiment depends on alignment, capacity, and planetary magnetism—and the final image of the station “suspended between moments” is charged by the environment. This integration of place, tool, and concept substantially elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The flooded opera house is vivid and specific—“sinking cathedral,” gilded balconies mirrored in black water, lanterns, pit, lobby, stage—and always filtered through Elena’s musical/professional gaze. Environment doesn’t just decorate; the rising water reveals the code, drives her movement through the building, and charges the piano’s final image as the water reaches its lowest keys. Spatial and sensory choreography are clear, and the setting strongly reinforces the liminal/“in-between” theme. A bit more tactile or auditory texture under stress could deepen it further, but as is, it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain weather station, instruments, frost, and aurora are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Mira’s professional and emotional lens. Environmental features constrain and shape action: isolation, thin air, and incoming weather define her role and the warning she must send. The recurring objects (console, illustration, aurora-lit window) directly charge the final image, with the smudged flower under auroral light acting as a micro-setting that holds the theme. Description is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, supporting atmosphere and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned train tunnel and mill ruins are vivid and tactile—“brick walls weeping decades of groundwater,” kudzu-choked ruins, the twelve-foot drop—and they’re consistently filtered through Marcus’s explorer mentality. The environment isn’t just decorative; its isolation, darkness, and the strange valve wheel frame the plausibility and intensity of the ghost shift. The recurring valve wheel as a physical anchor charges the final image of his hand on it as he confesses. While the setting could constrain action even more directly, it already does significant atmospheric and thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: “knowledge composted into new forms,” volcanic glass walls that feel like “the moment before dawn,” and water-threaded catacombs all carry both physical and thematic weight. The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are not just backdrops but charged environments that mirror and shape the keeper’s functions (decay vs. restoration). The recurring objects-as-setting—the river and the origami swan—anchor movement and frame the final image of the keeper between sanctuaries. The only limitation is that environmental constraints don’t quite force distinct tactical choices; they’re more atmospheric than actively binding.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage ridge, the manzanita and white sage, the ancient oak and its “dreaming roots,” and the eclipse’s shifting light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s closely tied to Elara’s intentions. The setting is not just scenic; she “had chosen this setting deliberately” as a liminal space where “ordinary magic” feels inevitable, and the eclipse’s light and shadow modulate the children’s focus. Environmental details are filtered through her professional and emotional priorities, and the final charge of the setting—light returning after totality—parallels the small opening in Maya. The world feels lived-in and thematically aligned without tipping into over-symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through Elias: the reclaimed silo with “faint smell of wheat,” “bronze quiet,” and the mouthlike fireplace all carry tone and history. World rules (post-dream reality, displaced axis) are consistently strange yet readable and learned through observation rather than exposition dumps. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the silo walls and the warm tapestry are not just backdrop but vehicles for his belief that stories may function as replacement dreams. This level of integration and atmosphere would be competitive at a high-end market.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse on the rocky island is vivid and integral, not decorative: it governs his isolation, his supply logistics, and the entire metaphor of beams, currents, and directed flow. Details like the "white finger pointing toward nowhere" and the fishermen’s boats ground the lyricism in a concrete place. The environment charges the final image—the sweeping beam, the arrivals by water—and feels inextricable from the story’s meaning. A bit more multisensory texture beyond sight and weather could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The church as dimensional anchor, the emptied sanctuary, the looped chant, and the alizarin-crimson palette create a vivid, coherent environment that is both tactile and metaphysical. Setting details are tightly filtered through Matthias’s obsessions (silence as decoration, the stones that “held reality’s fabric more tightly”) and directly charge the final image as he enters the threshold with the anchor “holding space open” around him. The environment meaningfully constrains method and mood; it’s hard to imagine the story working elsewhere or with a bland church.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s mood and ideas. The environment doesn’t much constrain her physical options, but it absolutely charges the final image as the spire dissolves into dawn and reflection. Details like “ink made from memories she hadn’t yet lived” and the crystalline architecture feel specific to this world rather than generic fantasy dressing. Setting acts as both emotional echo and conceptual stage for the time/memory themes.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glowing viaduct after rain, the pulsing stones, and the fractures-as-environment are vivid and tonally apt, giving the story a strong atmospheric container. The bridge as a liminal object between selves is thematically integrated and recurs meaningfully at the end. Setting mostly charges mood and metaphor rather than constraining specific tactical choices, which keeps it just short of top-tier. Still, the sense of place is far from generic and feels particular to this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern, the hanging skins, and the autumn forest are vivid and tightly integrated with Maren’s sensory constraints; details like air that “felt audibly muted” filter setting through her altered perception. The phonograph, drums, and skins function as more than décor—they shape how sound becomes touch and charge the final image of the forest’s “visible music.” Spatial and atmospheric anchors are strong without overdescription. Environment meaningfully echoes and transforms the internal stakes, especially in the closing ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The courtyard at dusk, aviary, and weathered stone create a vivid, grounded setting with good sensory texture and mood. Professional specificity (meteorological journals, cloud formation, temperature anomalies) is woven in without feeling like a tour. The environment mostly supports atmosphere and theme rather than actively constraining choice—the courtyard is a calm stage rather than a tactical obstacle. Still, the contrast between tranquil garden and violated villages meaningfully charges the stakes and the final night image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Conservatory of Lost Blooms, moss-softened floors, ultraviolet light, and the glowing filaments together create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is both tactile and thematically charged. The extinct-plant greenhouse and the final image of the bloom glowing “like a lantern” directly charge the ending, tying environment to closure rather than serving as mere backdrop. Details are economical yet specific—no museum-tour clutter—and they are consistently filtered through Mirabel’s professional and emotional lens. The setting could slightly more overtly constrain her options or actions to push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is vivid and specific, with the rust-colored clay, vaulted ceiling, and central pool all filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Setting and micro-objects (starlight, water, rope) are tightly woven into perception and theme, especially the pulsing starlight “heartbeat” that embodies the beings’ presence and pressures the choice. While the grotto doesn’t heavily constrain her physical options, it palpably frames the liminal, sacred quality of her threshold state and charges the final image. The balance of atmosphere and relevance is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, particular, and thematically loaded: sunken greenhouse, shipwreck ring, ash-choked orchard, and altered acoustics all feel lived-in and specific. Environmental conditions meaningfully constrain action (the “chronic hush” and the way hulls reflect or fail to reflect sound) and charge the final image of the echo-harbor answering. The mendicant’s bowl and the greenhouse skeleton function as micro-settings that embody generational memory and stubborn endurance. A slight excess of ash/fire imagery is the only reason this stops short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber grotto, dusk light, ethanol smell, and “glass walls the color of honeyed whiskey” create a striking, coherent atmosphere that is deeply tied to character and occupation. Setting details are strongly filtered through Vera’s professional and emotional lens, integrating the lab, the blotter, and the compound into one lived-in environment. The environment charges the final image—the amber glow and deepening night mirroring her interior revaluation—even if it doesn’t concretely constrain choices. This is vivid and economical, very close to top-tier work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and specific—the dockside knowledge, the emptied symphony hall, and especially the starlit library with its inverted-hull shelves create a strong atmosphere. Details are filtered through Maren’s professional and emotional priorities, which keeps description purposeful rather than touristic. The environment gently supports theme (invisible labor embedded in spaces like docks and libraries) even if it rarely constrains action. The library as a nocturnal, breezy refuge nicely charges the encounter but does not quite become an active pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the crystalline orchard, frozen quartz fruit, geometric shadows, and crater-lake of molten copper all feel lived-in and atmospheric. World rules are implied through action (crater-dwellers’ kinship webs, the shimmer, the arbor’s reflective truth) rather than dumped. Environment actively shapes the story: the dangerous/searing crater-heart necessitates the guided path, and the obsidian arbor literally reflects her truth and hosts the Threader mark. The closing image of glass-powder spirals on the lit path uses setting to charge the new trajectory rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop canals between towers, the domed chamber with vibrating notations, and specific details like the pale moth and singing eels create a vivid, original atmosphere strongly filtered through Sera’s observational eye. The environment is not just decorative: the canal network structures her movement and the carved walls interact directly with the pendant in the climax. Still, the setting rarely constrains choices under pressure—it feels more like an exquisitely painted backdrop than an active obstacle or collaborator in the key turn. The sense of place is publishable-quality, but not fully weaponized in service of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cavern orchard and dripping stalactites are vivid, original, and tightly integrated with the character’s way of thinking (mosaics, patterns, nourishment). The environment actively charges the final image: the center of the mosaic as method, the orchard’s silence as “held breath,” and the stalactites’ steady dripping all refract the theme of slow, patient processing of grief. Details are selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic, and the rules of this quiet magical space remain consistent. The only tiny limitation is that the setting constrains mood and frame more than concrete tactical options, but in this lyric piece that feels sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The library, pipe chases, and “sapphire hush” are vivid and particular, with strong sensory and vocational filtering—Maren literally reads the building’s vibrations and airflow like braille. The infrastructure genuinely matters, as the forgotten junctions are what allow the tape to exist and be found. The setting undergirds the central metaphor of unseen maintenance sustaining visible knowledge, charging both the discovery and the ending. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactical options in the moment; it’s more thematic scaffold than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse, mossy trellis, storm season, and damaged vines are vivid and consistently filtered through Vera’s botanist mind, avoiding generic nature writing. The environment doesn’t just decorate; the trellis and storm-torn vines explicitly charge the final image of new tendrils finding “paths she wouldn’t have chosen.” The linden tree and leaf extend the setting into a meaningful micro-ecosystem with emotional stakes. Weather and wet earth subtly mirror internal transformation without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The post–water wars landscape, rain-textured earth, tidal island, causeway, stone pillars, and ruined pavilion are all concrete, well-imagined, and tightly filtered through Mira’s attention. Environment constrains and enables action: low-tide access, rain-carved trails, and unearthed ruins directly shape her path and the presence of the telescope. Weather and water are not just backdrop but vocabulary, economy, and navigation system, deeply integrated with tone. The setting feels specific enough that removing the tidal island and its exposed ruins would materially flatten the story.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly and economically rendered: singing crystals, bioluminescent moss, moving shadows, and warm cave pearls all feel specific and atmospheric. These details are filtered through Varen’s sensibility and serve meaning, not just ornament (e.g., the “weather of sound” that teaches him to listen). The setting subtly mirrors the theme of distributed, living time and charges the final image of him emerging changed. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it primarily shapes perception.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and consistent: “ivory harbor after rain,” salt-crusted notebooks, wet cobblestones, and the small stone archive all feel tactile and inhabited. Details are well-filtered through his sensibility as an archivist of wreckage and memory. The recurring harbor and rain imagery nicely charge the final image of boats arriving with new fragments. The environment doesn’t quite constrain choices, but it deeply supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the mist as “breath released from ancient lungs,” the “starlit vault” ceiling, and the cracked pillars forming a quasi-language all feel textured and integrated with Aria’s perception. The environment does more than decorate: the cracks literally dictate her route, and the station’s architecture embodies the concept of accumulated unspoken truths. Sensory focus is primarily visual and atmospheric but suits the contemplative, nocturnal mood. The world’s rules (magical cracks, air-punched words) are consistent within a lyrical fabulist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tower, cliff, bay, and whales are rendered with vivid, selective detail that feels filtered through Mira’s observational gaze. The setting is not mere backdrop: the tower as “threshold,” the open roof, and the whale passage all explicitly charge the final image and the underlying concept of layered witnessing. Environmental specifics (salt wind, dawn light on whales) modulate with the emotional beats and culminate in the closing scene. While the setting doesn’t impose hard physical constraints, it meaningfully shapes meaning and tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prismatic escondite, solar storm, and visible magnetic fields are vividly rendered and tightly woven into the action, especially as the space fractures and the amulet interacts with the lines of force. Setting details evolve with the storm and directly stage the climax rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment charges the final image of Elian standing amid “fracturing dimensions and singing magnetic fields,” reinforcing the thematic turn. At times the description skirts purple, but clarity and atmosphere remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The funeral home prep room is specific and tonally rich (“humming lights and the quiet industry of preservation”), and it meaningfully shapes the story’s moral frame of honesty toward the dead. The ink pot and chrysanthemums function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when she returns to her work. Details are selective but vivid, and the rules of this lightly magical world (ink never runs dry, affects thought) remain consistent. The environment constrains and colors her decisions rather than serving as a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, textured, and integrated with the premise: bonsai forests, mountain silence, the abandoned town, and the fluorescent lamp all reinforce the themes of compression, memory, and restrained energy. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility, especially in how she interprets silence and machines. The environment supports tone more than it constrains choices—she could do similar work in any quiet, abandoned place—but it charges the atmosphere meaningfully. Spatial and temporal anchors are clean and persuasive.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The container labyrinth, shifting with the tides, is vivid and specific, and it’s consistently filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility (“space between rhythm and rust”). The environment is not decorative: the tide’s behavior literally reveals the label, and the maze-like corridors mirror the fragmented, unstable nature of memory and erasure. World rules (containers as maze, labels as currency, workers’ speech accumulating in corners) are consistent and learned through concrete observation. The recurring water/metal/container imagery charges the final movement into deeper darkness and another cycle of collection.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory, cliff, and twilight are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elena’s sensibility as a debunker of decayed wonders. Details like the smell of “salt and sawdust,” the rusted dome, and the open shutter make the place tactile and atmospheric. The setting subtly mirrors theme—the observatory as a “book settling into its final chapter” charges the final image. Still, the environment rarely constrains her options or directly shapes decisions; it’s more a strong backdrop than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The raft-city carnival is vivid and specific—the contrast between creaking old rafts and “glass platforms gleamed like floating diamonds” grounds the socioeconomic tension in concrete space. Setting is well-filtered through Mira’s priorities (investors’ “gilded barges,” the underside of docks, food stalls, lanterns) and supports the coded-symbol system organically. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain her choices, it meaningfully charges the imagery and the method of resistance. The recurring object-setting of the foundation stone chip nicely ties place to theme in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lunar setting is vivid and integral: earthlight, regolith, Tycho’s rim, and sublimating frost all feel precise and lived-in, filtered through a professional’s eye. Environmental constraints (permanent marks in the regolith, the sun’s advance, dependent chemical camera tech) shape both tactics and theme. The summit’s “dawning hush” and the transformation into “harsh clarity of lunar day” elegantly mirror the emotional arc without feeling forced. The recurring objects—camera, frost, sand grain—charge the final image and help avoid any whiff of white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: mist, rail/water junction, and especially the water basins are not just atmosphere but tools in Elias’s method. Sensory choices are purposeful—sound and touch over sight—nicely aligned with the POV. The depot’s liminal quality supports the theme of connection and transition, and the mist swallowing the hummingbird at the end gives the environment a charged final image. The only ceiling here is that the depot itself does not strongly constrain tactics beyond providing the water features.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen lake and rusted hydrographic outpost are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Miriam’s professional eye, giving the setting a strong lived-in specificity. Environmental details—condensation patterns, ice cracks, the outpost’s ghosts—meaningfully echo her obsession with hidden waterways and forgotten research. The final image of the frozen lake under a held-breath sky recharges earlier atmospheric cues and supports the charged poise ending. The landscape doesn’t yet constrain a concrete tactic, but it powerfully charges mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly textured and deeply integrated: archway as tuning peg, cobblestones as resonant medium, ironwood tree and blight as history, and the strange humidity as a physicalized symptom of decay. Details are filtered through Eliorn’s sonic sensibility, so environment and profession fuse rather than reading as catalogued scenery. Crucially, place is not decorative—town layout dictates her walking routes, and the archway and stones literally carry the magic and the ending’s charge. A slightly broader range of sensory modes (beyond the sonic and tactile) in one or two key moments could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The forgotten underwater temple is vividly evoked—the darkness, icy water, kelp curtains, extinct sea creatures, twilight-colored light—and is tightly bound to the premise of preserved beauty and hush. The environment constrains choice (oxygen, isolation, collapsed entrance) and supplies critical resources (the hidden mechanism), and the vial as object-as-setting becomes a new “atmosphere” at the end. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual but remains purposeful and filtered through Marina’s urgency. A bit more tactile interaction with the physical space under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marcus’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, haunted atmosphere. The setting is not postcard backdrop: the lighthouse’s isolation as a repository of “unwanted truths” and the reef as grave actively frame the stakes and the final image. The confessional cell within the tower and the narrow door’s scuffs are concrete, recurring anchors that charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the alchemical greenhouse, artificial moons, glowing fruit, and endless night are vivid, specific, and tightly wired to mood and theme. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the endless night pressing at the glass as the first stars of dawn “recognize their old positions” ties world-conditions to the progress of the debt. Details are filtered through Elara’s relationship to plants and growth, so the worldbuilding feels lived rather than touristic. The only limiter is that the setting mostly shapes tone and symbolism rather than constraining concrete tactical choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The red canyon labyrinth and vanished ocean are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the premise—the environment literally dictates the need for path-stitching and gives the final image its charge. Details like empty tide pools, glowing sewn paths, and the still spring “as broken glass” all feel filtered through Maren’s sensibility and support the sacred/ruinous tone. The canyon meaningfully constrains choice (hidden springs, treacherous maze) even if the navigation pressure isn’t dramatized as peril. The setting’s transformation from desiccated ruin to consecrated lifeline underwrites the entire ending.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly realized: the “catacomb orchard,” bones threaded with roots, wet earth, and the apple tree visible through a crack give the space a vivid, tactile presence. Details are filtered through Mira’s sensibility as both archaeologist and granddaughter, and they evolve with the action (from underground chamber to moonlit orchard, from buried sundial base to restored surface marker). The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the roots, bones, apple tree, and sundial all converge in the last scene to embody the life/death, past/present braid. While the setting subtly shapes what’s possible, it rarely constrains moment-to-moment tactics, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Golden Pixel Arcade is beautifully realized—neon tubes, lingering popcorn smell, chalk on sidewalks—giving the story a concrete, atmospheric locus. Details are filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a curator of obsolete mediums, and the environment consistently supports tone and theme. However, the setting rarely constrains or redirects choices; it’s more shrine and backdrop than active pressure. That keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt observatory, copper-stained windows, eternal candle, and autumn frost create a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and tonally aligned with secrecy and liminal visibility. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as an observer of patterns, which deepens both atmosphere and worldbuilding. The eternal candle and frost especially charge the final image, contrasting patient light with encroaching cold and city-level danger. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully frames how she can do her clandestine work.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are vividly evoked and feel texturally specific rather than generic swamp atmosphere; details like roots as “crooked fingers” and the glass set in mangrove trunk integrate setting with emotional stakes. The environment is not just backdrop—it’s the literal spatialization of unsaid apologies and shapes what is possible (e.g., the labyrinth navigation, the condensation window, moonlight on water). The gargoyle shard and the window function as charged micro-settings that constrain and focus Maren’s choices. A minor limitation is that the physicality of moving through the swamp feels almost too effortless, so the landscape’s practical danger never quite matches its metaphysical charge.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist-clad atrium, amber lights, and medical setting are vivid and sensorially grounded, and they evolve appropriately as twilight deepens. Details are filtered through Elira’s state—the softened edges from anesthesia, the 'eternal, misty embrace'—giving the environment a subjective charge. The coral fragment functions as a micro-setting object, returning at the end to embody the theme of damage accreting into structure. While the setting doesn’t overtly constrain decision-paths, it strongly shapes tone and the final image, which is enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard district and its perpetual fog are vividly rendered (“twisted stumps…like broken teeth,” walls “waiting for someone to give them back their voices”) and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The environment does more than decorate: the fog’s thickness and strange light are the enabling condition for her work and the district’s “own logic,” and the final image of a place remembering joy is inseparable from this setting. Details are selective and purposeful, with the orchard history and communal hall grounding the world. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics, it heavily charges tone, stakes, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: parabolic stone walls, multi-layered echoes, the reflecting pool, and the mural all interact with Elena’s profession and perception. The environment materially shapes her tactics (timing brushstrokes to echoes) and charges the final image as the garden “washes over her” while she picks up her brush. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the coin functions as a micro-setting object tied to the acoustics. The atmosphere—half-architectural wonder, half-uncanny resonance—is cohesive and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the garden plots as cipher, the spiral kale and password cabbage, the convergence point, Okonkwo’s greenhouse and mantises, and the drones all feel lived-in and purposeful. Environmental details consistently shape tactics—she reads cabbages as a password, chooses the convergence bed, moves under drone surveillance, and relies on the greenhouse insects as lookouts. The final image of the seed’s root reaching into a hidden “water table of rebellion” uses the environment to charge theme and closure. A slight risk of decorative density remains, but most details earn their place by constraining or enabling choices.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The house grown around a gargantuan shell, the garrett-greenhouse, the off-key wind, and the galaxy postcard all create a distinctive, charged environment. The shell’s inward/outward spiral and the greenhouse metaphor explicitly inflect how she lives and what her poems do, so setting is not mere backdrop. The final beats reuse these elements (shell, postcard, wind) to charge the closure image. It could go even higher if the physical environment constrained a concrete decision on the page, rather than primarily thematic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “opal library above clouds” and “museum of extinct feelings” are vividly realized, with concrete subspaces like the Hall of Obsolete Joys and Corridor of Lost Longings that feel particular rather than generic. Setting is tightly braided to theme and tone, charging nearly every paragraph with a specific atmosphere of rarefied, suspended loss. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it functions as a microcosm of the story’s conceptual stakes and gives the final image genuine charge. The consistency of opalescent, glass, and cloud imagery creates a coherent, memorable world-rule texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Extinct Language Archive is vividly realized—whispering dead languages, shelves, lamplight—and always filtered through Elara’s scholarly and emotional focus. The glass ink well, raised glyphs, and the archive’s held-breath silence function as a micro-setting that charges the final image (“the ink well still warm”) and mirrors her internal tension. Environmental details are selective and purposeful, reinforcing tone and theme instead of feeling like a tour. The setting doesn’t physically constrain options much, but it deeply charges atmosphere and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater is vividly realized and thematically loaded: its breathing stones, concentric rings, and geothermal channels mirror the father’s floodgate philosophy and Elara’s work. Setting is filtered through her professional eye, with details like volcanic tuff, decay patterns, and heat flow feeling both lived-in and purposeful. The environment charges the final image—the volcano’s eventual eruption and the amphitheater’s negotiation with geological pressure underscore the stakes of her decision. This is a strong case of environment as thematic and emotional engine rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The attic—with its vanilla-and-forgetting smell, skylight, and dust motes—feels lived-in and essential, not decorative. The skylight and dust become literal tools for her method, and the vintage bookshop archives are the only plausible source for the letters and meteorite. Environmental stillness constrains her to a kind of enforced attention that mirrors her emotional constraint. Setting and atmosphere are deeply fused with theme, though they stop just short of overtly constraining a crisis choice at the end, which keeps this out of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is striking and specific—the “prism terrace,” crooked wood grain, and altered atmosphere feel tactile and integrated with Elara’s thinking, not like postcard description. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: the terrace’s physical drift along old flight paths actively delivers her to the village and embodies the story’s logic about weather codes and architecture. This charged use of object-as-setting and weather earns a high score, though a bit more sensory variance beyond the visual could deepen the embodiment further.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater research facility is rendered with vivid, selective detail—bioluminescent corridors, crystalline cabinets, the glass observatory—and always through Marek’s sensibility. The environment supports theme and tone (crushing dark vs “luminous respite”) and charges the final image of him held in the observatory’s glow. The rules of this world are consistent enough to feel lived-in, and the micro-geography (lock → corridors → observatory → archive) is clear. While the setting doesn’t force a hard tactical choice, it shapes what kind of story this can be and makes the closure image memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The geode cave and crater glass are vividly rendered and feel integral rather than decorative; the environment’s light and refractive qualities mirror and support the memory-work without becoming over-symbolic. The setting meaningfully affects the process (“amplified her perception”) and charges the atmosphere of the reading. Detail selection stays purposeful and character-filtered—this is Maren’s working space, not a tourist catalog. A bit more tactile interaction with the environment under peak emotional strain could push this into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal arcade, sand, and mechanical games are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Marek’s sense of rhythm and probability, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The tide’s pulses and the “between acts” emptiness nicely mirror his interest in liminal, statistically exploitable spaces. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, it does meaningfully shape the texture and logic of his art. The specificity and integration are excellent, even if they stop short of exerting hard pressure on the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The twilight garden under stars is vivid and specific—pale flowers opening at a liminal hour, insect sounds, last warmth in petals—firmly rooting the scene. The environment is thematically apt as a threshold space “at the edge of everything,” aligning with exile/arrival and the act of inscribing a cosmic verse. Setting details are filtered through the tide dancer’s sensibility (tides, salt, stars), which keeps them from feeling like neutral tour-guide description. Still, the garden rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly charges mood rather than exerting concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor edge, warped workshop windows, and especially the pond and fog are vivid, sensorially grounded, and tightly filtered through the glazier’s way of seeing. Setting is not mere backdrop: the liminal quality of Pearl Bay at dawn and the still/moving pond explicitly shape her reflections and the final charged image of “carrying the pond’s lesson” into the day. The specificity of glass, water, and mist as lived-in tools of perception gives the atmosphere real heft. This environmental integration meaningfully charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge path with blackened stumps, new saplings, and moonlight is vividly rendered and tightly tied to theme. The porcelain box and the burned landscape function as micro-setting constraints, charging the final vigil and making this place uniquely necessary to the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (firefighter’s knowledge of fire lines, controlled burns). While the environment doesn’t strongly dictate tactics, it decisively charges the ending image and the terms of her annual return.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tide-polished grotto, filtered afternoon light, and salt-scented water are vivid and recur in ways that echo the slow, methodical reworking of hope. The environment feels specific and lived-in, with the sea’s erosion nicely paralleling incremental research. However, the setting mostly decorates and metaphorizes; it rarely constrains options or forces tactical choices beyond gentle ambiance and symbolism. Strong atmosphere and specificity, just shy of using environment as an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is rich and integrated: ivy-veiled corridors, drowned coasts, cold air, and ash-filled fireplaces all feel tactile and filtered through Mira’s vocation. The building as a dreaming, decaying organism is vividly rendered and thematically aligned with memory and echoes. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain concrete choices, but it deeply charges the final image (ivy as audience; walls dreaming aloud). Detail selection is economical and avoids generic climate-apocalypse shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and specific: wet earth, awakening blossoms, rain-slick stone, and the prism parapet all create a strong atmospheric anchor filtered through Aria’s attention. Environmental details are well integrated with action (droplets refracting light into rainbows as she arrives; the villa’s various mirrors as loci of her work). The space feels coherent and tactile, not like a generic “abandoned villa.” That said, the setting mostly frames mood rather than constraining choices, which slightly limits its functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terrace, valley, embroidered clans, and “slow dance of celestial bodies” create a rich, coherent atmosphere that feels integral to the story’s tone. The terrace as the site of a son’s death and as an ancient neutral ground meaningfully charges the negotiation without turning into schematic symbolism. Environmental details are filtered through Maren’s professional and emotional lens, not as a tourist catalog. The setting enhances rather than constrains choice, so while it’s thematically strong, it stops short of the kind of environment-as-active-constraint that would push this above 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt flat and dried riverbeds are vividly realized and tightly integrated: the landscape is both weapon (product of her drought engineering) and sanctuary. Environmental detail is purpose-driven—the emptiness, cracks as a “map,” and distant thunder all mirror and constrain her choices. The final image of the egg on the salt crust directly recharges prior setting details, giving the place thematic and emotional weight. A slightly wider sensory range beyond visual/aural might deepen immersion, but what’s here is already strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is lush and purposeful: the silver courtyard, frozen prism fountain, and snow are not just backdrop but the literal and symbolic site of resistance and release. Environmental details evolve with the story—the prisms brightening as she works, then scattering dawn rainbows—to mirror and charge the internal shift. The world’s rules (spiritual residue, threads around frozen water) feel consistent and are learned through action, though a touch less ornamentation could heighten their functional sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vividly evoked and integral: its history of scanning for threats and preserving echoes mirrors Elias’s own vigilance and the ethical afterlife of stories. Details like the rusted service hatch, circular platform, and “meteor hush” over the valley are sensorial and filtered through his reflective state. The dome and its acoustics shape his choice to perform the ritual there and charge the ending as it “held his words” like past echoes. The story stick as an object-setting hybrid also constrains action and anchors the final image, pushing this into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto above the clouds, with its volcanic stone, condensation, and wind-swept ferns, is richly specific and integrated with action. Environment directly shapes peril and choice: the gust that wrecks her structures is not arbitrary, and the suspended garden’s fragility mirrors the transient histories she honors. Details like “ghost-impressions of green against the gray pumice” carry thematic as well as sensory weight without feeling like a mere postcard. The setting also charges the final image of rebuilding in a place that may vanish.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and thematically tuned, with concrete details like frost-laced floors, cracked dome, and dawn refracting through ice. Setting is not mere backdrop; cold affects her body (numb fingers, fogging breath) and the sanctum’s abandonment and ice embody her isolation and long stasis. Objects-as-setting—the rope, the dome, the ice—charge the final image, as the “living archive” now inhabits this harsh, static environment. The environment doesn’t present hard logistical constraints, but it deeply shapes mood, history, and what her act means.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vine-draped bunker, pedestal, wafer, and storm are vivid and integrated into her actions (finding the entrance, placing the seal, feeling the bunker “breathe”). Sensory texture is good—concrete, vines, wind, “copper scent” of the storm—without devolving into a generic fantasy cave. The environment supports tone and concept more than it constrains choice, though the rewilded forest and impending storm do add a mild pressure frame. The setting feels specific and atmospheric enough for a strong mid-high score, if not yet indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The palace, observatory rooftop, and archives are clearly sketched, and the “between regimes” twilight gives the piece an effective atmospheric frame. The tile as an object-as-setting is nicely integrated, anchoring abstract ideas in a concrete artifact that returns in the final image. However, the supposed Babylonian specificity never quite materializes beyond generic palace/guard/stars imagery, and sensory detail remains mostly visual and conceptual. The environment supports tone and theme more than it palpably constrains bodies and choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: soundless sanctuary, breathing walls, Tuesday sky fragment, dead garden restored—all filtered through the shifting “grace” concept. Environmental changes track with emotional pressure and then the resolution, especially the final image of the garden solidifying and roses rooting in once-concrete soil. The soundless aspect meaningfully affects action (Kael’s laugh without sound) rather than being decorative. World rules around shifting are consistent enough to support the premise without bogging the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ruined orchard district and its perpetual fog are vivid, specific, and thematically tied to liminality—“a kind of boundary, a world halfway between solid and absent.” The setting is not just backdrop: fog, frost, conservatory ruins, and ancient trees all echo and charge the boundary-erasure concept and the closing image. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Mira’s work and sensibility, not as a tourist catalog. The final vision of glass mountains pressed against fog and broken wall clearly depends on this established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned cathedral with an orchard in the rafters is vivid, specific, and thematically charged; rotting pears, lingering incense, and shattered stained glass all mirror decayed vows without feeling like a bland symbol set. Tools, pears, and the quartz fragments function as micro-setting elements that she physically engages with, and the environment evolves (light fading, moonrise) in step with the arc. The setting also materially charges the final image of the repaired quartz eye and ribbon under moonlight. It’s more atmospheric than constraining tactically, but its integration with mood and theme is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The astral orchard and asteroid are strongly imagined—humming fruit, crystalline rows, “sentences waiting to be read”—and the contrast with the cramped, fluorescent bathroom is effective. Setting details are filtered through Mira’s role and family legacy, giving them a lived-in feel rather than tourist description. The environment exerts some pressure (orchard radiation justifies the bathroom as sanctuary) and charges the final image with the tree/asteroid/figure motif. It could shape concrete options slightly more, but as an atmospheric and thematic frame it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain-spanning labyrinthine bookstore is richly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s perspective, from mist-cloaked shelves to the nautilus chamber. Environmental features meaningfully affect what’s possible—the shifting geography, empty wings, and deliberate omissions are not mere backdrop but embodiments of the library’s rules and stakes. The final narrowing into a single doorway, with the mountain “sighing,” directly charges the closing image and her impending choice. This integration of architecture, atmosphere, and theme is strong enough to approach publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned carnival ship in fog is vivid and tonally apt, and details like “phantom passengers who remembered the calliope’s song” and rotting planks embed atmosphere efficiently. The emerald card functions as a micro-setting object, mediating glimpses of impossible gardens and charging the final image. However, the environment mostly frames mood rather than actively constraining or redirecting her choices in concrete ways. The setting supports theme and tone more than it shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly realized through smell, material, and scale, and the machinery and rope are not mere backdrop but functional parts of the plot. Details are filtered credibly through an archivist’s priorities, and the environment directly enables the climactic act of rebraiding to open the door. The final image of the university as a “living document, written in iron and wax” shows the setting charging the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harmonic caves, frozen pool, and crack patterns create a rich, tactile environment strongly filtered through a professional’s eye. World rules—resonance, stress in stone/ice, beings dependent on constant frequency—are learned via action rather than dumped. The echo chamber stone and the cavern itself actively constrain and enable choices (how and where a bloom can form, how she can detect and invite it), and they decisively charge the final image. Sensory detail is concentrated around sound, vibration, and cold in a way that deepens both atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glass humming pavilion, ambered glass, and skeletal beacon tower are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details like the hum and the amber light resonate with the themes of encoded meaning and softened ruin. The setting participates in the ending image (the pavilion “vibrated beneath her feet as if in approval”), charging the final beat, though it rarely constrains concrete tactical choices. Overall, the world feels specific and lived-in without slipping into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly imagined and tightly integrated: crystal forecourt, solidified fog, stormlight, and monuments are all filtered through her professional and emotional lens. The environment is not mere backdrop; “where fog became solid and storms provided illumination” explicitly fuses world-physics with the concept of collective memory and charges the final image. Details are specific and purposeful, with the crystals’ whispering and the shadow angles functioning as tools of her craft. This world feels singular and thematically load-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the blooming fortress, starless sky, and specific flora (evening primrose, creeping thyme) are vividly rendered and filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The environment is not just postcard—war-ruin-turned-garden and the abandoned fortress frame the thematic shift from siege to resurrection. Tools and micro-setting (courtyard, flagstones, mosaic floor) actively shape action by channeling where she prepares and sets the spiral. The final image of the spiral rising against a blank sky clearly draws power from the carefully built atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and star-slit opening are vividly rendered and deeply fused to Mira’s way of seeing, avoiding tourist-list description. Environment operates as more than backdrop: the still pool, carved stone, and starlight all mirror and charge the idea of liminal transition. The grotto’s ancient, tidal-carved quality directly informs how she frames the argument and the work of forgiveness, and the closing image depends on this setting. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical space (sound, temperature, bodily position) under peak pressure could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    The xenial trellis above the clouds is vividly rendered and sensorially specific: translucent barrier, fog below, arcing branches, and “gilded hush” all create a strong atmospheric container. Setting is filtered tightly through Mira’s history with the bunker, so the open, impossible garden continually recontextualizes her sense of space and safety. The recurring objects—the doll and the sprout in the crack—are spatially grounded and charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain logistics, it decisively shapes perception and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prism terrace, sound-refraction city, and floating vessel are vividly imagined and consistently filtered through Maren’s professional attention. The environment is not mere backdrop: acoustic properties, the train whistle’s echo, and the storm glass all inform how and when she can act. Details like light refracting across the boy’s face and the “cathedral” hush charge both process and final image. The world’s rules feel coherent and learned through practice rather than dumped as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“hidden orchard behind a kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “trees with silver bark,” “grass that hummed with harvested starlight”—and consistently filtered through Elara’s reverent, scholarly gaze. The imagery establishes a strong atmosphere of liminal, techno-mythic wonder. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains her choices; beyond the portal window, it rarely alters tactics or options. That keeps the setting from fully interlocking with the narrative stakes at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ashen, charcoal-built sanctuary and the ruined bridge debris are vividly realized and tightly bound to the protagonist’s psychology. The environment is not a backdrop but the embodiment of her choices, and its slow dissolution (walls returning to earth, threshold fading) directly pressures her to act. The recurring contrast between interior charcoal darkness and exterior starlight charges the final image. Setting, object, and body sensations could be diversified slightly beyond visual/cold, but what’s present is purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mushroom farm’s bioluminescence, damp-earth smell, and “breathing underground” ambience are vivid and tonally precise, strongly supporting the speculative mood. Setting details (glowing fungi tracking her, the blue-green twilight) are filtered clearly through Maya’s perception and mirror her unease and wonder. The bolt functions as a recurring object that charges the final image and marks the before/after state. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or action; it’s more atmospheric than tactical, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is rich, specific, and tightly fused to tone: the overgrown wisteria, sepia reading room, and “golden shadows” all feel lived-in and thematically apt. The reading room and the gramophone are not mere décor; the sanctity of the room and the placement of the machine constrain what can happen and where the supernatural event unfolds. Sensory detail (scent of paper and leather, rusted hinges, tarnished brass) is selective and filtered through Elara’s memory and estrangement. While the environment does not yet force a high-stakes tactical choice, it meaningfully charges the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “alchemical orchard” with phosphorescent fruit, crystallized apple trees, and dangling marionettes feels concrete and atmospheric rather than generic fantasy. Details are well filtered through Aldric’s sensibility as a retired knight seeking seclusion. Crucially, the greenhouse is not just wallpaper: its vanishing at the end embodies the cost and charges the final image of him walking into the night with a new inner resource. It could, however, do a bit more to constrain his on-page choices rather than primarily functioning as a mood-rich container.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The foster care file room in a former plantation house is an excellent, loaded setting that fuses historical and emotional atmosphere. Details like “forty years of whispered histories,” high windows, and creaking floorboards filtered through Mara’s gaze create a dense, coherent mood. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain action, but the plantation-house context and archival materials clearly charge the thematic stakes and the final image of the button within the file.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings are vivid, purposeful, and filtered through Mira’s sensibility: the palimpsest city, the Ministry’s marble halls, and especially the auric lagoon all feel lived-in and thematically charged. The lagoon under starlight and the old phone company infrastructure are not just backdrop—they shape the tactics (key, tunnels, puddle-map) and charge the final image. World rules around revisions, reappearing lagoon, and tunnels are consistent enough to trust. This integration of environment with theme and action is a standout strength.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, prism atrium, mist, and dewdrops are richly realized and tightly integrated with the action—the light and droplets set the temporal window, influence the music’s pattern, and mark the prophecy’s breathing. The environment evolves with events (thickening mist, faster dewdrops, full radiance at the end) and the final image of sunlight breaking through directly charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid but purposeful rather than touristic; the setting is inseparable from how the ritual works. The only reason this doesn’t nudge into the 9s is that the environment constrains tactics more symbolically than through concrete physical limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the “ashen skyborne arbor,” spiral staircase, seed vault, and whispering birch all feel coherently imagined and filtered through Seraphina’s attention. Environmental details like the Hush, the world’s highest ridge, and jars of stored harvests do real world-building work and support the story’s tone. The moonstone speck and arbor function as micro-settings that charge the final image, but they seldom constrain choice in a way that forces different tactics. Still, for this length, the atmosphere and specificity are strong enough to feel immersive and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Maren’s gaze: rust “the color of dried blood,” shattered glass, swirling leaves, mineral-damp stairwell. The greenhouse and stairwell are more than décor—they shape her movement and subtly mirror the passage from ordered, mechanical time into a forgotten, organic underworld. Sensory detail leans visual but is supplemented well by sound (running water) and touch (cooler, heavier air), giving the place real presence. The environment doesn’t yet constrain a specific tactical choice at the end, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rain-washed foundry, dripping roof, and cooling forge are vivid and integrated with Maren’s emotional state, with the percussion of water and the bloom of fire mirroring her grief and resolve. The coin and the forge operate as micro-setting tools that constrain what she can do—this is the one place where repairing the coin in this way is plausible, and that specificity charges the final image of luminous seams in the dim workshop. Weather returns meaningfully at the end, echoing the opening and reinforcing the quiet, unresolved nature of the loss. A small limitation is that the foundry doesn’t present any physical constraints or obstacles; it is an evocative container rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Echo gorge and the hidden sunrise are richly rendered and meaningfully integrated: the acoustics create the premise (unfinished words amplified), and the gorge’s narrowing “to a wound” mirrors the emotional work. The harp, case, and crocodile’s tooth function almost as micro-settings—tactile, handled, and crucial to how she operates. The environment shapes tactics (she comes here because this is where spectral confessions can be reached), and the final image of luminous morning over the gorge charges the closure. It stops short of absolute formal inventiveness, but the setting is both beautiful and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered and filtered through altered perception, with “colors that existed only in the space between what eyes were meant to see and what they could survive” anchoring both world and psyche. Setting evolves with the narrative—from dense canopy to thinning trees to the basin-like clearing—and the moss path and light frequencies interact with her body and memory. The environment does channel her (nowhere else to go, path remembered by her body), and the final clearing image is strongly charged. It stops just shy of the very top tier because the forest constrains atmosphere more than concrete tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s market “strung high above the city rooftops” and the neighboring stalls are vivid, economical, and strongly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting details—the sideways painting, the corridor of intuition, the oblivious city below—do more than decorate; they reinforce liminality and the theme of overlooked guidance. The recurring lens fragment as object-as-setting effectively charges the final image, constraining the kind of choice she must make. A slight limitation is that the environment doesn’t materially constrain tactics so much as it atmospherically supports them.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is rich, specific, and firmly filtered through Marcus’s professional and spectral sensitivities: abandoned circus posters, dust strata, cracked plaster like “frozen lightning.” Environment is not mere backdrop; dust distribution and ceiling cracks literally guide him to the hatch. Occupational detail (elevator shafts, counterweights, ticket office layout) feels plausible and purposeful. The circus-specificity mainly serves mood rather than constraint, but the line-level environmental craft is near-publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library, cloud-sea, frost-histories, and aether-ships are vivid and integrated into action rather than feeling like a backdrop catalog. The non-negotiable letterpress and the Library’s reality-responsive climate directly shape what Elara can do and how revelations arrive. The final image—cloud-sea patterns in the language of rustling awakenings, Library growing new sections—charges the environment with consequence. Setting is a major strength and feels inseparable from the story’s premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The baroque asteroid, visible time “like amber honey,” brass pipes, and crystalline walls create a distinct, coherent environment that’s both vivid and functional. Setting directly constrains choices (she must traverse Archive Hall and cover mirrors; walls dissipate storm energy), and rules around time-storms feel consistent. Details are filtered through Vespera’s sensibility rather than touristic listing. The only limit is that, at this length, some rich concepts (e.g., “Archive Hall,” “baroque civilization”) are more evoked than fully embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The resonance chamber, its honesty rule, the orchestrion, and moonless world are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone and theme. Details like “vaulted ceiling catching every whisper,” machines that respond to dishonesty, and dawn finally lightening the windows move beyond postcard description to charge the final image. The environment doesn’t impose hard logistical constraints on his tactics beyond the truth-telling rule, but it clearly frames what kind of work is possible and why it matters. Overall, setting is a major strength and feels inseparable from the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the shuttered factory, limestone fissures, and the “subterranean lagoon…luminous and impossibly still” are rendered with precise, sense-driven detail filtered through Elara’s obsessions. Weather, stone, and water are not postcard backdrop but directly entwined with the premise of petrichor and memory. The environment also constrains choice—the rising water table makes the fissure accessible, and the lagoon existing “beyond the reach of scent” forces the final renunciation. The tone of hush and geological patience in the landscape elegantly mirrors the story’s thematic concerns without slipping into over-declared symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal road, storm, and cliffside archway are sharply drawn and strongly filtered through Aria’s material awareness, and the weather meaningfully affects her tactics (parking, walking, seeking shelter). The archway in particular is excellent as a recurring locus, appearing in the present, in the slide’s images, and finally as the object her sculpture reaches toward. Environmental detail and occupational specificity (salt, grain, sawdust) feel lived-in rather than touristic. A slight overreliance on atmospheric grayness and abstraction at the end keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pavilion, etched glass, frost, and garden are rendered with exceptional sensory specificity and a consistent warm/umbrous palette. Environment is not just backdrop: the angle of dawn light and ice on the cathedral window literally enables the discovery, and the seasonal shift from amber autumn to melting snow to green shoots charges the final image. Details feel strongly filtered through an artist’s eye, leveraging pattern, color, and light in character-specific ways. Setting thus both shapes the key turn and deepens the thematic resonance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the floating library on the Persephone, the coastline like “a golden sea,” and the engineered beach debris pattern build a strong atmosphere. Details are consistently filtered through Miriam’s sensibility as archivist and granddaughter, which keeps the environment from feeling like a postcard. The obsidian lagoon functions as more than backdrop, acting as a literal and metaphorical threshold that frames the final encounter. The zeppelin’s library is slightly underused as a constraint on choice, but it does establish tone and context effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “paper-lantern cove,” ruined markets, the old wishing temple, and wet sand as a ritual medium all feel concrete and lived-in. Details are filtered through Elias’s memory and role as alchemist, giving the place a strong atmospheric charge. The environment matters to action—the cove edge, sand, and porous amber are instrumental to the process—and the final image of lanterns reigniting uses the setting to charge the ending. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual might deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rooftop orchard above the city, with its gnarled apple trees and skeletal foghorn tower, is vivid and particular, shaping atmosphere and mirroring the story’s layering of old and new technologies. Details like “fireflies in a jar” city lights and salt-smelling wind are specific and filtered through Seraphine’s attention. The setting charges the final image—she remains among the roots beneath the silent tower—but it doesn’t materially constrain or complicate choices, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “icebound atrium under starlight” and greenhouse are vividly rendered and thematically apt, with cold vs. sheltered warmth mirroring the stakes of preservation. Details like the frosted dome, constellations, and long winter dormancy are specific and filtered through Elara’s attention to seeds and time. Environment does exert some subtle pressure (temperature drop, limited warmth, fragile sprouts) and the oak acorn cap functions as a charged micro-setting object at the center of the ritual. Still, the space is more atmospheric than constraining; it shapes tone and symbolism more than tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The monastery-turned-weather-station “above the clouds” is vivid and specific, with sensory and professional details (granite outcropping, wind, arrays, valleys) filtered through Elara’s meteorological eye. Setting is integrated with function—the altitude and line-of-sight justify her role as the initiating station for thirty thousand people. Recurring objects (the bell rope, the switch, the sensors) charge atmosphere and concept even if not all constrain choices directly. Weather and place steadily shape tone and stakes, especially in the final image of the front revealing itself and the hush yielding to rain.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tracking station in a “hollow between celestial currents” and the recurring yellow lantern glass create a vivid, integrated environment that shapes both mood and practice. Setting details (recycling fires, resting tails, overlooked waypoint) are specific and filtered through the janitor’s reverent perception, deepening the sense of “flourishing stillness.” The environment meaningfully charges the final image of carrying the fragment to the collection chamber for rebirth. This is one of the piece’s strongest dimensions and feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned apiary in the wasteland is vivid and particular—“skeletons of beekeeping equipment,” “broken comb and fractured glass,” “pools of amber and rose”—and the bees’ absence saturates atmosphere and theme. The setting is not just backdrop: the apiary’s history and physical remnants justify the lingering ghost and the buried box, and the final image is inseparable from this place. Environmental detail is well-filtered through Mira’s sensibility and never devolves into a tourist catalog. While the wasteland itself doesn’t overtly constrain choice, the oasis-as-sanctuary deeply charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald silo with its green glass rings, shifting equations, and low hum is vivid, unusual, and tonally matched to the premise. Setting details are filtered through the timekeeper’s priorities (broken time capsules, temporal anomalies), so the world feels lived-in rather than touristic. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it clearly charges the final image of the silo “holding its broken treasures” and reinforces the thematic frame of sanctuary for damaged time. Overall, atmosphere is a major asset of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vividly and economically rendered; weather, debris, and light all feel tactile and specific. Setting is tightly braided with mood and theme—the storm’s “aftermath” mirrors damage and healing, while reflections in the water literalize the idea of more-real second versions. The lagoon and shoreline meaningfully charge key images (kite skeleton, half-submerged root, water-splash hunt). The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does decisively charge the final images, which is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: living stone pillars, sacred geometry, moss, copper wire, and fruit trees all function as both environment and conceptual machinery. Maren’s expertise determines what she notices (water flow, microclimates, root systems), anchoring worldbuilding in character bias rather than exposition. The temple-orchard literally shapes her actions—climbing ladders, wiring branches—and thematically charges the ending, where pillars and trees continue their “slow conversation” after her. A slight further constraint on options in the moment (e.g., a specific physical challenge imposed by the environment) would be needed to push into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, dust motes, and spring light all mirror her liminal psychological state and the theme of weathered, patient journeys. The amber as a micro-setting object is superbly used; its physical properties and the fly’s frozen motion directly charge the final image and thematic frame. Environmental details evolve (morning rain → afternoon warmth, her descent) and are filtered through her scientific yet newly contemplative attention. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it deeply conditions mood, thought, and the story’s final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “blooming jetty,” bleached reef ribs, mud at the waterline, and the birds’ vantage all create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details are filtered through the coachman’s sensibility (seeing the reef as a battlefield, hearing treaties in bird calls), which keeps the world from feeling like a neutral backdrop. The reef’s corpse and the jetty’s “single wooden finger” directly charge the final image of green threads breaking the water. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it meaningfully shapes theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly drawn and filtered through the scavenger’s professional eye, giving the setting a strong lived-in feel. Weather/light (“perpetual twilight,” “sky bruised purple and orange”) and metal labyrinths reinforce mood without becoming generic. The environment underpins stakes—libraries are gone, tech is improvised, distance is dangerous—even if it doesn’t tightly constrain the immediate micro-choices in the scene. Recurring objects (leaf, cylinder) function as a kind of micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observation deck between stars, containment fields, and residual anomaly are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Mira’s practiced, haunted gaze. The environment feels specific and lived-in, with the cosmos, glass, and machinery echoing her temporal and emotional dilation. The compass rose and sketchbook operate as micro-setting objects, contributing to tone and the final image, though they don’t strongly constrain physical options. Overall, atmosphere and spatial clarity are excellent and tightly tied to the story’s conceptual concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    The icebound spire above the clouds, violet/amber sky, and carved-ice railing are richly specific and create a distinct atmosphere. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Caelius’s perception and mood, especially the “wrong” sky echoing his moral unease. The setting, however, remains mostly atmospheric; cold, height, and the Archive’s physicality don’t significantly constrain choices or tactics. Still, the spire and sky frame the tone of consequence/strangeness effectively, especially in the first, more textured pass.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The customs-house whispering gallery is vivid and conceptually integral: the architecture literally carries her footsteps as archival whispers, and the curved stone and dome are used rather than merely described. The chessboard functions as a micro-setting/object, its fire-scarred squares and missing pawns charging the central space where she leaves it. Environmental detail remains selective and voice-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. The setting shapes meaning more than concrete choices, which is apt for this lyric mode but limits further elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain-bookstore is vivid and particular (“digestive tract of knowledge,” “architecture of grief”), and the stone’s sensory specificity (raised like tiny mountains, feather against glass fingertips) strongly grounds atmosphere. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the mountain-throat sanctuary both shelters and isolates her, so leaving it reconfigures the core situation. The recurring object—the stone—charges the final image as it moves from altar-like relic to something warm in her pocket, carrying the world’s rules and theme with it. A small limitation is that environmental constraints don’t strongly shape tactical options moment-to-moment; most pressure remains internal.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The time-frozen village, suspended villagers, and platinum labyrinth are vivid and specific, with weather and sound (thunder, first drops of rain) deepening atmosphere. Details are well-filtered through Mira’s pattern-oriented mind, tying setting to character. The environment charges the mood and final image but only lightly constrains choices; she could perform the same internal work in a different strange place with modest adjustment. Even so, the setting’s particularity and consistency significantly elevate the piece’s texture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon of bone towers, mist, and echoes is striking and specific, and it’s not mere backdrop: the “constructed silence,” echoes, and spire’s light define how truth can be erased or multiplied. The environment directly shapes tactics (she trusts echoes and mist to carry and hide her words) and charges the final image of a canyon “thick with truths the priests could not identify or un-speak.” World rules around the ritual and the spire are learned organically through her memories and plans. A minor ceiling comes from not quite exploiting the physicality of moving among towers under watch; the pressure remains more conceptual than spatial.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is vivid, tactile, and tightly bound to the stakes—the hovering copper hull, pressure seals, and rising corrosive water literally threaten her life’s work. The statue at the center of the room and the key charm function as micro-settings that constrain her options and organize the ritual. Environmental detail is filtered through her professional eye, so mechanics and damage are noticed in character. Crucially, the workshop/sea configuration and the statue-image charge the final moment, making the environment inseparable from the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal cave network and luminous pool are vividly realized and tightly tied to Marcus’s psychology; the “cathedral” feel and hidden light-in-water metaphorically and concretely frame his isolation and reawakening. The environment actively shapes his options (wandering paths, hidden chamber, reflective pool) and charges the final image of the shell resting in the water. The recurring quay vs. caves contrast deepens the sense of exile and return. Setting details are purposeful, selective, and always filtered through Marcus’s painterly sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the cobalt lighthouse, bruised clouds, fevered stone steps, and the night garden all feel lived-in and sensorially rich. Environmental details (heat wave, thermal currents, protected hollow, salt-worn granite) are integrated into the stakes for ships and the availability of jasmine, rather than feeling like postcard description. The lighthouse, lens, and scent concretely mediate her action, so the environment does constrain and enable choices. It stops short of a 9-band only because at the final image the setting is more lyrical than pressuring; the sense of ongoing cost/constraint there is comparatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marshlands, signal station, and starlit cupola create a vivid, coherent environment whose imagery and mood are tightly braided with grief-navigation (“black water and twisted cypress,” “currents of grief”). The censer foot functions as a micro-setting object whose physical weight and gleam charge both Mara’s interior state and the final image (tears like bronze), and the dead beacon vs. living guidance contrast is strong. While the physical environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain tactics—Mara’s journey to the woman is frictionless—the landscape clearly filters perception and supports the thematic stakes. The final shot of the station “watching” from the hill with its dark beacon explicitly reweights the setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hanging orchard and ravine are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Mira’s forager sensibility, yielding strong sensory and conceptual specificity. The environment does constrain action (collapsed paths, exposed stone, roots as handholds, hollow as cache) and mirrors the persistence-under-ruin theme without feeling like blunt allegory. Storms, erosion, and precarious roots evolve across the scene, giving the setting a lived, dynamic quality. It stops short of directly forcing a critical choice at the end, but it does charge the final image of her studying in the hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich and particular: “opal dock,” mist, lighthouse beam, and nautical twilight all work together to create a textured, lived-in world. Details are filtered through Aldric’s sensibility as keeper, with the lighthouse reading as both literal workplace and thematic locus for “lost things.” The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it does charge the mood and the final image of him on the dock as his inner stance shifts. The Edelweiss as a recurring object effectively functions as micro-setting, reappearing to reweight meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly and economically rendered: the cluttered map shop, the valley tunnels, and especially the blooming cavern feel tactile and strange without over-explanation. Environmental factors actively shape choice—the flooded tunnels, the rising creek, the darkness, and the living carpet of flowers all constrain Maren’s time and options. The recurring objects (maps, chip, door, ants) are fully embedded in place, and the final image of the doorway amid the bloom is strongly charged. A slightly broader sensory range (sound, smell, temperature) in key moments could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is the story’s great strength: the ridge, frost-tasting air, ember/cobalt grotto, and bleeding starlight are vivid and sensorial, tightly filtered through her perception. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the wounded sky and living cave reframe her duty and the dreams’ summons. Weather and altitude subtly shape experience, if not tactics, and motifs (starlight, silver, fireflies) feel organically of this place rather than decorative. The one weakness is that the grotto’s implied danger (“lacy menace”) doesn’t substantially constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ember nexus at twilight, the pocket-sun, and the shell form a coherent, vivid micro-setting that suffuses the piece with atmosphere. Details like “coals breathing their accumulated heat into the cooling air” are both sensory and thematically loaded, tying environment to ideas of density and return. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it decisively charges the final image when Maren presses the warmed columella to her cheek. World rules are consistent and legible within this gently speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and deeply integrated: the birch bark scroll, pine table, cabin, mountain, and valley all mirror his liminal state between life, dream, and death. The environment isn’t just decorative—the isolation, altitude, and ranger cabin silence intensify his temporal dislocation and sense of being forgotten. Recurring environmental images (mountain holding breath, cabin exhaling shadows, birdsong outside time) culminate in the final paragraph, charging the closure. The world’s subtle surrealism (flowers in impossible colors, rewinding birdsong) is consistent with the lucid-dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock shop, the fog, the worn pine floors, and the small screw together create a vivid, coherent micro-world. Details are filtered through Elena’s sensibility (ex-aromatherapist learning to sense through sight, touch, and sound), which keeps the atmosphere purposeful rather than touristic. The environment charges the ending—the fog’s lifting parallels her internal clarity, and the clocks ticking like small hearts contextualize her shift. While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes perception, motif, and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the floating stone tea platform over a canyon of clouds under layered storms, with ozone taste and silver rain, all filtered through Elara’s perception. Environmental details mirror the internal stakes (hovering between storms, held breath, worn ritual stone) without feeling purely ornamental. The crow quill, crystals, and parchment function as tactile micro-setting elements that shape her actions and the final image. The tea ceremony aspect is more atmospheric than functional, so the space could be leaned on even harder to constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard, library, and archive are vividly rendered and tightly tied to theme: trees about to be cut, dead composers’ unfinished work, and the incomplete symphony all echo the sisters’ unfinished business. The recurring perfume bottle and the sound of chainsaws function as charged micro-settings/objects that explicitly shape the final image. Environmental details are economical but pointed (“chainsaws sleep in trucks,” “sheet music…like letters never sent”). The world feels tactile and coherent without digressive cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Archive and temple library are vividly realized with strong, specific images (stones that predate light, spiraling galleries, helix of golden light). Time distortion and the "resounding hush" are well integrated into atmosphere and concept. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces a choice; it mainly frames her movement and mood. The setting is rich and memorable, but its role is descriptive more than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fjord, glacier wind, brass tubes, crystal vessels, and horizon measurement station are vivid, textured, and consistently filtered through Aira’s professional gaze. Setting and apparatus are not mere backdrop; the hydraulic system, atmospheric alignment, and curvature of the earth all mesh thematically with measurement and patience. Environmental forces (cold, wind, silence, darkness) shape the mood more than tactical choices, but they strongly charge the final image of her smiling into the “fjord quiet.” World rules around the clocks and horizon feel coherent and intriguingly specific without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, tactile, and thematically active: mycelial networks, pulsing light, and responsive colonies mirror invisible human connections. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain physical options, but it meaningfully charges the final image as the light “responds to the subtle vibrations of approaching presence.” Details are filtered through Mira’s professional and perceptual biases, avoiding tourist-list description. The setting’s liminal, subterranean quality underpins the story’s obsession with thresholds and permeable barriers.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rainwashed library, wet stone, old paper, subway seats, and hospital room are all sharply rendered with selective, character-colored detail; they feel lived-in rather than touristic. The candle lantern functions as a micro-setting object that charges both backstory and the final image, especially with the “only honest light” claim and its soft flicker against fluorescents. Weather and windows recur to mirror emotional transparency and constraint without heavy-handed symbolism. The settings don’t strongly constrain physical options, but they do materially charge choices and the last tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The environment is vivid and specific: “utility corridor…artery of concrete and copper beneath the city's veins,” the hum of streetlamps, ventilation shifts, scattered emergency boxes. Details are filtered through Mira’s professional familiarity, giving the tunnel a lived-in, almost sacred quality that mirrors her inner function. The glass harmonica disc and the copper lines act as micro-setting anchors that recur and charge the final image. While the setting doesn’t constrain tactical choices (because there are none), it strongly shapes tone and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The jetty, sea lavender, evening stock, harbor lights, and sensory details (scent steeping, mineral tang on the locket) are vivid, layered, and strongly filtered through the archivist’s sensibility. Setting does purposeful thematic work, mirroring liminality and preservation without feeling like a generic postcard. The recurring jetty blossoms and water imagery charge the final image and reinforce the idea of permeable, changing memory. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it meaningfully shapes perception and the story’s emotional weather.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The disused station with ivy and shattered roof is vivid and tonally apt, and the liminal, forgotten place dovetails well with themes of marginal spaces where “healing” happens. The setting recurs in the final line, charging the resolution image and reinforcing the sense of a threshold crossed. Still, the environment remains more atmospheric than constraining; it frames the exchange rather than actively shaping choices.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultrasonic forest, millennium oak, and vibrating insect-quakes create a rich, multi-sensory environment that is tightly tied to Elara’s unique perception. Setting is always filtered through her non-visual senses, which grounds both character and world. The forest and the ring meaningfully constrain choice and possibility—her navigation method literally depends on the acoustic and tactile qualities of this place. The final image (stillpoint left behind, stars finished shifting) is strongly charged by these environmental rules.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: Outpost 7 at a gravitational anomaly that literally bends signals is both world-building and central metaphor. The anomaly constrains her work and shapes the narrative logic of “bent” and “unbent” messages while the monitoring station’s amber light and equipment anchor us spatially. The dried pen functions as a micro-setting/tool with history, charging the final image and tying cosmic interpretation to human craft. Details stay selective and filtered through Mira’s professional eye, avoiding touristy cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor is vividly evoked—“shattered silver” water, wooden docks, empty boats, and moonlight that thickens into near-presence—and consistently filtered through Marina’s grief. The setting supports tone and theme, especially when the night seems to “witness” the exchange between Marina and Elena. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the final image and makes this feel like it could only happen here, not in a generic room. The integration of body, water, light, and tools (camera, rowboat) feels purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Archive of Keth-Soral is vivid and specific—murals as language, burned-out lanterns, hidden spaces behind canvases—and clearly filtered through a character obsessed with art and memory. Setting supports tone and theme rather than feeling like a neutral backdrop. The environment does mildly constrain choice (hidden mechanisms, the maze of corridors) but rarely pressures her in a concrete way. Atmosphere is rich and coherent, though not yet using the physical space to its full tactical potential.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and original, with the sound wave garden’s plants responding to frequency and touch in concrete, sensuous ways that are always filtered through Elara’s use of them. Environment and objects constrain choice: she needs the observation platform to catch vibrations, the garden’s responsiveness to channel her rebellion, and the auric lagoon under specific starlight and hush conditions to reach Mira. World rules (sound → color → meaning) stay internally consistent and culminate in the charged final image of the lagoon pulsing in response to her pattern. The specificity and integration of the setting materially charge the closure rather than serving as postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The container labyrinth, fog, storm-light, and scale of the port are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s professional eye, producing a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment is not just backdrop: it defines the maze-like stakes, makes GPS failure consequential, and justifies why her embodied knowledge and whisper network matter. Recurring objects (coin, key, maps) function as micro-settings/tools that charge the final image and theme. A truly harrowing on-page navigation beat under immediate physical danger could have pushed this closer to the top band, but as-is the setting work is publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: canal, dock after rain, streetlight, warehouse shutters, and the mirror all interact to generate the central tactic and the final image. Environmental specifics (angles of light, slatted shutters, reflective water) aren’t postcard garnish; they are the only way her “language” of light can exist. The dock’s history as the site of her own crisis subtly deepens the place without expository drag. The recurring use of water/stone/light textures meaningfully charges the closing image of stars “that had learned to wait.”

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is rich and purposeful: the cobalt library emerging from mist, the magnetic grotto, and the town’s window displays all feel specific and atmospherically integrated. The grotto and library are not just pretty backdrops; they embody the story’s logic (amplified quiet, unspoken thoughts) and charge the ending image of accumulated second thoughts. The town’s commercial windows—teacup, compass with two norths, unworn path—translate theme into concrete, memorable images. The only reason this isn’t higher is that environment rarely constrains immediate choices; it mostly frames and symbolizes them.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harbor, docks, and especially the “sublittoral fringe” are vividly rendered and tightly woven with the thematic and emotional stakes. The environment is not backdrop: the liminal waterline physically embodies her psychological threshold, and the final image of her entering the dark bioluminescent water is charged and memorable. The scrimshaw as object-as-setting further anchors the world rules (post-pirate heirloom, post-violence decree) without expository drag. A slightly wider sense of the broader world beyond the harbor might deepen context, but what’s here is highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid, economical, and thematically charged: turbines replacing old windmills, the farmhouse as a pocket of subversion, speakers in every wall, and the dried bouquet on the table. Details are strongly POV-filtered (theatrical language, attention to performance spaces repurposed as “joy centers”). Environment actively constrains choices—the mandate broadcasts and tone-detecting speakers dictate her tactic of narrated compliance, and the turbines “harvest wind to power the mandate’s endless machinery,” directly charging the final image. The sense of place is memorable and inseparable from the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt atrium, humming quartz columns, and frozen lake are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through the poet’s sensibility, generating a consistent, immersive atmosphere. Setting details (cobalt light, refracted waves, hum echoing off the lake) are purposeful rather than touristic, mirroring her cloud-shadow focus. However, the environment mostly shapes perception rather than constraining choice or tactics; it charges the experience but doesn’t strongly limit or force decisions. This keeps the atmosphere rich but short of truly integral.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, furnace, discarded glass, oak tree, and smoke from the phoenix create a strong, textured environment. Details are filtered through Mira’s sensibility: she gravitates to cracked vessels and misblown glass, which ties setting directly to theme. The courtyard and its debris enable her plant-and-glass compositions and the final image of her “plant language” spreading is concretely grounded there. The post-phoenix world is more backdrop than active constraint, but within the courtyard the atmosphere is rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the repurposed concert-hall basement, bifurcated wings, and specialized equipment all feel lived-in and conceptually integrated with the premise. The miner’s lens functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image and reinforces the theme of inherited resonance. Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s professional lens, with sound, light, and memory tightly braided. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does consistently shape how she works and thinks.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory, starlight, and “curtains of intention” are vivid and specific, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels integral to the concept of suspended mourning. Details like marble corridors, crystalline consciousness, and coordinate-bearing origami are well-filtered through Elara’s sensibility and never feel like tourist cataloguing. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the observatory is “designed” for mourning, and the curtains physically and symbolically frame the final choice as they part. A slight limitation is that the setting rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; it primarily shapes mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft and the tactile details of cards and wooden floor are vivid and cohesive, with the rain’s branching paths smartly echoed in the spread and in Soren’s future choices. Setting is consistently filtered through Maren’s practice and inheritance, which prevents it from feeling like generic atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, it strongly conditions tone and the sense of sanctuary versus the “rain-soaked city below,” especially in the final image. The measuring tape functions almost as a micro-setting object, binding the abstract theme of measurement to a concrete, handled tool.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archive and bronze pagoda are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, with details like shifting symbols and prismatic facets doing double duty as atmosphere and metaphoric machinery. The environment isn’t mere backdrop: it’s the device by which nostalgia is trapped and released, and the pagoda’s light explicitly shapes the final transformation. Spatial and sensory anchors are clear despite the lyric mode. The piece might gain further if more of her tactics visibly depended on environmental constraints, but what’s here is already rich.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “blooming library above clouds” and memory-blossoms are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a keeper of hopes. World rules around the unbound, blossoms, and dream-archives stay coherent and are revealed through her work rather than dumped. The recurring river stone functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image with tactile absence, even if it doesn’t strongly constrain choices. Overall, the atmosphere is lush and purposeful without drifting into incoherent excess.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse—mist, benches, terrariums, glass roof, stars—creates a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the material. Details are filtered through Mara’s expertise and mood (terrariums as “patients,” the shrine of children’s notes), and the environment evolves (mist thickening then thinning) with her internal progression. The recurring image of the greenhouse under the stars and the mist lifting at the end meaningfully charges the final beat. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain her options, it deeply colors and elevates the story’s emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, basement, tunnel, and hidden chamber are vividly realized and filtered through Maya’s emotional state (cold stone, frost, coffee rings as time-markers). The hourglass and tower architecture both constrain action and possibility—there is one path downward and inward, and she must physically commit to it. The dawn light and meteor at the end charge the final image without feeling like pasted-on spectacle. Detail density is high but purposeful, never tipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Rialto Palace projection booth is vividly realized as a container of emotional residue; details like rotting seats and shattered glass align with the “unused love as dust” conceit and support tone. The setting meaningfully charges the premise—the idea that the theater “stores” the sisters’ unused love—and the final sense of the building continuing to hum gives the environment thematic weight. However, the space doesn’t significantly constrain tactical choices; Mira is never forced by the physical environment to adapt behavior, so the setting functions more as charged backdrop than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The aurora-lit archway, cold stone, northern wind, meteor, and astrolabe collectively create a vivid, coherent environment that mirrors and charges the inner arc without slipping into confusing symbolism. Setting elements are not postcard décor: the archway as liminal threshold, the aurora as “unspoken words of light,” and the meteor as a model for surrender all inflect her choices and final understanding. The recurring astrolabe functions as a micro-setting tool that concretely anchors the final image. It’s lush but purposeful, and the environment clearly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The world-building is vivid, specific, and thematically fused: bioluminescent moss replacing forests, glass plains from ancient oceans, fungal forests in building skeletons. These details are filtered through Mira’s matter-of-fact familiarity, which keeps the lyricism from feeling like a tourist catalog. The “glowing dune in bloom” and the moss’s light explicitly charge the final image and the theme of post-catastrophe illumination. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Cyrus’s perceptual and philosophical lens (e.g., “bronze ferns and copper canopies, humming with the frequency of probable miracles”). Environmental specifics (silicon bark, tin leaves, rusted springs) are not mere ornament; they culminate in the physical barrier and doorway that embody his mental frontier. The setting clearly mirrors and externalizes his consciousness and charges the final image, though it rarely constrains his choices beyond the single barrier moment. Line-by-line, the atmosphere is lush and distinctive without losing spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shoreline, twilight, and “veiled ridgeway” are vivid and purposeful, not decorative; the liminal setting mirrors and pressures the liminal choice. The ridge crest and void concretize the risk of letting the leash go, and the waves/wind reappear in the last line to charge the final image. Details are filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility, avoiding tourist cataloguing. Environment functions as both mood and metaphorical constraint without over-explication.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt fortress under deep snow, the narrow spiral staircase, and the high-contrast winter light are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marcus’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Micro-setting details like the spiral stairs, dust, and narrow windows are functional, not decorative, providing the literal path that reveals the bronze trail and the bolt. Weather and architecture meaningfully echo and pressure the interior state—the fortress in “winter sleep,” the permanent shadow, and the snow-muted world all mirror his frozen, regenerating self. The recurring interface of body and environment (cold, tingling hand, creaking stone) also charges the final image of falling snow as “the world’s most patient symphony.”

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient temple library is vivid, tactile, and thematically aligned with decay and endurance (“marble softening into organic curves,” “dust motes drifted like memories”). The setting is not postcard background; the library itself becomes “the instrument of justice,” structurally central to how truth will be revealed. Environmental details consistently mirror the theme of graceful collapse and slow revelation and anchor the final image. This is near-publishable-level atmosphere and integration.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sea level monitoring station, reef remains, currents, and the torn atlas page form a coherent, textured environment that both embodies and pressures the story’s liminal state. Details are selective and purposeful (the confluence of currents, the vanished bay, the station “anchored yet floating”), and filtered through Elara’s professional and personal lenses. The setting directly shapes the discovery—redirected currents beneath a drowned coastline—and charges the final image of her drifting at a moored station. This environmental integration is strong enough to constrain options and meaning without feeling over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned repair bay and embedded stone circle are vividly evoked—bare metal under bare feet, rusted scaffolding, cracked skylights—and consistently filtered through Kira’s sensibility. The environment actively participates: the hum through the grates, the warmth of the stones, and the view of constellations all shape her perceptions and invite the final choice. The stone circle and bay foundation explicitly charge the ending image (“ancient stones sang around her”), tying setting tightly to closure. A slightly broader sense of the surrounding colony context might deepen stakes, but for this length the micro-setting feels rich and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse under ash, the drifting kite, and the distant volcanic hot springs create a textured, coherent world tied to reconstruction. Setting is filtered through Yara’s sensibility (plants’ colors/temperatures, ash clouds breaking) and supports mood and theme. The underground chamber beneath the greenhouse meaningfully charges the physical space as a site of hidden ancestral work. The hot springs themselves are more atmospheric than functional, but overall environment feels purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse, cliff, sea, and salt-crusted greenhouse are vividly realized and consistently filtered through her sensibility. Setting is not wallpaper; it mirrors and deepens the internal stakes—especially the greenhouse as a “cathedral of glass” and the promontory’s exposure to weather as grief. The environment directly charges the final image: the cereus blooming inside this resurrected space on the cliff reweights everything we’ve seen. Detail selection is economical yet atmospheric, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse-library is vivid, strange, and tightly integrated with mood and action: breathing walls, spiral shelves, and impossible stairs all mirror and shape her psychological descent. Environmental details (walls contracting, shelves spiraling inward, threads of light and memory) are strongly filtered through her artistic gaze. The setting constrains and guides her choices—particularly the sense of the space learning her—and charges the final image of emerging with the whole box. The world’s rules are dreamlike but consistent within that logic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The wind-carved encampment, persistent breeze, returning post-eclipse light, and stone table with moving ink all create a vivid, texturally specific environment. Setting is well integrated into perception (“structures…worn smooth by centuries of relentless air”) and supports the eerie, contemplative tone. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, the encampment and its “consciously wild intelligence” do charge the final image of the silent ruins and hovering drone. The sensory balance and world-rule hints (ink between states, temporal anomalies) feel purposeful and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The snow-muted library, cryogenic vaults, and humming dormant networks create a strong, coherent atmosphere that supports the tone and theme of frozen truth. Details like silence “pressing” and snow falling outside are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. However, the setting mostly functions as mood and metaphor; it rarely constrains her options or tactics beyond framing her isolation. The final image of the “library under snow” does charge the ending but not quite at a tactical level.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The desert rose farm under the glass dome is vivid, specific, and thematically charged, with details like “sand that remembered water from another age” and the sound of distant gunfire giving the world texture. The dome and roses both constrain and define Mira’s life: they enable her refuge, attract refugees, and frame her refusal to rejoin the violent world. The environment strongly mirrors the inner conflict between continuity and chaos without becoming mere symbol. While the setting doesn’t force many tactical decisions, it clearly charges the final image of peace as ongoing tending.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, crystalline spires, and moving constellations are vividly rendered and consistently tied to action—silence slows waves, zigzags alter resonance, the constellations’ broken patterns mirror the cosmic rupture. The rail spike also functions effectively as a micro-setting object, physically mediating the transfer of emotion and divine echo. The environment is not just decorative; it dictates Morwen’s tactics and charges the final images of reordered stars and luminous spike. This is approaching top-tier work, just shy of utterly unforgettable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory setting is vivid and thematically charged: cedar and polish, brass telescope pointed at “nothing in particular,” clouds like whales, the copper dome’s echoing accusations all integrate atmosphere with Eleanor’s legacy and vantage. The micro-setting of the rosewood nib as a recurring object, and the literal height above the city at closure, reweight the final image very effectively. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain logistics, but it does shape mood, memory flow, and the conceptual framing of her choice. This is near top-tier scene design for this length, lacking only a bit of concrete constraint on what she can or cannot do in that space.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” and the space “between seconds” are richly specific, atmospheric, and filtered through Mira’s sensibility; details like machines translating infant cries into spectra feel both eerie and purposeful. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the lab’s rules (time folding, sound remnants, specialized devices) directly enable her access to the looping death scene and the possibility of intervention. The amber light, shelves of echoes, and the final chamber of heavily folded time all sustain a coherent, melancholic tone without drifting into generic surrealism. Setting and objects clearly charge the final image of her working on the “firmament of her broken timeline.”

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, mist, tiles, and pool are vivid, integrated, and always filtered through Elara’s sensibility, avoiding “tourist catalog” description. The environment meaningfully shapes options: the acoustics, fallen tile, and hush are not just backdrop but the mechanism of transformation. The recurring object of the tile and the grotto’s exhale charge the final image and closure. A minor expansion of how physical constraints (cold, damp, echo) shape her body or choices could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly drawn and tightly integrated: the “ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky,” skeletal buildings, fountain, and minaret are not mere backdrop but the literal residue Lysara reads and reworks. The tessera, ash, ghosts, and final shaft of light all participate in the closing image, charging the renaming with spatial and atmospheric weight. Details are selective and POV-colored, emphasizing wear in stones and echoes of prayer in ways that mesh with her retrocognition. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it does decisively charge the final moment, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emporium, hedge maze, and mystic orchard are vividly and specifically rendered, with sensuous details (silver-tinged apples, boxwood walls that shift when unobserved) and a coherent threshold atmosphere. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, enhancing mood rather than reading like a catalog. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics in a mechanical sense, it meaningfully charges the liminal nature of the encounter and the final image of the garden humming as morning stirs. The specificity supports tone and theme effectively at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The light painting studio and RGB LEDs create a distinct, atmospheric space, and the crystal functions as a micro-setting object that structures attention and choice. Details like the “soft purple glow” and “velvet-lined case” are selective and filtered through her scientific/artistic sensibility. The environment, however, mostly decorates rather than constrains action; nearly all pressure arises from the crystal and her interior history, not from the studio itself. The crystal’s physicality and evolving light-charge do bolster the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal cave network, bioluminescent algae, tidal pool, and inland elm fossil are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Maren’s abilities and choices. Environment directly shapes action (her moving by touch, entering the pool to reach the fossil) and charges the final image. World rules are consistent enough to support the “factually mystical” paradox without confusion. The setting feels singular rather than generic, and the fossil-object-as-setting clearly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber warehouse under the cliffs, with its honeyed glow and dust-silence, is vivid, particular, and tonally aligned with the story’s preoccupation with buried time and small artifacts. Details like the towering shelves and labeled jars feel integrated rather than decorative, and they do some thematic work in echoing patience and accumulation. Still, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; it frames her vocation rather than forcing tactics in any single scene. The world rules around buttons and echoes are suggestive but kept at a high level, limiting their leverage on specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bluff, mist, snow, and wind are vividly rendered and filtered through Elena’s spy-trained perception (snow as code, mist as cover, the precipice as chosen for tactical and symbolic reasons). Weather and terrain are not mere backdrop; they frame secrecy, danger, and liminality (“boundary between earth and sky blurred”). The recurring mist/silver/snow imagery meaningfully reweights the ending image as the mist brightens and spring approaches. That said, the environment does relatively little to constrain concrete choices beyond signaling and ambiance; it shapes tone and meaning more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fog-bound crossing, shallow stones, rain gutters, and barge are vivid and consistently filtered through the coachman’s sensibility. The setting functions as more than backdrop: the liminal river, the fog, and the ticking gutters all echo suspension, transition, and distillation. However, while the environment charges meaning, it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond a generalized “waiting until the gutters stop.” The piece excels atmospherically but stops just short of using setting as a hard tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting work is outstanding: the scorched wasteland, stubborn green oasis, beekeeping ruins, well, and kiln all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental specifics (the land that “refused to burn,” flattening smoke, stone walls, the well) are not mere backdrop but central to the story’s logic of resistance and memory. Crucially, the oasis and its objects charge the final image—Mira taking the lantern glass back to her kiln—and reframe “setting” as a repository of accumulated kindness that constrains what she must do next. This environment could not be swapped for a generic ruin without breaking the story’s thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    The harbor, moonlight, fire escape, and rosebush are vivid and sensorial, with selective details like the “rhythm of oars” and the petal as “红色叹息” giving the space texture and mood. The setting is clearly anchored and consistently filtered through Maren’s attention as a gardener and daughter, so it feels lived-in rather than postcard-like. Environment supports theme via contrast—luminous harbor and silvered tool against bare branches and emotional darkness—though it rarely constrains concrete choices. The lock gauge as a recurring object effectively operates as micro-setting, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal library above the clouds is rendered with striking specificity (ghostly volumes, ink like marine life, foundations anchored to humming stones), and these environmental elements are not mere backdrop but integral to how Elara reads and acts. The tides, sundial, and stone circle all shape her experience and the final image of wading toward the eastern stacks as the hum rises. World rules feel consistent and are learned through observation and history rather than dumpy exposition. The setting directly charges the final image and theme, meeting high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is lush, specific, and integrated with mood: the lotus temple, dripping world, bruised-gold petals, and lily pads full of rain give the piece a tactile, lived-in atmosphere. Environmental details are filtered through Mira’s contemplative lens and mirror her inner state without feeling like blunt symbolism. The nest and pond scene reappear conceptually at the end, charging the final image of her carrying the nest as a blueprint for her installation. The environment doesn’t tangibly constrain her choices, which keeps this just below the very top tier, but as atmosphere and thematic support it is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The university radio station and its “ancient equipment” offer a solid, tactile frame, and the protests outside add atmospheric pressure. Technical elements like the transmission array and antenna integrate with Maya’s actions rather than sitting as window dressing. However, the setting is mostly conveyed through summary and generalities; sensory detail beyond sound and a few visual cues is sparse. The environment does constrain tactics (she must use this station and its charts), but it could do more texturally and spatially to shape the moment-to-moment experience.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subterranean setting is vivid and tonally aligned: cold stone, narrowing tunnels, the “Unyielding Cross,” and “origami made of shadow and silence” all create a strong, specific atmosphere. The nexus chamber’s impossible geometry and the crystallized silence around the key feel fresh and integrated with the core concept. Environment does constrain her—a claustrophobic character in tightening tunnels, with a mutinous space she cannot map—but much of this remains atmospheric rather than actively complicating tactics. Still, the setting meaningfully charges both the fear and the final revaluation of the tunnels.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quarry in mist is vivid and integral: fog, stone faces, and the hollowed crater all mirror the erasure and erosion of evidence and memory. Details like workers sifting gravel and “time had swallowed the fog” embed the place in the central question of what remains after disappearance. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain Elena’s choices tactically, it clearly charges the emotional and thematic field, especially in the final return to “shadowed silence.” The specificity and consistency of the setting’s mood justify a strong score even without a heavier mechanical role in the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The weather station, basement archives, and coastal cliffs are economically but vividly drawn, and the howling, shifted jet stream charging the final image works well. Professional and environmental details (experimental station, restricted archives, waterlogged journals) feel lived-in and plausibly constrain who has access to truth. The copper nail functions as a micro-setting object that grounds both history and present action. A slightly richer sense of physical space in the present-tense scenes would move this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is rich, tactile, and inseparable from the story’s function: bridges, tunnels, scaffold netting, and the mountain pullout are all liminal spaces that mirror and enable the supernatural encounter. The glass flake and billboard are micro-settings that directly generate the central turn and charge the final image. Details like “safety orange mesh that snapped in wind like the wings of enormous, anxious birds” entwine atmosphere with theme rather than feeling ornamental. Environment doesn’t impose physical constraints so much as metaphysical ones, but it decisively charges choices and images.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus train is richly evoked and strongly filtered through Marcus’s worldview of territories and markers, giving the piece a distinct, atmospheric locus. Details like “rusted circus cars,” “iron skin of the train,” and the sense of a self-contained “ecosystem” do thematic and emotional work rather than serving as postcard description. The setting subtly shapes the argument and the stakes by embodying an itinerant-yet-enduring way of belonging, which charges the final image of them walking away. It rarely constrains physical choice, but it decisively charges the conceptual terrain of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory, ridge, copper dome, and pulsing Cepheids all ground the piece in a concrete, atmospheric place that matches the tone and Elara’s professional gaze. The daylily and its golden residue provide a tactile, recurring object that’s meaningfully reinterpreted as a symbol of fleeting insight and preservation. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain specific choices, it does charge the final image of the stars pulsing outside the dome and root the theme of vigilance and watchfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard vortex, petrified trees, cursed lake, and ice dome are vivid, specific, and integrated into action, not just backdrop; the vortex’s response to his movements and its eventual stilling directly track the magical stakes. Environmental details mirror and externalize his inner state without feeling purely symbolic—the “frozen confession” literally and figuratively structures the scene. The setting constrains tactics (ritual at the vortex heart, seed in the mud at the shore) and charges the final image of the pool reflecting his face. A bit more sensory breadth beyond visual/aural would elevate atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt glade, violet earth, ancient oaks, and maze beyond are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through her rooted embodiment. Setting isn’t decorative: her physical rootedness constrains choice, the glade “responds,” and the clipping planted in that specific soil charges the final image. World rules (visionary grafting, covenant with land) feel internally consistent for a mythic mode. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual description over tactile interaction under peak pressure keeps this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a major strength: the “catacomb orchard” with roots threading bones and impossible apple trees in darkness is both striking and coherent with the death/life barter premise. Details are filtered through Elara’s agenda—she reads the roots’ intimacy with the dead as “communion,” which reinforces theme and character simultaneously. The environment constrains options (this is the only place the bargain can happen) and charges the final image of her sister becoming part of the roots and branches. World rules (no sun, silver-white roots, golden apples) are fantastical but self-consistent and never confuse spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quarry office trailer, crooked credential, and howling wind establish a tactile, lonely micro-world that mirrors his emotional state without feeling schematic. Occupational detail (quarry, estate sales, auction estimates) is selective and filtered through his appraiser’s eye and ex-roadie ear. The recurring objects—the serpentine chest, the grille cloth, and the imagined amplifier—function as setting anchors and charge the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does shape tone and perception in a sustained way.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is vivid and memorable, with concrete sensory and visual details (silver and amber spine, cloud deck, bruised sky) that are strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The liminal setting—“where earth meets sky”—is tightly fused to the theme of transition and charges the final image of a dawn without a sun. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices, it does function as a symbolic and atmospheric pressure that shapes how the knowledge is framed and received. World rules around the arbor and arbors globally are consistent and intriguing without becoming infodumps.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal atrium is richly imagined, with seawater channels, wintersun, and brass candelabras all integrated into how the library functions. The tides and lunar cycles inform the arrival of identities and the smelting schedule, so environment meaningfully shapes the conceptual “action.” Sensory detail is selective but lush, and the setting’s calm, tidal rhythm underwrites the tone and theme. The final image of wintersun over a breathing, tidal library is charged by this groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly drawn and deeply integrated: the rusting bunker and the crystal “cathedral” are not postcards but embodiments of the wall/connection dichotomy. The crystals, pool, and orchard above all feel specific and charged, culminating in the cave as a “threshold” that directly frames the final reconfiguration. Environmental details are filtered through Margret’s trained eye yet open into the numinous as her understanding widens. The cave’s physicality and atmosphere clearly charge the final image of her emerging with the pearl.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station and its ivy, rusted tracks, and graffiti-soaked bathroom are vividly realized and consistently filtered through her sensibility as a river chronicler. Environment and object-as-setting (the accordion, the graffiti itself) deeply charge the final image and metaphorize her mental state without feeling purely ornamental. The abandoned infrastructure’s persistence (ivy not yet cracking walls, tracks still suggesting a path) subtly constrains and reflects her options and endurance. Setting is so integrated with theme and closure that removing this exact place would materially diminish the story’s logic and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: mist as “spilled memories,” glowing title-less books, and the time-folding rules all grow organically from the core concept. The library’s physical and metaphysical properties (unspoken words, folding time, door only visible in the watch) directly constrain options and enable the final act. Details are filtered through her particular obsession and history, avoiding generic fantasy-library tropes. The final image of the inner sanctum and the charged weight of unsaid confessions gives the environment real thematic and narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer light, garden wisteria, and cold crystal violin are vividly rendered and always filtered through Elena’s sensibility. Setting elements recur purposefully—the solstice light, the observatory, the wisteria—to charge the idea of perforated destiny and the final image of light entering where certainty once blocked the way. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain her tactics beyond mood and symbolism, but it clearly shapes tone and the closure image. Overall specificity and atmosphere are strong and economical rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered and tightly braided with the soul-capture concept: the aurora’s “static” and colors echo the spark, and the environment feels more like an instrument than a backdrop. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the final descent from the grotto recharges the earlier imagery. The caveat is that the setting mostly charges tone and symbolism rather than constraining physical options or tactics. Still, for a lyric piece, atmosphere and object-as-setting work at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: the umbral grotto between earth and heaven, cloud-mist watering stone-grown plants, and the ash tree piercing the aperture all feel original and charged. Environmental features are not just decorative; the height, clouds, and liminal space concretely mirror Elara’s spiritual in-betweenness and enable her method of climbing to seek clarity. The scallop-shaped cloud formation and the hairpin pull the environment directly into the story’s symbolic machinery and final image. What holds this just shy of 9+ is that the environment, while beautifully rendered, rarely constrains on-page choice under pressure beyond providing the vantage for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse cliff, wind, and dawn are vividly and economically rendered, and the setting is strongly tied to function via the wind chimes and the idea of a beacon for moral uncertainty. Environmental details are meaningfully integrated—chimes, campfire remnants, and the stone railing all shape how she works rather than feeling postcard-like. The final image of the lighthouse as a place where “certainty came to be questioned” recharges the physical setting thematically. The landscape doesn’t significantly constrain a choice in-scene, but it does robustly charge the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: floating rock, starlit pond, sycamores, and mountain wind all work together to create a coherent, contemplative space. The pond and its ripples are not just backdrop but the functional mechanism of revelation and the charged final image. Worldbuilding touches like the “magnetic grotto beneath the stars” deepen atmosphere without bogging pace. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, but it strongly shapes tone and thematic action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tonally unified: “tower of bone,” “canyon of endless echoes,” dust, fossils, and birds all interlock into a distinctive environment. Details are well filtered through her long familiarity and vocation, avoiding tourist cataloging. The space does some conceptual work—her body becoming like the bone towers, the canyon pulse aligning with her own—but it rarely constrains discrete choices beyond justifying her immobility. As a result, the world feels rich and memorable but not yet fully weaponized against her in a way that would push this into the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire, crystalline walls, northern light, and the impossible garden are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The recurring motifs of frost, light, and stone are thematically aligned and culminate in the keystone’s final placement. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, but it does meaningfully charge the contrast between standardized, automated magic and the liminal, old-magic garden. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, pier lamps, and especially the sunken-library hold of the Cerulean Promise are vivid, specific, and atmospheric, with details like shelves “marked with the names of forgotten captains” doing a lot of quiet worldbuilding. Setting is not postcard: low tide and the ship’s hollow belly literally enable his access and the lantern light’s travel through the broken ceiling charges the climax. The recurring interplay of light, water, and books is thematically integrated rather than decorative. The final image of colored hum and threads in the water depends deeply on this environment as established.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber observatory deck, contracted sky, and tactile coins create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that feels particular rather than generic. Setting details (ambered light, weathered table, dense static) are filtered through Kira’s cosmological preoccupations and support the contemplative tone. The micro-setting of the deck and table doesn’t strongly constrain action, but the environment and recurring objects do charge the final image. World rules around the contraction and static are consistent and elegantly embedded rather than dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, cliff, broken telescope, and scattered light are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Melencolia’s sensibility, reinforcing liminality and memory. Objects-as-setting (the atlas, the box, the cracks in the dome) recur and charge the final image as she gathers her tools and walks into the dusk. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does function as a symbolic workspace where mapping and crossing are plausible and earned. Description is lush yet mostly purposeful and avoids generic, tourist-level cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sapphire viaduct, glowing stone, and dew-fed channels create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting directly supplies the method (dripping water) and charges the final repaired bell with “the bridge’s ancient light,” so environment and object interlock at closure. Details are economical yet atmospheric, with the sea and estuary consistently inflecting mood and stakes. This is a notable strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The reservoir basin, ridgeway, exposed town, and specific landmarks (Blue Heron Tavern, cracked spine of asphalt, whitewashed foundation) are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional and personal lens. The environment is not just decorative: the drought and dropping surface literally enable the story and reconfigure what’s possible. The recurring object-as-setting of the sapphire label charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting gate. A slight tendency toward picturesque phrasing over direct constraint on tactics is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility: the hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and crystalline waters all echo the theme of liminality and transformation. Environmental elements (waterfall light, orchard, crystal) are not just postcard visuals; they charge the final image and embody the alchemical stakes. The world’s rules feel coherent in a mythic-fantastical way and are learned through action (raising the crystal, flame at fingertips) rather than exposition. The only constraint on a higher score is that the environment influences mood and symbolism more than tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    The noctilucent arbor above the clouds is vivid, specific, and suffuses the piece with atmosphere; weather, altitude, and the open-night observatory feel tactile and lived-in. Setting is filtered through his professional gaze (patterns, fronts, passes) in a way that reinforces character and theme. The environment constrains options only modestly (he can watch but not intervene physically), but that limitation underpins the “watcher’s burden” frame. Overall, the world feels coherent and purposeful without sliding into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock dojo, perpetual autumn twilight, and upward-falling leaves create a striking, coherent atmosphere that matches the metaphysical stakes. Setting details (etched names, the maple, the ceremonial blade) are specific and filtered through the narrator’s history, avoiding generic fantasy feel. While the dojo does not heavily constrain tactical options, it meaningfully charges the ritual act and the final image of a “new era” on the rock. World rules like history rewriting and altered gravity stay consistent within the piece’s surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: storm-born silence, the brook, terracotta pot, and the escape room architecture all feel specific and sensorially grounded. Details like “rooms within rooms that unfolded like origami nightmares” and the moonlight on the brook are filtered through Mira’s mind in a character-appropriate way. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but the brook and storm-silence do charge the mood and final sense of latent potential. Overall, the atmosphere is immersive and tonally aligned with the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The echo chamber tunnel, the house, and the leaf blower are vividly and consistently realized, with sound as the primary atmospheric driver. The tunnel’s acoustics and resonance feel integral, transforming the blower into an “orchestra” and directly informing the story’s emotional mechanics. Details like dust shaken from beams and vibrations through floorboards effectively fuse physical space with interior stakes. The setting is rich and purposeful, though it stops just short of constraining a concrete choice in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The frozen garden in mist is vivid and specific, with the mist’s behavior and the ice-covered bench doing strong atmospheric work. The environment meaningfully frames the story as threshold vs. prison, and this reframing charges the ending. While the garden doesn’t physically constrain tactics in a concrete way, it functions as a conceptual and emotional setting that shapes her options. Details feel integrated through her perception rather than touristic listing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus, frozen-bloom weather, and mountain twilight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s priorities, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The setting is not postcard-detail; the nexus and embers directly constrain the method and outcome of her magic, and the frozen bloom image reappearing and then “shattering” at the end charges the final image. Environmental consistency (cold air, frost, embers, encroaching night) is well-maintained and meaningfully interwoven with the thematic concern of suspended moments before transformation. This is high-level work, just shy of 9+ only because the environment shapes mood and ritual more than it forces tactical constraint at every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned radio tower city over the Gorge of Echoes, the rusted ladders, and the swaying highest platform create a vivid, distinctive environment that’s tightly filtered through Mara’s professional gaze. Details like the improvised equipment and scavenged fragment feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the setting’s decay echoes the “endings” motif without being hammered. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her tactical choices beyond isolation and height, the Moon’s looming presence and the tower’s status as a memorial to past listening attempts help charge the central event and final descent. The result is atmospherically rich and specific, just shy of using physical constraints to drive action.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imaginative and consistently filtered through Maren’s professional eye: “spectral grotto,” stars hanging sideways, hull flickering between oak and ghostlight, parallel ferries visible at a distance. World rules (fractured routes, sideways time, parallel frequencies) are introduced through her work rather than exposition dumps, and the environment’s strangeness supports theme rather than feeling like a catalog. The hourglass and the grotto both return at the end, charging the final image as the world becomes “slightly more solid” and the grotto fades into ordinary sky. The one limitation is that the environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; it’s more atmospheric than problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly realized—warping walls, lagging and anticipatory mirrors, prismatic glass—and always filtered through the architect’s professional gaze. Setting and objects (gallery, mirrors, sinew thread) are tightly braided with theme and climax, especially as the space “expands and contracts like a living chest” during the hum. The environment shapes perception more than literal options, but it does charge the final image of her sitting among threads awaiting morning. Because the gallery doesn’t quite constrain a concrete choice, it stays just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The benthic city, bioluminescent descent, and research tower are vividly evoked and tightly filtered through a professional mariner’s eye. The underwater setting meaningfully shapes the central question—starlight through dense water—and makes the cosmos-as-sea metaphor feel organic rather than imposed. The recurring anchor link works as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it consistently informs perception, stakes, and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-clad atrium and mercury glass are vivid and tonally apt, and the observation room with its sensor pad and humming equipment feels tactile and specific without overexposition. Environmental details are strongly filtered through Elena’s work—threads, frequencies, pulses—giving the world a cohesive texture. The atrium and mist return at the end to charge the final image, turning the setting into a metaphorical threshold she chooses to enter. Still, the environment mostly serves atmosphere rather than exerting concrete pressure on choices, so it falls just shy of being fully indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater facility and rusted, bone-like cables are vivid and tonally apt, with details like “green-dark water” and bioluminescent pulses doing real atmospheric work. The setting is filtered through Maren’s fear and awe, and the final image of the ocean as a library reweights the entire environment. Physical constraints (flooded corridors, sealed entrance) are present but underused tactically; the space rarely forces concrete navigational choices. Even so, the environment feels specific, immersive, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The opal observatory, frosted window, snow-blanketed valley, and copper dome create a vivid, distinctive environment that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting meaningfully charges the story: the isolated valley’s unique constellation, the silence of deep snow, and the buried radio towers all reinforce themes of erasure, listening, and post-collapse quiet. The final image of snow covering towers as “soft white equations” powerfully connects environment to the conceptual cost of failed systems.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and purposeful: towers of bone, canyon-as-throat, dust of “forgotten pronunciations,” and humming rib-like structures all reinforce the theme of language as physical residue. The tunnel of echoes and bone towers are not mere backdrop; they actively alter sound, enabling the multiplication/distortion that underpins the new language’s birth. World rules around echo-behavior stay consistent and are learned through action and perception rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground garden is vividly and economically rendered—bioluminescent moss, herbs, inverted water, floating soil—creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. World rules (gravitational playfulness, physics-defiance) are introduced early and then escalate to affect action (Mira rising, environment responding to Amari’s voice). The setting strongly mirrors theme (untamed harmony, refusal to obey categories) without feeling like pure allegory. The environment doesn’t quite *constrain* a concrete choice at the end, but it does meaningfully charge the final image of stepping into that space.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is vivid and specific: sky-bridges above a grinding mechanical city, a golden-fruited orchard that “smelled of honey and forgotten storms,” and stone guardians that physically gate Elara’s progress. Details are tightly POV-filtered and recur with purpose—especially the locust shell, trees, and statues—charging the final image of the shell joining the roots. The environment actively shapes the story’s options: Elara must pass through the statues’ scrutiny and the orchard’s center to achieve her goal. This is immersive, purposeful atmosphere that supports theme and action without devolving into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt arcade, tinted glass at dusk, and bent border fence create a vivid, specific liminal space that matches the story’s emotional and political liminality. Setting is well-integrated: the arcade as “neutral ground” and the overlapping patrol blind spot meaningfully explain how this scene can occur. The storm in a bottle and the fence seen through the glass deepen atmosphere and thematics rather than feeling decorative. While environmental constraints could press more urgently on Marcus’s choices, what’s here is textured and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus train, pine clearing, sleeper car, and moss-ringed oasis are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (sawdust, aged velvet, silver-grey light, bubbling spring). Setting is filtered through his craft-minded gaze and quiet temperament, and the halo fragment’s glow effectively charges the central space. The environment shapes discovery (the scattered cars, odd acoustics, and hidden door) but doesn’t meaningfully constrain later choices or tactics, which keeps this just below the highest band for an elite venue. Still, atmosphere and spatial clarity are very strong and integral to the story’s spell.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Midnight Library’s hyperbolic architecture, “observed solitude,” and the inward-curving circular room are vivid, distinctive, and tightly fused to the story’s concept. Environment is not mere backdrop: the building’s impossible geometry is explicitly the mechanism by which forgotten narratives accumulate and are reawakened. The final image—glowing scarf casting geometric patterns in the circular room—is charged by this setting. This is close to exemplary use of place, though we never see the geometry materially constrain a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering archipelago and tidally threatened library are vividly particular and filter naturally through Mira’s perceptions (wind as voices, marginalia as failed translations of the sea’s speech). Setting is not postcard: the small island, the ferry schedule, and the pre-dawn light all constrain what is possible and make the sunrise-dependent magic plausible. The final image of the photograph hung where the morning light finds it directly charges the ending with environmental meaning. It’s rich and functional, though one more tactile interaction with the physical space under pressure would push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The garden, fountain, and “shadowed nexus under starlight” are vividly rendered and tonally integrated, with details like “fallen leaves and small bones” giving the place a history and weight. Setting is consistently filtered through the locksmith’s sensibility (abandoned places as secret-heavy rather than cursed), which sharpens atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mainly provides mood and thematic echo rather than active pressure. The recurring fountain/garden imagery does help charge the final discovery, keeping this comfortably in a strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are vividly realized and deeply integrated with the story’s metaphors of memory and preservation—the leviathan dome, gutted hull, and masts as splintered fingers create a distinctive atmosphere. The environment meaningfully constrains action (he must dive; the ring is underwater; the marsh and glass filter starlight) and charges the final image of memory as submerged starlight. World rules around the greenhouse, storms, and scattered constellation feel internally consistent and learned through his practiced attention rather than pure exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The forgotten library and its dust, oak table, and playground swing outside create a strong, cohesive atmosphere filtered through Maren’s sensibility. The afternoon light, dust motes, and “shadow caught in glass” recur and evolve, charging the final image when Maren plans to show the children how shadows can be “returned to their sources.” The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it tightly shapes tone and theme as a liminal refuge where exile is reinterpreted. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific—waterfall mist, stone parapet, liminal orchard—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a long-time caretaker. Environmental elements are not mere backdrop: the cascade’s voice “guides her hands,” its water mixes into the soil, and the parapet’s history reinforces the theme of guardianship between worlds. World rules (liminal branches, ash from dragon-dream fires) feel internally consistent at this short length. The environment charges the final image, though it stops short of truly constraining tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary, crystal shards, and starlight are vivid and specific, with details consistently filtered through Mira’s restorative eye. The environment is not mere backdrop: prisms, silence, and the needle/net form a micro-setting system that directly charges the final image of the spirit turning “in the prism light.” The sanctuary’s accumulated silence and history explain why this work happens here and why breaking that hush costs something. It stops just shy of a 9-band only because the physical constraints of the space don’t significantly alter tactics beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The henge, altar stone, and fresco vault are atmospherically specific (“rain-scoured,” “faces and patterns running like tears”) and integrated with Elena’s cartographic way of seeing. Setting is not mere backdrop: the disguised passage in the henge’s geometry and water’s erosion both matter to what she can discover. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices beyond a general sense of fragility and reverence, but it does charge the final image and thematic frame. Overall, it’s a vivid, purposeful space.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The wrecked library on the ocean floor is vivid and particular (bookshelves, drifting texts, “pages fluttering in slow motion”), and the deep-sea environment is filtered through Miriam’s professional, numbed familiarity. The snow globe functions as a charged micro-setting object that anchors the final image and the thematic turn. While the physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain her tactics, it strongly shapes mood and meaning, especially in the contrast between a floating library and a tiny preserved “world” in the globe. The detail level is economical yet evocative, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, the tower heart with servers, and the weather channel “between lightning and thunder” are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the story’s liminal, communicative premise. Environmental specifics—phosphorescent salts, crushed cloudberries, wet stone, embeddable servers—feel particular and are filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The setting genuinely constrains tactics: she can only communicate clearly in that charged interval, in this high place where “earth dissolved into ether,” and that constraint feeds directly into the climax. The recurring object-as-setting of the flower press bolt plate further charges the final image by fusing mechanical and spectral elements.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly and economically rendered: brass elevator, frosted glass, Meridian Spire, and “frozen splendor” above the clouds all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental details (fractured light, ice-etched windows, vertical ascent) are tightly integrated with theme and action, especially as increasing light unlocks the cipher and the final image of her stepping into the clouds. The worldbuilding is suggestive without exposition bloat, and the spire/airship context feels coherent. The environment shapes mood and symbolism more than it directly constrains tactics, which keeps it just under the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the sky gondola, thin cable, mountain pass, and layered cloud types are rendered with strong sensory and professional specificity. The environment is not just a backdrop; its suspension between peaks and between earth and stars underwrites the thematic liminality and the final charged image. Tools and objects (the brass telescope, the cable/string, the balloon’s fall point) are spatially coherent and recur in evolved ways. Weather and altitude shape both her psychological state and her observational method, even if they do not create hard physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The oak-library setting is richly specific—spiral staircases, shelves like growth rings, the “tree’s slow breathing”—and consistently filtered through Mira’s tactile, pattern-driven attention. It does more than postcard duty, tying growth rings and hollowed trunk to the story’s concerns with layered knowledge and interior space. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it is more resonant backdrop than active pressure. Still, it strongly supports mood and theme and charges the demolition at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the antique airship, the murmuration, the rigging catching luminance, and the dusty cargo hold all interact directly with Mira’s actions and discoveries. Details are filtered through her cartographic and linguistic sensibility, which sharpens specificity and avoids “tour guide” description. The airship’s confined-yet-social environment reinforces theme and constrains options, making it more than a backdrop. It stops just short of using environment to force a hard choice, which keeps it below the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen library above the clouds and the mist-carved hall of mirrors create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong visual motifs (ice, driftwood, lunar light). Details are consistently filtered through Thessa’s sensibility as a repairer and light-opener, which keeps the world from feeling like a neutral backdrop. While the setting seldom constrains concrete tactics, it meaningfully charges the premise and final image. The piece emphasizes mood and image over environmental friction, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the standout: floating rock arches, silver-leafed trees, the neglected butterfly garden, and the bell tower all feel specific and visually striking. Environmental elements meaningfully touch the ending—the arches “lean closer,” the bell alters the clouds, the planetary sky (“nebula of respite”) brightens. Details are well-integrated into action and theme rather than reading like a tour. The only limitation is that we rarely see the environment constrain choice under pressure; it mostly beautifies and blesses rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hidden lighthouse, the great clock, and the pane of hush are richly specific and saturated with mood; details like “crimson and violet mixing with the deepening blue of evening like a bruise” are vivid and purposeful. The environment feels lived-in and character-filtered, reflecting Elara’s long familiarity and reverence. Setting does charge the final image (lighthouse as sentinel, last light fading, stars emerging), though it constrains choice only lightly. World rules remain consistent and are absorbed smoothly into the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the cliffside orchard “like a wound,” the spiraled white-stone labyrinth, and the brass birds are not just pretty but functional to stakes and tactics. Environmental constraints—curse rules, bird patrols, stone textures, approaching frost—directly shape what Mira can do and why only she can do it. Details are tightly filtered through her role as caretaker and reader of the blueprint (stones by texture, temperature, age), avoiding tourist-catalog description. The final mechanism opening beneath the circling birds charges the closing image with place-specific power.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The braided ravine, confluence of creeks, and foam patterns are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Miriam’s scientific and emotional attention. Setting is not mere backdrop; it actively structures the final conceptual image that “the braided ravine holds all its streams,” recharging both grief and legacy. The chrysalis functions as a micro-setting/object that focuses her tactile engagement and anchors the thematic transformation. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the environment shapes meaning more than it constrains concrete options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “glass orchard library” above a sea of clouds, with crystalline branches, bottled moonlight, and dissolving manuscripts, is vivid, specific, and thematically charged. Setting is consistently filtered through her professional obsession with blankness and absence, so worldbuilding never feels like a postcard tour. Environmental elements (bottles, moonlight, dissolving texts) are inseparable from the story’s metaphors and charge the final understanding of “quantified absence.” This integration of place and premise is near–publication ready.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coral-ice pavilion beneath the desert is vivid and specific, with details like “liquid moonlight” pools and grief-shaped basins that feel organically tied to both worldbuilding and theme. Setting is consistently filtered through Miriam’s professional eye (tidal pools, formations) which deepens both place and character. The environment meaningfully constrains action—this is a hidden, singular repository that only someone with Miriam’s rare skill can address, and emerging “beneath the dunes” into sunrise charges the final image. The outer “desert fortress after rain” is more atmospheric than functional, but the core micro-setting is rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: grain elevators as barriers, the silent astronomical clock tower, and the library’s back rooms all feel specific and lived-in. The clock’s weight and cuckoo function as charged objects that shape action and meaning, especially in the closing image. Environmental details (dust-moted stairs, lanternlit planets, preserved choir directory) are filtered through Elara’s sensibility and reinforce the themes of memory and repair. While the physical environment doesn’t harshly constrain choices, it consistently frames and inflects them.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The canyon and moonlight are vividly rendered (“canyon walls rose around her like the sides of an enormous fault,” “fine red sand,” “intervals of silver and shadow”), and the setting’s tone of vast, patient geology pairs well with the theme of layered, entangled dreams. The mirror as an object is strongly integrated into the landscape, culminating in the final image of abandoned dreams like “ghosts in the morning light.” That said, the environment is mainly atmospheric; it rarely constrains her options or tactics beyond providing an evocative stage. The result is rich mood rather than fully instrumental setting.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine grotto, inverted gravity, mist, and upward-falling moisture are vivid and integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. Crucially, the environment and its altered physics determine when the markings are visible and how she moves, so setting genuinely constrains choice and possibility. Details like the black-cased lantern and silver ribbons of moisture feel selective and purposeful, sustaining atmosphere without clutter. This is near top-tier environmental work, with only a slight sense that the grotto never fights back or complicates tactics beyond visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The siskin alder grove is richly realized and deeply integrated with Elara’s perspective—branch patterns as chords, roots as bass lines, the natural amphitheater of three alders. The porcelain insulator as a relic of telegraph lines folds industrial history into the forest in a way that feels organic, not expository. Environmental details participate in the climax (the grove’s lean, the leaves catching vibrations, the siskin’s call), so setting actively charges the final image. This is high-level atmosphere and specificity, just shy of utterly defining her tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic nexus, twilight, eclipse, and stones are vivid and sensorial enough to ground the lyricism, and the setting clearly mirrors his interior state without feeling like a generic backdrop. The worry stone and the nexus function as micro-setting objects, returning at the end to charge the final image. Environment does not strongly constrain his choices—he could perform the same ritual almost anywhere—but it meaningfully shapes tone and thematic resonance. Overall the specificity is strong, if more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “shadowed workshop under stars,” frosted glass, and valley poised for fireworks are vivid, economical, and tightly integrated with mood. The diary clasp and the resonator function as micro-setting elements that both constrain action and charge the final image. Environmental details (children with fuses, elders covering ears) subtly widen the world and mirror Mira’s concerns without feeling like postcard description. The only thing holding it from an even higher band is that the workshop and valley rarely force tactical shifts beyond providing a charged backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The treetop village, hanging gardens, scent-memory, and corpse flower greenhouse are vividly realized with strong olfactory and tactile detail, all filtered through an herbalist’s nose. Environment and objects (seed, pollen, paper, doodles) are tightly bound to Kalia’s perception and to the thematic frame of wisdom under rot and intention in ordinary materials. The village’s mystery and the undercurrent of wisdom in the air contribute to tone and theme more than to concrete constraints on action. Setting feels specific and memorable but stops just short of fully determining her tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, and inverted waterways are vividly and economically realized, with strong, distinctive images (“crystalline question marks,” “ribs of some ancient beast”). Setting is not mere backdrop: inversion, arches, and water flows directly affect navigation and discovery. The artifact’s interaction with the ironwood tree dramatizes world rules through physical change rather than exposition. This environment also charges the final descent image, though the ending leans slightly more on idea than on a single, unforgettable physical tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The port’s container labyrinth, fog, and wind tunnels are vividly and consistently rendered, with details filtered through Mira’s technical eye (“air left fingerprints”). Environment is not mere backdrop: the container architecture and wind vortex directly underwrite both the prior disaster and her current investigation. Weather and metal groans shape atmosphere and plausibly constrain movement and perception. The final image of “what the wind had written in the spaces between buildings” elegantly charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ice cathedral, fossilized snow, and aurora are vivid, multi-sensory, and consistently filtered through Yara’s synesthetic perception in ways that shape action (the ice singing, the aurora guiding her). The environment is not just backdrop; the ice’s long “waiting” and the cavern’s acoustics are integral to the ritual and to the final image of a singing hush. Weather and cold meaningfully inflect the experience (tears freezing, breath warmth against amber). Setting and atmosphere are among the story’s most distinctive strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Thunder-echo range, dried riverbeds, driftwood, and Listener’s Crossing are vividly rendered, with details filtered through Kira’s archivist/keeper sensibility. The environment meaningfully shapes her tactics: she chooses this geography precisely because its thunder and reverberation enforce silence, and the canyon hush becomes both constraint and companion. The gilded flute as object-setting is strongly integrated, charging the final image with lineage and withheld song. Setting never feels like a backdrop catalogue; it continually mirrors and pressures the internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The topaz workshop, amber light, and halo fragment are richly and economically rendered, with a strong POV filter—“the patience of used light,” “a condition of perception.” The environment is not just decorative: the roofless workshop, vanishing stars, and the fragment’s glow all shape how Maren perceives what’s happening and charge the final image. World rules (stars vanishing, a universe that “does not require stars to make light visible”) remain internally consistent. The setting could constrain specific tactical choices more sharply, but for a lyric piece it’s unusually integrated and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridgeway, frost-dusted pines, valley lights, and aurora are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, generating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The aurora is not mere backdrop; it becomes the portal through which Mira steps and charges the final mythic register. The pendant as a recurring object also functions as a micro-setting, anchoring the magic and the closure image. The environment rarely constrains concrete choices, but it decisively shapes tone and the story’s metaphoric field.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically fused: the quartz arbor, mist, moss, abandoned car, and frost are not postcard background but the medium of the story’s magic and memory. Environmental details (quartz as emotional library, frost as script) directly carry the premise and charge the final understanding of place as architecture that absorbs people. The sensory palette leans visual but feels intentional and sufficient for this contemplative mode. The arbor and car window meaningfully constrain what Mira can do and know, satisfying the object-as-setting gate at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard in a bamboo forest, the empty loom, and the bead all function as charged setting elements that shape tone and closure rather than mere backdrop. The final image—forgotten orchard, empty humming loom, bead gone—reconfigures the opening space with palpable loss and fulfillment. Details are selective but vivid, and the world’s gentle magical logic (threads that remember words, raveling silence) stays internally consistent. The setting feels integral to the story’s mood and meaning, not interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular: orchard world, floating rock arches, blighted canopies, and downward-growing trees create a memorable, coherent environment. Details are filtered through Cael’s priorities—forge, tunnels, roots, supports—rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The arches in particular elegantly charge the final image as indifferent “azure defiance,” but the environment constrains tactics a bit more in summary than in live, scene-level problem-solving, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned repair bay is vivid and particular (the crane, the empty cradle, the humming silence) and nicely mirrors the liminal, haunted emotional landscape. Details are filtered through her sensory-cartography lens, which gives the setting a distinct texture. The environment provides a plausible interface (the crane’s control panel) but doesn’t strongly constrain her options beyond atmosphere and access. Still, it consistently supports tone and concept rather than feeling like a generic SF backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, sea, fog, dock, and lantern room are vivid and filtered through Maren’s practiced eye, avoiding generic atmosphere. Environmental specifics (currents, barnacles, gulls, stored letters in the walls, the ghost-heat of the lamp, feverish stones) all build a coherent, tactile world. The lantern room and sea glass function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final act and image. Weather and sea history subtly pressure the stakes without over-explaining systems.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald lighthouse, black water, stars, and relic wick are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory and atmospheric specificity. Setting is tightly integrated with function: the tower’s height, glass, and light rules (“total internal reflection”) are how he guides ships. The recurring object-as-setting (glass wick, green glass light) clearly charges the final image of the lighthouse “sang with shadowed elation.” The broader “after the last print newspaper” world is evocative but more gestural than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock tea house, valley mist, and moving light are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Yuen’s sensibility as a dye master. The environment’s liminal, suspended quality reinforces the thematic focus on transition and attention, and the shifting sun trails on the wing charge the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains options or forces choices; it functions more as atmosphere and metaphor than as a tactical environment. Even so, the specificity and integration with tone and motif are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the ancient tower, shifting labyrinth, storm, and trees at the boundary are all sharply drawn and filtered through her professional familiarity. Environmental rules (paths shifting, sextant healing in moonlight, dreams clinging to walls) feel internally consistent and grow organically from observation rather than exposition. Moonlight and storm aren’t just postcard backdrop; they enable the sextant’s function and turn the parapet into an “observatory,” directly shaping what she can do. The final image of her descending into the rain with new knowledge is charged by all this established atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, mica windows, luminescent roots, and endless night are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting actively shapes stakes—the greenhouse holds the realm’s last light, the Heart-Tree is the locus of revival, and the shattering mica literally ushers in dawn. Environmental elements evolve with events (dim bark, trembling windows, suspended shards) and charge the final image. A minor limitation is that non-visual senses are underused; more tactile/aural integration under peak pressure could further heighten immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and conceptually integrated: Whitmore & Sons as a mundane facade, the secret library, dust motes in lamplight, and the “Philosophy of Errors” stacks all mirror her emotional terrain. The Society of the Inkwell Moon and the back room’s towering shelves charge the atmosphere with ritual and secrecy. Environment actively shapes the story’s logic, giving her a liminal refuge where she can “stay while leaving” and study mistakes rather than confront immediate pain. The clock and midnight transformation further bind setting to stakes, though physicality could be used a touch more tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The courtyard, overgrown palace, and tea house are vividly realized and deeply integrated with Elara’s perception; details like the jasmine vine, crack in the stone, fountain, and ornamental grasses all mirror the theme of slow change. Setting isn’t just backdrop—it defines her tasks, constraints (secrecy, constant regrowth), and the atmosphere in which absolution is enacted. The recurring objects (bread, chrysalis/butterfly, broom, tea pot) meaningfully charge the final images. It stops short of 9+ only because the environment doesn’t force a sharply constrained choice, though it strongly colors her ongoing posture.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library above the clouds, “quartz hush,” frost-etched marble, and glass slides produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than touristic. Details are filtered through the archivist’s professional lens, which strengthens specificity and tone. The environment lightly constrains action (her careful steps to avoid disturbing the lattice of magic), but mostly supports mood and theme rather than forcing different tactical choices. That lack of hard constraint on options keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is vivid and texturally integrated: the truce of hush, the tarpaulins, salt and kerosene, and the creaking boards all feel lived-in and shape behavior. Details are filtered through Mara’s familiarity (“boots finding familiar planks”) and underworld upbringing, so nothing reads like a neutral tour. The environment meaningfully charges the tone and final image (light filtering through rotting boards at sunrise) even if it doesn’t tightly constrain specific tactical options. The watch fob as recurring object also helps charge the closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and voting forests create a rich, idiosyncratic atmosphere that feels integral to the piece’s speculative texture. Details like the herbaceous scent of crushed lavender and the “terrestrially cosmic” sky are strongly filtered through Mira’s perception. While the setting doesn’t materially constrain her choices, it does charge the central images (the ring, the aurora, the convergence) and supports the story’s tone and theme. World rules—forest elections, weather-people—are sketched efficiently and consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cave and crystals are vividly evoked—“auroral sorrow,” “womb of crystallized light,” “mineral rain”—and consistently filtered through Mira’s artistic sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the crystal-filtered light explicitly mirrors Elena’s lifelong pursuit and charges the final scene at the canvas. The micro-setting of the makeshift platform and dried petals grounds the human presence without breaking the lyrical register. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain choices, it meaningfully shapes mood and meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly and economically rendered, with details like children carving tunnels through abandoned growing halls and succulents “that had learned to survive on memory of water” doing strong double duty for mood and theme. Setting stays tightly inside Mira’s sensibility as a calligrapher and apprentice, never lapsing into tourist catalog. The environment doesn’t quite force tactical choices in-scene, but it does credibly explain the existence of the letter room and the culture of rationed lies. The final garden image, transforming the letter-room via gold leaf and candlelight, powerfully repurposes earlier environmental motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Whispering Bluff, the thin air, the sounding metals, and the iceberg fragment create a vivid, integrated environment that shapes what is possible (wind-carried “whispers,” winter-only speech, sculpture responding to air currents). Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a former bell tuner, so details like “materials that remembered tone” feel character-specific rather than touristic. The bluff’s wind and elevation are not just backdrop but the enabling condition for her entire practice and the story’s final “conversation with the sky.” The environment charges the final image and constrains the form of truth in this world.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dome, desert roses, and magnetically torn sky are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Cara’s perspective as a long-term caretaker. Environmental facts (the dome’s tech, magnetic disruption) directly generate the crisis and constrain what she can do. The rootedness of her cables with the roses and the final image of the dome intact with roses lifting toward a re-settled north tightly bind setting to theme and closure. Worldbuilding stays selective but feels deep and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard, mailbox cluster, dawn light, and bakery are vividly drawn and feel inhabited, with strong sensory specificity (“sandals soft against the worn stone tiles,” “flour dusting her apron”). The environment functions as more than backdrop: the courtyard’s stillness and “sandstorm calm” frame the thematic concern with suspended, unfinished stories. The recurring object-as-setting of the mailbox is especially effective and charges the final image when it is “now unlocked and empty, its purpose fulfilled.” While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it does shape tone and the mode of revelation in a coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken laboratory, black water, rusted equipment, and draining chamber are concrete, atmospheric, and constantly in play, shaping how she moves and what’s possible. The environmental constraint (flooded corridors, weightless underwater movement) is not just decorative; it enables the dance’s unique physicality and structures the key turn when the water begins to recede. The spider and its web serve as a small but potent micro-setting motif that is meaningfully reprised at the end. This is rich, purposeful world-building at an elite short-fiction level, though there’s still room to let the physical space complicate her tactics a bit more.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and integrated—beached whale, flooded cemetery, lighthouse, and salt crystal chamber all feel sensorially and conceptually cohesive. Environmental elements (salt, gravity pockets, crystals) are not mere backdrop; they dictate how memories manifest and how Mira must move, and they charge the final image of her role. Details like coffins rising “like boats” and memories drifting as luminescent fragments deepen atmosphere without over-explaining. At this length, the world’s rules for memory storage and gravity anomalies remain suggestive rather than fully systematized, but that ambiguity suits the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The brookside nocturnal haven is vivid and functional: the water, frogs, and hush are not just scenery but the medium she manipulates, and they literally quiet in response to her work. The origami wing and the brook together charge the final image as it floats downstream, binding setting, object, and theme. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her summoner’s attention to vibration and flow. The environment constrains the method (silence-mapping via natural soundscape), which lifts this above decorative atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and thematically fused: architectural details, the rooftop garden, and the meteor shower all reinforce the “language of old buildings” and legibility/illegibility motifs. Environmental details are filtered through Elena’s growing obsession, and the buildings effectively become a kind of third character. The rooftop meteor shower directly charges the climax, with stars as “corrections written in the margins of the universe” mirroring the story’s concern with what can and can’t be read. It doesn’t quite use physical constraints of space to shape tactical options, but as atmospheric and conceptual setting it’s extremely strong.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “velvet garden” and twilight light are richly specific and sensorial, neatly contrasting with the sterile research station and echoing the story’s liminal themes. The setting feels lived-in (grandmother planted it; it survived cuts), and details like jasmine fragrance and gradients of violet/amber charge the mood. The shell functions as a micro-setting object, its physical structure tied to the speculative mechanics. The environment shapes tone more than tactics, so it falls just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The marble sanctuary under the aurora, “pearl twilight,” and stalactites as a slow clock create a vivid, coherent environment that shapes tone and subtly the magic (the wall that crumbles at her intentional touch). Details are selective and character-filtered rather than touristic, and recurring objects (the thorn, the altar, the apse) are spatially clear. The setting also charges the final image, so the environment is doing meaningful narrative work, not just decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon, dry riverbeds, serpentine nexus, and starlight are vividly rendered and thematically apt, echoing the story’s preoccupation with resonance and absence (“waters that had dried a thousand years ago”). The seashell, the nexus, and the celestial alignment all tie setting to function rather than postcard description. The environment does not strongly constrain tactical options, but it clearly charges the final image of stepping into the song. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are rich, immersive, and integrated with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glacier shrine, candlelight, and wreck imagery are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her vocation, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The snow globe, candles, ice, and “borrowed starlight” recur meaningfully and charge the final moments. The environment shapes tone more than tactical choice; she could arguably do similar work in a different sacred space without much mechanical change. Still, the setting feels integral to the story’s identity and to the emotional resonance of the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and deeply integrated: the parapet’s wet stone, flooded paddies like “silver stitching,” harbor lights, and post-rain air all filter through Yuki’s pattern-obsessed perception. Environmental details are not generic; they recur as active metaphors (moon paths as stitching, water spiders’ nets) that reinforce both her vocation and worldview. The bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting object, anchoring memory and present stance while charging the final image. Weather and season (after rain, firefly time) directly enable the central image of fireflies responding to her whistle.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The wasteland orchard under dust storms, a radioactive dead zone with a thriving canopy, and the diamond as a crystalline record all create vivid, specific atmosphere that is tightly tied to the science-myth tension. Details like radiation mapping on the keeper’s skin and the dead village beneath the living canopy are economical and charged. The environment meaningfully frames the stakes and charges the final image of the storm and rooted trees as a stillpoint metaphor. The setting could constrain tactics a bit more directly, but it already does strong thematic and tonal work.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory above storm clouds, the cobalt glass, and the storm itself are vivid, sensorially rich, and consistently filtered through Elara’s mind. Setting is not just backdrop: the portico’s time-porous glass and the storm’s behavior are the very mechanisms by which prophecy and the prophet manifest. Weather, architecture, and tools (radio/portico) all converge to charge the final image of the cracking glass and emergent figure. A slight tendency toward decorative metaphor keeps this just shy of the top band, but the integration is still excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal setting and “feral loft beneath the dunes” are vividly rendered—rusted ladders, broken windows framing the sea, glass jars like wind chimes—anchoring time and place with strong sensory specificity. The environment meaningfully participates in the story: the loft is the only place the music box can be discovered, and it later becomes the sanctum where his redefined work happens. Details are filtered through his sensibility as a sound-obsessed wanderer, so the world feels lived-in rather than touristic. The only thing holding this short of the top band is that physical constraints of the setting don’t significantly shape tactical choices beyond providing the crucible for discovery and return.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drift-ice marina, polar wind, and lighthouse embedded in frozen sea are vivid and specific, with weather and ice behavior directly tied to the stakes. The Resonance Crystal and its copper cradle are well integrated into the environment rather than feeling like props. The ice’s groaning and shuddering evolve with the conflict, and the final calm of the harbor visually and sonically pays off those details. Setting clearly constrains choices and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly realized and integrated with action (ice as mirror, groans as messages, stone warmth as conduit). Details are filtered through Kira’s profession and temperament, creating a strong sensory and conceptual mesh. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables her work—her method depends on the lake’s reflective ice and the viaduct’s volcanic memory. The final image of lake, moon path, and viaduct answering each other is atmospherically powerful and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is concrete and atmospheric—rusted ladder, high watermark, tile walls, train rumbles—and the drought’s end is physically inscribed via the stain line. The environment plausibly explains why the skeleton surfaces now and allows the rumble/vibration that triggers the memory experience. The lantern operates as a micro-setting object, charging the mood and the final image with historical weight. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical options in the scene, it consistently filters Elena’s perceptions and supports the thematic frame of buried infrastructures and histories.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prison and, especially, the Delancey Street repair shop are vividly evoked through tools, window light, dust motes, and the cramped, lived-in workspace. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Thomas’s sensibility (confessional light, reverence for broken things). The clockwork heart functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains the kind of actions possible. The only thing holding this just under the top band is that the external environment never quite exerts pressure on his options beyond inspiring reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea” is richly realized and filters through every paragraph, from dissolving iron to the cathedral-of-motion engine room. Details feel specific and lived-in, and the workshop’s impossible precariousness mirrors the cart glider’s improbable sentience and project. The recurring image of the acid sea beneath and the humming machinery above charges the final moment without overwhelming it. Still, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices; it’s more atmospheric than tactically binding, which holds this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The social network archive and sublevel server farm are vivid and tonally apt, with the “echo of forgotten songs” and looping profile melodies giving the environment a haunted, tactile presence. Setting is consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a memory keeper, so details feel lived-in rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully shapes the premise (ghost profiles, hidden subdirectories, old servers the company has forgotten), and the final movement into “the silence where the company had hidden what it could not bear to remember” is atmospherically strong. The setting stops just short of constraining a specific tactical choice in scene, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: lighthouse, impossible-soil orchard, shifting ice, and the uncanny vintage store all feel tactile and specific. Environment isn’t just backdrop; apples answer hunger, the lighthouse defines her function, and the ice/floes plus the final softening wind directly charge the closing image of safe passage. Details are consistently filtered through her vocation, reinforcing tone and theme. The only thing keeping it from an even higher band is that the environment constrains her emotionally and conceptually more than through concrete, tactical limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered—ice “like distant bells,” “grinding” against harbor walls—and the cold, remote, debris-strewn environment mirrors her preoccupation with endings. Details are filtered through her altered state and her work with shipwreck remains, giving the place a lived-in, specific feel rather than a postcard backdrop. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image through inherited history. The environment shapes tone more than concrete options, but it strongly charges the story’s atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vineyard, pavilion, and distant station are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail and a strong seasonal atmosphere that mirrors the emotional arc. The professional lens (thirty years of tending grapes, understanding ripeness) grounds the setting and enriches theme. The environment charges the final image but only lightly constrains choices; it’s more reflective backdrop than tactical pressure. Still, specificity and consistency are high.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dunes, pavilion, kinetic parapet, and whisperfield are vivid and integrated with Mira’s way of perceiving—world rules (murmuring sand, living boundaries) are learned through her tactile engagement. The pavilion as a “threshold place” and the parapet as a living mechanism both echo the thematic concern with fluid borders rather than serving as mere backdrop. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with particularity (bone-white columns, unique plant-fiber roof) that avoids generic fantasy texture. The environment strongly colors mood and concept, though it stops short of visibly constraining a specific tactical choice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lavender field behind rusted factories is vivid, sensorially rich, and thematically charged; details like “creeping thyme” and “rusted iron skeletons” feel lived-in rather than generic. Setting and atmosphere strongly mirror the story’s concern with decay and restoration, and the recurring juxtaposition of lavender and machinery meaningfully charges the final image. Although the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does function as a microcosm for the thematic stakes. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong enough to approach publishable quality in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library is richly evoked as a living organism (“columns rose in proportions that mirrored the germination rates of wheat”) and not just a backdrop. Environmental details—chandelier, crystals, dawn light, dust patterns—are all filtered through Elias’s lexicographical mind and directly charge the ending image. The setting meaningfully shapes theme and tone rather than remaining postcard description. A slight tilt toward the abstract in some architectural theorizing keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog sculpture garden, unwinding videotapes, and dry fountain are vivid, idiosyncratic, and tightly fused with the themes of memory and forgetting. Setting is not postcard decoration: fog necessitates invisible paths and driftwood markers, while the garden’s abandoned objects embody “echoes” that charge the final realization. The environment constrains navigation and supplies the conceptual raw material for her prophecy. This is near top-tier atmospheric work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory above the clouds with the lunar face, condensation, trembling foundations, and thin air is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s professional and emotional concerns. Environment and objects (camera, glass, spinning hand, mountain tremors) actively charge the final image, not just decorate it. The setting’s altitude, fragility, and luminous exposure mirror and pressure the narrator’s obsession with the ephemeral in a way that materially matters to the ending. It fully meets the “object/setting charges closure” gate.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “radiant haven above the clouds,” amber light, and the softened city all mirror the hospice’s liminal role. The micro-setting of the “junk drawer” objects, especially the vinyl shard, functions as an embodied environment for Elara’s method. The broken record fragment explicitly charges the final image and constrains her choices—it is both tool and emblem of her philosophy. Description is selective and filtered through Elara’s sensibility rather than reading like a neutral tour.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle, the star-fields “like phosphorescent fish,” and humming stones provide vivid, specific atmosphere woven through action. Setting is filtered well through Elara’s scholarly perspective (runes, mechanisms, clockwork), and the meridian telescope plus floating isle magic feel coherent. The environment meaningfully participates: the observatory’s own shadow is the test site and the clockwork infrastructure resonates with the loop-closing key and the Bend’s geometry. Still, the setting mostly supports mood and concept rather than imposing concrete constraints or risks on Elara’s choices, which keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the hedge maze, overgrown herbs, Triton fountain, and glowing channels are all filtered through Elara’s history and aim. The garden is not postcard backdrop; it’s her mother’s sanctuary and a liminal space where the rules of the visible world loosen, making it the only plausible site for this bone-setting-for-the-soul attempt. The baby tooth’s light re-mapping the stones as constellations charges the final image and thematically binds place, object, and desire. A minor reason it doesn’t edge into 9+ is that the maze itself doesn’t significantly constrain on-page choice beyond symbolic access.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, sea glass, and tide-driven entrance are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elira’s sensibility as a former sky-dweller now bound to stone. Setting details (narrowing passages, damp half-dark, mist at the entrance) aren’t just decorative; they shape her craft and charge the final image of a sanctuary of living light threaded through the grotto. This world feels specific and atmospheric without lapsing into a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid and specific—the “honeyed hush,” rusting server racks, and drip-patterned concrete ceiling all feel tactile and lived-in. Setting is not mere backdrop; it mirrors and refracts the healing motif (moss over wounds, water’s slow work) and directly charges the closing image of “this moss garden, amber warm against my heart.” While it doesn’t strictly constrain options, the choice of this precise environment rather than a generic park deeply shapes tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “feral nexus” and coastal path are vividly rendered, with mist, twisted trees, and the river giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The seashell as micro-setting/object is smartly used, especially in the final spiral image. However, the environment is more symbolic and tonal than constraining—her choices aren’t meaningfully limited or redirected by the physical space. Description remains purposeful and filtered through her mindset, avoiding touristy cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the mist, harvest moon, untouched soil, and arbor are vivid and coherently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully shapes the ritual (alignment of moon and dawn, specific spot of virgin soil), not just providing a backdrop. Details like the brass goggles and tools also ground the world’s texture without over-explaining. The final image of the transformed arbor and luminous leaves is strongly charged by earlier environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through (“tired sentinels,” “indigo sky,” pressing cold). Environmental detail is well-filtered through Elara’s focus on objects and ritual, and the setting’s barrenness vs. the storybook’s lush orchard meaningfully charges the final image. However, the environment mostly sets mood rather than constraining choices or tactics; the cold aches but never truly forces adaptation. Still, as atmosphere and thematic mirror, it’s strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marble cavern, its acoustic purity, and the wounded-season weather are vivid, specific, and tightly tied to the premise of harvesting echoes and working by reflected light. Environment meaningfully constrains her tactics—mirrors, shifting light from the cavern mouth, and the echo-holding stone all shape how she can study and what the device can become. The setting also charges the final image, with the cavern “holding every sound she made” as part of the new function. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that feels integral rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bronze grotto, fissured stone, metal-rich glow, and the “shingled hush” are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the premise. The setting is not postcard décor; it is the mechanism by which burdens pool, are woven, and ultimately absorb the protagonist—her fate is literally to become the walls. Environmental detail (“starlight filtered through fissures,” the draft that orients the flame) is filtered through her task and modulates the tone of the final image, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, and sensory palette (ash wood, sawdust, old iron light) are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her grief and craft. Setting details evolve: rain, light, and the loft’s “rust-hued peace” all reweight the emotional stakes by the final blade of light. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it powerfully charges the final image and theme. Description is lush yet purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The kinetic lagoon, halted carousel, and sky “remembering” music are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility, establishing a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The setting is not postcard; the lagoon’s center and its “fractured stillness” mirror and intensify her inner state, while the silent carousel and light-without-sun return in the final image to charge closure. World rules (water you can walk on, voices remaining) are surreal yet stable and learned through action. The camera wheel functions as a micro-setting/object that constrains the final beat, anchoring the ending image in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful—the “hollow ribcage” terminal, cracked polymer, and the ghost of the carnival create a strong atmosphere that’s filtered through Mara’s engineer’s eye. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the tunnels, ruptured drainage, and mineral blockages directly shape her tactics and possibilities. The sextant as a recurring object meaningfully charges the final image, reweighting the space as a site of layered histories and futures. A slight tendency toward lyrical cataloging in places keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and textured: petrichor, “crystal whispering forecourt,” glacial hush, and the valley’s late sunrise all feel embodied and specific. Environment and objects meaningfully charge the ending—the sanctuary’s silence, the crystal’s song, and the valley sunrise frame and inflect the act of winding the clock. The world’s quasi-magical acoustics (crystals “singing” after rain) are consistent and feel organic rather than expository. The only thing holding this just below 9 is that setting constrains emotional choice more than it poses any real practical limitation or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canal at twilight, the converted warehouses, the “black glass” water, and the barge are all concrete, atmospheric, and tightly filtered through her professional gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop; her awareness of older brick beneath repairs directly shapes her final navigational choice. The sundial and the radio function as micro-settings and tools that charge the final image with time and liminality. Environment, object, and sensory cues integrate smoothly and constrain what she can notice and do in a way that elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor, snow, fog, and dock are richly evoked and strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility; details like “brine of centuries” and the dock’s creaking history create a palpable world. The fulgurite, rope, and dock are integrated into action rather than static description. The final image of the fog consuming the dock and him pocketing the glass is atmospherically charged and reinforces the liminal, preservation theme. The environment mostly shapes mood rather than tactical options, but it clearly charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The garden, fountain, birch, and autumn light are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly mirrors and amplifies the emotional terrain. The setting is not just backdrop; it explicitly draws people seeking “the geography of healing” and frames her work of mapping absences, and the recurring leaves and light patterns charge the contemplative mood. The weft thread functions as a micro-setting/object that warms the final image and links distant palace to present garden. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, it clearly shapes her mental options and the thematic stakes, which is strong work at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly filtered through the prince’s perception: rusted chandeliers as “mechanical flowers,” the brass railing, the stained-glass birds all mirror his grief for lost life. Environmental elements recur meaningfully—the mechanical songbird, the suspended palace, and the cavernous underworld all charge the thematic contrast between the living and the made. The egg and its golden veins function as a micro-setting/object that decisively charges the final image. The only minor limitation is that the environment rarely constrains his physical choices; it shapes feeling and meaning far more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is excellent: the obsidian lagoon, black sand, migrating clouds, and coastal village are specific, sensorial, and filtered through Mira’s history. Environmental images evolve—the lagoon shifting from black mirror to molten gold directly charges the thematic turn. The sand’s physicality (in her hand, against her cheek, clinging to her boots) grounds the lyricism. While the environment doesn’t constrain action in a tactical sense, it functions as an active emotional and thematic landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” is strongly realized and idiosyncratic, with each named fountain adding both atmosphere and structural function. Details like the pewter sky, migrating geese, dried basins, and algae-covered serpents feel selective and purposeful, not touristic. The environment directly shapes the narrative path (breadcrumbs at fountains, the final Circular Pool as the liberation site) and charges the last image of Mira sitting in deflating dusk. A slight cap comes from the fact that the setting constrains movement more symbolically than through hard logistical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nebula garden is vivid, specific, and integrated: bioluminescent petals, crystalline spiral trees, and zero-gravity shedding all feel particular and coherent. The environment mirrors and deepens the thematic concern with non-consumptive light and slow decay. While the garden doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it absolutely charges the final image and the mission (“to share light without using fire”). The setting feels lived-in, not a postcard, but it’s more atmospheric than tactical, which holds it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse, dusk light, and migrating butterflies are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s grief and craft; sensory detail is rich without losing clarity. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the estate edge, rusting iron, humidity, and glass faces of ghosts all charge the mentorship and grief imagery. The greenhouse and workshop together frame the before/after, and the butterflies concretize “collective grief” at closure. Very slight cap only because the environment constrains mood and meaning more than concrete options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian ridge, retreating tide, and iron clock tower are vivid and specific, with strong sensory and tonal integration. The pendulum mechanism and narrow windows are not mere backdrop; the environment (especially the pendulum and height) structures the ritual and charges the final image of descent. The rake handle functions as a micro-setting object that carries emotional history. The natural world (tide, stars) is more atmospheric than constraining, but it enhances the piece’s sense of charged isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cemetery and “cobalt silo” are vivid and specific, with details like leaning stones, rusted ladder, and star-held light creating a strong atmosphere. The setting is filtered through his workmanlike familiarity and quiet reverence, which deepens tone. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. Still, at this length, the imagery is rich and memorable enough to lift this category.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, blank page, and feather are vivid, sensorial anchors that recur and evolve in meaning. The environment is not just scenic; it’s conceptually tied to constraint and possibility (frozen water, spring thaw, reflective shards as timelines). Details are filtered convincingly through Elara’s professional and philosophical lens. The final image of ink/lake/kingfisher gives the setting clear charge, though it still operates more symbolically than as a tangible constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the ember alcove, mist, ruined city, ash-thin print, and patrols create a convincing, atmospheric micro-world. Details like the wrapped radio glow and dust in archive basements are filtered through Mira’s priorities of secrecy and preservation. Environment shapes the mode of action (cloaked broadcasts, low light, isolation), though it rarely corners her into specific tactical choices in-scene. The atmosphere strongly supports tone and theme even if it doesn’t quite reach the level of constraining a peak decision.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, the old rocking chair, the worktable, and the porcelain all do thematic and atmospheric work rather than reading as generic stage dressing. Setting is filtered through grief and ritual—light as “memory,” the gallery as a place “where art came to vanish,” the rocking chair’s creak as a time marker—which charges the final image of Mira leaving with fragments. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible: a private, liminal gallery closing hour enables this intimate, slightly transgressive ritual. The Vanishing Point name in particular reweights the ending by aligning spatial perspective with emotional disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and filtered tightly through the narrator’s professional gaze: “coral-encrusted streets,” “silt-filled plazas,” tide marks on the harbormaster’s walls. The flooded lower city and sedimentary layers are not just backdrop but conceptual machinery, mirroring the thematic layers of narrative and literally enabling the narrator’s work. The seafarer’s cog as a recurring object charges the atmosphere and final image (it will “join my collection” as data), giving the environment and tools real conceptual weight. The only reason this doesn’t edge higher is that the physical setting rarely constrains concrete choices beyond mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The velvet library, autumn light, and leaded windows create a distinct, atmospheric container that feels lived-in and thematically apt. The zither and its worn rosette operate as micro-setting, repeatedly handled and finally charging the last image with history and cost. Details are selective and filtered through Eleanor’s sensibility (scholarly quiet, “traveled” stillness) rather than catalogued. The environment doesn’t overtly constrain physical options, but it strongly shapes mood and the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted greenhouse is vivid and texturally rich (“iron bones weeping orange tears”) and is consistently filtered through Elena’s sensibility as both ruin and potential kitchen. Environment and object-as-setting genuinely constrain action and theme: the decay justifies pruning as central action and makes the final transformation image charged. The setting’s ruin/renewal tension directly mirrors the knowledge-erasure/knowledge-survival stakes, and the final promise to build a kitchen here feels inseparable from this precise place. A small further integration of practical obstacles in the space could push this toward truly exceptional, but it is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific: copper spire, bottled atmosphere, drone beehives, “nectar dusk” and honeyed sky all cohere into a distinctive techno-mythic city. World rules around energy collection are conveyed economically through action (weighing jars, sending charge up the tower). The tower and reservoir directly frame the climax, so the environment meaningfully shapes the final image. A slightly greater sense of physical constraint or danger at the tower’s peak could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the harbor road, “violet hour,” sea lavender, and lingering orris-root scent build a tangible, mood-dense environment. Details feel filtered through Mira’s sensibility as someone trained to notice small displacements and traces, so the house reads as palpably inhabited by memory. The recurring orris-root aroma and the lived-in house objects charge the final sense of the home as an archive of presence. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, it deeply inflects perception and the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater garden of Veluna is vividly rendered—kelp forests, schools of fish, anemones, coral, oysters, and light through water are all specific and sensorially grounded. These details are filtered through Thalassor’s changing perception, so setting and theme inform each other rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it deeply charges the thematic logic of his choices. The final image of the ampoule in his stone palm under water ties place and concept effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    The infinite staircase is a strong, memorable conceptual setting that undergirds the entire piece and is tightly linked to the paradox/quantum themes. “Bounded infinity” and the sense of every step looking the same effectively create atmosphere, and the staircase meaningfully reconfigures at the end. Still, sensory detail is sparse and heavily visual/abstract; we rarely feel the physicality of the climb or the environment constraining specific moment-to-moment choices. The dice function as a micro-setting object but could interact more dynamically with the space.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vividly rendered through specific sensory details (“heat-pressed glass,” “saffron quiet,” “streetlamps bleeding into the smog”). Environment is not just backdrop: the greenhouse is her sanctuary, the glass mediates the moonlight that powers the daydreams, and this liminal space becomes the drop point for her kindness messages. The recurring presence of moon, glass, plants, and city haze charges the final image of her sleeping in that space. Setting could constrain physical choice even more strongly in a top-tier piece, but it already meaningfully shapes the story’s options and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto city, monumental waterfall, emerald lens, hives, and bread all create a richly textured, coherent environment deeply filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a guide. Setting is not decorative: the hidden chambers, frozen entrance, and thaw actively constrain and reconfigure options, and the waterfall/lens imagery charges the final image of stepping toward the entrance. Sensory detail (light in water, moss, rosewater, yeast) is selective and purposeful, supporting both mood and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and hunger stone are vividly rendered and tonally unified, with strong sensory and atmospheric texture (“slow exhale of low tide,” “cold fire that cast shadows backward”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the isolation makes her choice plausible, the hunger stone charges the risk, and the lighthouse’s literal dissolution powers the final image. The environment’s constraining effect could be dramatized slightly more in her tactics, but as-is it solidly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The carnival and funhouse are vividly, specifically rendered—the “crooked tooth” façade, peeling smile like “desperate hands,” weeping mirrors—and the environment consistently mirrors and amplifies her inner fear/desire conflict. The funhouse and its mirrors directly shape the central act (unbosoming to the last mirror), and leaving the carnival behind charges the final image of driving toward dawn. The opera cloak clasp and dream dictionary function as micro-settings/objects that carry the world’s rules and history. It stops just short of 9-band because, while atmospherically rich, the space could constrain tactical choice even more strongly under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is striking and specific: an orchard of driftwood logs lashed into a floating ring, at blue hour on the open sea, with acoustic properties that matter to every action. Environmental details (cloud formations, leeward currents, wave behavior) are filtered through her professional attention and directly shape the ritual. The world’s rules feel internally consistent and are learned through what she does rather than through infodump. The final image is charged by this environment, though the setting constrains mood and method more than it forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and unusual—spiral-roads on turtle shells, a city literally settling into the mud, sunwashed dread as an environmental condition, distant marsh watchers. Details are filtered through Mira’s professional and emotional lens (hum-of-origin, shell patterns, bioluminescence fading), which keeps description purposeful. Crucially, the environment and its tools (shells, spirals, hum, turtles) constrain and enable choices and charge the final image of the glowing spiral and shifting creatures. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through her practiced attention rather than clunky exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The disused station and ivy “cathedral” are vivid and purposeful, thematically echoing reclamation and buried history. Setting is well-anchored in place and time, with specific details (tiles, ticket office, rosebush) that feel lived-in rather than generic. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables action; it functions more as atmosphere and metaphor than as a pressure on choices. The station’s role as a convergence point of eras is conceptually strong but remains largely in the realm of interpretation rather than on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pavilion is vividly imagined and sensorially specific—“crown like a broken tooth,” “kelp draped the railings like widow’s veils,” “rusted to a deep orange that bled into the evening light”—and these details are filtered through Maren’s professional and emotional lens. Environment constrains choice (the tide’s timing, the raised drawbridge) and charges the final image of her leaving as the pavilion “settled deeper into its long forgetting.” The setting is not a backdrop but an active partner in the theme of erosion and memory. This is close to exemplary, only shy of the very top band because it doesn’t quite introduce an unexpected environmental turn late in the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The submerged city’s forgotten library, deep archives, and candlelit blackout are rendered with strong sensory focus and a consistent, somber tone that matches Mira’s mindset. Setting is not postcard-only: the blackout and deep-archive stillness directly alter how she works and what she can see, and the “reclaimed stillness” motif returns to charge the ending. Details like the false panel and the weighty quiet feel specific and inhabited. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that meaningfully supports theme and action, just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating island tea garden and its cosmology are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s grief (“where grief could hold its breath and still feel like breathing”). Tools and objects—the dream-gem, cranes, lanterns—function as micro-setting and are tightly woven into action and the final image. World rules (dream ascension, detached shadows, basilica architecture) are learned through use rather than dump. The environment mostly charges mood and theme rather than constraining tactical choices, which keeps this just shy of a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is striking and specific: a floating observatory at forty thousand feet, electromagnetic tethers humming, circuit breakers cooling below, and a sky “burn[ing] with the particular purple of a sun that set years ago.” Details are always filtered through his mind and theme—ruins as “unused potential,” LEDs and cables as the machinery of foreclosed futures. The geode works as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and tying environment to interior calculus. The only minor limitation is that the observatory doesn’t materially constrain his choices; it’s more atmospheric crucible than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory and desert are rendered with precise, evocative detail (“brass instruments… like sleeping sentinels,” “knife-edge ridge where the desert met the sky”), firmly anchoring space and atmosphere. Setting is tightly bound to function: star positions literally drive the machine’s activation, and the dome’s opening, twilight, and star-trails all constrain when this can happen. The environment mirrors and supports theme without feeling like blunt allegory. This is very close to top-tier, but the physical constraints of the buried relay station never quite come into tactical play beyond being “sealed,” leaving some unused potential.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings create a vivid, moody environment that’s strongly filtered through Maren’s sensibility. Details like the carvings as “bones of forgotten stories” and the worn watch hand catching dying light both establish atmosphere and charge the final image. The setting doesn’t much constrain physical options, but it does meaningfully shape the emotional and thematic field in which her realization occurs. Integration is strong and efficient, if still more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet, mist, storm-worn stone, and valley are vividly realized and tightly tied to the story’s liminal themes (“between-spaces,” neutral ground). Setting is not decorative: the parapet’s height and darkness make the dropping of the drawer pulls a charged physical act, and the mist and moon modulate tone and symbolism across the piece. Details are economical yet textured, filtered through a professional who notices terrain and phases of light. The setting could constrain choices a shade more overtly, but as-is it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal setting is vivid and purposeful: Mussel Point, cedar poles, cormorants, osprey nest, and choppy water are filtered through a navigator’s eye. Environment and objects constrain tactics—she literally uses utility poles instead of stars to navigate, and the current plus shoreline geometry dictate her choices. Weather and tide contribute to tone without feeling like postcard detail. The astronomical compass as a bodily presence also serves as a micro-setting object that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground industrial stairwell, bioluminescent walls, and lake are vividly rendered with strong sensory texture, and the microorganisms’ “delicate robustness” nicely echoes the thematic concern with fragile/strong selves. Setting is not mere backdrop; the bioluminescence actively reveals hidden text and enables the “between the lines” mechanic, charging the environment with agency. However, apart from that, the cave doesn’t significantly constrain her options or tactics beyond atmosphere—it shapes perception more than choice. The recurring baseball as an object-set piece also helps charge the final image, but again in a lyrical rather than tactical way.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard, moonlight, stones, and spices are vivid and sensorially rich, with scent doing excellent double-duty as magic and memory. Environment is clearly anchored and tonally aligned with the “cosmic intimacy” the story wants. However, the setting mostly witnesses and echoes interior states rather than constraining tactics or creating obstacles; Lysara could perform this ritual in almost any sacred grove with minimal change. The final image of the orchard as eternal witness does charge the ending nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “midnight glade above clouds” and moonlit mist as molten rivers create a vivid, coherent, and specific environment, and objects-as-setting (saucer, tablecloth) are tightly integrated into action. The glade functions thematically as a liminal, forgiving space rather than a mere backdrop, and the above-cloud altitude reinforces the sense of separation from the daughter’s world. However, the environment mostly charges mood and symbolism rather than concretely constraining options or tactics. Even so, its recurrence and specificity strongly charge the final image of release and breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The recycled ship, starless void, gravity pools, and photograph-lined observation deck are vividly specific and strongly filtered through Seraph’s sensibility. The micro-setting of the photograph wall becomes functionally central, as it is literally the fabric she stitches to effect the change. World rules around gravity quirks and ship age are consistent and atmospheric without bogging down in exposition. The environment charges the final image, though it still feels more like a resonant backdrop than an active constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and eclipse sky are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail that’s tightly filtered through Mara’s contemplative gaze. Setting and recurring objects (black sand, volcano, jars, lightning bugs) charge the final image—the sand “remembering” her footsteps and the volcano “telling its fires” extend the story’s stakes into the landscape. The environment operates more as a resonant stage than as a hard constraint on choices, but it consistently mirrors and deepens the theme of transformation. World rules around the quasi-mystical elements feel internally coherent for this lyrical, slightly fabulist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fort at twilight, the blackout, and the ruined sundial are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action rather than feeling like backdrop. The sundial’s half-painted markings and the quill holder’s resonance are not only described but function as mechanisms that enable discovery and encode resistance. Environmental changes (from blackout to emergency lights) subtly mirror the thematic shift from controlled illumination to subversive “sparks.” Setting and objects materially constrain and enable choices, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless world, and mercury eels are vivid and sensorially specific, and they’re filtered through Mira’s occupational and emotional lens rather than as tourist description. World rules (lost friction, nets failing, her barefoot balance) are dramatized rather than dumped and remain consistent. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (rock placement, the aurora-timed visits, the difficulty of catching in a frictionless world) and charges the final image of the “borrowed dawn” spreading. A touch more tactile engagement with the frictionless danger at the climactic step could have further heightened constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly realized and tightly woven into the emotional arc, from “lantern flickering against the storm’s advance” to the final image of verses written in mist on the glass. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the dome becomes a “confessional between earth and sky,” and the glass literally receives her new, uncensorable words, charging the ending. Weather and altitude (thin air, trembling dome, first raindrops) calibrate tone and mirror her internal pressure without feeling like blunt symbolism. The environment lightly constrains choice (isolation, exposure) but mostly operates as a charged stage rather than an active obstacle, keeping this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vividly realized and woven through the piece, creating a strong atmosphere and consistent tonal contrast between serenity and conflict. Details like the sundial’s shadows and the gleam of the mechanical arm are well chosen and recur at key beats. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; the sundial’s “coded angles” never quite become functional in-scene. Setting thus supports mood and theme more than it drives action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prison library is vivid and particular—“rusted iron beams forming a skeletal cage,” moonlight pouring through, shelves unused for years—and the starry, open-roofed space sets a strong lyrical atmosphere. Setting and objects (rust, beams, stars, books) mirror the theme of beauty emerging within confinement, and the final image of the “rusted library” holding them in fractured light is excellent. However, the environment mostly frames and charges mood rather than constraining concrete choices or tactics in scene. Its contribution is substantial but more symbolic than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the station, roof, and tidal arbor are vividly rendered with selective, mood-true details (“bruised violet and tarnished silver” clouds, “garden suspended between heaven and earth”). The liminal geography and the recurring objects (piano, compasses, film reel) are tightly integrated into how he acts and what’s possible. The arbor above the clouds isn’t just decorative; it’s the only place his desire can be enacted, and that spatial logic charges the ending image. A tiny drawback is that the station world feels slightly generic compared to the arresting specificity of the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The island of Verid, the memory-moths, the reflecting pools, and the ridge with its bloom-flower are vividly, economically rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s professional sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the ridge, the bloom-flower, and the monsoon concretely condition what she must do, when, and how, and the flower-as-bridge explicitly governs the method of awakening. World rules around dreams manifesting and reality requiring checking are internally consistent and learned via action rather than exposition dumps. The final image of monsoon and scattered “seeds” of memory feels charged by the previously established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The islet after rain, wet earth, salt air, and the shifting light on lace and sea create a vivid, textured environment that feels integral rather than scenic. Weather and light actively reshape perception (the lace pattern changing with the sun, the sky after storm reframing the color of apology), so setting clearly charges both theme and the final image. The bonsai bench, cottage, and harbor are economical but effective anchors. A minor limit is that the physical geography never constrains his options in a practical sense; its influence is emotional and symbolic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("bruised purple," "drowned seedlings"), grounding the abstraction effectively. The storm-damaged greenhouse provides a strong textural counterpoint to the cosmic scale of Mira's thoughts, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than an active constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity, particularly the contrast between the sun-baked stone and the creeping frost. The environment actively participates in the narrative discovery (the frost revealing paths), integrating setting with plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "winterglass conservatory" is rendered with sharp, atmospheric specificity that grounds the abstract premise. Details like "patterns that shifted like musical notation" and "frozen ferns" effectively pressure the protagonist's sensory experience. The setting acts as a necessary constraint for the heat-mapping method.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater library is vivid and atmospheric ("bookshelves rose like ribs," "swollen and strange"), effectively grounding the surreal shift. Sensory details like the salt smell and the specific quality of light anchor the setting, though the "throne-chair" remains visually vague.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is grounded with effective sensory details ("cramped quarters," "stubborn earth," "terra-cotta arbor"). The visual contrast between the dark settlement and the distant lights of abundance ("abundance was merely rationed rather than forbidden") effectively reinforces the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospherically vivid ("twilight settled like a held breath") but leans heavily on static "postcard" description. While the viaduct and wisteria provide a backdrop, they do not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert active pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The living bridge garden is a standout, functioning almost as a character that "breathes and flexes." The setting details ("rusted irrigation," "sugar in rain") are vivid and specific, though the score is capped by the Q2 ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The juxtaposition of the tawdry carnival remnants and the sacred seed vault is excellent, providing strong atmospheric contrast. Specific details like the "yellowed horsehair" and "cracked rubber balls" ground the setting effectively, doing significant heavy lifting for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exceptional—the "impossible" underwater orchard and ashen forge create a unique, highly specific atmosphere that constrains the mood and logic. The sensory details ("humidity of apple trees," "green-sound of ancient wood") ground the surrealism in a lived, physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is established with vivid, color-rich sensory details that support the magical realism tone. The "fleeting golden sunset" effectively acts as a constraint on the scene, grounding the magic in a specific temporal window.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    While atmospheric, the logistics strain credibility; a functioning glass studio (furnace, glory hole) inside an abandoned control room requires more setup to be plausible. The "rusted consoles" add texture but do not constrain the glassblowing process.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmosphere of the rusted library is rendered with some effective sensory details ("metal cold," "smell of rust"). However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop rather than providing resources or constraints that shape the tactical interplay of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on repeated descriptors ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") that become ornamental rather than grounding. While the sensory details of the storm are vivid, the environment functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; details like "frost-sounds" and "frost-stiffened leaves" create a vivid, cohesive sensory experience. The setting successfully mirrors the internal state of the protagonist, grounding the abstract themes in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with the "crystal whispering forecourt" establishing a distinct, ethereal tone. The sensory details ("water droplets still trembling," "smudged" lens) ground the fable-like setting, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker for choices.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like "sap stains" and "sweet decay" effectively ground the scene and establish the atmosphere. The garden maze is not just a backdrop but an active constraint on the protagonist's perspective and the final interaction with the villager.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting of the methane seas and the station is vivid and grounds the action well. However, the specific details often serve as backdrop rather than constraints that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric imagery of the "sinking cathedral" and "gilded balconies" is vivid and establishes a strong mood. However, practical details like the "miraculously dry" piano and the unexplained source of lanterns undermine the physical grounding of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with specific details like "steel bones," "copper and regret," and the "chitter" of instruments creating a vivid sensory experience. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, and the "tiny branching rivers" of frost mirror the aurora, integrating setting with theme seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmospheric details like the "weeping" walls and the beaded wheel create a strong sense of place. The setting actively contributes to the mood, though the use of the abstract descriptor "liminal quality" weakens the sensory immersion by telling rather than showing.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the piece's greatest strength, with vivid, specific details like the overgrown library and obsidian sanctuary. However, the setting fails to constrain action or force choices, serving only as a backdrop for contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with specific sensory details ("manzanita," "honeyed" light) effectively grounding the ethereal subject matter. The eclipse is handled well as an atmospheric pressure cooker, though some descriptions veer into abstraction ("liminal space") rather than concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "displaced axis" providing a strong, recurring visual anchor that shapes the physics of the scene. Sensory details like the "smell of wheat" and "shadows that crawled" effectively ground the speculative elements. The silo library feels distinct, elevating the "scholar in ruins" archetype with specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse is rendered with specific, sensory detail—from the "white finger" to the smell of vinegar and flour—that grounds the whimsical premise. The setting actively supports the character's isolation and his new method of "reading" the world.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Specificity is excellent, grounding the supernatural in concrete tools like the loop pedal and cracked watch. The "dimensional anchor" adds flavor but remains a background constraint until the final line's confirmation of stability.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the glass spire and frozen lake creating a vivid, consistent atmosphere. The sensory details ("smell of ginger and snow," "gold bleeding into silver") effectively ground the abstract magical elements. The environment mirrors the protagonist's internal state well.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    The opening image of the glowing viaduct and the suspended rain is vivid and atmospheric, anchoring the magical realism well. However, the setting dissolves into abstraction ("corridors of her own history") in the middle, losing the physical constraint necessary to ground the metaphysical journey.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cavern is established with vivid, specific sensory details ("hands like weathered bark," "cracks in the stone") that effectively ground the story's atmosphere. However, the logical disconnect regarding the passage of time (seasons changing within hours) undermines the physical solidity of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting specificity is high; details like the "copper roof," "seventeen leather-bound volumes," and the "chemical odors affecting cloud formation" ground the abstract conspiracy in concrete sensory experience. The environment actively informs the protagonist's deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong, atmospheric setting with vivid specific details like the UV fluorescence and moss-dampened sound. The "Conservatory of Lost Blooms" effectively grounds the fantastical elements, though the anthropomorphic plants ("leaning with recognition") lean slightly into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto provides a grounded, vivid setting that contrasts well with the abstract energy beings. However, the "energy beings" themselves remain vague concepts ("pure intention") rather than a concrete presence, which limits the atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "echo-harbor"—a sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks—is a vivid, original environment that functionally constrains the action. The specific acoustic properties of the hulks and the "chronic hush" are not just set dressing but the mechanics through which the protagonist must operate, charging the final image with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "amber grotto" and scent descriptions create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the protagonist’s melancholic detachment. Sensory details like "honeyed whiskey" and "smelled of ethanol" effectively ground the abstract concept in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmospheric details like the "hull of an inverted ship" and the scent of jasmine ground the scene effectively. The setting supports the mood well, though the description of the library smell as containing "something indefinable" is a minor lapse in specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "crystalline/obsidian" motif effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The sensory details ("frozen quartz," "molten copper") are specific and enhance the atmosphere, though they border on ornamental at times.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    The rooftop canals and the concept of the "giant's nap" provide a distinct, imaginative backdrop that anchors the fantasy. However, the setting primarily serves as a passive container for travel rather than an active force that resists the protagonist or complicates her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern orchard is a distinct, vivid environment that actively constrains the scene through the mechanics of light and the physical discomfort of the stone. The sensory details (phosphorescence, dripping stalactites) effectively mirror the protagonist's internal state without becoming generic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is consistent ("sapphire hush"), effectively anchoring the mood. However, the "pipe chases" and infrastructure remain abstract backdrops rather than tactile constraints that shape Maren's tactics or movement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    The nursery is not just a backdrop but an active participant; the mossy trellis and the linden leaf physically constrain the protagonist’s epiphany. Sensory details like the "bruises" of the clouds and the "wet earth" effectively mirror the internal physiological and emotional state, satisfying the high-band criteria for setting utility.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid, with strong sensory details like the "silver threads" of rain and the "black stone" causeway. The "water wars" backdrop is standard but effectively utilized to ground the scarcity. The atmosphere supports the tone well, though the phrase "wry defiance of entropy" regarding the ruins feels like authorial intrusion rather than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is active and vital, directly challenging the protagonist’s abilities (singing walls, unpredictable shadows). The sensory details are vivid ("weather of sound," "visible architecture") and the environment successfully functions as an antagonist that forces the character's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmospheric details like salt crystals and wet cobblestones effectively ground the scene; the ivory harbor serves as a distinct, mood-setting anchor that frames the return. The setting tangibly interacts with the archivist's tools.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting of the starlit train station is atmospheric and conceptually strong, but the description often leans into purple prose ("stars hung like holes punched through velvet"). The "mist" and "cobblestones" create a generic magical-realism vibe that lacks specific, tactile grounding in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrates well with the plot; the "bony finger" of the tower and the "salt winds" ground the fantastical elements effectively. The environment actively shapes the atmosphere, though it could more directly constrain the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "prismatic escondite" is established with some vivid imagery, but descriptions rely heavily on abstract visual summaries ("fractured light," "ribbons of color"). The setting functions primarily as a visual backdrop rather than a physical environment that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The juxtaposition of the funeral home’s "quiet industry of preservation" with the asylum seeker’s precarious existence is masterfully handled. The prep room setting actively constrains the interaction, providing solitude and a thematic counterweight to the chaos Darius flees. Specific details like the "humming lights" and the "deathly vitality" ground the scene vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests" and the "glowing restraint" of the lamp creating a vivid, specific atmosphere. These details anchor the scene effectively, though the environment remains largely decorative rather than offering constraints that pressure the protagonist's specific choices in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The container labyrinth is rendered with impressive, tactile specificity ("corrugated walls," "rusted skyscrapers") that successfully grounds the surreal premise. The setting acts as a genuine constraint on the character's movement and perception, reinforcing the theme of entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is rendered with specific, grounded sensory details like "salt and sawdust" that effectively anchor the magical elements. The atmosphere consistently mirrors the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating carnival setting is vivid and provides good texture ("gilded barges," "ferry dock," "creaked under the weight"), anchoring the story well. However, the environment serves largely as a backdrop for observation rather than a source of physical constraint or urgent interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "regolith" and "chemical developing chamber" effectively ground the sci-fi setting. However, the description occasionally leans on familiar lunar tropes, and the "dawning hush" is a standard atmospheric beat that doesn't deeply complicate the protagonist's physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The specific mechanism of water refraction provides a vivid, if scientifically soft, grounding for the scene. Atmospheric details of mist and the depot effectively establish a liminal mood, though the setting exerts little pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The outpost is vivid and integral; the condensation on the glass serves as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains Miriam's worldview and charges the final image. Capped at 8.8 per the global gate rules (Q2 &lt; 9.0).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is integral to the plot, with the ancient archway functioning as a specific tool ("tuning peg") rather than just a backdrop. Sensory details like the "moss worn to velvet" and the "buzz" in the boot soles create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that grounds the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmospheric details are vivid and immersive, effectively contrasting the "icy water" with the "luminescence" of the perfume. The sensory shift from drowning to breathing the scent-atmosphere is handled with strong, specific imagery that anchors the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "black reef," "iron railing," and "brass-woven screen" anchoring the scene physically. The sensory details effectively support the tone of quarantine and isolation. The environment actively constrains the character, serving as both a physical prison and a metaphorical confessional.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.4)
    The "luminous coffin" and "frost and ferment" offer exceptional sensory specificity that grounds the magical premise. The setting acts as both prison and crucible, exerting constant pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "dim purple twilight" and "broken glass" water create a vivid, mythic setting. The environment effectively grounds the fantasy elements, though the sensory focus remains largely visual and static rather than constraining the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "catacomb orchard" is a compelling, specific environment that grounds the narrative with vivid, paradoxical imagery (roots as veins, bones in soil). The setting effectively anchors the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the transformation of the Golden Pixel Arcade into a post office is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details (neon hum, popcorn smell). The atmosphere effectively grounds the "futuristic nostalgia" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "cobalt observatory" and "copper-stained windows" provide a vivid, atmospheric grounding that fits the tone well. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop; the specific environmental details do not constrain Elara's choices or force a tactical shift. The sensory details are rich but occasionally veer into ornamental static description.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth is atmospheric and specific, with sensory details like "crooked fingers" and "black water" grounding the scene. The setting actively participates in the narrative mechanics (window, spirits), effectively constraining and guiding the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "mist-clad atrium" creates a cohesive, atmospheric envelope that mirrors the protagonist's drugged, recovering state. The sensory details are specific and grounded, particularly the "brain coral" which functions as a tactile object-as-setting that reinforces the theme of calcified trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "sediment" fog and twisted orchards create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that grounds the magical realism. The sensory details regarding light and mist are specific and enhance the mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "sound wave garden" is a standout creation, offering specific, governing constraints (echoes, parabolas) that actively shape the protagonist's method and the story's resolution. Immersion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hollowfield is realized with vivid, specific details like the kale spiral and the "bleeding sunset" on the greenhouse. The atmosphere effectively blends the botanical with the bureaucratic, though the "insects fed on bureaucracy" leans slightly into heavy-handed allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "gargantuan shell" is a vivid, memorable container that frames the story effectively. However, the setting remains largely a backdrop for internal monologue rather than a source of dynamic constraints that force specific tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and central to the piece, with specific sensory details like "frozen breath" and "dendritic" fractures grounding the abstract concept. The environment effectively charges the mood, though the "Museum of extinct feelings" concept itself leans slightly toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and well-anchored, with the "braille written for the dead" providing a strong tactile image. The archive feels lived-in, though the "symphonies of truth" concept remains somewhat abstract and detached from concrete environmental constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is integral; the attic's skylight and dust motes are not just atmospheric but constitute the toolset for the protagonist's work. The "smell of vanilla and forgetting" is a bit abstract, but the physical constraints of the space shape the method and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric imagery is vivid ("crooked rivers," "fractured hush"), establishing a strong dream-like tone. However, the spatial mechanics of the "drifting terrace"—specifically how it moves and where it exists in relation to the coast—remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details ("cathedral breath," "copper-touched air") are vivid and effectively establish a "solarpunk" aquatic mood. However, the setting acts largely as scenery rather than a source of tactical constraint; the rising water is mentioned but does not physically impede his movement or force a specific, desperate interaction with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    The geode and crater glass are vivid, purpose-driven elements that ground the magic system. The opening paragraph suffers from modifier congestion ("iridescent," "giant," "fractured," "prismatic") but the setting effectively constrains the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "tidal arcade" and "star-scattered sand" effectively grounding the abstract theme of order versus chaos. Details like the billiard balls acting as "tiny moons" creates a cohesive atmosphere that mirrors Marek's internal logic. The environment actively frames the performance, though it falls short of forcing a hard tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting creates a cohesive atmospheric mood but relies on generic signifiers ("pale flowers," "distant mountains," "edge of everything"). The physical environment does not constrain the character's actions or force tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric grounding in the harbor is vivid and sensory, establishing a strong mood. However, the setting remains largely ornamental, serving as a backdrop for contemplation rather than a source of constraint or pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but leans on generic "literary trauma" imagery (blackened stumps, moonlit ridge). The "new saplings pushing through ash" seven years later is a functional if slightly cliché visual anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established ("tide-polished grotto"), but the descriptions rely on repeated adjectives ("smooth," "patient") rather than sensory specificity that constrains action. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for thematic reflection rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist's choices. The rising tide at the end is a missed opportunity for urgent constraint, treated instead as ambient background.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric detail is a strength, with vivid imagery of the "ivy-veiled passageways" and "morning frost." The setting effectively establishes a mood of gentle decay, though it functions more as a backdrop than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a cohesive atmosphere ("wet earth," "fracturing it into brief rainbows") that grounds the magical realism. However, the setting primarily serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure that forces Aria to adapt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is anchored effectively with sensory details ("grinding against stone," "amber light," "ebony clipboard") that ground the abstract political stakes. The "terrace" functions well as a stage for the interaction, though the celestial bodies border on ornamental framing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sterile, white expanse of the salt flat effectively mirrors the concept of a predator-free "sanctuary," grounding the abstract stakes. However, details like "synthetic warmth" feel generic compared to the specific imagery of the cracked riverbeds.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The visual imagery of the "crystalline structure" and "silver courtyard" is evocative, but the setting lacks tactile consequence; the cold does not bite, and the "no footprints" detail unmoors the character from physical reality. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than a constraining force.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome is the story's strongest element, vividly rendered with specific sensory details like "old bone" fiberglass and "strange acoustics" that amplify the theme of listening. The setting is actively integrated into the narrative ritual, acting as a "husk" that holds the words, though the "meteor hush" feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "gray pumice" and "suspended garden" acting as effective constraints on the action. The atmospheric details of moisture and wind directly pressure the protagonist’s choices. "Blushing stillness" reads as slightly purple and disconnected from the established visual palette of gray and green.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vividly rendered, with the cold and the aurora effectively creating a distinct atmosphere that pressures the character (numb fingers). The imagery ("silence pooled like water frozen mid-collapse") is specific and establishes a strong mood.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like the "copper scent," "vine-draped entrance," and "pulsing" concrete effectively ground the surreal premise in physical texture.

    The "soundless sanctuary" premise is immediately contradicted by audible dialogue ("Kael whispered," "You sound certain"), creating a fundamental breach in the setting's physical logic and credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, with the "ruined orchard" and "fog" providing a cohesive, textural backdrop. The specific sensory details of the workshop ground the magical premise effectively, though they function more as backdrop than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "orchard in the rafters" and rotting pears on marble provide strong sensory grounding. The environment effectively mirrors the theme of decay and persistence, functioning as a necessary constraint on the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, effectively contrasting the cosmic "humming" of the orchard with the sterile, "utilitarian" sanctuary of the bathroom. The sensory details—crystalline rows, singing radiation—ground the high-concept premise in a tangible physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is evocative and functional, with the "infinite shelves" and "shifting geography" creating a distinct, pressurized atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "emerald swatch card" acts as a brilliant micro-setting and tool, grounding the surreal premise in a tangible object that constrains the protagonist's focus. The atmospheric details of the "rotting planks" and "calliope's song" effectively establish the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details are specific and grounding, particularly the smell of oil and cedar and the tactile description of the rope. The environment effectively constrains the action, forcing the protagonist to physically engage with the mechanism (climbing the ladder, manipulating braids) to advance the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "harmonic caves" and "frozen pool" are rendered with high specificity, grounding the abstract concept of sound-based energy beings in tangible geology. The sensory details ("crack patterns," "vibrational currents") effectively constrain the character's method of interaction with the world.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with evocative sensory details like the "humming pavilion" and "amber" light creating a cohesive melancholic atmosphere.

The physical space actively contributes to the mood, though it offers little physical resistance to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "solidified fog" and "whispering crystals" providing a unique, tangible constraint for the theme. The specific mechanics of the environment (shadow angles, lightning) directly drive the protagonist's insight. The atmosphere is vivid and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details like "copper light," "creeping thyme," and the "smoothed mortar" grounding the fable-like tone. The setting actively pressures the mood (the "gravity" of the starless sky), and the pyrotechnic tools are described with tactile precision that enhances the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospherically competent but largely generic ("ancient grotto," "stars that shimmered"), serving as a passive backdrop for metaphors rather than providing tactile constraints that force specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "xenial trellis" and "inverted sky" create a vivid, surreal atmosphere. However, the spatial mechanics of clouds drifting *beneath* feet in an inverted gravity field (where down is up) are slightly disorienting in a way that doesn't fully cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustic properties of the "prism terrace" and the specific lighting conditions directly enable the resolution. The environment constrains the method (waiting for the echo), satisfying the high-band requirement for setting-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory details are vivid ("fossilized" paint, "kaleidoscopic waterfall"), creating a strong atmosphere. However, the description sometimes leans on abstract or "purple" modifiers ("crystallized light") that distance the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but lacks concrete grounding, operating as a "charcoal-colored white room" or mind-palace rather than a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific ("frozen stars," "crystallized apple trees"), effectively grounding the fantastical elements. However, the description occasionally becomes static, listing features rather than integrating them into urgent action or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting of the plantation-turned-archive is atmospheric and thematically grounded, with sensory details like "creaking floorboards" effectively supporting the mood, though the "carbon-copy" detail may be anachronistic for 1868 files.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "auric lagoon" and the concept of the city as a palimpsest are strong, atmospheric details that ground the setting. The contrast between the marble Ministry and the glowing, mineral-rich water creates a distinct visual identity. The setting actively hides the objective, functioning well as an obstacle/container.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The synthesis of sound, light, and water ("drip of dewdrops," "prism atrium") creates a distinct, atmospheric magic system that grounds the abstract action. The specific interaction between the saxophonist's breath and the fog is vivid, though descriptors like "ancient" and "radiant" occasionally lean toward generic fantasy norms.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "ashen skyborne arbor" creates a distinct, memorable visual anchor that grounds the fable-like tone. However, descriptions occasionally drift into cliché ("patience of stone," "precision of flowing water") rather than distinct sensory particulars. The setting effectively constrains the action to the workspace and vault.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sensory details in the greenhouse ("rusted to the color of dried blood," "mineral dampness") establish a solid atmosphere. However, the setting serves primarily as a backdrop for transit rather than a constraint that forces choices or charges a final image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The foundry setting is vivid and tactile, with details like "steady percussion" and "brass pans collecting rainwater" effectively grounding the mystical elements. The environment actively constraints the action, providing the tools (forge, gold) necessary for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The specific acoustic properties of Echo Gorge are well-integrated into the plot, functioning as a necessary component of the magic rather than just backdrop. Sensory details ("threads of amber light," "splitting into three") are vivid and purposeful. The setting actively constraints and enables the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "ultraviolet forest" is established with visceral, sensory specificity that enhances the mood of alienation. The description of colors "between what eyes were meant to see and what they could survive" effectively grounds the surreal setting in the protagonist's physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospherically rendered, with the rotating painting offering a specific, grounded mechanism that elevates the scene above generic fantasy tropes. The tactile description of the lens fragment helps anchor the more ethereal elements of the market.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details like the "sputtering" tubes and the "asymmetrical waves" of dust grounding the scene. The "glint of brass" and the fading posters effectively establish an atmosphere of neglected history. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, moving beyond backdrop to actively constrain the plot; the "glass orchard" and the physics of the "Negotiation" dictate the mechanics of the discovery and the release. The specific detail of the frost syntax and the "sweating" spines grounds the high-concept premise in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and functional; "visible time" pooling like honey and the mirror mechanics act as constraints that shape the protagonist's physical actions. The shard of vase serves as an excellent tactile anchor that grounds the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The resonance chamber is an evocative, sensory-rich environment that grounds the magical realism effectively. Specific details like the "impossible red" of the stone and the "wilting" rule create a strong atmosphere, though the setting serves more as a container than an active force pressuring the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary antagonist and objective; the shift from the industrial decay of the factory to the geological permanence of the lagoon drives the narrative logic. The sensory details—scent, temperature, and light—actively constrain the protagonist’s path and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory anchoring ("bruised twilight," "salt and sawdust") that grounds the abstract theme. The visual description of the lantern slide’s shifting historical layers is specific and effectively charges the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber pavilion and etched glass are vivid and integral to the narrative logic. However, descriptions often lean on adjective stacking ("warm, fragmented showers," "soft, umbral tenderness") which slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details like the "obsidian lagoon" and "amber gasbags" establish a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the surreal elements. However, the setting serves primarily as a backdrop for the mood rather than a source of constraints, resources, or physical pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is evocative, with specific details like "amber light" and "paper-lantern cove" anchoring the atmosphere effectively; the environment actively frames the memory work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting of the rooftop orchard atop a skyscraper is evocative and functionally specific, grounding the magical realism in concrete details like "gnarled apple trees" and "concrete."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting offers vivid, specific imagery ("crystal walls," "frosted dome") that establishes a clear atmosphere. However, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop; the cold is mentioned but immediately negated by the protagonist's competence, failing to constrain her choices or add urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "windblown sanctuary" and "granite outcropping" grounding the action in a vivid, specific atmosphere. The sensory details of the cold air, the worn hemp rope, and the rising humidity effectively mirror the building tension. The environment constrains the protagonist's focus and charges the final image of the siren rolling down the mountain.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is consistent and creates a distinct, quiet mood, though the setting details often lean into abstract metaphor ("hollow between celestial currents") rather than tactile grounding. Specific props like the "yellow lantern glass" help anchor the scene, but the environment rarely constrains the character’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strength, with vivid imagery like "skeletons of beekeeping equipment" and "pools of amber." The setting establishes a strong mood, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "emerald silo" and the "broken" temporal atmosphere are rendered with vivid, specific sensory details (green glass, hum, cream-colored shard). The setting effectively supports the surreal tone, though the equations on the glass lean slightly toward genre convention.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, sensory details like the "slick and dark" stones and "torn skeleton." While "cobalt lagoon" leans toward cliché, the specific imagery of the debris line effectively grounds the abstract themes in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "living stone pillars" and copper-wrapped oaks creating a specific, memorable solarpunk atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's work and successfully grounds the abstract themes in concrete, tactile imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric details like the "frozen river of stone" and "fly amber" provide strong visual anchors that ground the abstract reflection. The setting effectively mirrors the internal state, though the interaction remains largely observational rather than tactile or obstacle-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "bleached bone-white" reef and "bird calls" effectively ground the mythic tone. While the imagery is vivid, the prompt-required phrase "narrow vastness" sits awkwardly, feeling more like a forced insertion than an organic description of the jetty.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent, utilizing sensory details of the "scrapyard" and "twilight," though it relies on familiar post-apocalyptic tropes like the "bruised" sky. The environment functions largely as a backdrop rather than pressuring the protagonist's specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details, such as the "vibration of the containment fields." However, the environment serves primarily as a passive backdrop for reflection rather than constraining action or forcing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("churning violet sky," "ice-carved railing") that anchor the scene visually. However, elements like the "wrong sky" remain largely ornamental, setting a mood without strictly constraining the characters' choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "whispering gallery" is effectively utilized as both a physical space and the story's central archive concept. The acoustic details ("dome caught her footsteps," "fractured voices") ground the abstract premise. However, the setting provides a container for reflection rather than a source of constraint or danger in the current moment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmospheric imagery ("mountain's throat," "digestive tract") effectively grounds the fantastical setting. The environment feels distinct, though the "infinite library" concept is a familiar genre standard.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "amber of stopped time" and "frozen leaves that would never decompose" create a vivid, atmospheric setting that mirrors the protagonist's stasis. The sensory details are specific and grounded, though the "platinum labyrinth" feels like set dressing rather than an integrated part of the environment's geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, effectively establishing a mood of "forged hush" through specific sensory details like the "cold bone" and "canyon of whispers." The environment acts as a constraint and a tool (the echoes multiplying the truth), integrating well with the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    The acid sea and the dissolving workshop create vivid, high-pressure constraints. The statue functions effectively as a micro-setting, grounding the abstract memories in concrete tactile details that guide the protagonist's final actions.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal cave setting is established with sensory vividness ("tide-carved passages," "uncanny luminescence"). The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal isolation, though the "hidden oasis" leans slightly into generic fantasy imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    Atmospheric details like the "cobalt lighthouse" and "salt-worn granite" are vivid and ground the scene well. However, the premise of heat creating thermal currents that block a lighthouse beam strains suspension of disbelief without a firmer grounding in the story's internal logic or magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric details of the station and marsh are vivid, though often filtered through abstract metaphors ("currents of grief") rather than concrete interaction. The bronze censer foot serves as a solid grounding object, though the "geography of loss" framing distances the reader from the physical reality of the terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hanging orchard is a vividly realized environment, with specific details like "roots gripping stone" and "granite outcropping" effectively grounding the action. The setting mirrors the thematic focus on persistence amidst ruin, actively shaping the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with strong, specific imagery ("golden eye," "sleeping moon") that effectively anchors the mood. The "opal dock" provides a vivid, if slightly ornamental, stage for the action that aligns well with the atmospheric goals.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "blooming cavern" and the antique shop are rendered with vivid, atmospheric detail. The sensory specificity of the "wet stone" and "pale flowers" grounds the magical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    While atmospheric, the setting suffers from a confusing descriptive clash: the destination is called an "ember grotto" (implying red/heat) and then a "cobalt grotto" (blue) within two paragraphs without explaining the shift. This inconsistency disrupts spatial grounding despite vivid sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are frequent but ungrounded ("living geometry," "ember nexus"), creating an atmospheric wash that lacks specific spatial logic or constraints to pressure the characters. The setting acts as a backdrop for dialogue rather than an environment that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with tactile details like the "crusted sap" and the "frost-covered window" grounding the abstract concepts. The mountain cabin feels lived-in and specific, effectively mirroring the narrator's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The shop environment is rendered with pleasant sensory details (copper, pine, essential oils), effectively grounding the scene. However, the fog operates as a heavy-handed pathetic fallacy—pressing in when she is confused and lifting exactly when she understands—which feels mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric grounding is strong, with vivid sensory details like the "gray wall" and "ozone." However, the "tea ceremony" aspect of the setting acts merely as a label; the ritual space does not constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting details—the waking chainsaws, the violet glass, and the archive of unfinished music—are masterfully integrated to charge the final image. The orchard’s destruction parallels the necessary "pruning" of the relationship, allowing the environment to function as a thematic amplifier rather than just a backdrop. Specific sensory anchors like the "first chainsaw cough" effectively ground the ethereal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting of the Archive is vivid and atmospheric, effectively establishing a mythic tone ("stones that predated light"). However, the description remains static and does not yet constrain character choice or generate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the mechanical ("brass tubes") with the elemental ("glacier," "razor horizon") to create a distinct atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's focus and shapes the tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bioluminescent setting is vivid and specifically informs the atmosphere ("light revealed connections invisible to ordinary sight") and character interaction ("fungal colonies responded to... vibrations"). The physical environment grounds the piece effectively, though it is sometimes subsumed by abstract geometric interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmospheric details in the library ("wet stone," "amber quiet") and the hospital ("fluorescent hum") are vivid and ground the scene well. The sensory contrast between the "honest" candle light and the electric lights effectively supports the central metaphor. The specific imagery of the subway scrawls adds a nice tactile layer to the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    The subway tunnel and the specific sensory details ("electric dusk," "copper arteries") are excellent, grounding the abstract theme. The glass harmonica disc acts as a potent micro-setting that constrains the mood and triggers the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospherically rendered with sensory details ("sea lavender," "purple light"), but it functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a constraint. The environment mirrors the character's mood (pathetic fallacy) rather than forcing specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting of the "crumbling platform" and "shattered station roof" creates a strong, melancholic atmosphere that supports the theme of brokenness and healing. Specific details like the "shimmering ivy" and "fragment of moon rock" ground the scene effectively. However, the description of the station as a "liminal space" is an explicit label that tells the reader how to feel rather than letting the atmosphere do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "ultrasonic forest" is realized with vivid, high-density sensory details that establish a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting remains somewhat abstract ("valleys of ancient sorrow") rather than providing concrete physical constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, using sensory precision ("amber light," "universe breathe") to ground abstract signal processing in a tangible atmosphere. The gravitational anomaly effectively creates a "bent" reality that mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the "origami" metaphor borders on ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "luminous harbor" is established with vivid, sensory details ("shattered silver," "waves against wooden docks") that ground the ethereal tone. The setting actively supports the climax, providing the necessary isolation and atmosphere for the silent exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("ancient smoke," "marble halls") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than constraining action. Sensory details are sparse and lack the specificity needed to ground the reader in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "sound wave garden" is vivid and functionally integrated, with specific sensory rules (moss pulsing, orchids chiming) that constrain the protagonist's actions. The synesthetic environment effectively grounds the ethereal premise and shapes the method of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent—tactile, specific, and functionally constraining (acoustics, materials, geography). The environment actively shapes the protagonist's tactics and the plot's possibilities, bordering on 9-band integration but held back slightly by the summary nature of the maze navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The specific use of the dental mirror and warehouse shutters to create patterns effectively constrains the protagonist's method, grounding the scene. However, setting descriptions often drift into abstraction ("frequency of unspoken longing") rather than sticking to concrete sensory details that enforce the reality of the dock.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.5)
    Descriptions are lyrical ("cobalt library," "magnetic grotto") but float in a vacuum, lacking spatial specificity or interaction with the character's immediate choices. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint or resource in a dramatized moment. The window displays offer the only concrete visual grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details regarding the scrimshaw ("warmed by her skin") and the dock are tactile and grounding. However, phrasing like "violet hour" borders on cliché, and the "re-education ships" remain a vague backdrop that doesn't fully inhabit the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is well-integrated, with the "hum" of the turbines and the omnipresent speakers acting as active constraints on the character's behavior. The sensory details of the pine and dried flowers effectively ground the abstract emotional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid, specific imagery ("cobalt light," "fractured glass") that grounds the abstract concept. The setting actively interacts with the character (humming columns), though the description is occasionally static.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glassblower's courtyard is rendered with specific, tactile details (shards, furnace, leaves) that ground the action. The environment actively supplies the materials for the protagonist’s method, integrating setting well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is evocative and specific, anchoring the abstract concepts in sensory reality (the "humming" walls, the "amber glow"). The environment of the laboratory feels distinct and lived-in, successfully establishing the post-catastrophe atmosphere without heavy-handed exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, establishing a "timeless observatory" effectively. However, the descriptions lean into abstract "white room" territory with phrases like "gossamer barriers" and "curtains of intention," lacking the gritty, tactile specificity that would ground the high-concept elements in a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "rain-beaded skylight" and "onyx-ink cards" creates a tactile, cohesive atmosphere that supports the story's mood. The interplay of light, rain, and the worn tools effectively grounds the speculative elements in a lived-in reality, though the focus remains largely visual.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "bronze prism pagoda" and "fractured shadows" creating a vivid, specific atmosphere. The physical manifestation of nostalgia as "luminescent dust motes" grounds the abstract concept effectively in the environment. The sensory details of light and twilight are handled well, though the "hollow shell" simile is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the piece's strongest asset, with the "blooming library" and "suspended dream-frames" creating a vivid, distinct environment. The physical grounding of the ether and the contrast with the river stone effectively support the central thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric details ("scattered salt on black velvet") effectively mirror Mara's quiet turmoil. The tail tip functions as an excellent micro-setting, constraining her attention and grounding the abstract betrayal in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, particularly the "coffee rings" and the "roots stirring." The physical constraints of the tower and tunnel effectively pressure the protagonist's movement, grounding the magical elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting of the projection booth is atmospheric and sensory, with details like "rotting seats" and "shattered glass" grounding the scene well. The physical space effectively mirrors the internal theme of decay and preservation, though some descriptions tilt toward abstract "emotional architectures" over concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies on "postcard" descriptions ("violet fire," "aurora-scented air") that feel decorative rather than constraining. While the setting provides the visual trigger for the ending, it lacks the gritty specificity that would force unique tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmospheric details ("glass plains," "fungal forests") establish a vivid post-apocalyptic tone, though some descriptions verge on tautology ("bioluminescent... phosphorescence"). The setting frames the journey but does not actively constrain the protagonist's tactical choices during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "mechanical rainforest" offers vivid, imaginative imagery (silicon bark, singing tin leaves) that anchors the surrealism. However, the setting functions primarily as a psychological mirror ("manifestation of his own consciousness") rather than a physical environment that imposes constraints or resistance on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are often replaced by abstract metaphors ("bridges of intention," "cotton and shadow") that obscure the physical reality of the scene. The environment fails to constrain the character's choices in a tangible way, serving only as a backdrop for internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is visceral and constraining; the "cobalt fortress" and the "six feet of snow" mirror the protagonist's frozen internal state. The physical sensation of nerve regeneration effectively functions as a micro-setting, filtering every perception through pain and renewal. The environment actively charges the final image of snow as notes in a symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmospheric description of the "graceful collapse" and "organic curves" is vivid and establishes a strong, cohesive mood. However, the setting serves as a backdrop for summary rather than a constraint that forces immediate tactical shifts or physical interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The station is established with tangible constraints ("cables thick as a ship's mooring rope") that anchor the speculative elements effectively. The contrast between the bone-white memory of the reef and the dark, cold reality of the new growth creates a vivid atmospheric tension. The sensory details of the tapping provide a specific, tactile grounding to the technical work.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    The juxtaposition of the rusted spaceport and the ancient stone circle creates a vivid, atmospheric backdrop ("toes curling against the cold metal"). However, the setting functions primarily as scenery; it does not impose physical constraints or obstacles that force the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sensory details of the greenhouse and volcanic aftermath ("ash and pumice," "mineral-rich steam") are vivid and specifically grounded. The setting effectively constrains the action, as the greenhouse acts as the interface for Yara’s ability, though the kite’s convenient entry via the broken window undermines the spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, with the "salt-crusted" greenhouse and "wind-scoured promontory" actively constraining and mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The physical environment acts as a crucible for the healing process, charging the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse setting is atmospheric and responsive, with walls that "breathe" and contract effectively mirroring Mira’s psychological state. The sensory details—salt, time, floating books—establish a strong, surreal mood that grounds the abstract conflict. However, the specific geography of the spiral stairs and the descent feels slightly convenient, appearing only when the plot requires a transition.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmosphere of the ruins is established with some competence, but the description relies on repeated tags like "wind-carved" rather than fresh sensory detail. The setting serves the mood well but feels slightly generic ("ancient silence," "ruins") until the specific, surreal interaction with the living ink provides a necessary anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric, with vivid details like the "crystalline interface" and "stones dropped into a frozen well." However, the "cryogenically strengthened hands" is an isolated detail that feels slightly inserted. The "pocket of silence" effectively frames the isolation, though the description leans toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The "glass dome," "desert roses," and "ballast sandbag" provide tangible, textural grounding that elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is active and antagonistic, directly constraining the protagonist's choices (forcing silence and zigzag movement) to survive and succeed. The sensory details ("wet paper," "visible vibrations") are vivid and integral to the plot logic. The environment dissolves at the end, emphasizing the permanence of the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory setting is masterfully integrated, serving as both a physical location and a metaphor for Eleanor’s detached but acute oversight. Sensory details like the "smell of cedar," the "cool" rosewood, and the clouds like "gray whales" ground the abstract logic puzzle in a vivid, tactile reality that mirrors her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting offers vivid, atmospheric imagery, such as "constellation tattoos catching the amber light," establishing a strong, dreamlike tone appropriate for the genre. However, the environment feels somewhat fluid and convenient, functioning more as a backdrop for the protagonist's success than as a tangible space that constrains her actions or forces adaptation. The "time folding" aspect is asserted conceptually but lacks concrete spatial manifestation until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustics of the grotto and the "pale curtains" of mist actively constrain the protagonist's experience. The environment feels tangible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "shattered sky" and "skeletal buildings" creating a tangible, pressure-filled atmosphere. The mosaic tessera serves as an excellent micro-setting element that constrains focus and anchors the magical realism of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific sensory details, particularly through the synesthetic filter ("tasted violets," "rust and rain"). While the "curious emporium" is a familiar trope, the orchard and the sensory texture ground it well in the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    The light painting studio provides vivid visual texture with the RGB LEDs and geode, creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting remains strictly atmospheric rather than functional; it doesn't constrain Mira's movements, force trade-offs, or shape her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.7)
    The sensory details of the bioluminescent cave and the "heat-mapping" of emotional residue are vivid and specific, grounding the speculative elements well. The environment successfully serves as the primary interface for the protagonist’s ability, though the "crystallized emotions" occasionally veer into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "amber warehouse" provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop with specific details like the "honeyed glow." However, the setting remains largely static and does not exert pressure or constrain the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    The setting is atmospheric, and the specific use of snow for the code signals is a strong, integrated detail. However, descriptions occasionally drift into standard genre clichés ("mist wrapped around her like a shroud") rather than fresh sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmospheric description ("knuckles through the mist") effectively establishes a mood of spindrift serenity. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint; the fog and river do not force a specific tactical choice or error.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric descriptions like "flattening smoke" and "shades of old porcelain" are vivid but operate as a backdrop rather than a constraint. The setting is visually distinct but does not force the character to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "luminous harbor" and "worn rungs" effectively establish a quiet mood, though the setting acts primarily as a backdrop for the theme rather than a source of constraint. The physical space is visualized clearly, but it does not exert pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "tidal library above the clouds" is a vivid, memorable conceit that grounds the ethereal tone effectively. Sensory details like the saltless water and swirling ink create a strong atmosphere, though the "atomic reflective surface" descriptor jars slightly against the ancient, organic texture of the rest of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "lotus temple" and the post-storm atmosphere effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The physical details of the thrush's nest anchor the abstract themes, charging the final image with specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting of the university radio station is grounded with specific details like the "dusty holder" and "ancient equipment," which effectively contrast with the cosmic stakes. The atmosphere supports the plot well, though the transition from mundane to magical is somewhat expository.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    Descriptions like "impossible geometry" and "walls pressing closer" are abstract tells rather than concrete sensory details that constrain movement. The setting provides atmosphere but fails to act as a physical antagonist that necessitates specific navigational choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and causally active; the fog and the "hollowed-out crater" mirror the protagonist's internal work and the theme of lost memory. Specific sensory details like the "stiffened silk" and "stone faces" ground the abstract psychic process in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Specific details like the "ink-stained fingers," "verdigris," and "waterlogged journals" ground the setting well. However, the basement and station are presented more through description than interaction, limiting the atmospheric impact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid and establishes a strong, moody atmosphere ("copper light," "orange mesh," "iridescent"). The setting details, particularly the scaffold netting, integrate well with the magical realism elements to create a distinct visual map. The imagery grounds the abstract concepts effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is excellent; the circus train is not just a backdrop but an active tool in the argument ("iron skin," "ecosystem"). The specific details of the cars meaningfully ground the abstract business discussion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory atmosphere is vivid and specific, but the physical logic of the daylily (retaining "golden residue" to stain paper three years after plucking) breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "swirling orchard vortex" and "petrified apple trees" create a vivid, distinct atmosphere that grounds the magic effectively. The sensory details of the ice cracking and the light refracting provide strong texture, though the "magic trick" terminology clashes slightly with the high-fantasy setting.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "cobalt glade" and "violet earth" provide a consistent, vivid palette that anchors the surreal tone. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, particularly the "roots snaking between ancient bones" imagery. The environment actively supports the theme of life-death integration, though "impossible garden" is a slightly generic descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quarry setting mirrors the thematic concern of "echoes" without being overbearing, and the sensory details of the trailer and the grille cloth (smoke, heat) are vivid. The environment effectively isolates the protagonist, heightening the stakes of the intrusion via the phone.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "magnetic arbor" providing a strong, specific anchor for the surreal elements. The sensory details ("spine of silver and amber") effectively ground the abstract concepts of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and cohesive, effectively grounding the "tidal atrium" with specific textures like brass, salt water, and wintersun light. The setting is the strongest element, though it functions more as a backdrop for mood than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the contrast between the rusted concrete bunker and the luminescent crystal cave is vivid and meaningful. The environment actively charges the final image of the pearl's light.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integrated; the "disused platform" and "green veins" of ivy mirror the protagonist's state effectively. The station serves as a necessary container for the mood, grounding the abstract internal conflict in concrete decay.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on standard magical tropes (glowing mist, humming volumes, towering shelves) without specific, grounding details. The "braille made for dreaming" is a strong image, but the environment generally functions as a generic "white room" for the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "velvet observatory" and the "transparent violin" are vivid, specific anchors that ground the magical realism. The sensory details of the midsummer light and the wisteria effectively charge the atmosphere, making the setting an active participant in the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto and aurora are described with vivid, if slightly generic, fantasy imagery. However, the setting serves primarily as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than an environment that constrains Mira’s choices or forces tactical adaptations.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is visually distinct ("succulents," "stone arches"), but functions largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures the protagonist's choices. The phrase "vineyard hush" clashes slightly with the established "cloud/grotto" imagery, creating a mild atmospheric inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "wind chime language" and "hollow mirror" offer specific, memorable details that ground the fantasy. However, the "dawn on a cliff" setting leans heavily on atmospheric tropes without constraining the character's physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "floating rock" and "pond caught the starlight" effectively ground the metaphysical stakes. However, some descriptors lean into abstraction ("smooth as worry") that slightly blurs the physical reality of the objects.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "tower of bone" and "canyon of endless echoes" provide a vivid, surreal backdrop that effectively establishes a mythic atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely a backdrop for meditation rather than a source of immediate tactical constraint or pressure that forces a specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful, effectively contrasting the sterile, "crystalline" automation of the spire with the tactile warmth of the keystone. Sensory details like the "clicking" drone and the "ghostly glow" anchor the atmosphere well, though the transition to the garden relies on somewhat generic geometric descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "amber and rose" atmosphere is vivid, the setting's physical impossibility (readable books in a sunken ship) undermines immersion. The description relies on poetic abstraction rather than the concrete, sensory grounding required for this environment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of the "contracted cosmos" and the "ambered deck" is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong backdrop. The sensory details ("honeyed gold," "static") effectively establish the mood, though the environment does not physically constrain Kira's choices in a dramatized way.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting provides atmospheric lighting ("violet and gold," "amber light") but functions primarily as a mood board rather than a constraint on action. The "ruined observatory" imagery is standard for the genre and does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is excellently integrated; the viaduct is not just a backdrop but the source of the magical solution (dripping water). The sensory details of the bridge and the dew directly constrain and guide the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "cracked spine of asphalt" and foundations emerging "like tombstones" effectively evoke the uncanny setting. However, the initial temporal confusion ("midnight" vs. "twilight") and abstract descriptors ("precisely humane") prevent full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting relies on generic high-fantasy signifiers ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "crystalline waters") rather than specific, grounded detail. Descriptions often default to the ineffable ("impossible hues," "colors that had no names"), which evades the work of concrete imagery and fails to constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "noctilucent observatory" and "arbor" create a vivid, distinct atmosphere that reinforces the narrator's isolation. These specific details ground the speculative elements effectively, though the storm description is somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "floating rock dojo" with leaves falling upward is a vivid, distinct image that effectively grounds the surreal premise in a specific atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely static and backdrop-focused; apart from the "upward" leaves, the environment does not actively pressure the protagonist's choices or provide tactical constraints during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Atmospheric details like the "moonlight fracture" and the imagined "scent of rotting flesh" are vivid and effectively set the mood. However, the setting lacks immediate constriction; the brook and porch serve more as a backdrop for reflection than as an environment that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.4)
    The atmosphere of dusty grief is consistent, but the setting relies heavily on the repeated label "echo chamber tunnel" rather than specific, sensory grounding. While the auditory details of the machine are vivid, the "household" remains a generic backdrop of shadows and empty hallways. The environment does not constrain the character's choices; it merely serves as a passive container for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric description is vivid ("honey through gauze," "interlocking angles"), establishing a strong mood. However, the setting suffers from "white room" syndrome, where the mist and garden serve as abstract backdrops rather than concrete environments that constrain action. The sensory details are often metaphorical rather than grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sensory details are vivid ("violet twilight," "twisted metal"), and the "frozen bloom" metaphor effectively grounds the atmosphere and links the setting to the thematic turn. The setting actively frames the protagonist's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of the radio tower city is evocative and anchors the scene well, particularly the "swaying" hut. However, some elements rely on standard post-apocalyptic tropes, and the "hollywood star fragment" (uncapitalized in text) feels like an inserted prompt object rather than a natural part of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "spectral grotto" and "ghostlight" effectively establish a weird-lit mood. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraints; the "impossible geography" provides flavor but rarely forces specific tactical choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is active and distinct, acting almost as a secondary character that responds to the protagonist's actions (mirrors lagging, then anticipating). The sensory details ("sinew thread... strangely warm," "fractured light") effectively establish the liminal atmosphere required by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The benthic environment is rendered with strong, specific sensory details, particularly the "bioluminescent haze" and the behavior of light underwater. The anchor link provides excellent tactile grounding, effectively bridging the grandmother's history with the sci-fi setting.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "mist-clad atrium" and "mercury" glass establish a strong, consistent noir-fantasy atmosphere. However, the spatial geography (observation room vs. atrium vs. outside) becomes murky during the climax, and the description relies partly on adjectival stacking ("impossible lightness") rather than distinct, hard details.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "green-dark water" and "glinting copper bones" effectively pressure the protagonist. The setting actively constrains the character via the tidal window and the physical nature of the submerged corridors.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional; the "opal observatory" and "soft white equations" of snow actively charge the narrative's mood and final image. The environment constrains the protagonist's isolation and provides the specific medium (twilight, silence) necessary for the resolution, meeting the high-band criteria for integration.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot mechanics; the acoustic properties of the bone towers and echo tunnel actively shape the protagonist's method. The sensory details—clicking stones, humming vowels—vividly ground the conceptual premise in a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The underground garden is vividly imagined with strong sensory details like bioluminescent moss and floating soil. However, the phrasing "gravity had always been gravitationally playful" is a tautological stumble that disrupts immersion. The atmospheric descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("air tasted of frost and possibility"), but the setting effectively grounds the surreal events.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strongest asset, with vivid specificity in the "wood-and-hollowed-steel" violin and the "smelled of honey and forgotten storms." The industrial city and the contrasting orchard are rendered with sensory richness that grounds the mythic tone. However, the setting operates largely as scenery rather than a source of tactical constraints; the environment cooperates with the protagonist rather than pressuring her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "cobalt arcade" is a vivid, constraining micro-setting that grounds the abstract border conflict in specific sensory details (tinted glass, claw machines). This specificity effectively anchors the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The abandoned circus train offers a strong, specific atmosphere, though the transition to the "hidden oasis" feels disjointed. The sensory details are vivid but occasionally veer into abstraction ("misting hush") rather than grounding the reader in the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospherically described ("scent of ocean salt," "curved spaces"), though it relies on familiar tropes of impossible geometry. While vivid, the environment facilitates the solution rather than constraining choices or creating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details ("stone corridors," "sea caves," "puddle of sunrise") effectively establish a dreamlike mood suitable for a fable. However, the setting rarely constrains the protagonist's choices; it serves more as a backdrop for the mood than a physical space Mira must navigate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is cohesive and fable-like ("saturated with unspoken things"), though description leans toward abstract mood rather than concrete environmental constraints that force specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the sunken greenhouse and "splintered fingers" of masts creating a specific, constraint-rich environment. The physical reality of the marsh effectively grounds the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "shadow caught in glass" is a compelling, specific image that anchors the magical realism and pays off at the end. However, the broader setting relies on generic cues ("forgotten library," "dust motes") that lack distinct texture, functioning more as a stage set for philosophy than a pressuring physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on generic high-fantasy tropes ("liquid silver," "place where dragons had once dreamed") rather than specific, grounding details. The environment serves as a backdrop for the mood but does not constrain the character's choices or provide tactical resources that shape the action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.0)
    The optics of starlight casting rainbows breaks physical verisimilitude in a story grounded in light mechanics; the "accumulated silence" is atmospheric but the physics lapse distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "rain-scoured" vault is a vivid, atmospheric micro-setting that effectively grounds the abstract theme. While the logistics of setting up a projector in a damp, 30-foot shaft feel slightly convenient, the sensory details of the frescoes ("running like tears") support the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    The concept of the *Montserrat* as a sunken library is evocative ("suspended thoughts") and grounds the story in a vivid, unique texture. However, the physics-defying snow globe disrupts the otherwise grounded, technical atmosphere of the deep-sea exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, blending "crushed cloudberries" and "phosphorescent salts" with the "flower press bolt plate" to ground the liminal setting. The specific props successfully anchor the ethereal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory details like the fracturing sunlight and brass fittings effectively ground the scene in a specific atmosphere. The vertical movement is well-integrated with the internal revelation, using the setting to mirror the rising enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the gondola and brass telescope are specific, tactile anchors that ground the abstract internal work. The "groaning" gondola and "warm" brass create a vivid physical constraint, though some descriptions ("held breath") lean slightly into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "dry knowledge" and "rings of growth" create a distinct, textured atmosphere that effectively grounds the fantastical library in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmospheric details are specific and immersive, with the "stranded luminance" and "brass porthole" grounding the fantastical elements effectively. The setting feels lived-in and directly serves the observational nature of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "frozen library above clouds" is established with vivid, atmospheric imagery ("dust motes hung suspended like frozen thoughts"). However, the recurrent "driftwood" imagery—while meeting a prompt requirement—clashes logically with the high-altitude ice setting, creating a mixed metaphor of beach-weathering and freezing. The setting effectively frames the ritual but does not deeply constrain the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The visual concept is strong ("floating rock arches," "silver-leafed canopy"), providing a lush backdrop. However, the setting functions as scenery for a summary rather than a tangible environment that constrains immediate physical choices in a dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("air itself seemed to hold its breath") rather than tactile constraints that pressure the character. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong atmosphere; the "orchard clung to the cliffside like a wound" is a vivid opening anchor. The contrast between the gnarled natural elements and the brass mechanical birds creates a distinct, cohesive setting that grounds the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The braided ravine and the specific foam patterns ("spirals within spirals") are vivid and purposeful, serving as an effective micro-setting for the protagonist's epiphany. The physical details of the river successfully mirror the internal thematic work of separation and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid, imaginative, and strictly anchored, providing a strong atmospheric container for the concept. While beautiful, the environment is static and low-pressure, functioning more as a gallery than a force that constrains the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, with the "ice formed coral branches" and "liquid moonlight" creating a strong surreal atmosphere that grounds the magic system. The juxtaposition of the desert heat and the frozen interior is effective. While the logistics of cooking (fire, ingredients) in this frozen abstraction are elided, the sensory details of the pavilion itself successfully carry the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific, grounding the fable-like premise in tangible details like the "1923 regulator springs" and the "Ukrainian handkerchief." The atmosphere of the grain elevators and clock tower effectively mirrors the thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with some evocative sensory details ("intervals of silver and shadow"), providing a functional backdrop. However, the environment remains static and does not constrain the protagonist's choices or provide obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sensory inversion of gravity—mist falling upward, the "held breath" sound—is vivid and atmospheric, anchoring the reader well. The setting actively creates the conditions for the protagonist's success, though the "stone warmth" response feels slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The specific blend of industrial detritus (the porcelain insulator) and nature (the alder grove) creates a vivid, tangible atmosphere. The object functions effectively as a micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's focus. The "silence" is established well as a sensory baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is atmospheric, with effective sensory details like "copper light" and humming stones. However, the "magnetic" aspect feels largely metaphorical and doesn't forcefully constrain the character's physical actions beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sensory details of the workshop—frosted glass, tarnished silver, the hum of silence—are vivid and effectively ground the magical realism. The atmosphere of anticipation is palpable, though the specific "static like snow on a dead television" is a strong, if slightly familiar, image that anchors the abstract concept.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details like "ghost of elderflower sap" and "rain-washed bark" effectively ground the opening. However, the setting's potential to constrain action is limited to the flower's smell, and phrases like "turning of the tide's thought" feel abstract and unmoored from the physical geography.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong, vivid imagery drives the piece; the gravity inversion and "floating rock arches" are visualized with specific, imaginative detail. The setting effectively dictates the physics of the scene, though "crystalline question marks" strains for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is the story’s true antagonist and catalyst; the "labyrinth of shipping containers" dictates movement and provides the forensic evidence. The sensory details—wind tunnels, groaning metal, rust—are woven tightly into the action, constraining the protagonist's path and charging the final image with atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The synesthetic descriptions create a vivid, distinct atmosphere that fits the mythic tone. However, the setting functions as a cooperative backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Thunder-echo range is a vividly realized setting that integrates well with the theme of listening and continuity. The concept of echoes cascading for minutes provides a strong atmospheric container for the protagonist's silent vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and effectively anchors the surreal premise; the "topaz workshop" and "amber light" create a cohesive, dreamlike atmosphere. These sensory details successfully ground the abstract concepts, providing a tangible constraint for the character's work.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the ridgeway, frost, and aurora creating a tangible, atmospheric crucible for the encounter. The sensory details ("needles dusted with frost," "iridescent membrane") effectively ground the supernatural elements in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The juxtaposition of the quartz arbor and the abandoned car creates a distinct, memorable visual anchor. However, the description often leans into heavy abstraction ("cathedral of crystallized whispers") rather than concrete grounding. The sensory details of cold and moss are effective, but the setting feels more like a stage for metaphors than a physical space with rules.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and lyrical but relies heavily on abstractions ("hush of time's unraveling," "geometry and grief") rather than grounded sensory details. While the "37 jigsaw puzzle edges" offer specific texture, the orchard itself feels like a stage set for the ritual rather than a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thrennis is vividly realized, with the vertical contrast between the floating arches, the ruined surface, and the deep roots effectively grounding the narrative logic. The setting details are purposeful and visually evocative, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, effectively blending the physical ("cold metal walls") with the abstract ("grief embedded in a corridor"). The sensory details are filtered strictly through Kira's unique professional lens, grounding the speculative elements.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with atmospheric cues like "fog bank" and "spiral stairs," but relies too heavily on abstract adjectives ("ghost of the great lamp's heat") rather than concrete constraints. The environment feels like a generic backdrop for the fable rather than a specific, resistant physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere and sensory details are vivid and establish a strong mythic tone ("green fire," "captured starlight"). The setting is immersive, though it serves more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details are vivid ("cobalt and violet," "morning light crawl"), establishing a strong atmospheric tone. However, the "floating rock" element remains purely ornamental backdrop, failing to constrain the character's movement, physics, or choices in any meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting specificity is the piece's greatest strength; the "silver light," the "rivers into the mortar," and the "trees standing at the edge of confusion" create a vivid, tactile world. The environment actively shapes the mood and the warden's method. A highly effective use of atmosphere to carry a low-plot narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, particularly the "mica windows" which function both atmospherically and mechanically in the climax. The transition from the "ghostly phosphorescence" of the dark greenhouse to the refractive dawn is handled with strong sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "Philosophy of Errors" section effectively grounding the internal epiphany. The sensory details ("amber glow," "leather spines") establish a consistent, if somewhat familiar, mood.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like the jasmine and carved beams are vivid, but the world logic is inconsistent (modern terms like "guerrilla gardening" clash with the timeless "palace"). The setting provides atmosphere but fails to constrain the protagonist's choices or force material trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "quartz hush" and "crystalline silence" create a vivid, cohesive atmospheric distinctness that grounds the abstract concept of frozen vows. The environment actively constrains the character's movement (must be silent), effectively integrating the setting with the action.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with specific sensory details like "rotting pier" and "smell of salt and kerosene" effectively grounding the surreal elements and constraining the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("lavender bluff," "bioluminescence"), establishing a strong mood. However, distinct elements like the voting forests remain ornamental backdrop; they do not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert pressure on the central negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details like "mineral rain" successfully ground the scene, though the description occasionally drifts into ornamental purple prose ("womb of crystallized light"). The setting serves as a vivid backdrop but acts more as a container for the mood than a source of physical or tactical pressure on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details are vivid and establish a distinct, melancholic mood; the "zinc plate" and "amber sky" create a strong tactile and visual palette. The environment feels lived-in, particularly the detail of children carving tunnels, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistently realized ("garden of sounding metal," "blue as preserved midnight"). However, the environment acts primarily as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint that forces character choices. The sensory details are vivid but often decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmospheric and vivid, specifically the "humming glass" and "ribbons of disrupted field" which ground the surreal premise. The setting effectively pressures the protagonist, though the spatial reference to Saturn works only as poetry, not geography.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting is described with competent sensory detail ("worn stone tiles," "fresh scratches"), but remains decorative. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details of the "black water" and "rusted stalactites" effectively ground the scene in a submerged, decaying tech-noir reality. The sensory environment successfully integrates with the character's movement, creating a distinct "underwater dance" aesthetic. However, the physical constraints of the setting are mitigated by the protagonist's "ease," reducing the potential for environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details—the whale releasing salt, the crystalline chamber—are vivid and establish a strong, surreal mood. However, the reliance on adjectival strings ("unnatural sheen," "gleaming silence") occasionally drifts into purple prose. The setting is the strongest element, providing a distinct, if static, backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the brook and origami wing serving as effective anchors for the ritual. The sensory details ("ghost-motes," "water whispered") establish a strong, albeit slightly stylized, mood.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary language of the story; the "syntax of sagging beams" and "groaning pipes" actively shape Elena’s understanding of her tutor. The environment participates in the climax—buildings "leaning inward" and "exhaling"—charging the final image with immense atmospheric pressure. Specific details like the "circular impression of a desk seal" anchor the magical elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity, using the "velvet garden" and "trailing jasmine" to create a vivid, atmospheric container for the scene. The transition from twilight to morning light effectively anchors the passage of time and mirrors the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "marble sanctuary" and "pearl twilight" create a cohesive, ethereal atmosphere, though the presence of stalactites in a built cathedral is spatially confusing. The setting serves as a vivid backdrop but does not actively constrain the protagonist’s choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic mythic signifiers ("vast expanse," "ancient text") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character's options. While the auditory focus fits the premise, the environment functions as a static backdrop for internal monologue rather than an active pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric description is vivid but operates as a static backdrop; the setting does not constrain action or force tactical shifts. The physical logic of a melting snow globe in a freezing glacier is poetic but decorative, lacking causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vividly realized, using sensory details like the "silver stitching" of moon paths and the "cool and patient" stone to ground the abstraction. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the imagery occasionally verges on the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively juxtaposing the "skeletal remains" with the "living canopy" to enforce the central theme. The physical constraints of the dust storms and the radiation mapping on the keeper's skin ground the abstract concepts in concrete reality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the cobalt glass portico and the "obsidian sky" providing specific, atmospheric constraints that ground the mystical elements. Sensory details like "dying wasps" and "grey ocean catching fire" effectively establish the mood, though the focus remains heavily visual. The environment actively pressures the character (knocking out generators), integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like the "hollow knock of crab claws" and the "feral loft." The atmosphere effectively grounds the fable-like tone, though the sensory details sometimes exist for their own sake rather than driving the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid, specific sensory details like the "bruising sky" and "molten gold" painting a clear picture. The setting actively pressures the protagonist through the dropping temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting details are vivid and specific, with the "basalt sanctuary" and "frozen lake" grounding the fantasy elements effectively. The environment successfully constrains the protagonist's method (needing ice for moon paths). However, some descriptions veer into ornamental prose ("ribs of some ancient beast from an era before names") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is rendered with tactile specificity, using the "watermark line" and "rusted ladder" to effectively ground the post-drought atmosphere. The environment exerts consistent physical pressure, though the transition to the supernatural element unmoors the established reality of the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "fluorescent corridors" and "golden shafts" of light effectively contrast the two worlds Thomas inhabits. While evocative, the lighting imagery borders on standard "antique shop" tropes rather than highly specific, lived-in observation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "acid sea" and "cathedral of motion" are integrated into the character's physical existence (wooden ribs, brass fittings). The environment genuinely constrains the character (pressure differentials, dissolving iron), grounding the metaphysical quest in concrete, dangerous physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details of the server farm "humming with the echo of forgotten songs" effectively ground the story in a melancholic, digital tone. Specific anchors like the Prometheus patch and the recurring "47" provide necessary texture, though the environment feels static rather than interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting offers vivid, atmospheric imagery ("bleached bones," "impossible soil"), though the magical realism feels somewhat untethered from the physical constraints of the ice. The environment functions more as a mirror for Mira’s internal monologue than a source of concrete pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "drift-ice marina" is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively mirrors the protagonist's transitional state. Some descriptors ("edge of the world") lean on familiar tropes, but the sensory details of the ice are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details are vivid ("burnt honey," "soft percussion"), effectively grounding the mood and satisfying the setting requirements. The imagery anchors the reader, though the reliance on visual adjectives sometimes slows momentum. The setting functions well as an atmospheric backdrop but does not actively constrain choices in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong atmospheric work with the "kinetic parapet" and sensory details of the dunes creates a tangible world. The setting does the heavy lifting in the absence of plot.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the lavender field and ruins are described with some sensory detail, the setting acts merely as a backdrop and does not constrain the protagonist's choices. A severe text artifact ("soft梯形") breaks the atmospheric immersion completely. The "metallic whisper" and "golden bars" show potential, but the environment never applies pressure to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the library convincing as an organic entity rather than a mere backdrop. Details like the "irregular heartbeat" of the chandelier and the "germination rates of wheat" in the columns effectively externalize the theme. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's standout feature, blending the surreal (mossy videotape towers) with the tactile (driftwood, chalk) to create a specific, pressurized atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's journey and internal state. The sensory details—particularly the "unwatched videotapes humming"—effectively bridge the physical and the thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is excellent, using the "impossible brightness" and "improbable architecture" to create a pressurized, atmospheric vessel for the story. The physical details of condensation and tools ground the surreal elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The specific tools of the trade—the junk drawer, the spoon, the vinyl shard—are excellent, tactile grounding elements. However, the setting relies on some abstract descriptors ("radiant haven," "scent of hope hung in the room") that tell rather than show the atmosphere. These moments of abstraction weaken the otherwise vivid physical reality of Room 412.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "spoons" detail effectively grounding the magical surrealism of the "Bend." The atmospheric details ("phosphorescent fish," "warped timekeepers") support the tone well, though the environment could press harder on the protagonist's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The garden is rendered with specific, atmospheric detail ("wild with calendula," "Triton still frozen") that mirrors Elara's internal state. The setting acts as a constraint and a sanctuary, essential to the ritual. The final visual of the constellations on the stone anchors the abstract emotional shift in a concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "serpentine grotto" and "mist pressing" establish a solid mood, though descriptors become repetitive. The specific inclusion of "zephyr bloom softness" feels forced and disrupts the verisimilitude of the setting, reading more like a prompt insertion than organic description. The sensory environment is distinct but static.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the decaying data center with the moss garden is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated. The environment actively shapes the narrator's mood and facilitates the central realization, grounding the abstract emotional work in concrete physical details like the melting ice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like the "spiral seashell fragment" and "emerald moss" are vivid, though the "feral nexus" is repeated to the point of distraction. The atmosphere is consistent but leans heavily into ethereal abstraction ("ordinary world seemed to thin") rather than grounded specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on familiar "sacred grove" tropes. The introduction of scientific terms ("DNA," "genetic memory") clashes with the established mystical tone ("spun sunlight," "golden stories"), creating a jarring incoherence in the world-building logic.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing a strong mood of subarctic desolation that contrasts well with the "warm" purpose. The sensory details of the debris and the skeletal trees ground the magical elements, though the crater itself functions more as a backdrop than an active constraint on the mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral; the acoustic properties of the marble cavern and the light angles directly enable the protagonist's solution. The sensory details ("brass gears," "crystalline face") are vivid and support the tone. The "wounded season" framing effectively grounds the temporal scope of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with "starlight filtered through fissures" and the "bronze grotto" establishing a strong, specific atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the character's actions, integrating well with the fractal weaving concept.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "old iron" afternoon and the specific scent of "arena sawdust" create a tactile, immersive world. The setting details actively constrain the mood and reflect the internal state without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The kinetic lagoon is a vivid, specific environment that actively constrains movement (boots finding solid ground on water). The atmosphere supports the surreal logic without breaking consistency or obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory anchoring like the "hollow ribcage" terminal and the smell of "popcorn and sawdust." These details effectively ground the sci-fi archaeology premise in a tangible, decaying reality.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong atmospheric grounding with evocative sensory details like the "petrichor" and "glacial hush" effectively establish the mood. However, the imagery occasionally tips into purple prose, and the phrase "voices died before they could fully born" contains a distracting error that mars the description.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, effectively grounding the "architecture of lies" theme in the physical contrast between the "black glass" canal and the converted warehouses. The sensory details—amber lamps, radio static—successfully anchor the intellectual conflict in a tangible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, establishing a vivid, if heavy, mood with "amber" wood and "oceanic hush." However, the setting remains largely ornamental; the fog and snow provide texture but do not actively constrain choices or force tactical shifts until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.7)
    The garden is atmospheric and thematically integrated, serving as a mirror for the protagonist's internal state; the specific detail of the red weft thread provides a necessary tactile anchor, though some descriptions lean on standard ruin imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "Royal Oology Chamber" and the "mechanical flowers" create a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the fable-like tone effectively. The sensory details (taste of copper, whirring mechanisms) work well to establish the setting's age and artificiality, though the "taste of nostalgia" drifts slightly into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "obsidian lagoon" and "black volcanic sand" are vivid, specific, and thematically integrated. The sensory details effectively ground the reflection, though the description occasionally leans into romanticized adjectives ("ancient and patient").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "city of forgotten fountains" is vividly realized, with specific names and details (algae-covered serpents, pewter sky) that ground the surreal premise. The atmospheric consistency effectively supports the tone, functioning as the story's strongest element.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, with the "violet haze" and "bioluminescent petals" creating a cohesive, immersive atmosphere. The environment interacts with the action (zero-gravity petals), though the scale ("three hundred leagues") feels slightly abstract. The sensory details effectively ground the ethereal concept.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the spectral elements in sensory details like the "rusting" iron and "weathered glass." However, some descriptions verge on purple prose ("concentrated green breath," "amber dying of the sky"), which can distract from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "obsidian ridge" and "sea of frozen flames" establish a strong, somber atmosphere. The clock tower's interior with its "brass gears" and "iron bones" effectively grounds the action. The environment feels tactile and appropriately constrains the character's movement and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    Descriptions are atmospheric but occasionally redundant, such as the "velveteen gloom" containing shadows with the "texture of deep velvet." The setting, while visually distinct, does not constrain the character or force tactical changes; the gardener simply enters and interacts with the props without environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the obsidian spire and frozen lake provides a vivid, if static, atmospheric container for the reflection. The physical details—obsidian, ice, the blue quill—are rendered with sensory clarity, though they serve largely as symbolic props rather than constraints that force action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic to the genre, leaning on standard tropes like "ruined city" and "cracked windows" without specific constraint on the action. The "dust" is the most distinct element, but the environment does not force tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rocking chair functions brilliantly as a dynamic micro-setting element, acting as a clock that constrains the scene and charges the final silence. The gallery atmosphere is vivid, though the "Vanishing Point" name leans slightly on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the strongest element, with vivid, specific details like "charcoal marks where officials had recorded tide schedules" grounding the abstract theme. The "coral-encrusted streets" and "silt-filled plazas" effectively create an atmosphere of decay that mirrors the thematic focus on sedimentation. The environment feels lived-in and specific, though it functions more as a backdrop for thought than an active constraint on immediate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "velvet library" and the zither's rosette are rendered with strong, atmospheric specificity that anchors the tone effectively. The sensory details ("amber leaves," "worn to soft edges") successfully create the "traveled silence," though the setting functions more as a mood setter than a constraint on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, effectively using synesthetic imagery ("iron bones weeping orange tears") to ground the magical realism. However, the setting relies on standard "abandoned garden" tropes that, while vivid, do not uniquely constrain the character's choices beyond providing a backdrop for the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is rendered with evocative, if slightly "purple," imagery ("nectar dusk," "bottled atmosphere") that establishes a cohesive fable-like tone. While the descriptions are vivid, they remain largely decorative, creating atmosphere without offering concrete constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's strongest asset; specific details like the "orris root" and "violet hour" create a tactile, immersive atmosphere. The house functions effectively as a sensory archive that actively constraints and guides the protagonist's attention.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific details like "sea-green serpentine" and "foxglove-purple stains" grounding the fantasy. The underwater environment effectively mirrors the thematic fluidity, though the "garden" metaphor is slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the abstract nature of the setting fits the "infinite staircase" concept, the story suffers from "white-room syndrome." The environment lacks sensory texture beyond the visual paradox; we don't feel the temperature, sound, or physical grit of the stone, which keeps the experience distant.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "yellow haze" of the city contrasting with the "mineral warmth" of the greenhouse creates a vivid, tangible atmosphere. The sensory details anchor the reader effectively in the specific 2 AM isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rendered with rich sensory specificity, particularly the "fracturing" light through the waterfall and the "warm yeasty smell" contrasting with the damp. The environment actively constrains the characters, with the melting ice serving as both a clock and a physical barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is established with strong atmospheric details, from the "salt and sawdust" smell to the "patient cruelty" of the sea. The hunger stone serves as a vivid, grounding artifact that effectively links the environment to the stakes. The lighthouse functions well as both a physical trap and a machine of transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmosphere is suitably gothic, with "liquid mercury" and "crooked tooth" imagery establishing a surreal mood. However, the abandoned carnival is a fairly standard trope, and some descriptions border on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of the acoustic driftwood orchard is vivid, specific, and functionally integral to the plot; the logs are not just scenery but the instrument of the magic. Sensory details effectively blend the visual and auditory ("bass note," "glowing faintly"), grounding the abstract concept in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting of a sinking city built on dying giant turtles is vivid, specific, and functionally integrated into the plot. While the imagery of the "watchers" and "amber light" establishes a strong atmosphere, the explicit labeling of "sunwashed dread" diminishes the immersive effect of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The setting is established with competence, offering atmospheric details like the "ivy's dense green curtain" and the "derelict platform." While the cathedral metaphor is slightly generic, the environment effectively mirrors the solemnity of the decision. The setting anchors the mood well, though it functions more as a backdrop for thought than a source of constraint or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, decay-focused imagery ("broken tooth," "widow's veils") that grounds the tone. The sensory details of the pavilion effectively mirror the theme of absence, though the specific mechanics of the water level blur the spatial logic slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details of the submerged city and the blackout library are the story's strongest asset, grounding the abstract theme in sensory reality. The "reclaimed stillness" effectively shifts the protagonist's mode of perception. However, the setting serves more as a mood setter than a source of physical resistance or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is evocative and specific, using the "floating island tea garden" and "cloud-sea" to physically ground the abstract emotional state. The sensory details ("shards of violet," "leaves still steaming") are purposeful, framing the protagonist's isolation and craft with high fidelity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory is a striking, specific environment ("electromagnetic cables," "red LED status lights"), effectively grounding the abstract math in physical space. However, orientation is slightly delayed, establishing the immediate physical setting fully only after the wedding reminiscence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observatory setting is rendered with specific, grounded sensory details (obsidian, tarnished brass, copper dome) that effectively anchor the abstract nature of the quest. The atmosphere of the "knife-edge ridge" at twilight is palpable and supports the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospheric, establishing a moody noir tone, though the "cobalt terrace" feels like a static stage rather than an active pressure cooker. The imagery is vivid but occasionally slips into purple prose ("sea swallow the sun whole") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting details (mist, storm-worn stone, parapet) establish a consistent mood but fail to constrain the characters' choices or tactics. The environment functions as a static backdrop—a "white room" with atmospheric weather—rather than an active force that the protagonist must navigate or overcome to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is functional, with the cedar poles serving as excellent specific anchors that drive the plot. However, the unique perceptual distortion of losing stereoscopic vision is under-utilized; the water is described as "choppy" and "gray" rather than through the specific visual confusion of the protagonist's condition.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground lake and bioluminescence are rendered with vivid, atmospheric sensory details that ground the surreal premise. The physical environment effectively supports the mood, though the spatial logic of the labyrinth remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established but relies on generic high-fantasy descriptors ("silver light," "trees dreamed in amber") rather than grounded particulars. The imagery is often filtered through heavy simile usage rather than direct sensory interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "midnight glade above clouds" and "molten silver" mist serving as an effective liminal stage. The specific props (cracked saucer, birthday cloth) anchor the abstract magical setting in tangible history, actively constraining the character's focus.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific sensory details like "gravity pools gathered like sleeping cats" and "faded photographs." The environment actively supports the mood and provides the physical materials (optical fiber, photos) necessary for the plot's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into "postcard" descriptions ("slow dance of celestial bodies") rather than constraining action. The specific interaction with the black sand and the volcano's breath grounds the scene well, offering necessary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sundial and twilight atmosphere are visualized with clarity, establishing a mood of decay and secrets. However, the physical logic of the quill holder’s resonance with stone angles is vague, straddling an undefined line between technology and magic that creates world-building friction.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric imagery is vivid ("ribbons of liquid mercury"), but the "frictionless" world lacks consistent tactile grounding; rocks stay placed in spirals and the protagonist climbs successfully despite the established lack of grip. The setting feels like a "white room" where physics apply only when convenient for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is integral to the story's logic; the observatory glass and the condensation serve as the physical medium for the resolution. The atmosphere is vivid, though the "storm" imagery occasionally drifts into generic literary tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like the "diffused afternoon light" and the "glass atrium" are vivid and establish a serene atmosphere. However, the setting acts primarily as a backdrop rather than constraining the characters' choices or influencing the fight's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmospheric detailing of the "skeletal cage" library and "fractured light" is vivid and immersive, anchoring the mood effectively. The setting actively shapes the tone, though the logistics of an open-air prison library feel slightly surreal, tilting toward magical realism without fully establishing the rules.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, blending the gritty reality of the station with the surreal "tidal arbor" effectively. The specific mechanics of the "corrupted frames" acting as coordinates ground the magical realism in a tactile, believable constraint. The final image of the "cloud-density" piano risks abstraction but fits the established dream-logic of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting establishes a consistent whimsical atmosphere, but relies on genre shorthand ("memory-moths," "shades of possibility") rather than fresh, grounded particulars. Descriptions like "colors that belonged to no known spectrum" function as placeholders for impossibility rather than vivid sensory details, missing a chance for originality.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details of the rain-washed islet are vivid and establish a strong mood that permeates the scene. The specific interaction with the lace and compass grounds the abstract reflection in tangible objects, though the "rhythmically placid" description borders on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse’s broken glass, receding water, and surviving rosemary bush function as micro-setting that constrains her motion and supplies the butterfly. Sensory hierarchy obeys an astrophysicist’s eye: bruised-purple sky, infinitesimal scales, light-curve tracery. Spatial choreography holds as she crouches, stands, returns three days later. The missing 9+ gate: no object or environmental feature is manipulated in a final beat to charge the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Canyon acts as micro-setting: frost-rimmed sandstone constrains movement and literally reveals the smugglers’ routes. Temperature differential (sun-warmed wall vs. creeping frost) mirrors her internal thaw without overt symbolism. Ledger strip as handled object carries topological memory of fire, charging the final image. Environment does not directly block or enable the final decision, so misses 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The salt-smelling sand, waist-deep water, and rib-like bookshelves perform as micro-setting that physically constrains Aldric’s movement and attention; the throne-chair suspends him between mortal craftsman and after-life ferryman, charging the final image of sentinel-by-window. Sensory hierarchy obeys his embalmer’s eye—texture of glass, weight of lens, acoustics of foghorn—while spatial choreography stays coherent across impossible geometry. Setting is not backdrop; it supplies the only tools with which Aldric can complete the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains: highest point limits visibility to guards, dictates midnight timing, supplies clay-ridge flowers for baskets. Sensory triage mirrors scarcity—cold metal bell, “stubborn earth” color, breathing settlement—never catalog. Spatial choreography clean: lights below vs ridge above track consistently; bodies ascend single path. Could reach 9.0 if one environmental feature (drought soil, patrol lights) had physically blocked an option during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Wisteria scent, firefly altitude, and stone temperature are filtered through Mei’s perceptual bias—she smells sweetness “made denser by evening mist,” a tactile POV detail. The camera-obscura box, silk pouch, and Kwan Yin tear function as micro-setting that literally channels the light tendrils; environment constrains the final tactic. Spatial choreography is flawless: apparatus balanced, tear lifted toward stones, no impossible positions. Weather and bloom press in, mirroring internal softening without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective sensory layering—subterranean cedar scent, molten glass gleam, vine respiration—anchors the micro-setting. The living bridge garden and root-cellar reciprocally mirror internal folds of time, constraining her final dirt-drawn design. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts. The only bar to 9 is a single overripe clause (“origami made of hours”) that slightly overdubs an already vivid moment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Redemption-center debris is tactile, selective, and POV-filtered: cracked rubber balls serve as both camouflage and emotional echo. The piano bench’s velvet split and horsehair stuffing ground the decoding moment in one textured object. Spatial choreography is flawless—prize wall slides, staircase descends, scanner wall, aisles—no floating geography. The synthetic-fletched arrow qualifies as a micro-setting tool that returns to activate the scanner, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-settings—resonator on temple, forge flames licking prototypes—constrain every beat; the greenhouse’s apple-roots-through-hulls image reappears in the final line, recharging the marvel tone. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5; only the silted ship names remain abstract, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emerald glass roof, bruised amber light, and the wooden bench function as micro-setting that guides camera placement and body posture. The moonbeam jar’s liquid silver constrains the decisive technical act. Sensory triage matches urgency: visual dominates, but hush of steam and scent of flowers sharpen the hush before closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift or white-room lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    The abandoned control room’s rusted consoles and cracked panes filter every beat through the POV’s glassmaker eye—hum of dying circuits mirrors glass memory, melting icicles time the furnace plunge. Micro-setting qualifies: the glory-hole flame and bookmark both constrain timing and handling. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment does not yet charge the final image enough to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Abandoned library is sketched through cold rust, groaning shelves, and starlight milk—selective, not catalogic. The cast micro-setting constrains the final decrypting action and is handled twice, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean: back-pressed-against-shelves → table → standing with cast-shield. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fort’s stone parapet, flaking booklet, and last star function as micro-setting that literally constrains the oracle’s final act: she can draw only while the storm pauses and starlight lingers. Sensory triage—wind taste, gold grit, marble hush—narrows to the charcoal’s drag across the page, charging the final image. Environment and tool are inseparable from the closure beat; removal would collapse the map’s creation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Frozen courtyard is vividly sensed through frost-stiffened leaves, refracted twilight, and vibration against the chassis. Micro-setting works: the bench and violin body serve as tactile locus. Setting never actively constrains choice—no slipping ice, no curfew, no malfunction from cold—so it decorates rather than pressures. Still, selective detail and POV-filtered perception remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Crystal forecourt, rain-beaded glass, and smudged projector lens supply tactile, selective detail filtered through registrar’s “ambiguously clear” bias. Micro-setting (counter, ticket surface) constrains the only physical action—hand-touch. Objects (ledger, lens, doodles) carry plot function; their states change (lens “heavier,” ticket gifted). Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Environment does not merely mirror mood—it enables the new communicative order.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden maze functions as micro-setting: its paths, bench, and rose base constrain where marbles are placed and where the final stance is crystallized. Sensory detail is selective—sap stains, cracked glass, sweet decay—filtered through Elara’s horticultural gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; the villager appears only at the entrance, keeping the center circle inviolate. Weather cue (autumn’s first fallen leaves) arrives precisely to reweight the bloom/decay dialectic at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is filtered through Kira’s mechanic gaze—worn lever, humming nexus, iridescent wings—details selected for engineering utility. The cold bay and warm fingertips create a micro-environment that mirrors the thematic temperature clash. The magnetic nexus and observation glass evolve from backdrop to active constraint that enables the final temporal image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floodwater depth is tracked beat-by-beat; gilded balconies reflected in black water and the dry piano platform constrain Elena’s path and final position. Lantern flicker supplies the sole light source, directly timing her chords and the pulsing water. The opera house’s historic weight is filtered through Elena’s professional eye, never tourist-catalog. Environment forces her choice to climb onstage and later to abandon the lanterns, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mountain station, frost-laced window glass, and the smudged botanical print each constrain choice: the print’s paper texture is the pivot beat; the glass pane once salvaged by Elena now frames Mira’s decision. Weather console and pressure read-outs supply tactile, lived-in detail that alters tactics—she types only after reading the drop. Spatial choreography is immaculate: cot → console → illustration → console → aurora-lit storm. Environment charges the final image: auroral grief-light on the smudge becomes the lasting visual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tunnel’s wet brick, beaded wheel, and crackling radio are filtered through Marcus’s urb-ex gaze; every detail either obstructs (crumbling mortar, drop) or offers affordance (wheel, radio static). Micro-setting works: the wheel’s wooden beads, preserved yet rotted, mirror his own swallowed truth. Environment constrains the final gesture—no exit except speech into the dark. Slight over-reliance on visual; one more non-visual cue at climax would nudge 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Catacombs, vines, dripping pipes, and the obsidian chamber are rendered with sensory economy; micro-settings (body, tool) don’t constrain choices, so 9-band gate fails. Spatial choreography is clean; the river fault and paper portal are anchored without contradiction. Atmosphere and decay mirror the theme of composted knowledge effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Granite outcropping, manzanita, white sage, and ancient oak are filtered through Elara’s body and ukulele, constraining her seating circle and chord choice. Eclipse light shift directly governs when she lowers the instrument and chooses silence. Final image of ordinary brightness re-returned recharges the ridge’s liminal status. Micro-setting (silk-wrapped curl in pouch) charges the closing memory-link but never physically alters action, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Reclaimed-silo library is concretely anchored—curved concrete, wheat ghost-smell, iron fireplace mouth—each detail filtered through Elias’s relic-attuned gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but pressure engine: extinct plants lean toward Mirabel, moss muffles footsteps, UV light exposes memory filaments—environment literally constrains perception and choice. Crystal vial doubles as micro-setting/tool; its emptying reconfigures the stake. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—scent > sight > touch—never cataloguing for its own sake. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or props.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Terra-cotta dust, starlight cracks, and the pool’s mirrored silver are filtered through Mira’s pattern-seeking eye, so every sensory note doubles as epistemic tool. The rope’s fibers literally constrain her hand placement while drawing, satisfying the 9+ gate. One clause (“rust-colored clay that once lined the roads”) drifts into tourist-brochure diction, but the glitch is microscopic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Shipwreck acoustics, ash-clouded greenhouse glass, and moss-covered concrete are filtered through Marina’s musician ear; each detail is selective and purposeful, guiding her choice to play. The bowl’s metallic memory constrains the moment of vibration, directly charging the closure image. One sentence drifts to overview (“the climate swallowed the coastline”) but does not obscure spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amber glass walls, ethanol reek, and static-charged blotter petal function as micro-setting that constrains the only possible action—self-inhalation. Light bending like “honeyed whiskey” is filtered through Vera’s sensory priorities. Spatial choreography clean: bench → petal → nose → exhale. Environment charges the final image: grotto glows amber as she accepts perpetual suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Starlit library hull, salt-jasmine air, and the domed skylight supply concrete, selective detail filtered through Maren’s tide-eye. The locket photo acts as micro-setting that charges the final exchange; environment quietly guides her stay until midnight. Could use one tactile library prop to push past 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are not backdrop but instruments: the geometric shadows guide Yara’s eye to the spiral tag, the glossy bark becomes a mirror that forces honest approach. Micro-setting works through the reeds—wetland grass that must now root in volcanic glass, a literal constraint on her craft. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices temperature of shimmer, hollow promise of reed, children’s laughter she will now learn. Final image of fresh spirals on the path ahead evolves the setting causally—space itself is being rewritten by her decision to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)

Final image of stalactites “indifferent and constant” mirrors her internal acceptance, charging the closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)
    Library infrastructure doubles as character: pipe chases dictate movement, floorboard creaks steer solitude, outage re-colors light to sapphire. Micro-setting (tape fragment) constrains the final ethical choice—transmit rather than keep. Selective sensory hierarchy (touch, vibration, muffled voice) mirrors Maren’s vocation. Could edge higher if one environmental detail recoiled on her physically—cold burn, metal cut—to embody cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Wet moss, trellis drips, and chlorophyll scent are filtered through Vera’s taxonomic gaze, making environment double as diagnostic tool. The trellis itself constrains her final insight: she reads the vines’ “circuitous” regrowth while literally standing beneath them. Micro-setting (leaf in palm) supplies the charged object that migrates to the closure image. One decimal shy of 9 only because storm-season sky could compress one adjective.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment is never backdrop: rain threads literally guide her steps, and the uncovered stone pillars force the meeting. The brooch’s cold weight against her chest functions as micro-setting that constrains the final exchange. Sensory selection—silver rain, black causeway, brass telescope—mirrors her narrowing perception under sleep-loss. One hairline slip: “南方 shower” untranslated jars the otherwise seamless Anglophone texture.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cave is not backdrop but active constraint: crystal tones map corridors, shadows misbehave under attention, pearls warm against cold logic—each environmental quirk alters Varen’s perceptual choices.

Spatial anchors are clear and purposeful; no descriptor is touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Container labyrinth is immediately anchored and continuously filtered through the nameless one’s biased attention—corrugated walls “like rusted skyscrapers,” salt breath, shifting corridors. Sensory selection narrows to touch and sound (soft paper, water against metal) that guide choice. The poison label acts as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture—its cloth-like fragility dictates gentle pocket-placement, charging the closure. Environment, body, and object interlock without ornamental excess; specificity never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory’s salt-sawdust smell, dead-eye windows, and rust-pitted dome are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final image as “a book settling into its final chapter.” The half-finished cello functions as micro-setting that literally constrains each successive choice—she can’t resist touching it again. Spatial choreography holds: she crosses threshold, approaches table, remains seated within the whisper. Weather is invoked only as tonal pressure (“wind carried whispers of closing pages”), avoiding tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating carnival evoked through motion and sound that filter Mira’s priorities; raft creak vs glass platform opposes old/new economically. Micro-setting objects—stone chip, chalk pigments—constrain tactics and appear in closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.

    The attic functions as micro-setting: skylight angle dictates dust-mote trajectories which in turn dictate her reconstruction method, so environment literally shapes tactics. Vanilla/forgetting perfume and crystalline sound-traces are sensory anchors that evolve from nostalgic relics to active instruments. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bench, skylight, paper grids, transducer—no floating props. Final image (“voice bloomed and withered”) reuses the vanilla-perfume motif now charged with ancestral voice, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prism terrace as micro-setting constrains every action—light fractures, boards record pressure, drift carries her to shore. Grain pattern becomes a legible archive that makes the crossing possible; wood remembers so Elara can decide. anchoring is late (~150 words) but disorientation is taught early and pays off at closure, so Orientation Test is waived. Final image of “diagram drawn in new weather” crystallizes both sky and village as mutable text.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Underwater city is evoked with brine-crusted crystal and copper air, each detail filtered through Marek’s hushed reverence; bioluminescent廊 strands and amber-bound firefly serve as micro-settings that constrain his final act of waiting. Spatial choreography holds as he moves from lock to observatory to floor; the dome glass charges the closing image by literalizing the sky-mirror. Selective sensory economy—no gratuitous tech exposition—keeps atmosphere taut.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The iridescent geode functions as both macro-setting and perceptual amplifier, its prismatic walls literally bending Maren’s awareness; the crater glass acts as micro-setting/tool that constrains how truth can be accessed. Sensory selection skews toward fractured light and tactile residue, mirroring the story’s epistemology. Spatial choreography is immaculate—seeds spiral, palms flatten, walls refract—guiding the transliteration beat. The final image of steady light accepting another “path found in the fragments” recharges the setting’s motif without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The arcade’s salt-bleached stones, flickering cabinets, and starlit sand converge into a lived liminal zone that dictates timing and frames the bishop’s ivory gleam. Sensory hierarchy is tuned to Marek’s professional gaze—every angle measured against tidal pulse. The micro-setting (blanket, balls, bishop) literally constrains the possible geometries of his toss; spatial choreography is exact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Twilight garden, pale flowers, moonstone speck—selective sensory triad that constrains the ritual beat. Micro-setting (hollow of palm, shoulder skin) doubles as arena. Starlight on dust charges the final image. No spatial drift; bodies track.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harbor fog, warped window-glass, and the pond’s returning rings are sensuously etched and filter through the glazier’s glass-trained eye. The “prism atrium” is micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moonlit ridge, blackened stumps, and saplings are filtered through Mira’s firefighter gaze; the porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains every handling choice. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and reflected light, mirroring internal scar tissue. Spatial choreography is clean: path, stone, box against chest. Environment does not merely backdrop but supplies the literal fire line where innocence was bartered, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tide-polished grotto is tactile—salt smell, rippling light, wet stone—mirroring her incremental method. Spatial choreography is stable; she moves between workbench, waterline, shelf without drift. The brass gauge recurs visually but is never manipulated, so it constrains no choice; setting therefore charges mood more than tactic, capping the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Granite, ash, ivy, and brass lenses are filtered through Mira’s professional gaze; the cold fireplace and the negative strip act as micro-settings that literally enable the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: we track her boots on worn stones, knees on cinders, negative held to dying light. Weather (the advancing green, rain through the roof) is causally linked to the survival of the diaries and thus to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism parapet after rain is not backdrop but instrument: its water beads fracture dawn light into the “brief rainbows” that feed the mirrors’ visions. Micro-setting (Aria’s fingertips on cold stone, the hush before bells) constrains her tempo—she must finish before the valley’s first ring. Spatial choreography is clean; mirrors are located in distinct wings yet linked by her song’s arc. Weather and time-of-day evolve causally—dew glints, birds test song, then the bell’s vibration replaces hers—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace’s stone constrains the ritual pacing—“ancient before either dynasty”—and the midsummer celestial clock visibly pressures the timing of the handshake. The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting, its black surface catching starlight to cue the name-reading beat. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (amber light, grinding sandals) and integrated into action rather than catalogued. Meets the 9+ gate: environment charges the final image by providing the literal platform on which the cost is enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt flat is not backdrop but crucible: its reflective glare hurts her eyes, its silence silences her thoughts, its sterile crust guarantees zero predators. The egg’s translucence—veins visible inside—becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather is tactical: afternoon sun vs. night cold simulate incubation cycles she cannot perform herself. Spatial choreography is spotless; every pace is counted along the map of cracks she herself authored.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen fountain-prisms function as micro-setting that literally refracts the final stakes onto the snow; their light “brighten[s]” in response to her untangling, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—her footprints absent, her knees at the rim, the dawn throwing “tiny rainbows.” Weather and surface actively constrain stealth and visibility, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dome’s acoustics and circular machinery scar directly enable the stick planting and the “whispered” reverse-telling; environment constrains the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elias’s calligrapher eye for bone-white surfaces and negative space. Spatial choreography stays clean—single ingress, central platform, exit line. No weather clichés; meteor hush is thematic tone rather than generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Grotto’s suspended garden and evaporative ferns constrain every action—moisture dictates vine pliability, wind holes dictate lattice placement. The moth wing operates as micro-setting/template, literally shaping the rescue knot. Final image of orange dissolving into gray recharges both setting and theme, meeting the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound sanctum is not backdrop; its cracked dome showers ice dust onto the rope, forcing Yara to work finger-numb, turning environment into antagonist. The aurora’s shifting color registers her progress bar—green to prism—mirroring the rope’s activation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the ceremonial rope itself functions as mobile architecture, constraining every finger placement. Spatial choreography is immaculate; she kneels, rises, exits, and the rope’s new state is left humming in the exact center of the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vine-draped concrete, copper storm scent, and the shifting seal create a tactile micro-setting that guides gesture (hand in groove, pedestal alignment). The bunker breathes with her heartbeat—an environmental mirror that charges the final image; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rooftop observatory tiles become the micro-setting that literally vibrates underfoot, constraining the final action. Palace corridors are mapped by number-grid, turning architecture into star-chart—specific, tactile, impossible to swap. Twilight between regimes is filtered through Maruk’s skin: “winter cold” settles in bones. One minor hedging: “ancient Babylonian” is never named on-page, but Mesopotamian echoes (clay tile, desert edge) suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanctuary itself is the antagonist: walls breathe, a corner becomes yesterday’s sky, the garden resurrects—all constraining escape routes and forcing the siblings to face one another. Sensory economy is fierce: “soundless” is felt in the reader’s own throat, light bends like a migraine aura. Micro-setting rule—objects reappear “when needed elsewhere”—is demonstrated twice before the pin return, so the environment actively rewrites tactics. Final rose-garden solidification literally roots the emotional closure in place.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ruined conservatory, gnarled apple trunks, and fog-as-membrane are continuously filtered through Mira’s glass-maker gaze; the broken sextant’s brass arms physically frame the final mirror, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (workbench, breath on glass) constrains the breathing method, anchoring the speculative mechanic in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vividly tactile: pears rot on marble, incense clings to stone, moonlight catches the re-assembled eye. These details constrain action—she kneels on slippery fruit skin, works by fading amber then moonlight—so environment shapes tactics. The micro-setting of the ribbon evolves from pocket talisman to statue collar, charging the final image. A hair more specificity on tool use (the grinding wheel’s whir against night silence) would have pushed 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard, pistachio cameo, and sealed bathroom each act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only the bathroom blocks the trees’ maddening hum, giving Mira a pocket to risk the question; the cameo’s impossible weight governs when and how she speaks. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (she notices radiation-seal integrity before décor). Details interleave with action; no exposition dump. Spatial choreography is clean; the dome’s geography remains constant. Environment directly charges the final image—the cameo glows under fluorescent light—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bookstore-mountain is lushly textured—“shelves ascending into misty heights,” “nautilus-shell chamber”—and filtered through Elara’s scholarly gaze. Sensory hierarchy focuses on hush, vibration, and ancient alphabets, mirroring her quest for absences. Spatial choreography stays consistent: ramp descent, finger-tracing spines, nook carving. While the setting enthralls, it never materially blocks or enables her final insight; environment describes rather than constrains, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.7)
    Fog-thinned bay and rotting carnival ship are sketched with selective sensory economy; the emerald card serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors hold; weather and vessel affect mood but never constrain tactics—Mira could be on any pier. The garden is promised, not placed, so environment stays atmospheric rather than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clock-tower micro-setting is superb: cedar-scent rope, brass smell, three-story lunar gears all filter through Elena’s archivist eye and directly enable the braid manipulation that births the door. The rope’s chemical preservation and diplomatic cipher braids constrain every move; without them the climax literally cannot happen—object-as-setting at its finest.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    Harmonic caves act as resonant instrument: temperature gradients, fracture topology, and the echo-stone’s glow all constrain how/whether silence can bloom. The spiral-ice “micro-setting” directly shapes the final tactic—no swap-out possible.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    The amber-filtered glass pavilion is not backdrop; its vibration cues mood and final approval beat. The prism’s rainbow scatter literally re-colors the walls, marrying object to setting. Beacon skeleton anchors scale and forgotten purpose. Micro-setting succeeds: body-against-glass, palm-on-cold-surface tether interior to exterior. Environment constrains the only path—up the tower—so setting charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal forecourt, solid fog, and stormlight are tactile, filtered through archivist’s professional gaze; surfaces reveal memory accuracy. Lightning angles supply usable data for her craft, so environment constrains method. Micro-setting (monument shadows) directly shapes her reading and the story’s final image. No world-rule drift; spatial choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fortress flowers, crumbling siege stone, and the rag’s oilcloth texture all filter through Mira’s pyrotechnician eye—smell of thyme vs memory of kerosene. The micro-setting of the courtyard flagstones literally anchors the spiral burn that concludes the story, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography is clean: gate → courtyard → great hall → back to courtyard; no floating rooms. One minor over-spray: “ancient stones that had once been quarried for war and were now crumbling into earth for flowers” packs three metaphors into one clause, slightly diluting the tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grotto and night sky function as micro-setting: starlight on water dictates Mira’s tangent gaze, stone lip holds the cicada offering, walls echo softer speech. Sensory hierarchy obeys her chronicler bias—temperature of minerals, sound of distant tide, visual diamonds in pool—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography steady; bodies remain seated, cicada tracked in hand → floor. Setting does not constrain a tactical choice as strongly as internal stance, so it stops short of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The xenial trellis above cloud-deck functions as micro-setting: altitude prevents normal plant growth, so the green shoot’s presence constrains Mira’s concept of limitation itself. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and filtered pale light, mirroring her attenuated attention after years of concrete. Spatial choreography is coherent—palm on barrier, feet lift, doll placed on railing, gravity return. One minor slip: “clouds drift beneath her feet like sleeping sheep” is the only visual cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism terrace is not backdrop but instrument: its light refraction literally changes the boy’s face, the acoustic refraction lets Maren sculpt silence, and the drifting motion grants her temporal slack to act. The storm-glass vial doubles as micro-setting—its color spectrum constrains her next move. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track the vial’s cork, the vapor’s drift, the boy’s unclenching fists against the window’s spectral dance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orchard, waterfall, silver-bark trees, fossilised paint, and dawn-drain are vivid, selective, and filter through Elara’s archaeological gaze. Kaleidoscopic waterfall colour-shift directly mirrors the world-shift she must undergo, charging the final ascension image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across one continuous scene; no geography drifts. Meets 9+ gate: the fossilised mural colours constrain her method and charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The charcoal sanctuary functions as micro-setting: its crumbling wall literally enables the final exit and constrains earlier stasis. Sensory triad—cold brass, starlight, ash taste—filters through the keeper’s bias toward thresholds. Spatial choreography is clean: ring found, wall touched, door opened. The environment’s decay mirrors internal pressure without overt symbolism, and the final starlight recharges the opening “burned bridge” image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mushroom farm is sketched with electric-earth scent and motion-tracking glow; the environment actively stages the confrontation. The bolt operates as micro-setting, its threads “digging into skin” to guide grip and decision. Lighting shifts mirror internal pressure without overt symbolism. One spatial gap: we never learn how the two Mayas occupy the same junction—floor, wall, distance—so choreography momentarily floats.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sepia room, wisteria-choked terrace, and brass crank are filtered through Elara’s scholar-eye and supply tactile props for the final act. The gramophone constrains the only meaningful choice; its brass gleam guides her hand. Spatial tracking is clean; one sensory anchor per move keeps the scene taut.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Phosphorescent fruit and hook-suspended puppets create a tactile, night-saturated micro-cosmos; the greenhouse never slips into white-room syndrome and its glow literally enables the final act by illuminating the strings. Yet the orchard itself never actively obstructs or resource-shapes Aldric’s choices—it is atmosphere more than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    File room as plantation house constrains Mara’s moral imagination—walls “remember” sounds—charging the closure. Brass button functions as micro-setting that narrows her stance. Selective sensory detail (dust patterns, softened edges) filters through archivist habit. Environment and object together charge the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Selective, urgency-filtered detail: the “amber-lit streets that streetlamps couldn’t touch” externalizes Mira’s practiced shadow-use; the mineral scent and warmth of the lagoon guide her knee-level decision to wade. Micro-setting (the worn key’s teeth, the false-natural stone lid) directly constrains her next muscle movement. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible body positions. One slip: “auric” is repeated twice, but the lagoon’s glow recurs as charged image at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Grotto, mist, prism, dew, saxophone form a closed micro-ecology that actively filters choice: dripping dew sets tempo, prism light cues register shifts, wet stone reflects his notes back as pressure.  Final image—“breath coming in ragged hushes”—is charged by the same elements, so environment constrains and reconfigures.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skyborne arbor, copper tweezers, antler tool, and moonstone speck form a tactile micro-setting that constrains every action; the vault’s “dancing shadows” charge the final emergence. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the “mossy delight” kinesthetic metaphor freshens perception. Spatial choreography is flawless—spiral staircase, back-row jar, lantern shadows track without drift. Environment literally holds the world’s genetic memory, so the setting’s specificity is indispensable to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass, rust, leaves, mineral dampness—each filtered through Maren’s restorer eye; sensory economy is good. “Iron frame rusted to the color of dried blood” is specific and stakes the mood. Greenhouse and stairwell track spatially; no clutter. Yet nothing in the environment yet forces a tactical choice; description is evocative but not yet instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The foundry’s dripping roof, cooling forge, and rainwater-filled scales function as micro-setting that directly shapes her kintsugi method—she needs the heat, the quiet, the brother-haunted space. Sensory hierarchy is alchemist-specific: scent of forge smoke, color-shift of molten gold, weight of scales. The coin’s evolving glow is tracked spatially against cooling shadows, charging the final image. Environment never sprawls; every detail answers to her intent or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Echo gorge’s acoustic wound is more than backdrop: its amplifying stone literally enables the broken-threefold resonance that frees the ghost. Light threads, mist, and narrowing walls are filtered through Mira’s ear and grief, guiding her tactical placement of harp and body. Micro-setting—the shifted harp bridge—functions as environment-in-hand, constraining the exact frequency she needs. Final image of “luminous ache” sun fuses outer landscape with inner cost, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Forest rendered in synesthetic ultraviolet supplies both atmosphere and conceptual mirror of Mira’s hyper-perception. The mask-strap and moss path operate as micro-settings that constrain footfall and skull alike. Space is coherent; few objects, all re-used.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop market is sketched with selective sensory economy—sideways painting, map-seller, musician—each detail filtering through translator-perception. The lens fragment itself serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Environment does not merely decorate; it supplies the hidden painting that re-weights the stake. Enough to clear the 9- gate, but the city below stays generic, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dust grains, brass gleam, and ceiling-crack geometry are filtered through elevator-man’s professional eye, grounding space and POV. Micro-setting (the mainspring) doubles as plot engine, constraining the final move. Sensory hierarchy narrows to visual + tactile under failing light, mirroring internal focus. Final image recharges the dust pattern that first hinted at the hatch.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass leaves, crystalline trees, and ink-sweating spines are sensuously precise and filtered through Elara’s print-craft attention. The letterpress itself functions as micro-setting: its un-negotiable metal anchors both atmosphere and final action. Cloud-sea patterns visibly reconfigure after the rupture, proving the environment charges the closing image. Only the “reading alcoves” remain a postcard glimpse; they neither constrain choice nor return with altered meaning, preventing the 9+ lift.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Baroque asteroid texture is selective—amber time-pools, brass storm pipes, reflective crystal walls—each element later constrains action (mirrors as buffers). Micro-setting of shard in pocket reappears to charge closure. Spatial choreography clean: eastern wing → heart mirror → eastern wall tear. Sensory hierarchy filters through poet’s bias (imagery > tech specs), keeping exposition lean.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: its “wilts near dishonesty” rule constrains Cassian’s need to speak work aloud—visible tactical pressure. Selective sensory detail (copper goggles, tremor in watch) grounds POV without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The chamber’s acoustic personality mirrors interior stakes; however, it does not materially alter the final tether move—thus held below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Factory floorboards, rising water table, phosphorescent basin—each setting detail is filtered through Elara’s scent-oriented perception and directly enables or constrains action. The cracked compass and empty vial function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; descent path tracks cleanly. Environment is not merely vivid but instrumental in the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Storm, arch, and lantern slide operate as micro-settings that physically constrain choices: the arch blocks wind so she can study the slide; the slide’s light needs twilight gray to reveal. Sensory selection mirrors urgency—horizontal rain, turbine-hum—yet never crowds the lyric cadence. The driftwood arm in the final image directly charges the stone threshold, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    Environment and micro-objects actively constrain: the cathedral glass’s hidden layers literalize the night-bloom secret and dictate the final shift in her painting; frost etchings act as tactile interference that redirects her gaze. Sensory economy is excellent—October light “scattered…in warm, fragmented showers” fuses vision with temperature. Pavilion, postcards, and glass all return in the closing image, cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Obsidian lagoon, floating zeppelin library, and ciphered debris are vividly particular and filter through Miriam’s scholarly gaze. The lagoon’s light-swallowing surface mirrors her internal black-hole of history, charging the final apparition. Spatial choreography is clean: descent ramp, crescent of artifacts, kneeling at water’s edge all track. One high-band slip: the zeppelin’s amber gasbags are admired, never used to constrain choice or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Paper-lantern cove evolves from dead ash to living light; the amber bottle acts as micro-setting that literally channels memory into sand, constraining every tactical step. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices porous glass warmth, wet sand, then emergent bread-smell—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bottle pressed, water seep, hands emerging, child laughing, all trackable in a single camera pan. Final image of seed-light across the cove recharges the opening “amber light fade,” fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orchard-as-micro-setting constrains her posture (“settled herself among the roots”) and supplies the final olfactory cue (“smelled of salt”). Specificity is selective—gnarled apple, brass tower, amber wax—filtered through archivist priorities. Spatial tracking is tight for single-POV rooftop perch. Environment’s role in charging the final image is clear, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium is not backdrop but active resource: cold that forces gloves off, starlight that intensifies as focus sharpens, glass dome that literally channels cosmic indifference. Micro-setting is exact—cotyledons quiver, acorn cap ridges press flesh, breath mist tracks time—while spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene. The final image of vortex sealing “around the seedling” is charged by this environment; remove the frost and the ritual collapses. One stray modifier (“ancient indifference”) flirts with cliché, preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Wind-carved parapet, aged hemp rope, and granite outcrop are tactile anchors; the rope’s soft fibers return in the final paragraph to mirror the siren’s expanding wave, charging the ending image. Microclimate sensors and glue function as micro-setting that literally constrain timing and action, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Station, lantern glass, and star fragments form a micro-setting that constrains every motion; spatial choreography is clean and sensory detail selective. The amber glow threading from glass to fragment to dawn charges the final image without overt symbolism. One abstract phrase—“flourishing stillness”—is repeated rather than evolved, slightly diluting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The apiary’s ribs, amber glass, and cracked earth are filtered through Mira’s bias; every visual detail later re-appears inside the stained-glass box, turning setting into keepsake. Environment materially constrains the only action—she digs where the ghost points—and the final image is charged by that same ground. Meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Emerald silo equations and green-glass light recur, charging the final image; the fragment itself acts as micro-setting that “does not age,” constraining her perception. Selective sensory detail stays filtered through POV bias—equations “twisting into new shapes” mirrors her cognitive loop—without tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt lagoon, slick stones, and half-submerged root constrain movement and supply the mirror that re-configures meaning in the final reflection. Weather is not backdrop: dripping aftermath keeps attention raw, dictates the poet’s kneeling posture, and licenses the hush that allows the kingfisher’s splash to “shatter” it. Micro-setting objects—feather, snapped kite—become tools the poet uses, their physical limits shaping what can be mended. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track feather from water to palm to pocket, kite from sand to reworked skeleton to underarm, without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The living pillars, copper wire, and diary function as micro-settings that constrain every motion; the ladder’s elevation literally re-views the orchard, charging the final image. Sensory selection filters through Maren’s arborist gaze—moss temperature, wire tension, branch give—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props or impossible shifts. Environment directly shapes the stakes: the orchard’s slow time reframes her six-month sentence into continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is selective and POV-filtered: rain-gleam on silver stone, dust motes as “restless spirits,” spring scent of wet earth. The tower interior, amber, and sculpture path are tactiley present; amber refracts light onto the insect, converging image and idea. Environment does not physically obstruct or resource any choice, so it never enters tactical play; thus capped below 8.8. Still, the rainwashed tower and fossil jointly charge the final reconfiguration, meeting the micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bleached reef-ribs and narrowing jetty planks tactilely guide kneeling/planting choices; twilight shift from rose to purple mirrors rising possibility. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—bird-call Latin, salt-tang mud, pod-grain against palm. Environment directly supplies the planting medium and the first-response mirror; no postcard sweep. Constraint on choice is present, but the reef’s skeletal scale could be even more intimately threaded through the last beat to reach the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cracked wasteland and scrapyard are sketched with selective, pressure-driven detail; the body-as-micro-setting appears in the fingertip-reading beat where grooves replace geography and directly constrain the final discovery. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—smelt metals, wax texture—avoiding tourist-catalog breadth. The leaf’s amber edge returns to mirror the wax cylinder, charging the final image and satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observation deck functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the residual anomaly vibrates the glass, her body absorbs the faint tremor, and the window itself becomes the tool through which she re-visions the sky. Specificity is purposeful—silver pencils, containment fields, compass applique—each enlisted in the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ice-carved railing, violet sky, and shifting-symbols lid are tactile and specific; the spire’s height remains an atmospheric backdrop rather than a choice-constraining environment, so the 9+ gate is missed. Cold bite, paper-stuffed satchel, and hollowed chess pieces keep sensory balance and embed the POV’s priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery’s acoustic curve literally steers her final gesture—sound reaches corners her voice can’t, so she relinquishes the name to the architecture. Micro-setting (burnt chessboard) constrains the choice to leave pawns absent. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: footsteps, whispers, scarred wood—no tourist catalog.

    The bookstore-mountain constrains every move: infinite shelves channel her wandering; the velvet-wrapped stone’s feather ridges mediate the pivotal touch. Micro-setting (glass fingertips, mercury eyes) charges the final image. Environmental detail is selective, sensory, and POV-filtered; no tourism. Meets 9+ gate: the stone’s texture directly shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: the frozen market square, suspended mid-game, functions as a literal board where Mira is both piece and player. The platinum labyrinth’s “gleaming coils” mirror the tapestry’s spiral of threads, charging the final image when she folds the rewoven story beneath her arm. Sensory hierarchy is tutor-biased—she notices pattern, weight, strategic spacing—so every detail serves both characterization and theme. Rain awakening the villagers provides causal environmental shift that externalizes her thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bone towers act as both cathedral and cage: proximity dictates stealth, echo multiplies voice, smooth walls receive forbidden text. Mist and acoustic physics shape tactics—poems travel farther than shouts. The spire’s pulsing anger/recognition charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery: charcoal scraped across bone becomes the tactile fulcrum of revolt.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hovering copper hull inches above corrosive surf functions as micro-setting: every creak and rising inch constrains her remaining breaths and choices. Selective sensory detail—smoking acid, copper tang, marble pocks—filters through her urgent priorities. Spatial choreography is clean; statue, charm, and hull remain tracked. The gears-and-cogs label is lightly ornamental, never tactilely used, capping Q3 just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal cave system is evoked through sound, touch, and mirrored light rather than travel-brochure vistas; the pool’s ceiling reflection becomes a micro-setting that literally reframes Marcus’s past. Spatial choreography stays clean across the wrong turn and chamber discovery. Sensory hierarchy matches a painter’s eye: light quality, surface texture, reflected image. The cave constrains the final gesture—release into water—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt walls, salt-worn granite, and brass lens housing are tactile tools that constrain Mira’s grip and guide the vibration outward; the night-scent garden is not backdrop but the enabling resource that charges the final image.

Sensory detail is selective—cool glass eye against thigh, saplings in wounds—filtered through forager’s gaze. Storm-scarred ravine anchors who-where-why within 120 words. Environment constrains climbing path and hiding spot, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal dock, mist, and revolving beam act as micro-setting: the vanished footprints literally remove physical evidence, forcing Aldric to adopt “gaps” as method. Edelweiss functions as portable alpine environment that constrains interpretation once the note is discovered. Sensory hierarchy obeys keeper priorities—sound of beam mechanism, smell of brine over perfume of dried flower—so detail never catalogues. One minor slip: “opal” color is stated but not exploited later for reflective/light interplay that could have charged the final image even more.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cobalt grotto, ridge path, and firefly constellation are rendered through the queen’s fatigued gaze, each sensory layer filtering her waning majesty.

    Orchard roar and violet-glass glint are filtered through Eleanor’s guilt-narrowed attention; the sheet-music folders as “letters never sent” charge the final silence, though spatial anchoring inside the basement is skimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength: “stones that predated light,” “helix of golden light,” and the hush that “filled every corner” are sensory, selective, and charged. The Spiral and the dictionary function as micro-settings that could later constrain choice—setup is strong. However, because no final beat uses these objects to foreclose an option, the setting never fulfills its 9+ gate. Still, the place feels lived-in and guides attention with economy.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fjord, glacier wind, brass tubes, and the “knife-edge” horizon are filtered through Aira’s professional gaze, each detail measuring or seeking level. The station itself functions as micro-setting: its platforms, vessels, and key constrain every gesture she makes. Cold, water-sound, and light density evolve with the beat, mirroring her sharpening awareness without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or duplicates.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mushroom farm is not backdrop but active constraint: fungal light responds to footfalls, guiding distance and revealing thresholds Mira obeys. The compressed-earth corridor, the intersection of cultivation rows, and the glowing mycelial threads together constitute the micro-setting that dictates where bodies may stop. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the man halts at the exact geometric boundary every time, turning layout into love grammar. One hairline slip: the phrase “eastern corridor” is floated once and never reused, leaving faint orientation drift—just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rainwashed library and wet-stone smell are filtered through grief-biased attention; the candle lantern micro-setting constrains the final beat—she opens its pane as the shared confession. Spatial choreography across subway→hospital is clean. Environment never over-describes; each sensory touch primes the father-daughter stake.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)

At 9+ gate: the self-portrait’s hinge mechanism materially shapes her discovery and thus charges closure—meets test.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sound-garden mechanics constrain every action—pressure-sensitive orchids, bass-moss hue-shifts—so the setting actively enables the climax; the lagoon’s breathing returns under starlight to charge the final image. Black-stone platform’s vibration conduction is a micro-setting tool that focuses the signal beat. Detail economy is high; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Container corridors groan, pool light, swallow sound—each descriptor doubles as navigational intel that Mira exploits. The coin’s brass warmth and the maps’ cloth-soft creases micro-set the body-as-setting rule. Final image of violet storm-light on steel recharges the opening fog-groan; environment directly shapes the tactic of whisper-network. Meets 9+ gate: container geometry constrains every exit decision and charges the last catwalk stance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dock, canal, warehouse shutters, dying streetlight—each is tactile, proximity-based, and filters through guardian’s occupational attention to reflected light. Rain-soaked cobalt planks constrain her barefoot stillness; shutter slats become optical instrument. Dental mirror functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to light/dark under pressure. No world-rule break; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as mirror angles redirect beams across canal. Cobalt dock would break logic if swapped—its color is the necessary reflective surface.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt library and magnetic grotto are vividly evoked—“emerged from the mist only at certain hours”—and the grotto’s starlight reappears in the final paragraph, recharging the quiet. Sensory selection favors hush and shimmer, filtering through Eleanor’s patience. Spatial anchors hold without clutter. The setting never constrains a visible choice, so it ornaments rather than pressures, capping entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    The blooming library is rendered in exact, weightless detail—petals glowing with stored memory, dream-frames suspended—each image filtered through Mira’s archivist gaze. Micro-setting (the river stone in her pocket) constrains her tactile nostalgia and resurfaces in the warming beat at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent as she “moves through aisles” and pauses before a single frame. One demerit: weather is mentioned only as “non-existent wind,” a missed chance to press atmosphere against her skinless body.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Greenhouse mist, starlit glass roof, and the workbench micro-setting constrain visibility and mood, guiding Mara's narrowed attention. The tail tip itself becomes mobile “setting,” handled in multiple beats; starlight directly charges the final image. Spatial anchors remain consistent; no floating objects. Sensory economy favors touch and sight filtered through professional caretaker bias.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tower basement, frost-rimmed hourglass, and plaster handprints are tactile, selective, and steer choice—she descends because the tunnel opens, she aligns her scars because the prints are 3-D. Dawn light and meteor hush function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no drifting geography. Just shy of 9 because the ivy telepathy rule is introduced late and doesn’t constrain physical action earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Projection booth functions as micro-setting: jagged reel edges, brittle film, rotting seats—each object is handled and constrains choice (she handles, then renounces). Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s psychometric bias—touch and vibration dominate over visual cataloguing. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the hidden canister under the false floor is tracked from concealment to discovery to re-concealment. The final image recharges the “hushed thunder” motif, giving the booth itself vocal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)

Spatial choreography stays exact; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sea-edge, cotton-shadow ridgeway, and frayed leather leash function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image. Salt wind and violet twilight feed directly into bodily sensation—joints protest, heartbeat persists—so environment alters stamina and timing. Spatial choreography holds: leash dropped at crest, path forks, void below. Could hit 9+ if weather had forced a mid-route tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    Body-as-setting (numb hand, thigh-pocketed bolt) and the snow-choked staircase constrain every move; fortress stone and winter cold are filtered through Marcus’s hypersensitive nerves. The bolt’s green oxidation against snow-glare is a visual hook that charges the final image. Micro-setting mastery lets 800 words feel vast.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Library is textured through Threnody’s bodily scale: shelves tower, moss traces reader-bones, marble softens—details filter her dwarf-titan POV and justify stealth choreography. Iron-gall ink constrains the only tactical choice on the page (what she writes, where), so tool-as-setting passes the 9+ gate. Spatial track stays clean; no impossible drift between stacks. Atmosphere supports the hush-of-revelation theme without ornamental overload.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station as micro-setting constrains every action: buoy cables, console, seabed anchorage, drifting currents—all tactile and leveraged for plot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices temperature, salinity, and acoustic feedback, not tourist visuals. The torn atlas page functions as mobile micro-setting that evolves from nostalgic relic to obsolete artifact, charging the final image. Weather/environment causally affect choice when redirected currents enable the deep-coral settlement.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Repair-bay chill, rusted scaffolding, and dormant robotic arms ground the spatial stage early; the barefoot contact with warm stones converts setting into visceral choice-pressure at climax.

Spatial choreography tracks kite drift through broken pane to bench-top without drift. Hot-spring plume re-enters at closure, recharging the “breath of the earth” motif that mirrors the embryo’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Seaside cliff and salt-bitten greenhouse constrain every choice—wind dictates seedling placement, salt crust decides which species survive. The night-blooming cereus is micro-setting turned talisman; its single-night life span supplies the ticking clock that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy stays vegetal: scent of nectar, temperature of compost, texture of ceramic—never tourist-catalog. One minor over-label: “cathedral of glass” momentarily drifts into sermon tone.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse library is viscerally anchored—salt-breathing walls, inward-curving shelves that track Mira’s attention—and the tarot cards act as micro-setting that constrains her choices. Sensory hierarchy follows her painter’s eye: color, line, reflection dominate; touch returns via “paint-stained fingers.” Spatial choreography is coherent as she descends spiral stairs that “she had not noticed before,” a causal reveal, not teleportation. Environment mirrors internal collapse/contraction without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate via the cards charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Wind-scoured stone, hummingbird drone, and metamorphic ink act as micro-setting that directly constrains the final touch; without them the dissolution beat fails. Sensory selection skews visual but filtered through tracker’s temporal sensitivity (“frequency only he could hear”).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave is not backdrop but instrument: mineral signatures, tidal pool, algae that respond to emotion all constrain how Maren can read and finally float. The fossil’s impossibility is tethered to specific sensory cues; environment charges the final image without ever slipping into tour-guide exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber warehouse breathes through Elara’s fingers: dust motes in “unearthed silence,” honeyed walls that aren’t lit, cliffs that “hold breath.” Buttons as micro-setting constrain her taxonomy and charge the ending when the canyon echo re-weights them from relics to seeds. Proper-noun economy is impeccable—Veleth, Third Age, Canyon Echo—each reused to anchor depth. Only the canyon itself stays off-stage, preventing full environmental pressure on her body.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mist-shrouded bluff functions as micro-setting that constrains visibility and tactics; snow drifts act as readable text that directly shapes Elena’s next move.

    Radio booth is tactile—cold coffee, dusty console grooves, humming relic—yet astral overlays (“spaces between stars”) edge toward generic awe. Physical layout stays coherent; the charts act as micro-setting, constraining tuning choices. Final antenna quiver gives concrete feedback. Weather/proximity of protests outside could tighten spatial pressure more.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stone cold, narrowing walls, amber-lit compass, crystallized-silence alcove—details are filtered through claustrophobic attention and steer action. Impossible geometry is shown via Elara’s disorientation, not exposition. The compass re-appears at climax to guide the final discovery, satisfying the 9-band constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Quarry fog, ribbon silk, pigment order—each micro-setting item is filtered through Elena’s tactile bias and returns in the closure image of rolled canvas. Spatial choreography consistent; weather actively thins to echo release. Body-as-setting (palpating ribbon) constrains her perception and thereby the portrait’s geometry. No environment violation; detail refrains from tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Basement archive textures—ink-stained fingers, waterlogged clumps, jet stream howling through window gaps—are selective and POV-filtered. The weather station functions as off-stage pressure source rather than tactile setting; we never see Maren move through its corridors or handle instruments, so environment does not directly constrain her final choice. Meets micro-setting bar via the copper nail that heats in her palm at the end, charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mountain pullout, billboard netting, and glass flake are not backdrops but instruments: the netting’s flutter teaches the map-grammar, the flake becomes the literal lens that re-projects the world. Spatial choreography is immaculate—car stopping, door opening into tunnel dark, rear-view shimmer—all tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy stays inside a touring musician’s bias for light and echo. The micro-setting of the flake in her palm constrains the final choice to ferry it onward, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    “Rusted circus cars…faded paint whispering” gives tactile decay; the train’s moving territories metaphor is fully dramatized through touch and arrangement logic. Dusk “purple and gold” mirrors their exhausted, sacral mood. The foreign bill acts as micro-setting, constraining Marcus’s pitch. Spatial choreography clean: two bodies circle one car, exit together. Weather (dusk) affects tone and timing, not just backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observatory is sketched with economical sensorial hits—copper dome, ridge altitude, midnight chill—that filter through Elara’s professional eye. Daylily-telegram object functions as micro-setting and returns to charge the final image; stars themselves act as environmental agents that constrain her future labor. Spatial anchoring is clear; no impossible moves. Could use one tactile beat—her hand on the brass eyepiece—to push past generic into 9-band constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard-vortex is never mere backdrop: the petrified trees groan, the cursed water dissolves spell-shards, the moss-slick rocks force barefoot choreography. The ice dome literally refracts his failure back at him, charging the final image when the pool reflects only the man who rose. Spatial tracking stays coherent; no orientation debt. Micro-setting (seed, bare feet, mirror-pool) constrains every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt glade’s living soil, violet earth, and resin-scented clipping are re-used as tactile tools: the clipping ultimately replanted becomes the literal conduit for consciousness spill; environment constrains her immobility and then enables transcendence, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Catacomb orchard is not backdrop; silver roots threading skulls constrain Elara’s foot placement and literalize the bargain’s cost, charging the final grafting of sister into trunk. Torch half-light narrows perceptual field, filtering notice to glowing fruit and warm card—objects that decide fate. Spatial choreography remains stable; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Quarry trailer as micro-setting constrains: thin walls let wind howl, making silence audible and the choice to leave harder. Sensory hierarchy is roadie-specific—wood grain, amplifier heat, mesh texture—never tourist-catalog. The Elko mention widens the map only after the present space is charged. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor’s silver-amber bark, mist-cloud deck, and bruised-purple sky are filtered through a linguist’s awe—every detail is noticed metaphorically. The magnetic tree literally re-weights her footing and reconfigures the final image; environment charges closure, satisfying 9- gate. Micro-setting of the seed-as-object also alters choice—its weightlessness dictates it be “planted in understanding,” not soil.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Brass candelabras rising from rippling pools, seawater sluicing through marble channels, and the bamboo creel worn to “aged bone” give tactile specificity that filters through Asa’s caretaker gaze. The tidal atrium’s breathing rhythm constrains every motion—Asa must time her walks, her smelting, her shelving to lunar water—so environment actively shapes procedure. Micro-setting (the creel, the leaf molds) doubles as tool and symbol without overt signalling. A hairline slip: “wintersun” is evocatively repeated but never grounded in temperature or angle that might sharpen the final serenity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal cave functions as micro-setting that literally collapses the bunker’s wall and reframes choice; the pearl’s light charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through evaluator POV—rust, quartz crunch, refracted rainbows—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the ladder descent and pool approach. Weather absent but irrelevant; no credibility dings.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Station micro-setting (ivy-furred brick, rusted track shape) directly constrains movement and metaphor: the path is obsolete yet still suggests forward motion. The accordion bellows function as portable setting—its patched leather limits her ability to play, forcing the final silent renunciation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she catalogs like a chronicler—lichen chronology, graffiti strata—never touristy. Weather is implied but not exploited; a minor lost opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing library in mist, braille-like indentations on title-less spines, and the watch’s warming silver constrain every move; the door materializes only via reflection, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—“mist pooled like spilled memories” sets tone without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography stays clean as she follows aisles to the inner sanctum. Environment actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ gate, but the watch’s reflective trick is disclosed late, a micro-slip.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal violin itself functions as micro-setting: its cold transparency alters Elena’s gestures and literally refracts the midsummer light that guides her decision. Velvet observatory, wisteria, coffee cup—each object is filtered through POV need, never tourism. Spatial choreography is clean; only the “empire of knowledge” remains a touch abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Skyborne grotto under aurora” is taught early and literally holds the young man’s suspended form; the emerald chip functions as micro-setting that constrains her final gesture, charging the image; spatial choreography is clean—“she descended”—so the environment passes the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto’s inverted geography—clouds beneath stone arches—constrains every climb and vantage; the ash’s thinning twigs physically force the climactic recognition. Sensory triage is POV-true (“petals … greeted the dawn” while the hairpin’s bronze warms). Setting never clogs momentum; instead, elevation becomes the story’s engine, recharging the final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lighthouse cliff, dawn wind, and chime topology are vividly specific and filter through Mara’s professional ear. Micro-setting objects—mirror shard, pouch, stone railing—constrain her ritual and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; environment directly guides her decision to “unhook” thoughts. Weather is not postcard but instrumental, integrating with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Environment and object interleave: the floating platform limits movement, the pond’s surface acts as mirror/timer, and the sycamore hush supplies acoustic texture that modulates with each ripple. Sensory hierarchy skews to Mina’s bias—smell of grandmother’s kitchen arrives as intrusive memory, not checklist. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track across the single scene. The grotto is named but never tactilely inhabited, a minor missed constraint that keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is the story’s engine: bone towers, wind-carved fossils, and bird-flight patterns supply the literal navigation system. The arrowhead micro-setting constrains tactile attention and reappears in the cooling beat to mark session’s end. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—dust layers, thermal currents, echo timbre—integrated into the meditation rhythm. Spatial anchors remain coherent within the single fixed vantage.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment, body, and keystone function as micro-setting: the spire’s “functional geometry” and keystone’s “internal fire” directly enable/force the mist transition. Selective sensory detail (frost catching light “almost intentional,” keystone warmth against cold air) is filtered through Mira’s custodial gaze and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean from corridor to cloud-garden; no credibility breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library’s still water, lantern-amber sinking through ceiling breach, and brass key in pocket together constrain stance—he must float motionless to receive. Meteor flash, cathedral hush, and tide-clock supply immediate sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography clean: collapsed ceiling → rippling ribbons → bookshelf wrap. Environment charges final image; removing any prop would collapse the visible-sound moment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    Amber light, weathered deck, copper disks’ residual fingerprints anchor every beat; the observatory itself functions as a resonating chamber that lets static “swell and shift.” Micro-setting succeeds: the third coin’s almost-visible tremor materially triggers Kira’s realization. Sensory selection stays biased to her ear and skin, never touristic. Setting subtly guides choice—proximity to sky, to coins, to grandmother’s rail—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Brass table, shattered dome, and copper box act as micro-setting that physically constrains handling of the atlas page. Scattered light through cracked glass is returned in the final walk into dusk, charging the closure image. Sensory selection skews visual but is filtered through Melencolia’s narrowed, centuries-old attention. Observatory cliff-edge location is vivid yet never overwhelms the 700-word budget.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sapphire viaduct’s color-shifting stone and carved drip channels are not backdrop; they supply the only tool the mage uses and charge the bell’s final glow. Micro-setting (the bell itself) constrains temperature choices and literalizes the “brittle devotion” concept, satisfying the 9+ constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Reservoir, ridgeway, and sapphire label act as micro-settings that physically constrain movement and meaning. The receding water level is tracked beat-by-beat, forcing each discovery; the label’s color survives submersion and re-enters the final image, recharging the theme of indelible memory. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices what a warden would: asphalt spine, intact foundations, corked bottles. Spatial choreography is flawless; no anchor drift.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting detail is lush yet selective: the frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; waterfall light recharges the ending image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the crystal’s tactile “weathered palms” and starlings’ acoustic swirl keep it from white-room. Spatial choreography is steady—kneeling, raising, weeping all track. Environment subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arbor’s rail and roofless night constrain every action—charts blow, fingers numb, eyes narrow to star-burn—and the parachute buckle serves as micro-setting that alters stance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: temperature drop before color, static before shape. One minor over-indulgence in “anvil lit by moonlight on one side and dark as coal on the other” slows the ascent to climax by a half-breath.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective, urgent detail: the upward-falling maple leaves, the hovering stones etched with masters’ names, the ceremonial knife as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and breath during the blade moment, mirroring the internal thaw. The floating dojo’s physics is accepted early and never contradicted; environment metaphysically mirrors the split self without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory economy: moonlight fracturing across water, eaves drip as “small revelation,” cool brook mist—all filtered through Mira’s puzzle-designer attention. Micro-setting (seed pot, water sound) constrains her nightly stance and ultimately charges the closing image of latent bloom. No exposition dumps; world-rules (seed needs highland cool) learned through action. Spatial choreography never drifts; bodies and props stay anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The echo-chamber tunnel is vividly sonic—sound “bounced back upon itself, multiplying and twisting”—and the leaf-blower’s off-key roar is tactile. Yet the household interior is a white-room: no doorway, stair, or object is touched or navigated, so the setting never constrains movement or charges the final image. Atmosphere excels, but the tunnel alone can’t carry the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frozen mist garden is rendered through guardian’s body: ice bench numbs, pendant burns scalp, pages scratch inside hair. Environment constrains the final choice—she can only leave when mist “parts slightly,” proving setting is antagonist and ally. Sensory triage favors touch over sight, matching feral POV. Micro-setting (pendant as portable hearth) charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crozier’s amethyst glint and the frost-creep across stones are filtered through Mara’s precise alchemical attention, turning setting into a crucible that constrains her ritual choices. Violet twilight and “frozen bloom” serve double duty—atmosphere and thematic mirror—without tourist clutter. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, unwrap, pyramid-build, second snap, stand and leave; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (crozier, embers, frost) actively shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted radio-tower city, swaying platform, and gorge wind constrain her posture and tool handling; the hollywood star fragment operates as micro-setting that charges the final image.

Weather and moon distance causally affect signal reception. The fragment's heat-scarred edge is returned to in the closure beat, reweighting its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Spectral grotto, starlight at impossible angles, and the flickering hull create a tactile, POV-filtered world that directly guides Maren’s choice to act as stabilizer. The empty hourglass functions as micro-setting, its weight against her hip cueing the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gallery and thread are rendered with synesthetic specificity: mirrors that lag/anticipate, thread that “sings” and leaves phosphorescent trails. These sensory objects double as micro-setting that directly constrain her choreography and charge the final image when patterns illuminate her own false memories. Spatial choreography is clean; no wasted props. Misses 9 only because the gallery’s “breathing walls” metaphor is briefly generic before the luminous thread specifics take over.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bioluminescent haze, crystalline research tower, and chain link against ribs create sensory hierarchy filtered by a sub-sea navigator’s priorities. Environment constrains: starlight must be reconstructed through miles of water, making the edge-geometry lab the only gateway—this directly shapes tactics. The final image—silent streets and the anchor link now repurposed—recharges the micro-setting with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mist, mercury glass, and the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting constrain visibility and acoustics, shaping how Elena listens and moves. Sensory selection favors hush and mercury reflections that mirror the “spaces between beats,” integrating atmosphere with theme. The atrium’s spatial logic tracks cleanly across the final exit. Environment does not alter tactics in the climax, capping entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Undersea ruin, rotted cable copper “like ancient bones,” bioluminescent pulses, and the gold flecks that sense invisible frequencies all constrain the final choice to merge. Micro-setting (the codex, her diving suit, the phase-transitional water) functions as tactical terrain. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual shimmer, tactile warmth, claustrophobic chest tightness—mirrors her shifting perception without tourist excess. The facility’s dry-core chamber inside a drowned whole is a spatial paradox that directly powers the climactic revelation.

    Magnetic nexus and worry-stone function as micro-setting: stone’s dent is mapped, magnetic currents “hum beneath his feet,” constraining his stance. Twilight and eclipse are handled as filtered perception, not weather report. Sensory economy is excellent—copper light, cool basalt—though spatial footprint beyond “among the stones” stays vague; still, the objects charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    The workshop under frost-glass stars functions as micro-setting: the brass resonator and moth-shaped clasp are tactile props whose proximity allows the tuning beats. Spatial choreography is clean—bench → ear against metal → outside step. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s vocation: sound first, then the red glare that paints walls. The setting charges the final image: sparks fall “like spent thoughts returning home,” reweighting the indoor silence she has just re-catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mosshaven’s rope-ladder altitude and greenhouse air are filtered through Kalia’s olfactory bias, constraining every move.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ice cavern functions as both backdrop and instrument: every surface becomes a vibrating bell, so the setting literally supplies the final sonic architecture. The fossilized snow altar and refracting auroral walls are handled tactilely, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean—bell, sheet, aurora, body stay tracked. Because the ice is the resonating body that delivers the certified wonder, the environment constrains and enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate; only the sculptor’s distant workshop remains a floating postcard, preventing the extra tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thunder-echo range is more than postcard: the acoustic rule forces her muteness, the dried riverbed supplies the ritual material, and the Listener’s Crossing re-appears as the exact scar-site, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the velvet case pressed to sternum) functions as emotional barometer. Spatial choreography is clean—three canyons, one junction, driftwood pattern mirroring a constellation—tracking holds throughout. Environment directly constrains her only viable action: silence and marking, not playing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Topaz workshop functions as micro-setting: the amber light is not backdrop but perceptual filter that literally colors every emotional measurement. The halo fragment is handled across ≥3 beats—falls, pulses, dissolves—charging the final image. Roofless architecture lets stars vanish directly above the presses, fusing setting to stakes. Spatial choreography is crisp: fragment on bench → lifted to chest → dissolves into her sternum, each move tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Frost-needled pines, dragonfly-wing veins, and aurora shimmer are filtered through courier eyes, constraining when she lifts the pendant into the light. Cold, wind, and altitude act on body and choice; the overlook supplies the vantage that makes valley lights become “fallen stars,” charging the final image. Micro-setting (pendant as handheld cosmos) directly enables the sympathetic vibration beat. Slight over-adjectival frost glitter, but density serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    The quartz arbor isn’t backdrop; its cold conducts emotion into Mira’s body and the prism’s refraction literally reveals hidden patterns, satisfying the 9+ gate. Frost on the abandoned windshield is handled twice—once as legible text, once as mirror—charging the final smile. Spatial choreography is exact: edge of arbor, moss stone, car window, mist between columns. Sensory selection stays biased to Mira’s synesthetic mission—no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is not backdrop but constraint: the “raveling silence” actively strips alternatives, forcing her material choice. Bamboo hush, sap light, and loom click all filter through her perceptual bias—sound as thread, light as sap. Spatial choreography is clean: bead lifted, scissors reached, body replaced by fabric. Environment charges the final image—empty loom humming where a woman once sat.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating rock arches, ash-choked trunks, and the warm-shaft micro-setting are filtered through Cael’s smith-bias: weight vs. weightlessness, surface vs. core. The arches’ indifference mirrors his initial self-erasure and later frames the green shoots that defy it. Environment constrains the final image—the arches still drift, but now over living green—charging the closure with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Repair bay is textured through Kira’s sensory map: cold metal, residual vibrations, empty crane cradle—details filter her professional gaze. The crane catwalk supplies vertical choreography that guides her ascent and final stance, charging the last image. Micro-setting (shard in pocket) constrains every move; its glow alters air pressure, integrating tool and place. Only light lapse: “colors that existed in no earthly spectrum” is generic wonder-phrasing amid otherwise sharp specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse interior is built from tactile, lived particulars: feverish stones, fossilized prayers in the walls, the ghost-heat of the dead lamp. Micro-setting objects—sea glass, stone stacks—constrain every major choice and charge the final image. Weather and tide are filtered through Maren’s professional eye; no catalogue tourism. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and stones track cleanly up the spiral stairs.

Final image of sun cascading across weathered hands re-uses established anchors, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stormlit tower, silver-lit labyrinth, and scent of “trees remembering confusion” are filtered through the warden’s professional gaze, anchoring every sense to her task. The sextant’s cracked lens and the mortar “where weather had carved rivers” act as micro-settings that constrain her method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or duplicates. Weather and moonlight causally enable the sextant’s repair and the unfolding vision, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mica greenhouse saturates every beat—phosphorescent roots, crystalline shards, refracted dawn—guiding Elara’s ritual and finally constraining the cost (the windows must shatter for light to escape). Selective sensory triage narrows to touch and sight under crisis, keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from aisle to Heart-Tree to imploding walls. Micro-setting (the silver bark she swaddles) functions as the crucible object that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bookbinders, laundromat, Thai restaurant triangulate Arbor Street within four sentences; body-as-setting appears in the crumpled fibers of the letter that she keeps kneading.

    The pirate market is evoked through sensory triage—salt, kerosene, creaking planks—filtered by Mara’s practiced gaze. Rotting-pier geography stays coherent; exits and lanterns track. The fob serves as micro-setting that finally charges the image. Weather and tide remain background; no world-rule contradiction, but environment never actively constrains her tactical choices beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Lavender bluff where purple stone met starlight” is tactile, specific, and filtered through Mira’s skeptic gaze; the aurora’s color shift mirrors her internal reconfiguration. The tin compass is handled repeatedly, constraining attention and finally charging the closure image. Micro-setting (compass on tongue) directly enables the epistemic turn. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Weathered bluff scent rises when she descends—environment participates rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Crystal cathedral acts as both gallery and accuser: shifting refracted light literalizes “auroral sorrow,” forcing Mira to confront the palette she once muted. The broken lock’s fused tumblers mirror her creative block, constraining whether she can grip a brush without self-reproach. Sensory triangulation—taste of mineral rain, weight of dead petals, charcoal grit beneath nails—anchors body inside living geode, no visual catalog. Final spotlight on blank canvas quadrant proves environment actively choreographs the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The toxic-amber sky, zinc plate worn to “metal memory,” and succulents surviving on “memory of water” are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mira’s calligrapher eye. Greenhouse tunnels and collapsed halls provide spatial pressure that funnels her to the letter-room. The plate itself acts as micro-setting/tool, constraining the final inscription choice. Only the city’s vertical scale remains slightly vague, keeping this just under exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bluff itself is rendered as an instrument—“wind pressed against the rocks and returned transformed”—and the kinetic sculpture’s chambers literally constrain how air can reach the iceberg. Bodies navigate ledges, balance mobiles, gauge distance to cloud-drift. The fragment’s blue is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Environment is not backdrop; it is the mechanism that makes the symphony possible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Glass dome, thorned stems, rebuilt hands, and fear-smoke function as micro-setting that constrains every move; roses tilt only when she inhales their dread. Magnetic drift is not backdrop but active antagonist warping nutrient lines—setting literally poisons the stake. Final image of dome intact and north relocated reprises opening sky-hum, now charged with her bodily cost. Sensory triage is POV-perfect: Cara notices scent of synthetic petals before color, fitting caretaker ontology.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored—stone tiles, bakery door, light changing—and sensory hierarchy (Elena’s curator eye for detail) stays consistent. Micro-setting objects (mailbox, locket) receive tactile handling and constrain action: the jammed slot literally blocks further letters, forcing the opening beat. Weather is used metaphorically ("sandstorm calm") rather than physically altering choices, keeping it just shy of top-band constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The submerged lab is not mere backdrop; buoyancy literally enables her dance-language and the slow drain provides the decisive environmental shift.

    Dock-side dawn, whale corpse, and salt-crystal labyrinth are rendered with tactile specificity: crystallized tears, gravity tugging at the sternum, coffee-ground spirals that double as nautical charts. The lighthouse basement arrives suddenly, but the micro-setting of the crystal chamber immediately constrains movement and choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors salt-light-gravity over visual panorama, reflecting Mira’s profession of tending invisible luminescence. Every described object either guides her descent or charges the final image; nothing is mere scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The brook, moonlit stones, and paper wing form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains her method: water provides the “frequency,” moonlight the visible signal, the wing the tactile tool she must finally relinquish. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices cold breath, paper creases, frog cessation in the order a focused ritualist would. Spatial choreography is immaculate: wing lifted by air currents, settles on water, drifts downstream—no impossible positions. The environment evolves in lockstep with the hush-ritual, charging the final image with earned quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Desk seal, antique wood-ring, and rooftop meteor shower are handled, not catalogued; seal’s embossed paper sound recurs under pressure. Third-floor east window and midnight pipes filter through Elena’s growing lexicon, constraining her willingness to breach the lie. Spatial choreography clean: door-knock, desk, ladder to roof, hand-over-hand gesture track without drift. Environment directly shapes the final silence; buildings “lean inward” to witness the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    The velvet garden at twilight is filtered through Mira’s need for sensory escape; jasmine scent and color gradients mirror her thinning skepticism without overt symbolism. Spatial anchors are clear early (edge of station, crate of effects) and the shell’s micro-chambers later function as mobile setting that constrains how memory can be received. Details are selective, POV-colored, and support the final reconfiguration. No environment-driven tactic alters the climax, so the 9-gate remains unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marble sanctuary and aurora light are not backdrop; their drip rhythm sets narrative tempo and the shifting glow literally allows secrets to be spoken, constraining when and how Yuki works. The rose thorn operates as micro-setting—handled twice, once at entry and once as signature—charging the final image with ancestral defense. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies, box, altar, wall track without drift. One extra adjective layer (“northern lights painted the vaulted ceiling in shifting ribbons of green and violet”) could be trimmed under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Desert-night sensorium is selective and POV-filtered: “dry riverbeds,” “silver shadows,” “persistent question” keep the palette tight. The cracked seashell acts as micro-setting, handled twice and warmed in palm—its changing state charges the final image. Starlight shift is used as causal timer, not postcard. Spatial choreography stays clean; canyon acoustics are woven through action instead of backdrop lists. One of the stronger showings in the piece.

No environmental detail is wasted; all props either constrain motion or reappear in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-window micro-setting succeeds: west-facing sun angle, bench tool order, and velvet case constrain attention and echo confessional light. The shop’s proximity to bakery/tailor is named but never used, a missed tactile opportunity. Heart-as-setting functions better—brass catching light guides the final inscription decision. Overall selectivity beats white-room, but environment never actively endangers or resource-blocks the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The kaleidoscope’s brass cylinder, arrow slot, and acid-etched gears act as micro-setting; their exact angles constrain the climactic frequency shift.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dawn library is filtered through a lexicographer’s eye: dust motes mapped like vocabulary, shelves spiralling like vines. The chandelier crystal doubles as micro-setting; its sonic properties constrain Elias’s final decision to return it. Light angles, timber expansion, and the 1847 wheat-germ proportions give tactile history without catalogue bloat. One spatial slip—“pressing it into his palm” under dimming lights—never breaks choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Fog, mossy videotapes, and chalky soap texture are filtered through Mira’s prophet-gaze; every object drips with abandoned memory and guides her feet. The dry fountain functions as micro-setting that forces the final listening stance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal forecourt’s post-rain whine, the bear’s weight on cold stones, and the clock’s brass guts all function as micro-settings that constrain mood and finally the act of winding. Each detail is filtered through the narrator’s professional eye—gear teeth like memory, light through water—never touristic. The sanctuary’s rules stay consistent: silence amplifies small sounds, sunrise arrives late, bear moves without threat. The setting itself enforces the final choice by offering absolute quiet in which the first tick becomes audible.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—will he break the twenty-year freeze and wind the clock?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each return of petrichor, crystal hiss, and bear breath thickens the emotional density until refusal becomes impossible. The single micro-turn occurs when the bear’s “excruciatingly gentle” presence models the patience required; the narrator’s agency crystallizes in the key-turn. Cost is audible—the sanctity of silence is permanently broken, a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Canal, barge, twilight, and pocket sundial function as micro-setting that directly shapes tactics: the sundial’s shadow tells her which unused channel to probe, the brick repairs mark where to moor.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian lagoon and volcanic sand are not backdrop but instrument: the sand’s heat-retention mirrors her own delayed grief, and the water’s light-absorbing surface supplies the final reversal image. Micro-setting (coin, turnout coat) constrains the beat where she presses warm sand to cheek. Spatial choreography is immaculately tracked: kneel-scoop-sift-pocket-rise. No encyclopedic dumps; every sensory pick is filtered through firefighter priorities (heat, weight, reflectivity).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Fountain detritus, cracked tiles, algae-green serpents—selective sensory hits evoke neglect and constrain Mira’s slow excavation. The stained-glass box itself functions as micro-setting, its shifting mosaics guiding her tactile method. Final image of the arm-less statue mirrors the relinquished burden, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nebula garden is not backdrop but pressure source—petals fall against zero-g, roots drink diffuse matter—constraining Vael’s transit and charging the final image when the gear’s cold flame spreads through that same medium. Sensory triage is POV-true: luminous fog, brass teeth catching starlight, metallic heartbeat against translucent flesh. Spatial choreography holds across the 300-league drift. Environment fulfills the 9+ gate by shaping the stakes and final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse glass, monarch-stained sky, and moss-covered table function as micro-setting that constrains her choice to speak the poem aloud—humidity carries sound, glass holds ghosts. Sensory hierarchy obeys a carver’s eye: texture of moss, color of rust, squeak of flagstone. Spatial choreography stays clean as she moves from pane to table to threshold, each position tightening the ritual. No 9.0 because the estate’s broader geography remains vague, but that vagueness never affects the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Obsidian ridge, clock-tower iron, and brass pendulum are filtered through Marcus’s professional eye; black glass catching “dying light like frozen flames” mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Velveteen gloom, starlight aperture, and ivy-scented air give immediate sensory grip; the cobalt silo’s acoustics absorb sound and time, nicely guiding the hush needed for close attention to the tapestry. The cemetery ladders and weathered stones root us, while the silo acts as micro-setting that isolates the moral focus. Detail is selective—no catalog of epitaphs—yet the ladder left “long ago” is a loose prop (who left it? why still solid?) that slightly undercuts physical credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher feather operate as micro-setting that constrains the final act: cold rigidity mirrors the constraint she embraces, feather’s river shimmer supplies the ink’s blue.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The micro-setting—alcove, candle, short-wave dial glow, coal brazier—directly constrains her tactics (must hide the amber light, must work small). Mist functions as living audience, pressing the windows, a pressure that grows with the broadcast. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Mira’s copyist ear: “every note preserved was a story saved,” not visual spectacle. Final image charges the same setting: dust motes in that very alcove become the medium of rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Gallery, chair, porcelain shards, and scattered soot form a single, evolving micro-setting that literally supplies the materials of ritual; every description funnels into Mira’s hands. Light change from “scattered” to “dimming” tracks emotional cadence and forces the final exit. Porcelain’s former domestic safety is weaponized into cutting shards, a concrete constraint that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The brass chronometer cog functions as micro-setting; handled twice and charged in the final image, its “sharp teeth” become the emblem of precision that outlives both sea and state. Coral-encrusted streets and silt-filled plazas are filtered through the narrator’s archaeological eye, guiding choice—every layer he decodes commits him deeper to isolation. Sensory economy is excellent: “water-stained walls still bearing charcoal marks” collapses sight, history, and tool in one stroke. Environment constrains action—he works underwater, in ruined office, with limited air and light—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Velvet library, amber leaves, and the zither’s rosette supply sensory filtration that mirrors interior subtraction; micro-setting (worn wood under thumb) constrains her ritual and final image. Light, fabric, and wood are returned to in cadence, charging the hush with palpable residue. Environment never becomes a prop, but it also never actively endangers or resource her tactics beyond ambience.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop; its “iron bones weeping orange tears” mirrors Elena’s own decay-to-rebirth arc and guides her physical choices of where to kneel and prune. Broken glass, silver light, and dead vines evolve with each cut, tightening atmosphere without descriptive bloat. The seed’s glow and the celestial alignment are selective sensory anchors, never tourist-catalog. Setting constrains the final image: the ruin becomes the kitchen she will inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Copper spire, internal threads, and the cracked central reservoir are tactile, choice-relevant details; the tower’s silence after the climb directly mirrors Elara’s fear of being unheard. “Nectar dusk” risks lyric cliché but is saved by the mother-of-pearl box that catches the same honey-violet light, turning sky color into object gleam, a nice convergence. Spatial choreography holds: booth → stairs → reservoir apex, bodies never float. World rule (bottled atmosphere as currency) is learned through weighing action, not lecture, satisfying economy bias.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Salt-worn clapboard, orris ghost, tide-worn path—selective sensory triangulation roots us fast and keeps pressure local.

Sensory economy favors scent and light over visual catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Waterfall-as-wall, emerald refraction, and mossy stone are knotted to action (lens-held-to-water, bread passed hand-to-hand), so environment constrains secrecy and later enables emergence. The grotto’s acoustic roar and thaw-runoff timing are used, not scenery, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lighthouse, tide, hunger stone, and salt-sawdust workroom are textured and POV-filtered. The yoyo’s cold, gravity-defying string and backward-casting shadows function as micro-setting that directly enables the final unmaking, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One missed opportunity: the clocks themselves never constrain a mid-scene action—they decorate rather than complicate.

    The time-frozen village isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Mira’s choice to decode the tapestry during the lull, knowing movement may resume imminently. The platinum labyrinth constrains her psychologically (avoidance → confrontation) and charges the final image by reflecting the darkening sky as she achieves clarity. Sensory detail is selective: breath curls, frozen leaves that “never decompose,” thunder’s “sacred” lull—all filtered through her exiled tutor’s perception. The tapestry’s “woven hush” absorbs sound, making its discovery tactilely specific.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bone towers aren’t backdrop—they’re active: surfaces for writing, sources of echo, spatial anchors for choreography. The canyon’s “forged hush” and midday shadows physically constrain light and sound, making Sera’s poetry both rebellion and tactical necessity. The pale spire pulses in response, proving environment reacts to human action. Final image of mist thick with truth charges the setting as co-conspirator.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints: the hull’s shudder dictates timing, the copper surface smokes with imminent destruction. The key ring charm and statue function as micro-settings that charge the ending: the charm’s symbols, once forgotten, become a “promise of continuation” when pressed to the statue’s cratered heart. Sensory detail (smoking sea, tarnished brass, marble pockmarks) is selective, urgent, and filtered through the alchemist’s desperate focus.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coastal cave functions as both physical and psychological micro-setting: its echoing darkness mirrors Marcus’s internal silence, while the hidden pool constrains his final choice. The seashell and painted replica are object-as-setting, directly charging the climax. Luminescent water isn’t just atmosphere—it’s the thematic locus where “temporary eternity” becomes visible. Every detail serves pressure or closure without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse, bruised clouds, and night garden aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. The heat-turned-stone steps shape Mira’s physical state; the jasmine’s rarity makes its sacrifice meaningful; the lens housing is both tool and altar. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: cobalt walls catching morning light echo the earlier “bruised clouds,” now healed, mirroring the calm waters sailors speak of.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible that isolates Elara between storms, forcing confrontation with her failure. The crow quill, canyon of clouds, and ozone-laced air all constrain choice: only here, suspended, can crystallization become ink. The body functions as micro-setting—her palms scarred, her tears diamonding—directly enabling the final inscription. Every detail serves the climax; the gray light catching the quill’s tip is reused to ignite the luminous runes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the sheet music archive isn’t backdrop but crucible—dead composers’ unfinished scores mirror the sisters’ abandoned symphony. The perfume bottle and chainsaws are tools that constrain choice (Eleanor must act before destruction) and charge the final image (bottle pocketed amid falling trees). Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: calm opening (violet glass, garden scent) narrows to crisis (static voice, coughing saw). Environment directly shapes stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Archive of Unwritten Endings is rendered with exceptional specificity—stones predating light, shelves as monuments to stardust civilizations, corridors folding like ghost-read pages.

    The forgotten library inside a sunken city functions as both setting and micro-setting: its submerged silence, candlelit stacks, and false panels actively shape Mira’s perception and discovery. The ink stamp—a recurring object—constrains choice (authentication) and charges the final image (her own future annotations). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “density” of quiet, “worn smooth” handle, “candlelight alone” all filter through Mira’s professional attention. The environment doesn’t just reflect theme—it enables the central revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The floating island tea garden functions as micro-setting: its cloud-sea steam, crystalline bushes, and suspended grief-pressure directly shape Mira’s craft and isolation. The gem, crane paper, and lantern core are tools that constrain choice—only azure paper, only dream-polished gems. Final image charged by setting: the garden shivers during ascension, yet Mira remains grounded, reinforcing her descent-as-method. Sensory detail filtered through her professional bias and sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s a charged micro-setting that constrains choice: tethered to ruins, it enables observation but forbids intervention. The geode, as object-as-setting, evolves from inert heirloom to responsive oracle, its crystals scattering light into “geometries that look... like answers.” Sensory detail is filtered through trauma: scorched stone, humming cables, purple twilight—all serve the protagonist’s fractured cognition. The final image hinges on this setting-object interplay.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The obsidian floor, brass instruments, copper dome, and desert ridge aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the sealed relay requires stellar alignment; the tarnished tools signal time’s passage; the open dome frames the celestial language. The “brilliant dimness” of the mechanism’s glow charges the final image, merging setting and theme. Sensory detail is selective—sunlight on tool marks, warmth of the chip—and filtered through Mira’s observational bias. The observatory functions as micro-setting that enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “cobalt terrace” and “forgotten shore” are economically rendered yet deeply atmospheric, with dusk and tide mirroring Maren’s internal erosion. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the driftwood carvings exist only here, forcing her method of reckoning. The watch hand’s tarnished gleam in dying light charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Minor deduction for “cobalt” verging on decorative—it doesn’t alter tactics beyond mood—but the tactile shore (bones, tides, smooth wood) grounds every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storm-worn parapet isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that pressures choice: neutral territory dictates where and how they meet, and the mist physically obscures their exchange. The brass drawer pull functions as object-as-setting, its tactile history charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (stone beneath boots, mist curling “like breath held too long”) and filtered through professional urgency. The moon’s emergence silvering the parapet directly reweights the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal launch isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: boulders, ramp, and especially the cedar poles shape Elara’s altered tactics. The astronomical compass functions as micro-setting, its brass warmth contrasting early coldness to mark internal shift. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (salt spray, choppy water) then calibration (pole alignment). Final image of “gathering light” recharges the gray morning with earned hope, avoiding overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underground lake functions as both setting and micro-setting: its bioluminescent walls pulse “in patterns that seemed almost conversational,” directly enabling Vera to read hidden messages and charging the final encounter. The baseball—a recurring object—constrains choice by anchoring her journey and warming as she nears the core chamber, tying tactile sensation to thematic revelation. Every sensory detail (worn leather, shimmering ink, pale blue-green water) reflects Vera’s perceptual bias—seeking meaning in absence—and evolves with her progression. The environment doesn’t just backdrop; it actively mediates knowledge and emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is not mere backdrop but an active micro-setting that supplies resources (spices gathered over years, ancient stones) and constrains choice: ritual must occur here, at this liminal site. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—starlight fruit, silver light, fragrant spices—filtered through Lysara’s heightened perception, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The environment charges the final image: moonlight “pooling like welcome” mirrors her acceptance, and the eternal spring reflects the timelessness of her new role. Only minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual lyricism in early lines.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The midnight glade functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its liminal altitude constrains the protagonist’s quest (“where earth surrendered to sky”) and charges the final image. The cracked saucer and birthday cloth are tactile extensions of environment, each shaping choice—the saucer’s fracture directs moonlight like “time itself bleeding,” enabling the climax. Sensory detail is selective (molten silver mist, choking beauty) and filtered through grief, never decorative. The setting’s impossibility mirrors the thematic impossibility of retrieving lost time.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its patchwork hull, gravity pools, and obsolete photo chemicals directly constrain Seraph’s actions and tools. The observation deck’s faded photographs aren’t backdrop but active medium—she stitches through them, and their dried tears respond. The “locked dimension” pressing like a painted-shut door merges spatial metaphor with physical reality, charging the final image. Every detail serves texture and constraint, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The black sand beach, volcano, and eclipse aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the warm-cool sand permits standing, the forbidden shore signals redirection, and the celestial dance times the release of light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Mara hears the tide’s “hesitation,” feels the volcano’s “breath”—avoiding tourist cataloguing. The recurring jars function as micro-setting, constraining her philanthropy to acts of timed release. Final image (“black sand would remember her footsteps”) charges the environment with legacy, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    The luminous fort, twilight, and blackout aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the blackout enables discovery, the half-painted sundial supplies coded resistance, and the bronze quill’s resonance only works in this specific spatial relationship. Sensory detail is selective (amber glow, weathered stone, faint click) and filtered through Elara’s sentinel priorities. The micro-setting—the sundial and quill—constrains the pivotal choice and charges the final image. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves pressure or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless stone aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. Mira’s bare feet on “strange, frictionless stone” that “no longer posed any threat” shows adaptation. The aurora isn’t decorative; it’s the only time eels appear, gating action. Crushed star dust on rocks charges the final image, making setting inseparable from method and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stormlit observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s active pressure: wind screams against the dome, lightning illuminates the chamber, rain patters as revelation arrives. The darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-settings, constraining choice (she measures breath, not exposure; clings to transit as metaphor). Final image—writing on glass—is charged by the setting’s impermanence and altitude. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: touch (cold railing), sound (timer, thunder), then sight (amber afterimage).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial form a micro-setting that actively constrains and reflects the conflict: light patterns encode meaning, water’s indifference contrasts human urgency, and spatial choreography remains coherent. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Varn notices coded angles, not flora. The mechanical arm and needle card function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Only minor deduction: the “fragrant air” feels generic amid otherwise precise environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rusted library functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining and enabling choice: its skeletal beams frame intimacy, its disarray invites reordering, its nocturnal openness permits clandestine creation. The coffee tin, moonlight, and security towers are filtered through Mira’s poetic perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. Sensory detail is selective—warm metal, silver light, looping handwriting—each advancing emotional stakes. The final image (“fractured light, luminous and incomplete”) charges the environment with thematic weight, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station and tidal arbor are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail that reflects Elias’s perceptual bias—e.g., the “bruised violet” sunset, the “cloud-density” piano. The broken clock and compasses function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices. The tidal arbor isn’t mere backdrop; it’s a liminal space that enables the climax and embodies the story’s thematic core. Slight deduction: the roof transition lacks tactile grounding, creating a minor spatial gap before the membrane thins.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Verid’s setting is economically specific: seventeen sky-shades, memory-moths, reflecting pools—all filtered through Mira’s professional attention. The ancient ridge isn’t backdrop but micro-setting: its bloom-flower enables the ritual, and its elevation creates urgency against flooding. The knowledge fruit seed’s “colors that belonged to no known spectrum” constrains interpretation methods and charges the final image. Only minor deduction: the “forgotten crops” terrace lacks tactile interaction beyond scent, slightly weakening spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The islet functions as micro-setting: rain-washed green, salt air, and palm-frond breeze aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Marek’s perception and pace. Tools (bonsai shears, compass) and objects (lace) are handled with tactile specificity that charges the final image—pruning becomes metaphor made physical. Sensory hierarchy reflects calm urgency: focus on light shifts on lace, moisture on skin, wind rhythm. Only missed opportunity: breeze doesn’t *alter* a choice, merely mirrors internal shift—but compass-and-lace mechanics compensate fully.
