  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating tea garden and glass basilica are vividly rendered across senses and filtered through Elias’s craft-bias (tools, fibers, facets). Setting details are purposeful (tea fibers for dream-weave, basilica panes charging light) and charge the final image (cranes igniting tea leaves). World rules remain consistent and learned through action. While environment rarely constrains choice, it strongly charges and evolves with events.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory, storm turbulence, ozone tang, and the cooling breakers create a vivid, pressured milieu that constrains choices. The geode as micro-setting/object is integrated into action and charges the final image. World rules feel consistent within the speculative premise and are learned through use. Strong economy—most details serve pressure or character.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient observatory, brass telescope, and dusk-to-night gradient are vivid and functionally integrated, shaping tactics (telescope positioning, star trails visibility). The “brilliant dimness” recurs as a tonal and spatial container, charging the final image. Tool-as-setting (matrix chip, console) is smartly leveraged. Detail selection remains purposeful and filtered through a pilot’s attention.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shore and terrace are vivid, selective, and character-filtered (“sieved hush,” driftwood faces, clock-etched wood). Setting is used, not toured: the beach ritual constrains his method and the watch hand charges the final image. Sensory economy is strong with tactile and auditory details woven through action. The environment subtly mirrors his inner tangle without shouting symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The parapet, mist, wind, surf, and moon are vivid and POV-filtered, shaping cadence and tone. The neutral midpoint on the parapet and the moon-timed protocol subtly guide choreography and options. The final image (wind easing, stars pricking, descent of stairs) is charged by the environment-object weave. Occasional overt symbolism skims the surface but doesn’t blunt specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Coastal Oregon, phosphorescence, and the utility poles as a “terrestrial constellation” create a vivid, integrated milieu that shapes tactics. The kayak launch and weather constraints are functional, not postcard. Object-as-setting (the compass) helps charge the final image. Minor over-symbolism is present but mostly filtered through Elias’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid and integral—its glow alters perception, the stone paths enforce tactical choices, and the final image is charged by the contrast between fading external light and internal illumination. Sensory selection (cooler air, dripping corridors, phosphorescent algae) deepens mood without overstuffing. The environment constrains options at the fork, not a postcard backdrop. World rules feel consistent within the piece’s frame.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard and moonlit rules meaningfully enable the ritual (“making such feats possible in this timeless grove”), and the spice-scent charges the final image.

A few overtly symbolic lines skirt excess but do not break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The midnight glade above the clouds, stone altar, and mists are vividly filtered through POV and charged with purpose (a locus where lost time pools; clouds hiding the sleeping daughter). Recurring objects (cloth, ink, saucer) are integrated with place and culminate in the final image. Environment constrains tactic selection—this ritual can only occur here as framed by the story’s logic. Lush detail rarely drifts into ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The recycled spaceship and low gravity are vivid and functional, with the archive chamber and cracked viewports shaping texture and action. The environment contributes to the buoyancy beat and frames the ritual’s solitude. Objects-as-setting (photos, tear) are integrated and charge the final image. World rules remain consistent and taught through use.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Black sand, sulfur-salt air, and the volcano’s tempered flows meaningfully charge the images and the ending; environment isn’t a postcard. The celestial alignment and obsidian paths entwine setting with outcome. Sensory texture is rich across sight/sound/smell, filtered by Elias’s giving gaze. A slight excess of decorative phrasing occasionally competes with action, but the place constrains the prophecy and final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The luminous fort, emergency crystals, half-painted sundial, and high window moonlight are vivid and integrated into action. The quill holder and sundial function as lived tools that constrain tactics and charge the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition. Atmosphere and setting meaningfully shape choice without becoming a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    World and micro-setting are richly specific (frictionless sea, aurora’s electromagnetic caress) and meaningfully operative. The environment actively enables the method and charges the final image. Detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s pattern-obsessed lens. Occasional lushness risks saturation but never erases spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, storm, and timer are tactile and recur with purpose; weather and altitude meaningfully shape his isolation and the descent choice. Detail selection is purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog. The timer’s glow and the storm’s pressure charge the final image. Strong atmosphere without static repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s priorities. The sundial and needle card function as micro-setting tools that shape tactics and the ending image. Environmental sound (“brook’s murmurs”) and light constraints (angles) interact with action rather than sit as postcards. Tone and spatial choreography remain coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted, roofless library under stars is vivid and filters every choice (moonlight as cover, exposure to guard light). Objects-as-setting (coffee tin, warped shelves) are handled, not just described, and charge the final image. Environmental constraint (open yard, surveillance) meaningfully shapes tactics. Sensory texture is purposeful and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal arbor is vivid and specific (petrified waves, bioluminescent fungi, driftwood piano) and actively shapes discovery, tools, and tactics (reel wedged in bark; projector from vines; arbor as nexus). Environmental and object micro-setting (clock/compass) charge the final image. World rules are learned through action rather than dump. Sensory texture stays POV-filtered and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ridge, orchids, pre-monsoon atmosphere, and fog of forgetfulness are vivid and POV-filtered, not touristy. The environment constrains choices (pre-monsoon timing, planting site) and charges the final image (shoot glistening under moonlight, flowers “awaiting judgment”). World rules (dreams that can reshape reality) remain consistent. Sensory detail supports theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The islet after rain, the sun breaking haze, and seawater are not just décor; they supply resources and constraints (sunlight and brine to “diffuse” and reveal the hue). Objects-as-setting (compass, lace, bonsai) are integrated and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered through a bonsai tutor’s precision. Slightly lush accumulation stops short of overindulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is superb, with the "terra-cotta arbor" and the "antique silver bell" functioning as more than backdrop.

This integration of setting into the core magical mechanism is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as an active antagonist and a physical manifestation of the story's core themes. Descriptions like "veins of an ancient earthbound leviathan" are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional, both atmospheric and functional. The abandoned carnival is not mere backdrop; it houses the central clue (the piano) and provides the tools for the climax (the prize counter for cover). The final image of planting in the "dry soil" where the wall's shadow lay directly constrains the final action and powerfully charges the story's thematic closure. The sensory details are vivid and purposeful, establishing a memorable and integrated world.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)

This integration of environment and plot is of the highest caliber, easily satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a significant strength, working as more than a backdrop. The "rusted library perched on a cliffside...open to the night sky" creates a potent atmosphere of forgotten truths and exposed vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.6)
    The setting is a masterclass in atmospheric and functional world-building. The storm-tossed fort is not merely a backdrop but an amplifier for the story’s core concepts ("The fort's isolation amplified the tone of marbled hush").

The sensory details are selective, purposeful, and filtered perfectly through the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a standout success, with the frozen courtyard and twilight atmosphere being both evocative and integral to the plot.

The environment is fully integrated into the narrative's climax and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    The atmosphere of "icy warmth" is established immediately and sustained effectively.

The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Sage Ridge setting is exceptional, functioning as a character and a core thematic element. The recurring image of "dreaming roots" is not just descriptive but constrains the story's central metaphor for endurance and hidden life.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere is superb, weaving a tangible sense of the mystical and cosmic from abstract concepts. While the macro-setting is conceptual, the micro-settings—the loop pedal and the single-color palette—are concrete and functional. These objects directly constrain and enable the character's choices, charging the final image and satisfying the criteria for excellence, but the score is capped by flaws elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the story's thematic and emotional landscape. The "glass spire," "frozen lake," and "mirrored horizon" are integral to the core concepts of inversion, reflection, and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning not just as a backdrop but as a core thematic and narrative engine. The greenhouse for extinct plants, with its "ghostly fragrances" and alchemical revival, perfectly mirrors Elias's struggle with lost memories and fragile hopes. The "crystal shadows" and the "ultraviolet revealing" method are not mere details; they constrain the action and charge the final, revelatory image, making the setting indispensable to the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a significant strength, moving effectively from the evocative general setting of "dust-choked roadsides" to the specific, charged micro-setting of the "terra-cotta grotto."

Furthermore, the frayed rope functions as a powerful object-as-setting, embodying the character's past and constraining the final, crucial choice, thereby charging the closure image perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is the story's most powerful and fully realized element. The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by the skeletal husks of shipwrecks" is a spectacular, original image that is deeply integrated into the narrative. It's not just a backdrop; the pooled water is used in the central ritual, and the greenhouse's cracked glass filters the light and contains the sound, directly constraining and shaping the scene's action and atmosphere. This is a masterful use of environment to drive theme and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "amber grotto at dusk" is a masterclass in purposeful setting. It is not mere backdrop; its fading, honeyed light directly mirrors Elara's internal shift, creating a resonant atmosphere. More critically, the "fragrance chemist's blotter petal" functions as a tool that is indispensable to the climax, charging the final moments where her transformation completes. The environment is so integral that removing it would gut the story's tonal and thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vividly rendered, creating a strong, evocative atmosphere with details like the "breezy library perched on the cliffside" and "lanterns flickered like hesitant fireflies." The sensory details are well-chosen and filtered through the point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but functionally integral to the plot. The "glimmering obsidian arbor" and the "shimmering crater" are more than backdrops; they are active environments that hold the secrets necessary for the plot to advance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.4)
    The "shadowed library" and its "dim underbelly" are more than a backdrop; they are a crucible for the character's conflict and a direct constraint on his choices. The recurring "sapphire hush" motif effectively charges the atmosphere and the final image, creating a cohesive and evocative world. The environment is so integral that removing it would collapse the entire narrative logic, easily passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional and a primary driver of the story's success.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as a primary antagonist and a core driver of the plot. The "musical crystal cave" and its "bright darkness" are rendered with vivid, multi-sensory detail that creates a unique and compelling atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength: "ivory spires," a harbor "carved from ancient ivory bones of leviathans," and the "rain-slicked docks" create a potent atmosphere. It's more than just a backdrop; the tide pool directly yields the herald's trumpet valve, a key object that constrains Elara's choices and is essential for the story's climax. The environment charges the final image, fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, purposeful sensory details creating a palpable sense of mystery and magic.

This excellent integration of environment and object easily satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is both atmospheric and functional, with the sterile, liminal space of the prep room mirroring Elena's moral limbo. Specific details like the "sharp tang of formaldehyde" and the "cold steel table" are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional and indispensable. The bonsai labyrinth—a curated, miniaturized wilderness—acts as a perfect crucible for the character's work of crafting "invented histories." The fluorescent lamp, a piece of salvaged technology, becomes a tool that interacts with this natural setting, constraining and enabling the central action of "refracting" the past. Every detail, from the gold flecks to the damp soil, is purposeful and charges the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.7)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the story's central organizing principle and primary metaphor. The "towering labyrinth of shipping containers" directly constrains action, with the tides dictating movement ("high water forcing retreats to higher stacks"). This environmental pressure is essential to the plot's rhythm and charges the final image, where the wanderer finds a "precarious perch" to synthesize their collected histories. Specificity is superb and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, with the abandoned observatory functioning as a crucible for the character's transformation. Specific details, like dust motes as "forgotten constellations" and the roaring sea, create a powerful, melancholic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional, moving far beyond mere backdrop to become an active agent in the plot. The "mist-coated rail depot" provides both the central problem (the need for guidance through fog) and the tools for the solution (rainwater from the eaves, refracted light from the sun). This integration, where environment constrains choice and charges the final image, is seamless and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)

    Tidal arbor actively constrains choices (vines for projector, tides for rhythm) and charges the final image where "tidal branches curling protectively" reconfigures sanctuary into launchpad. Micro-setting qualifies as environment shaping tactics and closure.

    Micro-setting triumph: the seed constrains every choice and charges the final image ("shoot glistening under moonlight"). "Pre-monsoon warmth" and "loamy heart" anchor tactile urgency, though dream faces verge on symbolic over literal constraint.

    Islet constrains choices (seawater collection, compass discovery) and charges the final image, but verbatim "rhythmically placid" repetition triggers a -0.2 Text Artifact Screen deduction despite micro-setting strength.
