Sensory detail is vivid and selective (oil that never dries; buttered popcorn ghosting the air) and filtered through his professional bias. World rules are learned through action, not exposition. The environment charges the closure by making “cracks” functionally become the gate to the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass orchard library, cloud sea, frost, bottle, and press are vivid and functional; they constrain tactics (printing as only viable action) and charge the ending (fall/dissolve). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through a craftsperson’s eye. World rules (negotiable reality, liquid time) are learned through action, not dump. The final frost etch and cloud rise prove the environment’s agency in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The baroque asteroid, cathedral, storm, and time‑threads are not just vivid; they constrain choice and enable the ritual, charging the final image (“did not mind the sight of time”). Details are POV‑filtered through an architect‑poet’s sensibility, avoiding tourist catalog. The storm’s charged particles and covered mirrors function as micro‑setting tools with consequences. Spatial and rule consistency stay tight across the vision beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The resonance chamber and brass walls are vividly specific and POV‑filtered; sensory choices (hum, vibration, brass veins glowing) are purposeful and evolve with the action. The chamber’s acoustics and “leaning in” charge the ritual and the ending image (walls unspooling to dawn). While it more charges than constrains choice, it functions as an object‑as‑setting that amplifies the cost. Integration is tight and economical throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Limestone cliffs, a half‑collapsed maw, and mineral‑starred walls are vivid and POV‑filtered; the lagoon tangibly shapes choices (wading, touch, suspension). The arch and water physics constrain action and generate the core event. The setting charges the final quiet with the factory skeleton and waiting lagoon in counterpoint. Object‑as‑setting (compass/arch) integrates seamlessly with environment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)
    The storm and archway are vivid and tactile (“salt-crusted stone,” “wind howling… like a choir of lost things”). The arch functions as a constraint and engine for choice, literally shaping the final act and image. Objects-as-setting (slide, driftwood, arch) charge the ending. World rules stay coherent through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The pavilion, garden, and cathedral window are vivid and functional; setting is not backdrop but mechanism and reliquary.

Sensory texture (ozone, old paper, groaning brass) supports tone without stalling movement. World rules stay consistent and enact meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and POV-filtered (salt and burnt sugar; lanterns; phosphorescent tide), with sensory specificity escalating alongside the conceiving. The bottle and tide charge the final image, and the cove’s market-sounds reweight the world-rules on the page. Environment informs tactics (kneeling in sand; not opening his eyes) even if constraints are subtle rather than forcible. Strong integration without mere postcarding.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The orchard‑atop‑a‑skyscraper is exquisitely integrated and constrains choice: he selected this site for its contradictions, and the final act (burying under the oldest tree) depends on this environment. Sensory specificity is rich but purposeful (salt‑thick air, petals, pear trees grafted from a monastery). Setting rules are consistent and learned via action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The atrium’s ice, iron ribs, ozone bite, and starlight aren’t postcard; they pressure choices and shape the tactic (vortex beneath, ice cracking, starlight pooling to aid reversal). Recurring objects (acorn cap, frost, roots) function as micro‑settings that constrain action and charge the final image. World rules are taught through use, not exposition. Spatial and sensory choreography stays crisp under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The windblown sanctuary, bell, and rope are vividly rendered and directly constrain tactics (leaving slack for wind passage). Sensory detail serves pressure rather than postcard description. The final image is charged by the place’s altitude and weather dynamics. Occasional lyric flourish skirts purple but stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    The station, dome, alarms, and lantern glass are vivid, selective, and POV‑filtered; the environment hums and constrains via the dome and alarm system.

World rules are learned through observation without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vividly particular and filtered through the poet’s perceptual bias (wet salt, crushed reeds, cobalt shallows shifting to bruise‑violet). Environment and objects constrain action: the feather becomes a quill; the shallows enable retrieval; dawn’s indecision mirrors and pressures his method. Recurring elements charge the final image (feather bridging kite and notebook; the lagoon’s “recognition”). Lush but purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly specific and instrumental: hollow pillars, fungal chambers, and copper‑fed trees shape options and tactics. The environment constrains choices (wiring to navigate flaws, elders’ symmetry fetish) and charges the ending (pillars “sigh” as Tomas begins). Detail is POV‑filtered through Elira’s botanical eye, avoiding tourist catalog. World logic (copper oxidation, nutrient trade) reads plausible and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rainwashed tower, ivy-swallowed sculptures, and bronze-filigree door are vivid and functionally constraining—the environment literally shapes the path and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The micro‑setting and recurring object do real work: the observation deck’s sealed glass, thin air, and dead alarms shape action and tone, while the compass rose constrains choice and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (frost, breath fog, hollow chime). World rules (time stretch) are conveyed through perception and used at the climax. The final image of the gleaming applique with the needle fixed ties setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ice spire and wrong sky are sensorially vivid and rule‑consistent, and they constrain choice (arduous climb, easier descent once the exchange reweights the place). Recurring objects—sundial lid, chessboard—function as micro‑settings that guide tactics and charge the final image. The environment participates in closure (the spire sings; the sky reconfigures), not just decorates it. Detail selection stays filtered through Lirien’s thief‑craft and wonder ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery and dusted floor aren’t decorative; they enable her tactic of word‑walking and carry the acoustic motif into closure. The chessboard functions as micro‑setting/object that palpably charges the ending (splinters to wings; reassembles). Sensory economy is sharp (warm wood “like a second heart,” echoes as layered sediment). World rules remain consistent within the lyrical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain-bookstore is vivid and integral, not a backdrop: false wall, spiral stacks, lectern room shape options and the final image.

The setting functions as pressure and as charged micro‑setting through the key/object.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid and sensorially rich—the cave’s bioluminescent dome and “pool so still” are unforgettable and charged. Environment constrains and enables choice (the pool’s “temporary eternity” allows the shell’s reveal and the final leap “through”). Details are filtered through Elias’s painterly bias (ochre, sunsets), integrating world and character. Scale and specificity remain proportionate to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lighthouse at dawn is specific and lived‑in (iron ribs humming, cool lantern glass, harbor choreography), and it functions as medium and constraint for the “vibrations of intent.” Sensory economy is excellent, especially scent and sound. The recurring object (cork) and the lantern/oil frame the final image. Minor restraint: the broader world remains narrow by design, which suits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The signal station, antennas, and sea air are vivid and purposeful, shaping the means (radio/phone) and mood of the work.

World rules (reversible exile, mirrors) are consistent and learned in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    The parapet, waterfall, and orchard are sensorially vivid and functionally constrain choice (the cleft/veil is the only ingress). Tools and objects-as-setting (knife, seed) charge the final images (the silver sapling, unnameable apple). The environment shapes tactics—he must go to the veil and use the orchard’s living materials. World rules are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prism sanctuary, oil lamp, net, and needle are vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s craft. Setting charges the final image: prisms shatter, starlight silvering the harbor, needle left on the altar reframed as promise.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful—the vault, frescoes, rain, henge, and projection apparatus all shape perception and the final cadence. The environment charges the last image (rain returns; the vault “exhales”; the hum persists), and the henge functions as a temporal instrument. Sensory curation reflects Elara’s professional bias. A small constraint: while the henge influences choice, more overt spatial constraint would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned library and submersible world are tactile and filtered through a professional’s eye; the snow globe functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image and constraining attention.

    The fog‑shrouded sculpture garden and shore are vivid and tactically relevant: fog guides alignment, statues alter options, and driftwood functions as a navigational tool. The environment charges the final image (tide taking the arrows; the sea as “rewind”). Sensory detail remains selective yet lush across sight, sound, and taste (“static,” “salt,” “metal”). The world rules—haunted yet material—stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lunar observatory, central tower, gears, and cameras are vivid and functionally integrated—tools and environment drive the choice and charge the ending. The spinning hand operates as micro‑setting/object that constrains action; the cameras’ refracting time reframes reality. Sensory selection fits Elias’s priorities. The setting’s rules stay consistent within the dreamlike frame.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” is not mere backdrop; the edge where she drops the shard charges the final image and concretizes release. Tactile specifics (chamomile, lemons, chipped teacup) filter through Lena’s professional bias and mood. The environment mirrors and pressures the choice without heavy-handed symbolism. Balance across senses supports the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory and floating isle are tactile and purposive—“the observatory wasn’t just a place…it was a lock,” and the telescope/light becomes the access constraint. Recurring objects (key, automaton, sundial keyhole) charge the final image and shape tactics. Atmosphere is lush yet functional, with consistent world rules cued through action. Minor room for more constraint‑driven detail at the crossing, but the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The secret garden is sensually specific and integrated: vines that tremble, flower pulses, a well whose symbols “made her teeth ache.” Environment and objects constrain tactics—the tooth and well literally gate access—and the humming needle charges the final image. World rules are taught through action rather than exposition. Small deduction only because the garden offers little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto and mist are tactile, recurring, and character‑filtered; quartz veins like constellations create an atmospheric mirror to the theme. Setting actively charges the final image and shelters the ritual, giving the transfer a sanctum distinct from village torches. Object-as-setting (sea glass) interlocks with place. Minor repetition (“serpentine”) doesn’t dull the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The data center‑turned‑garden is vividly sensory and functionally shapes choice (planting moss in a server rack). Recurring objects (moss, pendant, icicle patterns) charge the final image. The environment’s decay→growth logic mirrors and enables the resolution. Detail is selective and filtered through Lena’s noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    The feral nexus and mist aren’t postcard; they pressure tactics and determine the ending (apparitions, water stilling, dissolution). The seashell functions as a micro‑setting object charging the final image. Sensory selection (whisper, damp, stilled water) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. World rules stay consistent in their lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arbor at dawn, copper automaton, and harvest moon are vividly rendered and filtered through a tinkerer’s sensibility. The environment constrains the remedy (song bound to place/time) and charges the final image (vines forming an arch, listening). Sensory selection is purposeful—earth pulse, stretching silk—without museum‑tour excess. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crater orchard is vivid and purposive: silence, frost, and apples become materials and constraints. Weather and terrain charge the final image (embers under drifts) and dictate tactics (hollow apple as reliquary). Tools and micro‑setting integrate with action rather than postcard description. World rules are taught through use (flash‑paper, gold leaf) without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble cavern, silver veins, cold, and reflective angles are integral to method and outcome; environment and tool jointly charge the final image. Acoustics, light, and season shape tactics rather than serving as postcards. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV‑filtered. Only a marginal deduction because the environment doesn’t force a hard trade‑off beyond urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bronze grotto and lamp burner function as micro‑settings that constrain tactics (alignment to fissures) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful across registers—hum, soot, needlework starlight—filtered through Elira’s craft. The environment actively presses back, shaping choice and consequence. Economy and specificity avoid postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is tactile and purposeful: ash wood, knife, damp cedar, rain-beaded skylight. The skylight’s light literally “paints” stripes on the final lion, charging the last image and embodying “here and gone.” Tools and environment shape action and tone without postcard excess. Micro-setting details (kettle, ladder, windowsill) consistently guide the beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is distinctive and integral: the kinetic lagoon’s memory logic governs action and the final image. Environmental particulars (frozen carousel, brass horses, mist-lagoon, floating islands) are filtered through Lira’s bias and tactics. The lagoon constrains choice (no ripple, only remembrance/hands) and charges the closure decisively. Details evolve with the pressure rather than sitting as postcard scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terminal is vividly rendered and tactically used: hydroponics, doors triggered by water pressure, salvaged scaffolding, and the observation deck detritus shape choices. The sextant functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects the POV’s priorities (flows, pressure, structure) and avoids tourist cataloging. World rules feel consistent and are learned in action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is tactile and determinative: the crystal forecourt both preserves and releases sound and is physically altered in the decisive act. Weather and petrichor infuse tone and action; the sanctuary’s silence constrains choices until it “exhales.” Specific objects (moonstone pendulum, etched gears) charge the final image. Economy and integration are high.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canal, split, marsh, and docks constrain options and force a meaningful path choice; the environment saturates action and theme. Sensory specificity is crisp (wet earth, algae‑slick piling, mist) and functionally used (tying off, dropping the ledger, steering choices). The sundial functions as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image. Consistent tone and world rules support the lyric mode without static postcarding.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful—the snowy dock, fog, and harbor sounds shape mood and constrain tactics (“worked quickly” as fog thickens). Recurring objects (rope, fulgurite) and the environment charge the final image (bell buoy tolling, harbor “breathing”). Sensory selection fits Elias’s trained eye and touch. The world’s rules stay consistent, gently fantastical through observed effects.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden and harbor are vivid and purpose‑driven: the willow bench yields the locket; autumn’s breath and the bruise‑colored sky charge tone. The thread functions as a tool‑object that constrains choice, effectively acting as compass to the garden’s corner and powering the final image. Detail selection fits Elias’s sensibility and profession. Minor lyricism never slips into postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The suspended palace, black‑iron chains, stalactites, and abyss are vivid and action‑charged; wings scrape rock and the structure groans, constraining motion. Sensory range (mist salt, steam, mineral tears) is purposeful and POV‑filtered. The environment explicitly charges the final image. A hair more spatial choreography during the flight could further sharpen constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian lagoon, dunes, and black sand are vivid, integrated with action (sewing, wading, binding a wound in saltwater). Setting isn’t postcard—its properties matter (heat memory, abrasive sand, still water mirroring sky) and charge the final images. The coin and thread function as micro‑setting objects that constrain choices. A touch more spatial choreography during the rescue would push this to the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The city of forgotten fountains, the Bone Fountain, and the stained glass box are vivid and functionally integrated. Environment and object constrain options (door only opens via the box’s fractures aligning) and charge the final image (fountains weep light). Sensory specificity (rust, greened coins, lavender drift) is purposeful and filtered through POV. World rules hold without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The nebula garden is vivid and operative, not a postcard: petals, frequencies, and the garden’s “heart” shape tactics and the revealed route. The gear as tool-object interacts with the environment to generate the path, charging the final image (last petal, new garden). Sensory specifics (ionized blooms pulsing with her heartbeat; shimmering sonar threads) feel character-filtered. World rules (illumination from resonance, aversion to fire) stay consistent and drive choices.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ancient greenhouse at dusk, glass, soil, jasmine, and butterflies create a tactile, constraint-rich micro-setting that shapes action and image (lantern effect, wings whispering against glass). Tools and materials (chisel, cracked granite) matter to choices. The environment charges the ending as storm and migration refract the family ritual. Sensory selection tracks the carver’s priorities without tourist catalog breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    The clock tower, tidal obsidian ridge, and sea are tactile, specific, and integrally tied to action; the pendulum pause functions as micro‑setting that constrains choices. Environmental detail evolves with pressure (gusts, salt, groan of mechanism) and charges the closing image. The rake‑handle and bob operate as setting‑objects that shape tactics. No postcard static; atmosphere and geography are purpose‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and character-filtered (cobalt silo groaning, marigolds, weeping cherry), with sensory range that advances mood and meaning. Objects function as micro-settings: tapestry, case, and silo walls actively produce pressure (voices from the walls; door’s final click). The environment charges the ending image though it doesn’t strongly constrain tactics. Consistency of world rules holds without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The obsidian spire, fissured ice, comet ink, and kingfisher quill are vivid and purposeful; sensory choices feel filtered through a specialized eye. The environment actively shapes tactics (finding the crack, noon shadow dot, hum guiding the hand). The final image (quill behind ear; softened world) is charged by these objects and place. A hair shy of 9+ only because constraint doesn’t bite harder in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Atmosphere and specificity are exceptional: the ember alcove, mist that “listens,” the dial siphoning light, and dust that “learns” fuse world and theme. The radio and its glow function as object‑as‑setting, constraining tactics (dimming/brightening) and charging the ending image. Sensory selection tracks POV craft, avoiding cataloging. The environment meaningfully shapes the choices and the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery’s vanishing‑point geometry, chair, powdered floor, and mask create a lived, pressurized micro‑setting filtered through Liora’s art logic. Objects recur and charge the final image (fractures catching light; the ghost‑portrait on the floor). While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain options, it reweights meaning and anchors the accumulative closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sunken city and sewer aren’t wallpaper—they constrain tactics and dictate the fatal end (flooding, tides, grates, pumps). Object-as-setting (cog) charges the last image and governs attention. Sensory economy (stink of copper, groaning ribs, brackish reflections) is purposeful and POV-true. World rules read consistent and learned in action.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet library and autumn aren’t wallpaper; the traveled stillness actively enables the tactic of “subtracting noise,” and the space’s history charges the ending. The rosette functions as a micro-setting/object that anchors bodies and choice, vibrating in the final beat. Sensory specificity is precise without excess. Environment meaningfully shapes both tone and action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse is tactile and lived-in (“iron ribs rusted into lace”) and functions as sanctuary and later as communal table. Environment charges the final image (vines on rust, laughter through cracks) and frames choices (he goes there for silence, serves at its door). The setting subtly constraints tactics without becoming a set-piece obstacle. Rich sensory economy avoids generic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lightning tower, beehive node, and lacquer box are tactile and tool-like; the environment literally enables the act (he must climb and insert the seed) and charges the ending with aerial light/drone imagery. Sensory work is selective (ozone, copper warmth, humming), filtered through a keeper’s lived familiarity. World rules stay consistent and are learned in action. Strong atmosphere without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bay, dock, streetlights, and displaced objects are vivid and purpose‑driven; the environment supplies the very means of the ritual and charges the final image. The teacup’s light and the bay’s “sigh” tie setting to turning points. World rules (hush as substratum) are learned through action. This setting is inseparable from the piece’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned garden is tactile and operative: arches, mosaic, dome seam, pressure suit, and abyssal light constrain choice and shape climax. The environment charges the final image (kelp-wrapped light, child’s song, statues sloughing stone, ampoule as pigment). Detail selection stays POV-filtered and functional. World rules stay consistent within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The staircase’s material rules (spiral, gray haze, a flaw in recursion) shape tactics and the decisive lateral escape. Sensory cues are selective and purposeful (stone thud, café hum/scent) and evolve with the turn. Objects function as micro‑setting constraints (the dice interacting with stairs). Minor breadth, but high leverage and charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog, and waxing moon are tactile and integrated, not decor. Environment and object-as-setting (the brush) constrain and charge choices, especially the “dawn” written where the leaf had been. Sensory range is rich (scent of “rain that would never fall,” jasmine, damp paper), and the world’s rules stay consistent. The final image is inseparable from place and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    The grotto behind the falls shapes action (steam-kneading, lichen-lit chamber, honeyed cliffs) and constrains choices (waterfall’s rhythm as technique, bees’ placement). The opera lens functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is dense yet purposeful, filtered through a guide’s priorities. Environment decisively informs the ending’s communal scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse, hunger stones, and low‑tide coastline are vivid and functionally constraining—time and geography shape tactics and make the path possible, then foreclose it. Tool‑as‑setting (the yoyo within the gear labyrinth) directly charges the final image. Sensory economy is sharp (“bruised violet of a storm’s underbelly,” “rust flaking away”) without tourist listing. The environment evolves causally with events (beam flicker, spiral horizon) and frames the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Vivid, sense‑charged funhouse that constrains tactics (absorbing mirror, oil‑rippling surface) and evolves (mirrors weeping silver). The opera clasp functions as micro‑setting/prop charging the end. Details (“burnt sugar and copper pennies,” spiral hall of cursed likenesses) are purposeful and POV‑filtered. Environment shapes action and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating orchard, driftwood circle, iron pot, shells, and mallet are tactile and rule-bound, and the sea’s sway literally guides choices (“he leaned into it”). Setting charges the final image (sink or soar; blue hour deepens) and shapes tactics across beats. Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, filtered through a musician’s perception. It satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and functional: shells as maps and memory, turtles’ breaths affecting watchers, city foundations moving at the end. Environmental specifics constrain tactics (reading cracks as language, using breaths and stress as signals) and charge the final image. The gate and shells are not postcard details; they are the operating physics of the scene. The reed whistle as micro-setting object further binds space, sound, and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station’s damp, rust, ivy, and the rosebush provide vivid specificity and tone while echoing the creeping lie. The space holds clear geography and integrates with action (torch, tunnels, exit along tracks). The rosebush petal bookends the piece and charges the final image. While the setting pressures fate less than it textures it, its integration is purposeful and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion is tactile and selective (algae slick, iron teeth, rust and old paper), filtered through a surveyor’s eye. Environment and tools shape tactics: mortar seams as message channels, the drawbridge window, waders, ledger. The inkwell functions as micro‑setting charging the ending even off‑site. Rich atmosphere supports theme without museum‑tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken library is tactile and operative: filtered seawater, rust, pressure lock, and lamp light all constrain movement and tactics. The environment charges the final image (ocean hum, city’s heartbeat) and informs choices (pressure lock, water height). Detail is purposeful and filtered through a professional, tactile gaze. One notch shy of 9+ only because environmental constraint at the peak remains gentle rather than forcing a trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and integral: basilica, tea garden, cranes, and the floating isle all shape atmosphere and final meaning. Recurring objects (gem, glass, cranes) constrain and charge choices; the garden tilts like a ship, and the basilica’s material state changes the outcome. Sensory selection is purposeful (steam, salt, brittle parchment) and filtered through the lantern maker’s craft. World rules remain consistent, learned by action rather than dump.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, storm, and console form a coherent pressure-box; the “cooling breakers” and power loss shape and limit action. The geode functions as object-as-setting, charging the final image when it goes cold. Sensory specificity is purposeful and filtered through Lena’s lexicon. World rules (harmonics, perturbation) are taught through action, not dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory is vividly particular (oculus, carved celestial maps, solstice angle) and shapes action (the chip’s slot, the projection, dusk timing). Environment and recurring objects (drone, chip, spire) charge the final image. World rules are learned via use, not exposition, and the oculus star concretely reweights the ending. Sensory balance and selective detail maintain urgency without cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt terrace, mist, iron railing, and driftwood “bones” are vivid, selective, and filtered through a professional’s eye for lineage and residue.

Sensory detail stays purposeful and consistent with tone. The setting’s specificity heightens the final hush without overexplanation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The parapet, chasm, mist, and storm are vivid and purpose‑driven, echoing the precarious truce. The object‑as‑setting (drawer pull) charges multiple beats and the ending. Weather and stone add tactile risk and tonal pressure, though they rarely constrain tactics. Specificity remains POV‑filtered rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal launch, sagging wires, and wind/tide aren’t postcards; they shape mood and decision (he doesn’t paddle, counts poles back). The micro‑settings (post office steps, bar with neon “dying star”) recur and charge the final image. The compass functions as a micro‑setting/object that constrains and then reweights choice. Sensory selection is purposeful across smell, touch, sound, and light without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid and rule‑consistent, and it actively constrains choice (warmth, voice, parting on throw). Object‑as‑setting (the baseball) and the environment charge the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful (algae/ozone “after a storm that hadn’t happened yet”), mirroring the temporal theme without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tunnel to fissure to path to city.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    The orchard under a never‑setting moon and the spice‑charged air are not wallpaper; they’re the operating system for choice (rituals, beasts, veil‑thinning). Specific sensoria—saffron breath, cardamom, vanilla, nutmeg—are POV‑true and purpose‑driven. Setting charges the final image (the orchard “held its breath”) and materially enables/limits what Liora can do. World rules are learned through action rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glade above the clouds isn’t decorative; it functions as the reservoir of time and pressures tactics (she performs the ritual here because “the veil” is thin). Micro‑objects—saucer, ink, acorn—are woven into setting action and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is high and POV‑filtered, with environmental evolution (trees knitting, canopy densifying) tracking escalation. World rules stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Eulogy’s bone‑ship, gravity flickers, and the photograph function as micro‑settings that constrain tactics and charge the ending. Environmental details evolve with action (ship groans, bones sing; gravity falters during stitching). The world’s rules are shown through use rather than dump. The final image (“She stayed”) is explicitly reweighted by the setting’s loss.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The volcano, black sand, and lava-sea interface actively shape options and tactics (cave pull, molten “kiss,” pumice raft).

Setting is not decorative; it directs the story’s hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vividly specific (silvered walls humming with trapped daylight; half‑painted sundial; gearwork pulse). Environment and objects actively constrain choices—the dial’s alignment window, the blackout, the stored light that could flare. The bronze quill holder functions as micro‑setting and returns to charge the final image. Sensory selection remains purposeful and character‑filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and functional: frictionless bluff, aurora, and tidal edge tangibly shape tactics and risk. The micro‑objects (rocks, dust) operate as environment, literally anchoring reality and charging the final image (“her footsteps the only friction left”). World rules are learned through action. Specificity serves mood and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory and storm are not postcard backdrops; the leak blurs ink, the altitude enables scattering, and the timer/workbench frame his options. Specific objects (1978 timetable, darkroom timer) are integrated and reweighted at the end. Atmosphere serves pressure rather than ornament. A model of purposeful, POV‑filtered detail.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and functional: glass refraction, sundial geometry, and the brook/heron calibrate pace and choices. Environment and objects constrain tactics (light through panes, needle shadow, dial notch) and charge the final image. Detail is purposeful and filtered through action. Occasional lyric flourish skirts purple but stays controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted prison library is vivid and lived‑in—the wind through bars, iron shelves, cold breath, stubborn lamp—and POV‑filtered by a poet’s noticing. Setting quietly constrains tactics (working at night, hiding poems, building in shadows) and charges the final image. While not a hard physical constraint at the peak, the environment infuses every choice with pressure. Specific objects (tin, lamp, pressed violet) are integrated, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds isn’t mere backdrop; its currents, groans, and bark‑door constrain and enable choices, culminating in a charged final image suspended “above the rules of endings.” Objects as micro‑setting (piano, clock, compasses, projector) are tactically integrated. Sensory selection (salt‑yellowed ivories, ozone and old paper) is precise and POV‑filtered. World rules are learned through use rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ridge/nightshade/monsoon triad is vivid and charged through POV bias and returns at closure (the ridge “trembled,” rain as exhale). Environment constrains tactic and timing (act before first drop) and redefines the rules (the ridge is memory). Sensory economy is strong: taste of the seed, the scent of storm, mud underfoot. The setting does consequential work beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The islet, wind, damp sand, and bonsai function as lived environment and micro‑setting. The wind becomes a teaching force (“lean into the wind”) and wet sand enables the diffusing act; the compass and pot charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias’s craft. Tonal atmosphere matches the grief‑to‑poise arc without postcard excess.

    The setting is rendered with masterful, evocative prose ("cathedral of glass and steam...clawed its ribs bare") and is integral to the plot. The storm-damaged greenhouse isn't a backdrop but the story's crucible, constraining Elias's actions to pure observation of decay. The micro-setting of the dust on the soil directly enables the story's central action and charges the final thematic resolution, satisfying the highest standard for environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a standout success, operating as a character and a thematic engine. The frost, canyon, and predawn light are not mere backdrops; they are integral to Liora's internal state and constrain her final choice. The central metaphor connecting the frost's brittle patterns to fractured glass and the ledger's code is masterfully integrated, charging the final image where she reads the landscape itself as a new text. The environment directly precipitates the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.8)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric; it is an active antagonist and a core component of the resolution. The "tomb of winterglass" is a brilliant initial state, and its transformation—it doesn't shatter, it *sings*—is a stunning and earned payoff. The conservatory as a silenced cathedral of sound and the piano as a waiting instrument are used with maximum thematic and narrative impact, making the environment indispensable to the story's success.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.6)
    The setting is the story's most powerful asset, a masterclass in world-building through specific, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.7)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative. The terra-cotta arbor functions as the community's symbolic heart, and its destruction is the plot's pivotal moment. Furthermore, the antique silver bell acts as a "micro-setting," an object that constrains choices (its sound) and becomes the charged, central image of the story’s powerful final beat. The specificity of these elements elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as a character in its own right. The viaduct is not just a backdrop but a "threshold," its atmosphere—the violet haze, jasmine, fog—directly participating in the story's supernatural logic. Key objects, the camera obscura and the jade, are pivotal to the action and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ criterion by constraining choice and defining the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.8)
    The setting is not a backdrop but the story's primary mechanism and antagonist. The “living bridge garden” and its “hyperbolic geometry” actively constrain the protagonist’s choices, directly shaping the plot from the spiral staircase’s appearance to her final escape “sideways” along a geometric curve. This perfect fusion of environment and action is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.7)
    The abandoned carnival is an exceptional setting, rendered with specific, evocative details that create a potent atmosphere of decay and hidden potential. Crucially, the setting is not mere backdrop but an active participant in the plot; the piano and the duck-pond pit become essential tools that Lena uses to overcome an obstacle. This integration of environment and action is seamless and elevates the entire narrative, easily satisfying the requirement for the setting to constrain choice and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.8)
    The setting is a masterclass in worldbuilding economy, functioning as a primary character and an engine for the plot. The sunken greenhouse ringed by wrecks is a singular, unforgettable image. Every element—the rising tide, the forge, the aurora—is active, constraining choice and charging the final, sublime image of Elias wading into the water. It is fully integrated and indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.7)

    The stormlit observatory, crystal flags, and breathing fog are not backdrop but active constraints: the flags hum under rain’s afterecho, the fog’s solidity dictates when she works, the Spear’s shadow bleeds and twitches. Micro-setting (stone under palm, refracted rain) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather affects choice. Only the brief “market long dissolved” risks postcard nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fortress blooms, the vines pulse like a “slow, silent heartbeat,” and the mosaic tiles only speak when struck by flame—setting actively constrains and enables the climax. Micro-setting (the tower’s peak, the rag’s flare) is tactile and stakes-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grotto’s damp stone, moon-ink, and single water drip are vivid micro-settings; the jade cicada as embodied constraint warms to pressure choice. The night sky returns in the final image, now charged with unspeakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bunker’s curved ribs and the xenial trellis are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the ending “petals of steel peeling back.” Sensory compression—copper-tasting air, honey-lightning silence—tightens with urgency. Spatial choreography of ascent coherent; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism terrace, storm glass, and canal function as micro-setting that constrains every action: the terrace fractures light to soften sound, the vial absorbs noise, the water receives footsteps. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The mirrored planes and murky fluid evolve with the emotional arc, charging the final image. No environmental element is generic or static.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The silver-leaved orchard, waterfall veil, and ruby-flaked throne are vivid, selective, and causally active: the orchard hides the hatch, the waterfall reframes perception, the throne’s metal mirrors the flake. Micro-setting (tree bark murals) literally redirects the quest downward. One minor spatial fuzz: ladder rungs’ warnings are read but not shown to affect tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen sanctuary, starlight through cracked dome, and bronze doorknocker are not backdrop but active constraints: the charcoal dust coats lungs, the starlight shapes alien silhouettes, the ring’s warmth signals the moment of irrevocable choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sepia reading room and gramophone crank are vividly rendered: “golden shadows stretched like lazy fingers” and black-flaked mirror. The “standing wave” floorboard vibration constrains physical action—floor loosens when Elias strikes—fulfilling 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays coherent; no props teleport. A fractional lapse is “sepia” flagged twice without tonal modulation, a micro-repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse is no backdrop but an active constraint: glass weeps, plants trace sigils, roots spell half-remembered oaths. Micro-setting (gauntlet, program) doubles as charged object that enables the final unsnap. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased—condensation like tears, scent of crushed silverleaf—guiding choice. One minor drift: “sky began to mend” outside is inferred, not anchored in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room’s sour-coffee air and yellowed paper constrain Elias’s movements and mood; the brass button functions as micro-setting that literally rolls onto the desk and later charges the final envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ticket office’s popcorn-sawdust ghost-smell and the dust-as-language micro-setting actively constrain Elias’s reading of cracks; the final gold dawn through the broken skylight recharges the opening darkness. Environment and tool (mainspring barrel) jointly shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass orchard’s suspended shelves and frost-etched windows constrain every move; the press, bottle, and dissolving walls function as micro-setting that charge the final image when “the last of the glass orchard shattered into starlight.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Asteroid cathedral and glowing strands create sensory immediacy; shards serve as micro-setting constraining Elias’s vault-light ritual. Spatial choreography is clear; earlier baroque rises haven’t appeared on-page so no cap is triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain-bookstore breathes, shivers, and rains dust; shelves and glyphs constrain movement and meaning. The setting is not backdrop but active participant, guiding Elias to the false wall and later sealing the door behind him.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is filtered through tactile attention—metallic veins, frozen laughter, hearth warmth—each detail constraining choice (labyrinth absorbs regret; tapestry threads resist then yield). The time-frozen village is more than postcard: its stillness forces the tutor’s introspection and later thaw mirrors his internal shift. Micro-setting (the board on the inn table) becomes the charged final object. Platinum labyrinth could be more materially specific, but its reflective function justifies its presence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon’s bone towers are not backdrop but conductivity: the ribbed lattice physically dictates Liora’s climbing route and the echo paths the words will take. One line—“marrow thick with confessions”—turns geology into moral memory and constrains the final carving choice. Density of condensation, chalk and bleed link body to place under pressure. Final image of carving into “the spire’s remains” makes the setting’s fracture integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Acid sea and corroding hull are not backdrop but countdown; the brass ribs and copper stink constrain every move. The workshop’s dissolution is tracked beam by beam, forcing the final choice. Micro-setting of the statue’s scarred chest becomes the crucible where world and self fuse.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ridge, grotto, and bleeding starlight are rendered with tactile specificity—cobalt stone, smoldering veins, copper air. The environment actively constrains choice: thin air, violet fireflies, and the fissure itself compel the final surrender. One hairline slip: “cobalt stone” appears once and could be sharper, but the grotto’s breathing rock and starlight pool anchor the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ember nexus bridges constrain action: warm railings conduct pulse, steam vents dictate where one can stand unseen, cooling gold-to-amber signals the closing window of choice. Micro-setting—the shell heated in palm—functions as tactile location. Only the initial skyline sketch leans touristy before pivoting to lived-in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)

One minor drift: “cobalt atrium” remains more color label than spatial anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Courtyard’s residual heat, kiln crack, and moonlit ash form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: the kiln’s flaw decides the vase’s fate, the embers dictate when they can speak. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and scent over sight, consistent with Elias’s POV. Final image of dandelion seeds catching wind recharges the ash motif.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    The laboratory’s “forgotten acoustics” and copper-warm wires are tactile and selective, never touristy. The carbide-lens-as-micro-setting constrains every choice: its refraction literally shapes the resonator’s path. Spatial choreography stays coherent—hand, dish, shadows, bell. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: only hum and gold remain at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Observatory’s cracked dome and moonlit alcove constrain choices—she must wedge cranes into cracks and telescope hollows. Brass telescopes and copper petals are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the “old silver” sky. Setting evolves: curtains once shroud grief, then open to possibility. Micro-setting (bench, stencil, box) functions as crucible for transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft’s rain-beaded skylight, the worn brass tape, and the candle’s shadow are not backdrop but instruments: they refract light, measure distance, and cast patterns that directly shape Elias’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glowing dunes, the rusted badge, and the chess clock all constrain choice: the dunes bloom brighter as the spark is carried, the badge’s rust flakes to reveal brightness beneath, the clock’s ticking rewrites the air. Sensory detail is selective—bioluminescent petals, fractured lullaby whistle—and filtered through Hollow’s rail-centric priorities. Spatial choreography is clean; the crate reseals and the tracks loop without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mechanical rainforest is rendered with tactile specificity (“brass trunks,” “binary rustles”) and constrains the final stance; the gear left turning on a branch recharges the setting as living engine. Spatial anchors are clear early.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rock arches, choked tunnels, and the orchard’s twin suns constrain every choice: the silk unfurls into a fissure only a miner could reach; fruit bursts minutes later with immediate consequence. The “hissing forge” and peach handed to the smith root the wonder in tactile detail. One rock arch shudders in the moment that costs the world some latent instability—setting directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The brook, reeds, moonlit stones, and the wing itself form a micro-setting that actively constrains tactics: water stills when touched, lattice of light hangs above it. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—cold burn, silver bleed—charging the final image. One notch shy of 9 only because the broader geography remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Rooftop wisteria and ink-steam tea conjure a seductive gothic hush, but the brownstone itself never steps forward as a sensate antagonist; its grief is told more by summary than constraining detail.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden’s twilight palette and resonance lattice constrain every move; petals blacken and silver in direct response to memory feed, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shrine’s ice, candles, and salt-scented air constrain every move; the glacier’s groan times the beats. Sensory selection narrows under grief’s urgency—fogged breath, fused glass—then widens to diesel and starlight. Micro-setting (altar, locket, globe) functions as extension of body. One minor drift: “blue veins pulsing” risks cliché but is saved by the glacier’s personification tying to buried time.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The parapet’s wet stone, moss-crushed mint, and moon-silvered harbor are filtered through Kael’s craft-centric gaze; the bamboo whisk and breathing nets act as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Environment and tool jointly charge the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
