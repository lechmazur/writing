  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly particular—"jagged panes… like broken teeth," "skeletal remains," rotting compost—and the flood's aftermath constrains Elias's work (no more grant theater, only patient observation). The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image: broken glass rattling as he steps out, embodying his acceptance of unraveling. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling in soil, desk, evening exit). Minor: occupational neutron-star detail is decorative rather than tactically integrated; the greenhouse's decay does all the substantive work.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon and frost constrain and charge the entire arc: frost patterns mirror her glass work and provide the discovery mechanism; the narrowing canyon walls guide her path. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her artist's eye. The body and ledger function as micro-setting, shaping the final release. The frost returns in the closing image, reweighting her perception from maker to listener, and the environment actively participates in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The winterglass conservatory constrains choice: frozen air prevents sound, forcing Liora to reverse the heat-map mechanics. The tuning fork case functions as micro-setting, pressuring her hands ("burning against her wrists") and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through grief ("salt in her veins," "frosted panes trapping the absence of vibration"). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from glass to piano to open doors.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered with purposeful detail—bioluminescent anemones, waterlogged books, fractured dome—that constrains Elias's existence and charges the final return. The lighthouse's skeletal remains are concretely described and the climb's tactile difficulty (rust, slick kelp) shapes the action. The cleared water moment at the lighthouse top charges the closure image by making the dead visible. Micro-setting (lens fragments, anemones) actively participates in the ending. Minor deduction: occupational detail (undertaking) is gestured at but not leveraged to constrain a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta arbor recurs with functional weight: initially a gathering place, then torched (raising stakes), finally rebuilt with roses and the bell hung from it—constraining the final image. The ridge, river, and chapel root the action spatially. Micro-setting (bell's hollow handle, root cellar, orchards) is selective and purposeful. Sensory detail (flames licking tiles, frost silvering the ridge, bread scent) supports atmosphere without catalog excess, and the bell's physical presence charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The viaduct's arches, twilight haze, night-blooming jasmine, and moss-covered jade anchor place and atmosphere with sensory specificity filtered through Elias's focus. The camera obscura functions as both tool and micro-setting, its brass lens warm against his palm and its mirror catching faint light—these details recur and charge the final projection moment. Fog curling around ankles and wrists, the scent of wet earth and iron, and the river's ember-scattered surface all pressure mood and provide the means (breath shapes, shadow split) that enable the climactic reveal. The twilight-bloom motif seeds early and returns transformed in the closing beat, meeting the 9+ test of environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The living bridge garden, blackthorn hedge, and hyperbolic geometry constrain Liora's navigation and charge the closure image when she steps "beside" the maze to design edges. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—ozone, crushed lavender, vines pulsing like veins—and filtered through Liora's professional lens as maze designer. Spatial choreography remains clear through the climb and final bridge scene. However, the hyperbolic geometry and fractal patterns function more as atmospheric texture than mechanical constraint that alters a specific tactic mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned carnival is vividly particular—skeletal prize booth, yellowed piano keys, duck-pond pit now filled with rainwater—and the vault's glass vials and the arrow's corn-husk fletching supply tactile anchors. The piano itself becomes a trap mechanism, constraining Lena's tactics and charging the closure (she returns tomorrow "to the piano, to the keys"). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not quite reach 8+ because the guard's positioning and the floor's collapse mechanism are under-explained, leaving one beat's geography fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse, wrecks, forge, and aurora are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated: the greenhouse sagging "like held breath," wrecks as "coral reef of memory," aurora pulsing with the fire. Spatial choreography is clear (Elias moves from anvil to forge to wading out), and the rising water constrains the final beat. The forge's heat and the copper imprint charge the climax, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's synesthetic POV (violet hum of rust, emerald and blood light). One minor slip: the cells dividing "like they had every night since he was twelve" is told rather than shown affecting a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald station, brass rails, and golden sunset anchor the setting vividly in the opening. The jar of moonbeams and the flower arrangements supply concrete tools that shape Liora's tactics (watching the blooms, memorizing shifts). The final image—horizon as "a wound of gold and violet"—charges the ending with sensory specificity. Minor drift: spatial choreography during the confrontation (where exactly the stationmaster stands, how close Liora is to the case) remains slightly vague, but the overall texture supports pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The control room is vivid and functional: frosted dials, dead switches, cracked window revealing the blueprint sketch, pipes that hiss when the valve turns. The thaw operates as live pressure—groaning ice, rivulets on the floor, dripping ceiling—and the flood Elara triggers is a direct environmental constraint that shapes her choice to leave. The glass orbs in her satchel serve as micro-setting (they "chime like wind chimes"), anchoring her craft even outdoors. Spatial choreography is clear across two locations (control room, observatory ridge) with one clean transition. The final beat—kneeling in wet grass, holding a shard to light—uses body and tool to charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rusted library under stars establishes vivid atmosphere and the ladder groans under Lena's weight, tying setting to action. The shell and ledger function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure image. Yet the library's physical logic is thin—why is a child wandering alone in a closed, rusted building? The setting supplies resources (ledger, cast) but does not meaningfully constrain Lena's choices or force tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridge fort, storm aftershocks, flaking gold leaf, and pebble shore supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Eldrin's professional bias as an oracle. The booklet constrains his ritual (he traces, exhales, lets it slip), and the fort's stone holds the ghost of the defender's vigil, charging the final image when the gold leaf glints "in the memory of light." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The micro-setting—booklet, stone, star—shapes the closure image and meets the Q3 9+ gate, lifting the score solidly into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The frozen courtyard supplies concrete images—frost, cobblestones, ice-slicked bench—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The violin's transparency refracts light, yet this property never shapes a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is stable (courtyard, bench, void, courtyard), and the ozone-scent detail adds texture. The micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental; removing the ice or twilight would not fundamentally alter X-7's arc, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The forecourt and lens are vivid and purposeful: "water trickling through crystal pavers, each step releasing a whisper of light," "lens…warping the lines of her skin." The lens constrains Lena's perception and charges the final image ("its weight familiar now, its imperfections perfect"). Spatial choreography is clear (desk, forecourt, door). The crystal setting brackets the piece (wet at opening, dry by dawn) and reweights the opening image at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for recurring object/environment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    The garden maze is spatially coherent and recurs across beats: polishing at the heart, leading elders to the center, tucking marbles into roots, paths shifting to welcome the lost. The marbles function as micro-setting, constraining the vine dresser's ritual and charging the final image when roots cradle them. Sensory detail is selective—"leaves brushing her shoulders like old apologies," "dying light," shoots crushed by boots—and filtered through the vine dresser's priorities. The maze's role in the elders' conversion and the final stance-shift qualifies for mid-7s, though the specificity of blooms and ivy spelling her name flirts with overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The xenobiology station's skeletal frame groaning, the gas giant's twilight bands, and the magnetic nexus all ground the scene with specific, purposeful detail. The nexus—its cobalt lattice, the cold lever, the warping air—constrains Elias's choices and charges the final image when he rests his hand there, feeling "the faint thrum of a universe." Sensory selection reflects urgency (fogging breath at the console, oil residue on coveralls) and the abandoned aviary's shudder ties setting directly to the specimen's awakening. Minor slip: "the hush of beating wings at rest" as a timeframe feels more lyric than spatial, but the micro-setting (console, lever, viewport) consistently shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns constrains movement ("water resisting him like a held note") and the swollen floorboard requires the cello bow as tool, directly enabling the key discovery. Sensory detail is vivid and layered: water lapping "like a slow, patient tongue," lanterns turning sheet music into "a topographic map of shadows," balcony mirrors reflecting independently. The antique program functions as micro-setting, its dampness and shifting ink constraining interpretation and charging the final moment when it's restored and dry. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (pit to aisles to balcony to wings). The setting participates in closure: the air's "sudden warmth" and water's shiver embody the ghost's reply, making environment inseparable from the duet's success.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The weather station's physicality—frost-laced window, groaning iron ribs, barometer needle, hygrometer—constrains Liora's choices and charges the closure; she handles the window, the illustration, the radio, each tool reflecting her paralysis. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, wet stone, copper taste) filters through her post-fever hyperawareness. The ravens and auroral glow add atmospheric specificity without ornament. The station itself functions as micro-setting, its pressure (falling barometer, shearing ice) driving her final exit into the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel's damp ribs, pitted valve wheel, and black sump are vivid and selective. The valve wheel constrains Elias's final choice—turning it triggers the vision and its lighter weight afterward signals release—meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Sensory hierarchy reflects his scavenger's eye: he appraises the wheel "not by touch but by the way his pulse jumped." Spatial choreography is clean throughout; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The moss-covered library, underground river, and obsidian monolith are vivid and purposeful, establishing a coherent hermetic space. The origami swan and the black water constrain the keeper's ritual actions across multiple beats. However, the setting does not force a choice or charge the final image with a visible consequence; it remains atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment enables repetition rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sage Ridge is established early with sensory particulars (gnarled roots, sagebrush, iron-tasting air) and returns at the climax where the eclipse light and "stones hummed" charge the closure image. The vial as micro-object constrains Elias's choice to press it into Mira's palm. Spatial choreography is clean. The ridge's "ordinary magic" remains somewhat abstract—its mechanics never materially constrain a tactic—but the eclipse setting does tighten the window and amplify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The silo as reclaimed library—shelves spiraling "like the grooves of a colossal phonograph"—is vivid and purposeful, anchoring Elias's archival work. The fireplace, ladder, and tapestry fragment constrain his physical moves (climbing, feeding pages, pressing wool). The final image charges setting: "the silo sighed behind him, its metal skin singing a note just shy of sorrow" binds structure to emotional resonance. The wind "carried the scent of rain, though no clouds remained" subtly reflects post-human displacement without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lighthouse tower with brass-lined study, Fresnel lens, island diner, north cove, and train all anchor clearly. The lighthouse's beacon and Chen's incense-smoke create atmospheric texture. The microdot on the desk and the train ticket in his pocket function as micro-setting objects. The lighthouse going dark for the first time in twenty years charges the final third, constraining Chen's departure with visible consequence. Sensory detail (saltwater dripping, screen door slam, incense curling) is selective and purposeful, filtered through Chen's professional calm.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and indigo palette function as micro-setting elements that recur and gain symbolic weight. The palette's emptying and the pedal's looping charge the final image when the novice presses it again. Spatial choreography (chamber, corner, floor, threshold) remains stable. However, the "dimensional anchor" itself stays abstract; its geometry and constraints don't visibly limit movement or enable a tactical choice—mere description of "walls pulsed" and "cracks" without mechanical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purpose: the spire amplifies sound (glass hums, breath feels intrusive), the lake's cracked mirror refracts temporal shards, and both pressure Li Wei's isolation and his role as oracle. The nautilus shell constrains a choice—its fracture casting a shadow that triggers his shift from hearing to holding—and charges the final image when he shapes air instead of writing. Sensory hierarchy reflects his musician's ear (meow-pitch cats, sewing-machine metronome, ice groaning as overture). Spatial choreography is clean throughout the spire, balcony, and vista.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct—wet stone, neon glow, fractured light—is vivid and sensory, filtered through Elias's perception of the loop. The tablet is handled across multiple beats (gripped, traced, flared, crumbled), constraining his choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent (viaduct peak, collision, forward path). The setting actively pressures the protagonist: the procedural regeneration of the bridge traps him, and its final vanishing confirms his escape, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cavern's "damp earth and stretched hides," the "ancient phonograph, its horn cracked but still proud," and the tactile focus (drumheads, grooves like Braille) create a lived-in micro-setting that constrains Elias's realization—he must feel rather than hear. Sensory hierarchy reflects his deafness: texture and vibration dominate, auditory cues absent. The needle and record function as constrained tools within this space, and the drum maker's hands become part of the environment's language. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, stool, phonograph horn). The setting directly shapes the closure choice: without the cavern's silence and the phonograph's tactile output, the pedagogical turn would lack anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: flagstones, lavender, ivy-choked arches, fountain. The storm recorder functions as micro-setting, its brass dials and needle anchoring Elias's craft and later serving as a repository for forbidden objects. Sensory hierarchy reflects his professional lens (barometric pressure, ozone, the pigeons' uneven coos as data). The setting subtly guides his choice: the courtyard's enclosed space and failing light frame his solitude, and the recorder's hidden compartment enables his secretive documentation. The final detail—"a door creaked on rusted hinges. Not his."—charges the space with threat and directly shapes the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto is vividly rendered: terra-cotta warmth, damp clay, crushed sage, stalactite for swinging the rope. The setting provides concrete tools (rope coiled at the mouth, stalactite anchor point) that enable the poet's physical investigation and final carving act. Sensory details are filtered through the drifter's tactile priorities (worn boots, frayed fibers, wall shadows). The constraint that charges the closure is the rope itself—an object of the setting—which the poet handles across multiple beats, transforming it into the ladder left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks function as both setting and metaphor, constraining spatial choreography (Liora sits by the fire, the child approaches from the wreckage) and charging the final image with atmospheric weight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "damp earth," "condensate drips," "timbers creaking like old bones." The greenhouse's sigh and the shipwrecks settling deeper into the earth at closure reweight the environment as co-participant in the ending. Micro-setting (mendicant's bowl, violin strings) also constrains choice and charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber grotto functions as more than backdrop: its pulsing walls, shifting light (gold to molten red), and the breathing quality create atmospheric pressure that mirrors the emotional transformation. The silver cuffs constrain Liora's method (reading static charge) and the petal itself is handled across multiple beats, warming and crumbling with narrative consequence. Dusk's completion bookends the piece and the grotto "holds" both characters at the climax, providing spatial containment for the confrontation. Sensory detail is selective (bergamot, metallic tang, amber warmth) rather than catalog-like, and the setting's properties—static charge, trapped sunlight—directly enable the plot mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The seaside library courtyard is anchored with sensory particulars: salt-kissed breeze, lantern light, wrought-iron railing, oleander, distant waves. Spatial choreography is clear across moves (railing to donation box to her desk to oleander to side door). The locket—a concrete object—constrains the midnight exchange and charges the ending (she wears it as they part). Time of day (post-concert dusk to midnight to dawn ferry) shapes the clandestine tone and tightens the window for decision. Minor slip: "break room" and "children's ward" hint at institutional infrastructure not established, creating slight spatial vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater supply vivid, purposeful detail—trees that refract stories, air humming with lost languages—and the crater's glow literally lights Reed's path during the search. The obsidian arbor constrains touch ("too sharp to touch") and becomes the surface for the collective dedication, charging the closure when Reed feels its hum answer back. Spatial choreography remains clear across crater lip, orchard edge, and village, with the crater functioning as both physical boundary and thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop canals are vivid and purposeful: "black and slow as ink," "crumbling parapet," the boy's boat drifting backward. Spatial choreography is clean (Elspeth at the parapet edge, boy below in the canal), and the setting constrains action—the jar is hurled *into* the canal, the thread pulled *from* it. The canal water as medium for time and echoes charges the final act. Minor: the giant's anatomy (towers as ribs/bones, canals as veins) is asserted more than felt in tactical pressure, but the canal itself meets the 9+ gate by shaping the closure move.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern orchard's sensory anchors—stalactite drips, bioluminescent lichen, mineral-rich earth—are vivid and persistent. The mosaic stepping stone and glass eyes function as micro-setting elements that constrain the conjurer's ritual action and charge the final image (the eyes cloud over, the mosaic glows faintly). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting's silence and darkness actively pressure the protagonist's need for precision.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library's "stained-glass windows," "dust-moted air," "crawl spaces beneath the stacks," and "vent above her" create coherent spatial choreography. The tape's magnetic strip "warm from body heat" and the draft that carries sound are micro-setting details that enable Elias's choice. The "sapphire hush" lighting modulates with the outage and dawn, charging the final image. The sub-basement key in the closure anchors the next spatial move. No occupation-depth issues; the archivist role is gestural but sufficient for a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mossy trellis, wet soil, and microscope anchor the setting concretely and pressure Liora's choices: the trellis becomes the site where she pulls up stakes, the rain blurs boundaries during her surrender, and the microscope reveals cellular reconstruction that shifts her understanding. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency—texture of leaves "waxy resistance to something almost pliable," the storm's "electric hum vibrating through her bones." The nursery functions as micro-setting, and the recurring linden leaf charges the final image. Minor gap: occupational detail (botany, microscopy) is gestured at but not deeply leveraged to constrain a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island pressures every beat: desalination rig hollows, salt-cracked mud, crooked rain trails, drafty cottage. The brooch groove in the altar and the bioluminescent cavern veins function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure. The rain's shift from crooked to straight in the final paragraph is a purposeful environmental evolution tied to the exchange, reweighting the island's posture. Sensory selection (iron and incense, amber blur, damp paintbrush) reflects Elias's priorities without catalog drift.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly anchored—translucent stone that pulses, jagged formations refracting sound—and the pearl's opalescent swirl supplies a recurring visual anchor. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtering through Liora's clairvoyant attention. The cave's acoustics constrain the encounter (song "unravels her," shadows fold into the entity), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape a choice. Minor slip: spatial choreography of the entity (neither human nor beast, inhabiting space "between thoughts") remains abstract, and the transition from cave interior to twilight exterior compresses without clear passage.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ivory harbor, slick cobblestones, repurposed lighthouse, and driftwood table supply concrete micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices (he ascends the lighthouse rather than joining the docks). The valve glints in sun and is handled across multiple beats, charging the final image. Sensory selection (ocean-spray, ink and damp parchment, salt-crusted crate) reflects urgency and professional bias. The setting evolves causally—café reopens, lanterns flicker—and the harbor's pulse metaphor grounds tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vault's rusted lattice, the cracks forming arrows, and the mist curling around boots create vivid spatial anchors that constrain Elias's route and charge the ending image. The phantom punch as micro-object constrains his choice at the pedestal and its dissolution marks the threshold moment. Sensory detail is selective: "wet earth and old promises," "wind through a keyhole." The map's final fold—a crease that won't align—functions as setting-as-object, encoding the theme and altering his future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower, tide pools, and telescope are vividly rendered with sensory detail (salt wind, whale songs vibrating through stone, bioluminescent waves). The tower's open structure subtly mirrors Liora's willingness to receive memory. The tile's obsidian texture and warmth return with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains her work (the tower as a liminal space) and the final image of the open door charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered through color, sound, and spatial distortion; "walls shifting between violet and bruise-blue" and "floor became the ceiling became a memory" ground the reader in a coherent alien space. The setting actively constrains and enables: the escondite's magnetic language responds to the amulet, the storm bends light outside, and spatial mutiny shapes Lysander's final act. The micro-setting (ice pillar, amulet fragment) charges the closure image when walls dissolve. Minor: some sensory selection could be tighter under the POV's priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The funeral-home prep room is vividly anchored: porcelain table, formaldehyde smell, scalpels, death certificates. The ink pot's serpent etching and the liquid's autonomous swirl create tactile menace. Spatial choreography (door, table, tray of scalpels) tracks cleanly. The setting constrains choice—locked coffins, mortuary paper, the liminal space of death work—and charges the final image of "the world where debt could drown." Minor: the city-to-border escape compresses geography without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bonsai forest under glass, the workshop clutter, and the mountaintop anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. Sensory selection is strong: fogging glass, scent of damp earth and pine, the lamp's buzz as metronome. The environment does not constrain a choice during the story, but the final sunrise "gilding the edges" charges the closure image by making the invented histories glow—satisfying the 9+ gate's "charges the final image" criterion at a solid level. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor deduction: the town below remains abstracted; we never see shutters or vendors, only the promise of them.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (corrugated steel ridges, rust language, wind through gaps) and evolves causally (alleys shift with tides, new crate appears). Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The setting does constrain Daniel's navigation and the flooded paths force wading in the climax, meeting the 9+ gate for choice-constraint. Micro-setting (the label clutched to chest) charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's cracked dome, warped floor, and broken teeth anchor setting and reflect abandonment. The cliff's edge serves as the site for the new journal, and the cello's hollow belly hums with "storms it had never heard," charging the final act. The shell's constellations pulse in time with music, constraining his realization. These elements recur and shape the closure image, though spatial choreography remains static (Elias seated throughout) and the observatory's role as pressure is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lumina's carnival setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (kite lanterns, frying dough, sequined masks) and the raft city's fluid architecture matters thematically. The brass cuff and spray cans function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elira's identity and tactics. Spatial choreography is clean across the mural site, fortune-teller's stall, and clocktower. The setting charges the final image ("lights reflecting off the water like a thousand scattered promises") with purposeful tone, lifting the score into the mid-7s despite lacking a moment where environment forces a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lunar surface is visceral and selective: "boots crunched over the moon's silvered dust," "jagged rock," "regolith," with the crater's edge framing Earth as "a pale jewel." The canister and camera function as micro-setting that constrains action (planting, photographing, tracking time). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The summit setting charges the final image when "the summit of Tycho Crater gleamed, untouched for now, a lie of permanence," making the environment indispensable to the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The water barrel functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's diagnostic method (he coaxes light into a lens, painting the error in his mind). The mist-coated depot supplies tactile and auditory detail (clatter, gas lamps, cobblestones) that filter through Elias's non-visual senses. The array housing's jagged seam and the iridescent film are specific, purpose-driven anchors. Spatial choreography is clean: stool outside shop, barrel, crowd, ship's flank, return to shop. The final image—wake splitting mist into halves—charges closure by mirroring the repair's precision.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake center, and condensation on glass provide tactile constraint: the ice's thinness and the dock's creaking inform Lena's final approach. Sensory detail—wet stone scent, black glassy ice, breath fogging—is selective and grounds the mystical turn. The outpost's "groaning in relief" charges the closure image, and the ice sealing behind her makes the environment active in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archway, cobblestones, and well function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the action: the archway "deciding whether to stand or surrender" pressures the tuner's pace, and the cobblestones warming underfoot signals revival progress. Sensory selection is strong (rust and gold light, scent of bread, thin voice) and filtered through the tuner's professional attention. The final image of laughter from a silent street reweights prior atmospheric detail. The setting actively participates in escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered—corroded plates, split dome, bioluminescent jellyfish, mosaic star-maps—and the rebreather countdown anchors time pressure. The perfume vial recurs across beats, shifting from warm keepsake to mist-threaded light to empty vessel, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (chamber, dome, water above), though the transition from entombment to three-day drift and half-full rebreather blurs physical plausibility and distances the setting's constraint from the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight pulse anchor early and pressure Elias's climb (iron bars, cracked glass spiral, rusted gears). The lattice as micro-object constrains the ascent and charges the ending when it "knits itself back together." Sensory hierarchy (salt-thick voices, warm wood, cool pane) filters through urgency. The scuffs on the door and the gearworks recur with specificity, shaping both entry and the discovered bodies. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical moves.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered (frost-weeping glass, blackened vines, nightshade blooms) and anchors every beat. The oldest tree's cavity of glowing veins constrains the awakening action and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the orchard's alchemical properties (poison-thriving soil, tree as Vesper's vessel) enable the climactic resurrection. Micro-setting (bead buried in soil, glass panes sealing) directly shapes tactics and closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    The red canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (brine scent, copper air, red dust veins), and spatial choreography remains clear. The Heart Chamber's "stone pulsed like a second heartbeat" charges the ending image, and the labyrinth's shifting paths directly enable the closure moment. However, no environmental constraint narrows a mid-scene choice; setting functions more as backdrop and final-image device than as a pressure that alters tactics during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered: roots snaking through bones, air tasting of figs and damp earth, the sundial base warm despite burial. Spatial choreography (descent, niches, mural wall, sundial hollow) remains coherent across beats. The environment directly constrains and guides Elias's work—roots dictate his path, the hollow accepts the seed, the sapling's emergence through cracked stone charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through his labor-focused perception (calloused hands, methodical brushing of dirt) and modulates with his emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden arcade is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (neon ghosts, chrome-and-glass, bleep-bloop symphony) and filters through Lena's professional POV. The mailbox, clipboard, and chalk constrain her methods and charge the closure sequence. The micro-setting (arcade alley, mailbox) shapes the mailing ritual. Spatial choreography is clean. The environment constrains choice at the mailing beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the final image doesn't fully leverage the setting's pressure—elevating it would require the arcade's elements to more decisively alter the closure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn sky, and eternal candle provide vivid anchors, and the embroidery loom and telescope constrain Elias's actions across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is coherent (Elias at the loom, courier entering, enforcers on the stairs), and the flame's flicker synchronizes with the telescope to create a functional micro-setting. However, the "adjacent possibilities" clockwork and the walls "bleeding" stars into mortar remain abstract rather than tactile, and the final dome-shattering lacks sensory grounding—no sound, no sensation of glass or air, just metaphor. The setting charges the closure image but does not evolve causally; the observatory remains static until it conveniently explodes to serve the thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt, mist, gnarled roots, black water, scent of damp earth) and recurs as a spatial constraint—Liora must navigate its tangle and "step free" at the end. The shard functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pressed to palm, warm at collarbone) and its state shift (cracks sealing) constrains the moment by mirroring her own healing. However, the spirits remain atmospheric decoration rather than a force that alters tactics; they question and sing but never block or enable a choice. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment charges the final departure, yet the labyrinth's role is more symbolic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atrium's mist, ivy "like old barbed wire," and twilight violet-gold ceiling create a charged liminal zone that mirrors Lena's role as threshold interpreter. The coral fragment's "labyrinthine grooves" and the cast's smudged surface function as micro-settings that constrain her method (tracing, decrypting) and recur at closure when the coral passes to the boy. Spatial choreography is clean: bench, boy approaching from mist, siren beyond glass. The anesthetic's dulling effect and "ribs singing" anchor bodily pressure. The final image—smudges glowing "like embers"—transforms prior detail into a charged symbol without forcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog-shrouded orchard is vivid and selective: skeletal trees, moss-softened earth, the greenhouse patched with waxed canvas, light slanting "in strange, liquid ways." Spatial choreography is clean (orchard → studio → orchard), and the environment directly charges the closure—stringing film between dead trees turns the fog itself into a canvas. The micro-setting (the fresco fragment, the film, the vials of light-paint) shapes Liora's method and the final projection. However, the sensory catalog leans visual throughout; scent of peaches and the buzz of laughter appear only in the climactic projection, not earlier to ground Liora's lived experience of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vivid and particular, with sculptures that hum at frequencies and respond to the nickel, constraining Liora's exploration and charging the final crossing. The hobo nickel functions as a micro-setting object that enables key transitions. The spatial choreography across garden, mural courtyard, and painted door is mostly clear, though the nested reality layers risk some disorientation that the piece teaches as intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse anchors early with vivid sensory detail ("damp earth and crushed mint," vines around shelves), and the public garden behind the textile factory provides tactical grounding for the coded planting. Spatial choreography is clean across locations. The gourd seed as micro-object constrains the resistance method and charges the final image (splitting open in the dark), satisfying the 9+ constraint test and elevating the score despite limited occupational depth on entomology itself.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gargantuan shell is anchored early and richly detailed (spiraled walls etched with war names, acoustics bent to holy, mouth open to the sea), and it constrains the poet's perceptual world (tide of memory, calcium veins vibrating). The postcard, helmet, and poppies function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the shell remains abstract—no clear sense of how the poet moves between the niche, the mouth, and the ghost's position. The sensory palette is vivid but sometimes generic ("crushed violets and gunpowder turned to pollen" reads stock). The shell's role as setting that forces a choice or alters tactics is present but modest; it amplifies her voice rather than constraining it.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The opal library, moonstone shelves, glass-orchids, and bamboo chime function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the chime's crack motivates repair, its sealed state triggers the awakening, its final destruction is the climactic act. Sensory detail (ozone and foxglove regret, translucent petals, blackened bamboo) is vivid and selective, filtered through Liora's curatorial attention. Spatial choreography remains coherent (aisles, chime location, dome overhead). The setting charges the final image when sunlight spills into the ruins, reweighting the library from cradle to mourning-site.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive setting is vivid (crushed violets, slow decay, brittle scrolls) and constrains Elara's choices: the emissaries' arrival at dawn creates a ticking clock, and the archive's acoustics matter when she sings into the harmonic gaps. The inkwell and parchment function as micro-setting, charged at closure when the shard "never stopped singing." Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard below, doors swing open). The setting shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but some details (sylph-touched indigo, Twin Moons) remain ornamental without pressing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amphitheater's breath and the volcano's groan create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Liora's deliberation. The surveyor's chain is handled in multiple beats (kneeling, coiling, unspooling onto the table) and its brass links anchor tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (amphitheater → valley → table). The chain's hook weights the blueprint in the final beat, a micro-setting detail that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is well-managed: dust, mist, brass temperature reflect POV priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The attic functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's world to ledgers, pigeons, and dust-light patterns that he reads "like sheet music." The skylight's square of pale light anchors the dust-mapping action and charges the final image when "the dust swirled in time" with his hum. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elias's musical past (ruffled feathers "like crumpled sheet music"). The setting shapes tactics (pigeon training, meteorite on windowsill) and pressure (Madame Holloway's intrusion).

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace's wood grain constrains Elias's search (he follows the curl to find the husk), and the sinkhole's lashed-chair ladder is tactile and specific. Sensory details—kerosene/salt smell, cornstalks whispering, fireflies pulsing—are filtered through urgency. The maze's spatial logic (designed confusion vs. the "real center") directly shapes the plot. Minor slip: the "drifting prism" shimmer on the terrace is noted but never returns or alters a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drowned facility is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: cracked glass domes, bioluminescent algae as living maps, corroded wiring, the pressure groaning in harmony with tides. The underwater environment constrains action (oxygen tanks, the weight of water) and charges the final image (Elara staying below, Kael surfacing). Micro-setting elements—the burnt feather, the scope, the observation deck—recur with reweighted meaning. The facility's pressure and the "respite" hour shape the emotional arc, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The iridescent geode is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors (sea-foam, opalescent mist, damp crystal floor) and the crater glass functions as both object and micro-setting that constrains her task. Spatial choreography is clean. The cave's "cheerful gloom" and breathing walls charge the final departure. However, occupational detail (how recollection works, what the role entails) remains generic, and the geode's sealing feels decorative rather than a constraint that shaped prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade's slick cobblestones, tide timing, fire-eater's torch, and gull overhead function as tactical variables Lior integrates into his performance, directly constraining his note choices and stance shifts. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (spray cooling ankle, torch flare synced to arpeggio). Micro-setting qualifies: the bishop in the case, the tide's math, and the torch's position all shape on-page choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    The twilight garden, blackened pond, and waterlilies supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through the POV's ceremonial focus. The moonstone dust and pond reflection function as micro-setting that constrains the verse-inscribing action. The garden's sensory details—crushed nightshade, petals unraveling—modulate with the ritual's progression and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves; the heron's disappearance and the pond's reflection both serve the method and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atrium's glass walls, central pool, and mist function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's ritual and charges the closure. The prism he aligns "warmed" and "pressed against the glass wall" is handled twice with evolving purpose. Sensory hierarchy is strong: salt, damp glass, mist curling. The spatial choreography (dock, walkway, atrium, pool) remains coherent. The stone's sinking and lingering ripples supply a concrete anchor for the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit ridge, blackened trunk, flat stone, and steep descent are integrated into action (tracing bark, sitting, drawing, walking). The porcelain box functions as micro-setting, constraining his choice to finally open it and later leave it. The moon's climb and dawn's arrival mark time and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (scent of damp earth and resin, breath fogging porcelain). The spatial choreography—ridge as spine between burned and untouched valleys—directly mirrors his internal state and shapes the ending descent. Minor gap: "slow dance of celestial bodies" is poetic but vague as a time anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto is vividly rendered—"walls smooth as glass," tide-polished, kelp and driftwood—and sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The setting does light work: the tide threatens to erase her charcoal equations, signaling impermanence, and the grotto's transformation at the end charges the final image. However, the environment never concretely constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; the tide rises but Liora's actions remain unforced. Spatial choreography is clean, and the gauge as micro-object recurs with reweighted meaning, which supports the band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (damp stone, pulse, scent of old smoke and wet earth). The crumbling alcove, sealed door, and shrine room are spatially coherent, and the ivy "as if listening" recurs to charge the final departure. The passage itself constrains Elias's movement and the sealed door becomes a literal threshold he must breach. Micro-setting (film negative, diaries, tuning fork) functions well. One gap: the post-climate-shift world (drowned coasts, acid rains) is declared but never shapes a present choice or resource constraint on the page; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terrace functions as micro-setting: the prism parapet refracts light into rainbows (charged early and reprised at closure when they fade), the stone balustrades and flagstones establish spatial grounding, and the bells' echo rolls over the stones to mark time's passage. The cracked mirror on the parapet's edge is handled twice, once as borrowed prop and once as the vessel for the heartbeat's unraveling. However, the terrace itself does not constrain a choice—Liora could perform this ritual anywhere—and the spring setting (wet earth scent, fireflies) remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The terrace's stones, skeletal vines, and cracked mosaic create spatial coherence. The ebony clipboard—smooth grain, notched edge—is handled in multiple beats and its tactile weight constrains Veyra's grip and ritual staging. The midsummer sun and lavender/gunpowder scent charge the final image. However, the "slow dance of celestial bodies" and stars remain ornamental metaphor rather than active environmental pressure on choice, limiting the 9+ gate despite strong micro-setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered through embodied detail (crust brittle under boots, fissures as veins, salt brushed from knees). Micro-setting test satisfied: the fissure at the center directly enables the egg-placement choice and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent with Elias's calculating attention. However, the storm/thunder remains atmospheric decoration—it does not constrain any on-page decision or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silver courtyard, falling snow, and prism sanctuary supply vivid visual anchors and spatial coherence. The snow's final reprise ("melted where she stood") charges the ending image with heat/cold contrast. However, the setting does not constrain a choice: the threads hum and pulse but do not resist her technique, and the vault interior (echoes as visible ghosts) remains postcard description without altering her approach or forcing a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dome's acoustics and history (a machine built to listen, now deaf) are specific and purposeful, charging the thematic texture. The salt flats and campfire ground the setting with vivid, selective detail. The charred stick functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning in the final beat (pocketed, "glowing like a secret"). Spatial choreography is clear; the setting constrains perception and subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's moss-swallowed stillness and cloud-suspended height are vivid and specific. The setting charges the final image (spiral shadow on the grotto wall) and the body/tool constraint (hands weaving, breath of air carrying the wing) shapes on-page action. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Lior's priorities. Meets the 9+ quick test criteria but minor over-reliance on atmospheric description without further tactical constraint caps it at 7.2.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glacier sanctum, aurora, and ice establish a vivid sensory environment filtered through craft vocabulary (wax, silver, crevasse). The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elira's ritual and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent: kneeling, rope coiled, walls weeping, aurora pulsing. However, the setting description sometimes stalls momentum with lyric phrasing ("blue-dark," "snowmelt ardor given form") rather than being woven through goal-directed action, and the professional craft detail (lost wax casting) is signaled but not mechanically constraining on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bunker's corroded walls, ivy-choked hatch, and peeling murals are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean (hatch → roots on floor → terminal → wall). The setting constrains choice at closure: Lior's touch on the bunker wall triggers the transformation, making environment an active participant. The rewilded forest and storm supply both sensory texture and thematic pressure. Sensory selection is strong—ozone, machine oil, breath fog—and filtered through Lior's focused perception. Minor gap: the crossroads and its collapse in the film are described but not grounded in concrete spatial anchors that would deepen the reader's sense of the geography Lior navigates mentally and physically.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The palace setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked mosaics, chiseled sigils, and the descent constrain Qishti's movements and charge the atmosphere. The tile itself functions as micro-setting, recurring with evolving meaning (warm, pulsing, rewritten onto skin) that directly shapes the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("thick with the scent of damp and something older"). The underground sanctum supplies the altar and schematics that enable the final reconfiguration, making setting essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sanctuary is rendered with purposeful sensory compression—"silence thick as wool," walls breathing, scent of rain on dry earth—and its soundlessness directly constrains the music box's function, charging the final note's return. The box itself operates as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats (tracing the lid, prying the pin, pressing it back) and left behind in the dirt with the pin "gleaming like a question," a detail that reweights the closure image. Spatial choreography (center, edge, floor, horizon) remains clear throughout shifts in memory and present action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ruined orchard, fog, frost, and twilight are vividly rendered and filtered through the protagonist's perception. The sextant functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure when it dissolves and the mirror becomes "smooth as still water." The orchard's transformation (skeletal branches to constellation shapes to light-bearing fruit) constrains the protagonist's final move and charges the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate criteria. Minor deduction for the workshop's mirrors ("refused to reflect anything but fog") being told rather than shown altering a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard-within-cathedral is vividly particular ("apple boughs sagged...their roots tangled through the cracked marble like veins") and constrains the final choice: the mender plants the seed "where the light bends" (rose window), anchoring the closure image in spatial specificity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (quartz dust, loam pulse, tart apple). The ribbon tied to the branch and the doll left beneath the sprout charge the ending with micro-setting pressure. The interplay of stone, fruit, and light grounds every beat without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The astral orchard is vivid and purposeful: violet blossoms show past curators, fractal spirals constrain Veyra's choices, and pollen traces equations. The bathroom acoustics detail is specific and functional. The orchard's door and the museum's return are spatially coherent. The cameo's final engraving change ("Complicated") and the pistachio shell bearing Veyra's face charge the ending image with setting-object synergy, elevating the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain bookstore with shifting aisles, shelves "like ribs of some slumbering titan," and books with blank titles creates a coherent otherworldly space. The botanical diary (flowers blooming in reverse, margins with "unwritten" symbols) functions as both map and constraint, guiding Elias's search. The Library's door—"a slab of stone that wasn't there until you needed it to be"—and the "chasm of unwritten light" directly pressure the climax. Spatial choreography (aisles rearranging, the traveler blocking Elias, the door sealing) remains clear. The bookstore's final sigh and reconfiguration charge the ending image with the sense of a living, patient trap.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    The carnival ship setting is vivid and purposeful: funhouse mirrors, carousel horses, the ledger in the captain's quarters all supply resources that shape the climactic act. The emerald swatch (micro-object) charges the final image by bleeding color into the sister and later becomes "emerald threads" for future rescues. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt and old cotton candy, earth and crushed petals). The fog functions as both barrier and door, directly shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mechanism room is vividly anchored ("cathedral of brass and silence," "scent of oil hung thick as incense") and the rope's texture matters throughout. The door's wax seal impression and the gears' stuttering supply environmental pressure that shapes Elara's tactics. However, the library beyond the door—"pages of frozen breath, spines of woven shadow"—veers into poetic abstraction without grounding physicality or spatial choreography, and the transition back to the mechanism room elides how the shift occurred, weakening the micro-setting's grip on the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harmonic caves constrain Eldrin's method (reading echoes in stone and ice) and supply the materials for his conjuring. The echo chamber stone, frozen seep, and ripple-marks are handled tactilely across multiple beats and charge the final image: "ripple-marks...shivering, rewriting themselves." Sensory selection is purposeful—dim light, cold, moisture, low thrum—and filtered through Eldrin's mapkeeper lens. The caves function as both setting and living archive, shaping every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass tower with "spiral stairs…worn thin by centuries of salt wind" and the humming pavilion whose walls sing constrain her climb and charge the final image. The star-path grooves are handled tactilely ("fingertips…remembered the rhythm") and enable the rekindling. Sensory detail is purposeful: the wind's scent of rain, the perpetual dusk, the beacon cutting through it. The body-as-micro-setting qualifies (her ribs mirror the hush) and the pavilion's song reappears at closure, anchoring her decision to return.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal flags, the Spear's shadow, and the stormlit observatory above clouds are vividly rendered and purposefully integrated. The flags hold borrowed memory that Summer-Quill handles ("pressing her fingers," later "her palm"), and the shadow's twitch and the space where it "would fall" directly enable the vision-touch moment. The observatory's isolation and the storm's rhythm charge the final image ("the candle flames bent toward the future"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or recurring object constrains choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fortress at dusk with glowing blooms and starless sky creates a vivid, purposeful frame that constrains Liora's choice to climb and launch at night. Sensory detail—crushed lavender, old gunpowder, metallic tang—is filtered through Liora's professional and emotional priorities. The mosaic tiles reweight at closure when starlight makes the message shimmer. Spatial choreography (tower climb, descent) tracks cleanly. However, the "blooms below flared brighter, their glow climbing the walls like vines of liquid fire" leans toward poetic convenience; the mechanism by which her rocket ignites the fortress blooms is unclear and risks breaking internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly anchored with moonlight pooling "like spilled ink," the drip-and-ripple water, and the scent of wet earth and jade. The tidal pools function as micro-setting that reveal the chronicler's method and return at the end with the hermit crab's cracked shell, charging the closure image. The stars, the tide's retreat, and the dawn horizon track the passage of time and pressure the fisherman's departure. No occupation-level depth is required here, and the sensory selection (metallic tang of jade, white breath cloud) remains purposeful and POV-filtered throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bunker's "curved ribs," "rust" taste, and "coppery" silence anchor setting through POV-filtered detail. The xenial trellis—bone-white vines, warm lattice, hushed bloom—constrains the child's sprouting attempts and charges the final ascent. Spatial choreography (ceiling becomes pit, trellis above clouds) remains coherent across inversions. The trellis's changing texture (thickened, gilded) tracks causally. The bloom's core and the child's gilded palm directly enable the bunker's collapse, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prism terrace, storm glass vial, and canal setting supply vivid sensory anchors (mirrored planes fracturing dusk, copper spoon dipping droplets, fractured rhythms of water). The brass dial and terrace prisms constrain Elias's ritual actions, and the final prism adjustment charges the closure image. Orientation delay (who/where/when unclear until ~150 words) caps this category at 7.0 per the rubric. Spatial choreography remains coherent once established, and the setting's role in bending sound into comfort is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and underground atrium are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity ("silver-leaved trees," "ozone and old metal," "geometric tiles"). The ruby flake as recurring object constrains action (unlocks hatch, melts throne) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the descent and chamber sequence. The waterfall's shift from kaleidoscope to "just water" at the end provides a concrete environmental marker of change, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen sanctuary is vivid and purposeful: "charcoal and old incense," starlight through the cracked dome, scars in the wood. The doorknocker ring is handled twice and the sanctuary's fading edges constrain Lior's final choice. Micro-setting (the ring, the wood, the threshold) charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: the dampest corner houses the bolt, the mushrooms pulse and dim in sync with metaphysical pressure, and their light casts "long, wavering shadows" that enhance the glitchy atmosphere. The farm's air thickens and walls ripple during the bolt-turning beat, directly shaping Lina's experience. The final image—mushrooms dimming "like forgotten constellations"—charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid (indigo pulses, ozone scent, mycelium-embedded diamond) and filtered through Lina's survivor pragmatism. The desert edge provides spatial boundary and escape vector.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sepia reading room constrains Elias's search (hidden ledger in foundation, precise twilight angle, floorboard vibration) and charges the closure: "every shelf, every groove in the floorboards, every golden shadow cast at this precise angle" becomes the record itself. The gramophone and mirror function as micro-setting anchors that recur with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail (the cold handle, pressure through shoe soles, blackened mirror silvering) is filtered through Elias's focalized perception and integral to his discovery, meeting the 9+ test for constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with specific sensory anchors: glass panes weeping condensation, crushed silverleaf scent, plants that unfold rather than grow, and roots tracing sigils. The greenhouse functions as a temporal pressure chamber ("a moment stretched thin"), and the final clearing of the glass panes to reveal the stage constrains the knight's final choice. The body (gauntlet, breath, teeth aching from script) and the program object charge the climax, meeting the 9+ gate criterion that setting or object must shape the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The file room is concrete (yellowed paper, sour coffee tang, chipped mug, manila spines) and the button's tactile presence (tarnished brass, bent shank, worn edges) charges multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean: Elias at the desk, the button rolling, the Polaroid beside the discharge papers. The setting constrains choice—Elias has access to archives and military records—enabling the genealogical discovery that drives the mailing. Minor gap: the halfway house in Toledo and the studio apartment imagined for Daniel lack the specificity given to the file room, reducing their pressure on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The auric lagoon constrains the inciting encounter (booth appears only there, only at dusk), and the booth itself—glass panes, dangling receiver, flickering walls—becomes a charged micro-setting that houses the key turning point. The puddle-reflection method anchors setting to choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("ozone," "liquid memory," "silt"). Spatial choreography remains clear across four time shards. The key in Lena's pocket at closure and the booth reappearing under stars charge the final image with prior environmental particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The radiant grotto, mist, and prism atrium create a vivid, recurring spatial frame that charges the opening and return. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "damp stone and crushed mint," "dewdrops forming like tears." However, the setting does not constrain a choice—it functions as atmosphere rather than tactical pressure. Spatial choreography inside the atrium is vague (where does he stand, how close to the panes?), and the slip of paper in the saxophone case is a prop convenience rather than an earned environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ashen arbor with dangling roots, parchment sky, and monuments is vivid and purposeful. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting: it constrains her choice to climb and charges the final transformation when pressed to the sapling's bark. Spatial choreography (branch, crown, ladder of roots, ledge, grove) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is selective (warm as breath, humming seeds, bark splitting along silver veins) and filtered through Liora's task-focused attention. The arbor's transformation—roots forming a ladder, then vanishing to become a grove—alters her environment causally and supplies the new workspace at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and specific: charcoal-scented boneyard, waterlogged harbor relics, greenhouse with glowing leaves, cavern with slow-falling water. The compass and ledger constrain his next choice (wedging the gear), and the greenhouse path shapes his descent. Spatial choreography remains clear across four locations. The glowing leaves function as micro-setting that charges the final image when they "part like a crowd." Gate satisfied: environment constrains choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The foundry is vividly rendered—rain, rust, ash, corroded roof—and the crucible directly enables the coin's transformation, shaping the climactic beat. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, workbench, crucible's maw). The dawn exterior and workshop return provide atmospheric closure but do not constrain further choices. Sensory detail is rich without overwhelming, and the setting charges the final image of the glowing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (pale gold mist, wet earth, stone conspirators) filtered through Liora's collector lens. The gorge itself constrains and guides: cliffs lean in, echoes answer, and the harp waits at the site of loudest laughter, making setting a functional pressure rather than postcard. The crocodile's tooth—worn at her throat, warming as she descends—operates as micro-setting object that charges the final image when it glints in sunrise. Spatial choreography remains clear (boots on damp stone, kneeling at harp, scattering petals) and the dawn timeline brackets the action purposefully. Setting earns high marks for integration with choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultraviolet forest constrains perception (black leaves, bruise-colored glow) and the basin of black water charges the climax by reflecting the interrogator and then Liran's younger self, altering his stance. Sensory detail is selective and vivid—bark "slick with something like sap, something like blood," air tasting "like burnt copper and old hymns"—and filtered through Liran's proprioceptive hypersensitivity. The pewter strap's shift to violet where light touched it functions as micro-setting that reweights the object at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist's market is vividly rendered—ropes groaning, lights flickering, stalls where "time moved differently"—and its suspended, liminal quality charges the atmosphere. The lighthouse lens fragment constrains Lior's choice: slotting it into her coat clasp triggers the market's light shift and the painter's validation, anchoring the closure image. Micro-setting (the coat's collection of keepsakes, the painter's booth counter) functions as spatial constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("scent of rain before it fell," "ink that smelled of salt and rust"), though some phrases ("lantern light like a trapped storm") trend ornamental. The market's verticality and the edge-of-rooftops finale provide spatial coherence across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (buttered popcorn, damp sawdust, peeling wallpaper) and constrains action throughout—the ceiling cracks shape investigation, the dust patterns provide crucial evidence. The shift from office to revealed mechanism above is spatially coherent. The tool (mainspring barrel) functions as micro-setting, actively used to unlock the ceiling door. However, the "vast, silent mechanism—gears the size of wagon wheels" lacks the selective, filtered detail that would show Elias's professional priorities; it reads slightly catalog-like in the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard library and sea of clouds supply vivid, purposeful imagery that charges the final dissolution. The frost patterns function as a micro-setting element, constraining Elias's decision to unstopper the bottle and press the page. Spatial choreography remains clear across press, shelves, and windows. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than as a constraint that shapes tactics; no tool, distance, or environmental feature limits his choices in a way that alters outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    The baroque asteroid, black stone cathedral, time-strands "thick as rope," and the storm's charged particles create vivid atmosphere and are woven through action (Elias covering mirrors, moving through chambers, kneeling at the altar). The shard functions as a micro-setting element that charges the final image. However, spatial choreography is sometimes vague—where exactly Taelis enters, how close she stands, and the cathedral's layout during the vision blur under the figurative density. The setting constrains one choice (covering mirrors during the storm) and charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the occasional opacity in blocking and the fact that the environment doesn't tighten Elias's tactics further cap the score in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber is concretely rendered (brass walls, vibrating, "leaning in," glowing veins) and constrains the final transformation—its function as containment and amplifier enables the climactic unwinding. The music box and its gears are handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clear (Elias kneels, lifts the stone, presses it to his chest, turns the crank). The setting charges the final image: the empty chamber with one warm gear is the story's residue. "Mist," "ozone and old copper," and tactile warmth provide sensory grounding without catalogue excess.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subterranean lagoon directly charges the closure: warm-where-cold water, reverse waterfall, stone arch keystone all externalize the "hinge won't hold" motif and constrain Elias's final choice. Micro-setting (the compass pulsing against his thigh, minerals like scattered stars) filters through his collector's attention. The factory skeleton frames the opening and closing, anchoring the post-industrial timeframe. Spatial choreography is clean from catwalks to cliffs to lagoon chamber. Setting details (ozone, old pennies, wet stone) are sensory and purposeful, not catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-tossed archway is vividly rendered ("salt-crusted stone," "jagged mouth," "ribcage of some ancient leviathan") and pressures Elias's situation by blocking his route and forcing engagement. The lantern slide functions as micro-setting, its "brass edges warm as if alive" and layered surface constraining his perception and choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wind's "turbine-hum," gulls wheeling left). The archway's stones "humming with the same layered frequency as the slide" charges the closure when Elias carves and embeds the blackthorn hand, making the environment indispensable to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber pavilion, stained glass, and night-blooming jasmine are vivid and filter through Liora's artistic perception. The cathedral window constrains her investigation and charges the closure when she presses a postcard to it and sees the preserved flowers. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("the cold seeping into her bones like a confession," "scent thick and sweet"). The melting snow tracks time and mirrors the thematic shift from seeking to stillness. The recurring objects (postcards, glass, jasmine) return with reweighted meaning and the final garden moment grounds the renunciation spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    The zeppelin library, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (brass hull groaning, salt-stung air, ozone scent). The skiff descent and lagoon's edge—littered with locket, shoe, ribbon—ground Elias's choices in tactile particulars. The lagoon's surface ripples with "a hundred hands reaching up," charging the final image. Spatial choreography (zeppelin → skiff → lagoon shallows → return) tracks cleanly. The obsidian lagoon constrains the parley and provides the medium for release, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective—phosphorescent tide, burnt sugar, paper lanterns—filtered through the alchemist's memory-as-alchemy lens. The amber bottle functions as a micro-setting object: held, warmed, pulsed, then released, constraining his grip and charging the closure image when it rolls into the tide. Spatial choreography (kneeling in sand, standing, turning toward docks) remains coherent. The cove's resurrection is rendered through layered senses (scent first, then sound, then touch) that reflect urgency and purpose, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop garden is anchored early and purposefully: "a liminal space for archiving emotional patterns too fragile for ink," and the ancient pear trees constrain and charge the closure (Elias will bury the shaving "beneath the oldest tree, where the roots could decide"). Sensory details—salt-thick air, orchid petals, wind carrying blossoms and subway hum—are filtered through Elias's priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent (basin, trees, ledger, sky). The body and tool (wax shaving, basin, his temple) participate in micro-setting terms. The environment shapes the final choice (burial beneath the tree), meeting the 9+ gate for Q3, but the garden's function feels more thematic than tactically constraining across beats, holding the score in the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound atrium under starlight constrains every choice: permafrost resists planting, ice cracks signal danger, the iron ribs groan, and thawing moss provides the nest. The setting is handled texturally (ozone and old growth scent, breath crystallizing into fractals) and charges the final image as ice melts and leaves unfold. The body-as-setting also functions: Liora's kneeling position, trembling fingers, and the seed "squirming like a minnow" in her grip all pressure her actions. The vortex beneath the floor remains slightly vague as a spatial anchor but functions sufficiently as atmospheric constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The windblown sanctuary, spiral stairs, belfry, and alpine light ground the action vividly. The rope's weight and the wind's pull constrain Elias's final choice—leaving slack as a counterweight is a micro-setting decision that charges the closure. Sensory detail is purposeful: the bell's hum, breath curling in cold air, the storm's breath against the sanctuary's bones. The piece uses the body and tool (hand on bell, rope through arms) as micro-setting effectively. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the climb and bell work.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The station setting is vivid and purposeful: "metal ribs groaning," "cracked but still luminous" lantern glass, observation dome all anchor the scene and constrain Eli's choices (he must stay to witness, uses the lantern to focus light). The lantern's physical transformation (cracks healing) charges the final image and provides a concrete object that recurs with shifted meaning. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Eli's patient, spiritual lens ("ghostly heat," "veins of starlight").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The skeletal hives, melted wax "tears," sand-swallowed dunes, and stained glass box create vivid micro-setting that constrains the beekeeper's world and charges the closure (box atop hive, handprint). Sensory detail (thyme scent, wind shift, raindrop) modulates with pressure. The wasteland's transformation from howling to "steady breath" directly mirrors the covenant's untangling, elevating setting to thematic participant. No slips in spatial logic or continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The silo's interior—rusted door, spiral staircase, scratched messages, workbench—supplies atmospheric detail and constrains Elias's path upward. The garage-sale objects line the walls with micro-setting specificity. The final bulb and workbench anchor the climax spatially. The emerald patina and "timeless air" charge the setting, though the silo functions more as symbolic container than active pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain functions as active setting: wet salt and crushed reeds anchor sensory presence, the shallows provide the medium for the feather's prism effect, and the water's refusal to reflect perfectly mirrors the poet's thesis. The body (kneeling, wading, fingers brushing sand) and recurring objects (feather, kite, notebook) constrain multiple choices. The heron's return and the fisherman's patched boat supply thematic counterpoint. Spatial choreography is clean (shore to shallows to shore) and the environment charges the final image of the heron stepping through reeds.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The temple orchard's living stone pillars and hollow chambers where roots trade nutrients are vivid and purposeful, grounding the architectural-secrets concept. Copper wire and sapling constrain Elira's final work (she kneels despite cracking joints, guides growth around pillar flaws). The orchard's "whisper" (wood against stone, copper chime) charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: western quadrant, central pillar, sapling against ribcage curve. Micro-setting (wire, diary, bark) functions as world. Minor: the professional systems (nutrient trade in darkness) are sketched rather than tested under pressure, but the wire's oxidation feeding trees without poisoning them supplies one constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    The rainwashed tower, amber fly, dusty footprints, and bronze filigree are vivid and specific. The sculptures "wrong in order" and the basin "that never overflowed" create unease. The amber fly functions as a tactile anchor (warming in her palm, dissolving into her veins) that constrains and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from tower exterior to "inside" could be tighter. The setting actively shapes the final choice: the terminal, the hologram, and the rearranging sculptures all pressure Elara's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and specific: the jetty's slick stones, the battlefield's moss-filled furrows, the salt and silt all ground the piece in concrete sensory detail. The jetty and seed pods function as micro-setting that constrains the coachman's ritual actions across multiple beats. However, the setting does not alter a key choice—the coachman's plan proceeds unimpeded by environmental resistance—and the "blooming jetty" element appears only in retrospective summary, not as a present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scrapyard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail ("ribs of twisted metal," "wind carved spirals in the dust"). The dome and vines constrain Rook's final choice, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the two locations. Sensory selection is strong but tilts heavily visual; other senses (sound of wind, smell of rust/rain) appear late and could sharpen earlier beats. The micro-setting (body, cylinder, leaf) functions effectively as a pressure element.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observation deck as liminal space with thinned air, frost-bitten metal, and creaking infrastructure grounds the scene with sensory specificity. The compass rose and sketchbook function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice (aligning sketch with stars, touching the applique). The station's silence and groaning metal pressure Lira's final action. However, the time-dilation mechanism remains abstract—no concrete detail shows *how* the deck "could make time feel" stretched, limiting its tactical constraint until the final beat where Lira "stretches toward the light."

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, violet sun, and wrong sky create vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Lirien's sacredly playful stance. Spatial choreography is clear: scaling, chambers, chessboard, window, descent. The ice shaping itself into footholds during descent and the spire singing at closure demonstrate setting-as-pressure and object constraint. Sensory detail—"breath curling in shapes that weren't quite smoke," "clouds churning like a restless sea"—remains selective and voice-consistent. The wrong sky functions as both constraint and stakes-marker, charging the final image when the first right star blinks into existence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.1)
    The whispering gallery is vividly described with "hollowed-out cathedral," "arches humming," and dust patterns, but it functions primarily as backdrop. The chessboard appears in multiple beats but does not meaningfully constrain Liora's tactics—she could perform the same symbolic unbinding in any setting. Spatial choreography is coherent (perimeter → center → floor) but remains illustrative rather than pressuring choice.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly grounded (shelves spiraling like fingerprint grooves, *Poetics of Silence* section, cracked atlas pedestal) and the mountain-as-throat metaphor sustains atmosphere. The stone itself—warm, pulsing, glyphs shifting when he blinks—functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: tracing the feather-texture rearranges glyphs into a map of his interior, directly enabling the pivot. The circular room with empty shelves and the lectern provide a charged final stage. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout all transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are vivid recurring objects, but spatial choreography is vague—where he stands relative to the village square, labyrinth, and inn is never made concrete. The final board game constrains the closure choice (he plays to stay, not win), lifting the score within the cap. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical; body, tool, and micro-setting are underused.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, mist, and echo-canyon create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere filtered through Liora's defiant POV. The "pale spire" and "jagged rib" constrain her climb and shape her tactical choice to reach "the fissure in the third tower, where the bone was thin enough to carve." Sensory detail—chalked fingers, cold bone, vibration of chant—grounds action. The canyon functions as both setting and antagonist: its echoes amplify her words to shatter the spire, charging the final image when she carves into "the spire's remains, where the light would refract it forever."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    The acid sea and brass-ribbed workshop create vivid, purpose-driven constraint: the rising water imposes a live clock and the corroded environment mirrors the alchemist's project of mending broken things. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency ("scent of corroded copper and something older—something like regret"). The key ring charm and statue pockmarks function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Minor gap: spatial choreography during the final transformation (statue's fingers closing, workshop dissolving, alchemist "already elsewhere") becomes abstract and the physical mechanics of "lifting" versus "pulling under" remain unclear, slightly reducing groundedness at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cave's bioluminescent moss, still pool, and acoustic details (the sigh, the hum) are vivid and body-specific. The pool constrains the central action: Elias kneels, presses the shell, drinks—each choice shaped by the water's stillness and the cave's "temporary eternity." The ochre-stained cliffs and swallowed docks anchor the village in ruin. Spatial choreography is clean: quay to cliff edge to cave mouth to cavern center to pool. The final leap uses the cliff's edge and the cave's "waiting mouth" to charge the closure image, qualifying the setting as essential to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt lighthouse and lantern room constrain choice: Elias must use its bones and vibrations to beckon the boats. Dawn's pale light and spent oil charge the opening and final images. The cork's tactile ridges and the harbor's spatial choreography remain clear. Does not reach 9-band: the lighthouse functions primarily as metaphor rather than imposing a physical constraint that alters the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The signal station is vividly anchored (rusted antennae, warped floorboards, dying relay switches) and micro-setting elements—the censer foot, typewriter, phone—constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: "salt wind," "click of relay switches," "breath fogging the bronze." The bronze censer foot functions as both object and setting micro-anchor, warming in her grip and shaping the closure beat. The cliffs, station interior, and props are spatially coherent and pressure choices throughout, though occupational systems (signal-station mechanics) remain sketched rather than deeply rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ravine and orchard constrain movement and supply the truffles that enable Lior's survival tactic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: mud, musk, storm-clawed roots. The eye's "unnatural weight" and truffle aroma as masking agent are micro-setting details that charge the final burial image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, climbing, pressing into earth) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal dock, mist, nautical twilight, and lighthouse form a coherent micro-setting filtered through Elias's observer role. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "slick with the breath of the sea," "dried storms and shipwreck sand," "sea sighed against the pilings." The boutonnière's physical transformation in saltwater and the Fresnel lens adjustment constrain the final beat, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (dock → workshop → lantern room). No occupation-level depth is required here, and the environment shapes rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern is rendered with purposeful sensory detail: wet earth, crushed mint, bioluminescent fungi, limestone gnawed by water. The creek's rise functions as both clock and constraint, forcing Elias deeper and charging his final choice. The chip and its glow act as micro-setting, guiding movement and charging key beats (warmth when he hesitates, flare when he nearly turns back). Spatial choreography holds cleanly through the fissure and door. The house at the end, however, arrives without spatial grounding—its sudden appearance and domestic warmth feel grafted rather than discovered, weakening the setting's continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt stone, ember grotto, violet fireflies, and starlight fissure anchor setting vividly and filter through the queen's purposeful perception. The grotto's breathing rock and copper-tasting air constrain her final choice—she must kneel and reach into the fissure to complete the bargain. The body (slippers, palm, veins, chest) functions as micro-setting, and the fireflies return with reweighted menace (teeth, silver wings) to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (halfway up, mouth of cavern, kneeling beside fissure) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly rendered—suspended bridges like veins of molten copper, steam vents hissing, gears groaning with "directed spontaneity"—and the setting's industrial-organic pulse charges the atmosphere throughout. The shell and the twilight setting constrain the emotional choreography and charge the final image when "their footsteps revaluing the streets" integrates environment into closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (railing, shadows, cobblestones). The setting passes the micro-setting test by anchoring choices and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cabin's "timber bones groaning," wind that "knew him," and pines "counting down" create vivid atmosphere. The grave outside and desk inside anchor spatial choreography. The birch bark scroll physically constrains choices (traced, clutched, burned), charging the final image when its ash settles and Elias steps out. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fogging windowpane, sharp mountain air).

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The water clock, brass gears, damp wood, copper smell (by memory), and harbor fog are vivid and filtered through Elias's lost sense. The shop functions as micro-setting: the clock's drip measures time, the glass counter fogs with his breath, and the loupe narrows his world to "edges not quite sharp." These details constrain his perceptual mode and charge the final image of winding the mechanism. Spatial choreography is clear; the fog's thinning signals morning arrival and brackets the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock tea platform functions as micro-setting: it "creaked as the wind tested its patience," "shuddered," and "began its slow descent," constraining Lian's ritual window and charging the final image when "the platform touched down gently, as if the earth itself had been waiting for her to finish." The mist, valley, and residual rain create saturated hush—sensory specificity filtered through Lian's attentive state ("the air still hummed with the threat of its return"). The crow's arrival and departure bracket the transformation with concrete environmental pressure. Minor penalty: the tea itself remains ornamental ("The tea beside her steamed, untouched") and does not constrain a later choice despite being named in the setting element.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's "yellowed paper and old roses" scent anchors early, and the orchard's falling apple concretizes the stakes. The perfume bottle constrains Mara's method and charges the closure (the empty vial on Elias's desk), satisfying the 9+ gate for recurring-object integration. Spatial choreography is clear—back room, table, orchard outside, then dawn planting—and sensory detail (sharp green tang of sap, bitter unripe fruit) reflects urgency. Minor gap: the city's bulldozing plan and the archive's physical connection to the orchard remain slightly abstract; we never see equipment or officials, which would have sharpened the temporal pressure and grounded the threat in concrete proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The temple library is vividly rendered with fractal corridors, bone shelves, and skin books, creating strong atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters the protagonist's approach. The dictionary appears in multiple beats and charges the final image (dissolution into light, then disappearance), meeting micro-setting integration. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the surreal geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cliffside station, brass instruments, hydraulic clock, copper pipes, theodolite, and fjord are vivid and purposeful. The key's physical warmth at seventy-three and the black water vomiting onto stones are specific sensory choices that constrain Elias's decision. The station's isolation and the fjord's quiet charge the final image when silence swallows the aftermath. Spatial choreography (cliff, tower, deck) remains clear across the ship's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("wet paper and old glue") and the lantern's fractured mica pane recurs with evolving symbolic weight. The subway scrawls and the liminal "place that smelled like rain on hot pavement" provide spatial specificity that charges the traversal moment. However, the library itself remains somewhat static—books whisper, shelves stretch—without materially constraining Lila's choices. The lantern and its light paths (gold/blue) do pressure her final decision, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subway utility tunnel is vividly rendered with selective detail (graffiti tags, ozone, damp metal, distant streetlamp hum) and consistently filtered through Elias's familiarity. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting: its vibrations and notes constrain his therapeutic method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (folding chair, phone booth, candle stub, rat scuttling past). The environment pressures choice subtly—the tunnel's isolation enables his niche, and the glass disc's sonic properties shape his ritual. Strong sensory selection supports tone without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting: violets in cracks, salt-bleached wood, tide pulling at pilings all charge the atmosphere and mirror the archivist's work of preservation through decay. The locket, vellum, and walnut ink constrain her ritual choices on the page. Sensory detail (damp earth, salt, ink drying dark) is selective and filtered through her archival focus, and the jetty's recurring bloom at the end charges the final image with regenerative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The station—ivy-choked platforms, kudzu-buried freight car, glass-strewn ticket booth—supplies tactile grounding and constrains Lena's movements (she must navigate debris, unseal the padlock). The moon rock functions as micro-setting, passed hand-to-hand and charging each transaction. Sensory selection is strong (camphor, old paper) and filtered through urgency. The final image of ivy swallowing the nameplate participates in closure, reweighting the station as a site of perpetual erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly particular: trees hum at different frequencies, sound bends like light through water, branches curve inward "like cupped hands." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elian's blindness—he tastes languages, feels vibrations, listens to the ground—and the setting directly enables his navigation method. The platinum ring's temperature shift (pulsing warmer, then cooling) functions as a constraint that guides his path and charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography is coherent (forest → clearing → dawn). Minor deduction: the constellations' pause is declared but never alters on-page choices or tactics; it remains ornamental backdrop rather than a live constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory, anomaly, and vellum are purposefully detailed and constrain the protagonist's interpretive work. The anomaly "unbends" time, the pen "glows faintly," and the vellum "drinks the ink greedily"—each detail charges the final choice to return to the hydroponic bays. Spatial choreography is clean (desk → console → outside → walk toward bays). Sensory selection reflects urgency: ozone, parchment, and the hum of the anomaly anchor the reflective beats. The meteorite nib and hydroponic setting are specific to the world's post-Unspooling logic, and the anomaly's visual flicker during the key transmission ties setting to the narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    The harbor (moonlight, salt, old wood) anchors early and returns in the ending "silence no longer empty but *alive*." The vintage camera's brass body and the water's luminous peaks provide tactile detail that shapes two beats. However, spatial choreography during the confrontation is vague—"standing on the water" and "lunged…toward" lack clear distances or positions—and the camera's transition from "no film" to "heavier" relies on metaphor rather than constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is anchored with vivid sensory detail (charred parchment, soot, humming air) and the desert wind at closure charges the final image. The third pillar constrains Elias's discovery and the key-and-seam mechanism shapes the climax. Micro-setting (tapestry, pillar, ledger) functions well. Minor issue: spatial choreography during the descent into "the archive's gut" remains vague, but the setting participates meaningfully in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline reeds, frequencies, gold-and-violet churning water). The lagoon functions as both setting and constraint: Lira's drumming on its surface is the means by which she releases memories, and the water's memory-retention property directly enables the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (perched at edge, feet above water, hand on surface, slipping in). The micro-setting of body and water charges the final image and constrains her choice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The geomagnetic storm, neon-twisted port, and shipping-container maze create a vivid, pressure-filled environment. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (Container Row 17, stacks, the dent in steel), and the storm's effect on compasses ties directly to the navigation challenge. The zodiac coin's constellation alignment with the dent is a strong micro-setting moment that charges the closure. Deduction: the storm's sensory impact fades after the opening, and the final "bunk" setting arrives without spatial transition, breaking continuity.

    The cobalt dock, slick planks, and canal fog ground the scene early with sensory specificity. The dental mirror functions as a tool that constrains the guardian's method (catching light, bending reflections) and charges the final image when it reappears on the father's workbench. The shutters of the abandoned boathouse supply a concrete mechanism for the pattern-weaving. The rain and stars modulate pressure, narrowing from threat to clarity. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the boy's arrival, kneeling, and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto constrain tactics: the grotto's pull intensifies, the filings hum and seal doors, the windows reflect chess patterns that stop the demolition crew. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("ozone and old parchment," "veins of blue," "low, resonant note"). Spatial choreography is clear (library steps, beneath the library, town displays). The ending image charges the grotto as a persistent force ("its magnetic heart beating"), fulfilling the micro-setting requirement. Minor slip: "twilight hour when the library's ghosts leaned closest" is a stock phrase that dilutes specificity at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The docks, salt-stiffened ropes, fog, and sublittoral fringe create vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elias's familiarity. The scrimshaw's warmth and vibration supply tactile micro-setting that constrains his choice to dive. However, "sublittoral fringe" appears twice as descriptor without shaping a specific tactic or choice—it charges the glowing revelation but doesn't pressure an earlier decision. Spatial choreography (pier, water, trench) remains clear. The setting supports atmosphere and one closure image (the glowing fringe reveals the cage) but doesn't supply a mid-story resource or obstacle that alters Elias's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Turbines as "slow, indifferent gods" recur to frame and charge the scream; the porch's splinters and the farmhouse's groaning dust anchor micro-setting. The knife and bouquet are handled tactically (whittling as displacement, petals scattering as release). The setting constrains choice—Lena's isolation on the porch, the wind's role in swallowing sound—and the turbines' mechanical mourning charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is tight: wind, dust, brittle petals filter through grief-numbed attention.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (hum "just beyond hearing," ice groaning, glyphs shifting). The quartz constrains Elira's choices—she walks the spiral, synchronizes breath, and ultimately kneels at the water's edge—charging the final image when the lake "answers" and thaws. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the spiral descent. The setting functions as both constraint and catalyst, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape a choice and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glassblower's courtyard is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail (phoenix embers in cobblestones, kiln, courtyard wall). The cracked vase functions as micro-setting that constrains a choice—Elias calls it "perfect," teaching Liora his aesthetic and enabling their connection. Sensory selection is strong (rosemary, geranium, basil) and filtered through Elias's plant-language POV. The courtyard's warmth and bloom charge the final image, directly supporting the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory is vividly detailed (copper wires, brass resonator, recordings of extinct instruments) and the lens functions as micro-setting, constraining the experiment and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (golden shadows, hum, warmth in palm). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The lens's physical properties (cracked facets, refraction) directly enable the plot's central turn, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains a choice or charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's brass telescopes, cracked dome, and stone steps constrain Lena's movements and charge the closure: she pulls open curtains, lights candles inside cranes, and uses alcoves for discovery. The workbench and tools (wire, vellum, needle) are tactile anchors that shape her craft choices. The winter snow and lined steps in the coda show environmental evolution that mirrors her transformation. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the micro-setting (bench, telescope, steps) functions as active setting at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rain-beaded skylight is vivid and purposeful, charging the opening and returning at the end to frame pattern recognition. The measuring tape, tarot cards, and manila envelope are handled tactilely across beats, grounding the esoteric work in concrete action. Spatial choreography is clear (worktable, intercom, visitor enters, visitor leaves). The loft itself does not constrain a choice in a high-pressure beat, but the recurring skylight image charges the final moment, lifting the category into the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    The archive's cracked dome, dust, and bronze surfaces anchor place vividly. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtering through the historian's priorities. The pagoda constrains the historian's approach (she turns it counterclockwise per old texts), and the chamber's trembling dust mirrors her internal release, charging the final image moderately. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating library and its blooming books constrain Liora's choice by offering a repository that "never died," making the shadow-trade spatially and thematically coherent. The stone functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats (found, examined, pressed to chest, placed on sill, glows at closure), its warmth and pulsing charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful ("air hummed with the weight of unread words"), though the clouds and curator's "yellowed parchment" hands veer toward stock imagery without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The misty workshop, terrarium glass fogging, and stars anchor setting effectively. The chameleon's wound and silk-thin cicada membrane constrain Elias's reconstruction choices, charging the final image when Lumen turns "the color of new leaves." Sensory selection is strong ("damp earth and crushed herbs"), though the mist as recurring motif borders on atmospheric convenience rather than lived constraint. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting evolves with each ritual layer.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower functions as micro-setting and constraint: its stone "tunneling," ivy "humming," and beams "whispering" pressure Liora's telepathic awareness and frame her isolation. The hourglass (frost-laced window, sill, sand frozen/thawing) recurs with reweighted meaning and charges the closure beat when it "ran out." The archive downstairs supplies the mother's file that triggers the final choice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "coffee rings...concentric confessions, brown halos of hesitation and haste" reflects her habit of reading marks. Dawn anchors time and returns at closure to breathe with her. The fern's fronds "trembling" and dust "like snow" vary texture without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The projection booth is concretely rendered with rusted reels, cold glass, ozone smell, and storm vibrations. The crystal ball and film strip function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elara's perception and method across multiple beats. The booth's spatial labyrinth ("every rusted bolt and cracked lens a doorway to some other when") charges the final act when she threads the film "her fingers sure now," linking environment to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered with "stone veined with silver like the scars of a god's forgotten battle" and "ozone and something older—remembered stardust." Sensory detail is purposeful: the instrument "pulsed warm," the auroras "bled into violet," and the well of "liquid darkness" ripples with constellations. The archway constrains the sequence (Liora must enter, follow the star, sing to unlock) and charges the final dissolution into "silver motes." Spatial choreography is clean through the journey from archway to well, and the setting's rules (time unravels, creativity is trapped) remain consistent and shape Liora's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dunes provide vivid, purpose-driven detail that charges multiple beats: they part to reveal the spark, bloom brighter as Hollow acts, and turn green at closure. The train cabin and crate anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Sensory selection (bioluminescent algae, rust, pulsing light) filters through a post-apocalyptic lens and reflects urgency. The chess clock as micro-setting object constrains Hollow's choice to wind it backward, directly charging the final image. Economy is high; no occupational padding. Setting details interweave with action rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mechanical rainforest supplies vivid sensory fragments (brass trunks, copper ferns, binary rustles), but these remain decorative—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or tactic. The gear appears frequently yet only as a touchstone, not a tool that alters action. Spatial choreography is coherent within the dreamlike frame. The setting charges the final image (gear left on a branch) but does not constrain an on-page decision, capping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway as threshold space is vivid and purposeful: "the land hesitated before becoming water," the path "twisted like a held breath," and the vigil fires create spatial anchors. The ticket punch functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when she releases it into the shallows, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's priorities (cold brass, damp sand, salt air). Minor gap: the mist and twilight, while evocative, remain somewhat ornamental in the middle third without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, sealed fifth-floor door, and the bolt itself are rendered with concrete, purposeful detail. The bolt's temperature shift (cold → warm, pulsing) and the banister's lightened wood grain anchor the investigation sequence. The nerve regeneration in Elias's arm recurs as a tactile micro-setting that charges his final choice ("where the pain was returning in flickers, like distant music"). However, spatial choreography on the fifth floor is vague—no clear distance between door and window, no account of how the pianist entered a wax-sealed room—and the moat reference (keys scattered into it) floats without spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The temple library is vividly realized—shelves sagging under scrolls "older than memory," "edges frayed like the hem of a god's discarded robe," a place "where time folded in on itself." The central dais with the basalt scepter, the oculus with constellations above, and the ruins of the throne room anchor spatial choreography. The library itself constrains choice: it's a relic of the Old Kings where "a careless step could drop you into yesterday or tomorrow," and the pretender "had chosen it well." The final image—dawn light spilling through the broken roof—charges the closure, though the micro-object (ink pellet, scepter) does more causal work than the macro-setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tide gauges' rhythmic *clink-clank*, the torn atlas under resin, and the barnacled stone road provide concrete sensory anchors that constrain Lena's choices and charge the final image. The station setting pressures the ending: alarms blare for depth-zero readings, and the lights extinguish as she steps away. Sensory selection is purposeful—warm stones, dissolving ink, water at her knees—and filtered through Lena's occupational lens (sonar, depth readings, GPS).

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay's cracked concrete, rusted girders, and half-buried stone circle constrain movement and frame discovery. The opera glasses return with reweighted light (fractals, map/message/dare) that charges the ending. Barefoot tactility (grit, vibration through soles) grounds sensory hierarchy in Lena's physicality. Spatial choreography is clean and the stones' warmth/spirals/hum supply sensory specificity that narrows and then expands options.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The volcanic hot springs anchor space vividly (steam, black sand, mineral-rich air) and the springs directly enable the unsealing ritual—Liora syncs her pulse with the water's heat. The amber pendant, whisper-vines, and kite are handled across multiple beats with tactile specificity. Micro-setting (her hands in water, mud, vine winding up her arm) constrains and charges action. Spatial choreography remains clear. The grove and temple ruins supply concrete staging for the finale, elevating the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The arboretum is anchored early with layered sensory detail (salt wind, foghorn ghosts, olive leaves, tide pulse) filtered through Lena's grief-sharpened attention. The cypress tree constrains the photograph's fate and charges the final image (the leaf she plucks). Micro-setting work is strong: the bark, the low branch, the fig trees all pressure her choices and the ending. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (scent of cypress oils, the sting in her palms). The setting persists beyond her and frames the realism she can anchor to, directly supporting the thematic close. No occupational depth is needed at this length; the arboretum as sanctuary and worksite is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.6)
    The lighthouse-library fusion supplies vivid sensory detail (salt, parchment, ozone, wet ink) and the "walls pressing closer" recurs with purpose. However, the environment does not constrain a visible choice or alter tactics; Elara's actions remain abstract. Spatial choreography (stairs "crumbled long ago," yet she "descends" and "steps into" the dark) is incoherent, breaking the 9+ gate and capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wind-carved encampment, eclipse shadow, and frozen victims create a vivid crisis tableau. Sensory detail is selective: "breath curling like smoke," "dust that hung suspended." The ink patterns function as micro-setting, constraining Kael's choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the thief's position "at the edge of the encampment" in the hologram versus his live appearance creates minor confusion. The environment directly enables the closure: spilled ink becomes the threshold Kael crosses.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The snow-laden library, isolation chamber glass, cryo-pod cores, and pneumatic tubes supply vivid anchors. The glass chamber constrains Elara's final stand spatially, and the console's blue light charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (burnt copper ink, ozone scent). Minor slip: "stained glass" witness feels decorative rather than weight-bearing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dome, sandbag, knife, and roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the cracked pane pressures her decision to patch it, the soil grounds her kneeling ritual, and the glass barrier becomes the literal and symbolic edge she defends. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"thick with the scent of things that refused to break"—and the roses' breathing versus the world's scream creates spatial contrast that charges the final image. The fissure that "didn't spread. Neither did she" uses environment to anchor her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden is rendered through specific, purposeful detail: grooves that hum, stems swaying to subsonic pulses, soil that refuses to hum in one spot. These details constrain the fisher's tactics (he digs where silence appears, drives the spike to silence the goddess) and the rail spike returns warm from the forge, then cold in his pocket, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across garden, tree, hollow, dock remains legible. The "feral lullaby" sensory filter is consistent and voice-appropriate, though the scent of reeds at the end feels slightly convenient as an ambient echo rather than an object with prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's brass telescopes, glass dome, spiral stairs, and acoustics create a vivid enclosure that mirrors Lydia's isolation and her observational habit. The rosewood pen nib and ledgers function as micro-setting, grounding her tactile engagement and charging the final act of writing. The caretaker's presence two floors below and the tea ceremony at closure add spatial depth. Environment subtly guides choice: the ledgers betray her father, the plates hidden below offer proof, and the observatory's height positions her above the fray until she descends.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lab setting (wax cylinders, rusted speakers, firmware slot, clock) constrains Elara's method and charges the final image when the lab's "new rhythm" syncs with her breath. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: hum, hiss, amber warmth, wings twitching. The amber functions as micro-setting, recurring with evolving meaning (trapped mosquito → cracked → singing wings). The Pleiades tattoo recurs purposefully. However, spatial choreography during the time-fold scene is abstract—exact positions and distances blur slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's acoustics and mist function as active constraints: the flake whispers, the mandala's void opens, and the mist "swallows" Lior's final line. Sensory detail (lavender, slate, cobalt, ochre) is specific and filtered through the artist's craft-focused POV. The setting charges the final image—void and mist merge—meeting the 9+ gate's environment-constrains requirement. Spatial choreography (knee, hand, mandala center) remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The plaza and tesserae constrain Elias's method and charge the closure: he must work stone by stone, and the mosaic's glow is the story's final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (charred cedar, burnt parchment voice, scuffed boots with blood flecks, cobalt blue sliver). The shattered sky and skeletal minaret frame the wound/jewel opening and recur to anchor tone. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, commander's shadow falling, blade clatter, both kneeling). The mosaic as "map" of the fire's path is a micro-setting that drives plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard and maze anchor spatially with vivid, synesthetic detail ("gnarled trees heavy with fruit that shimmered like bruised silver"). Micro-setting qualifies: the apple and the coin are handled, and the path that "unspooled between the trees" guides movement. The stone bench and the hedge maze pressure Elias's isolation and Lydia's intervention, and the theater ghost light frames the ending. Sensory selection is purposeful ("petals that crunched underfoot like brittle applause"), filtered through Lydia's synesthetic POV, and the orchard's quasi-sentience ("the orchard obeyed") charges the closure beat when the trees "swayed in approval."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The light-painting studio is vividly anchored with specific sensory detail (ozone, burnt sugar, fiber-optic brushes, melted plastic) and the setting constrains Lena's response—her equipment is damaged, forcing her to work with what remains. The muscovite sliver functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it dissolves into her skin. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, though the studio's physical layout and the mechanics of light-painting could be more precisely tied to the climactic creation of the door to elevate from strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered (bioluminescent lichen, calcite crystals, ozone scent) and the elm leaf fossil returns with reweighted warmth at the climax, constraining Lior's final recognition. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: curiosity blooms near the fossil, fear spikes where the cave narrows. Spatial choreography tracks clearly from mouth to deeper chamber. The fossil's levitation and the "softer, alive" ceiling substance charge the ending image with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber warehouse with fossilized resin that "glowed faintly in the dark like trapped sunlight" and the canyon well "slick with moss" are vivid and purposeful. The ninth button gleaming on the hook—a disk of pale amber veined with the traveler's screaming face—charges the retrieval beat. However, the warehouse itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; Elias moves between shelves without spatial friction, and the cliffs' threatened collapse never materializes as tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bluff, mist, and thawing snow constrain Lena's choice to meet and shape the scene's sensory texture (frost, accumulated snow, scent of green things). The pillbox as micro-setting object charges the closure: its emptying and abandonment on the cedar roots signal irreversible change. Spatial choreography is clear (crouched behind cedar, ally ten paces away, footprints in snow), and the environment mirrors her internal thaw without heavy symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fog, river, bridge planks, and gutters constrain the crossing choice through the two-lift rule and the ticking countdown. The yarn needle's brass eye catches light twice, charging the handoff. The coachman's pocket (parchment) and the girl's lap (needle) function as micro-settings that hold the key objects. Spatial choreography remains clean across the crossing. The "spindrift serenity" at closure integrates atmosphere into the girl's dissolution, and the far bank / upstream direction guide the final moves.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oasis setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked earth, bleached combs, sun patterns, and the kiln all anchor the potter's work and the story's spatial logic. The lantern glass as micro-setting object constrains the potter's choice (he embeds it in the bowl) and charges the final image (the bowl glows faintly). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the potter's attentive stance. The environment subtly mirrors the thematic question of persistence and fracture without becoming overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fire escape, harbor rhythm, and moonlight function as lived-in constraint and resource—Lena chose this perch "not for the view, but for the way the moonlight slanted here." The gauge tooth, tin pots, and basil are handled tactically, not catalogued. Spatial choreography (Elias climbing the ladder, his sleeve brushing thorns, soil from his coat pocket) stays coherent. The setting charges the final image: scattered moonlight on thorns, the harbor's pulse, seedling breaking soil. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all constrain and charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal library above clouds, floating shelves rearranging by tide, brass sundial casting fractured light—all constrain and charge the final moment when doors open for the first time. The micro-setting (sundial as both tool and mirror) shapes two key beats: the bird's strike sending shockwaves and Lior holding it as shield. Sensory hierarchy (wet feathers and gunpowder, mist-damp pages) reflects urgency and filters through scholarly POV, though spatial choreography of shelves and stone circle in relation to Lior's position occasionally blurs.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lotus temple, floating walkway, lily pond, and suspended glass orbs create a vivid, coherent spatial signature. Sensory detail—wet stone, crushed petals, residual mist—grounds the reader without catalog excess. The installation itself functions as micro-setting: the empty orb receives Liora's spiral, and the first orb's shadow "shaped like a thrush in flight" charges the final temple image. The recurring twig spiral and orbs constrain Liora's choice to release rather than hoard, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The basement radio station is vivid and purposeful: "forgotten current," "equipment older than the university's newest power struggles," charts with "smudged" ink. Spatial choreography is clean (headphones, console, dial, door). The setting constrains choice—Liora's access is limited to this neglected space after her keycard was revoked. The recurring charts and the dial return at closure, charging the final image. Sensory selection (static "like angry stars," pressure in skull, ventilation kick) reflects urgency and POV filter effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The vault's "slow weep of centuries," the chamber's "roots that writhed slow as sleeping serpents," and the table as monolith anchor atmosphere. The compass constrains the central action (transfixing the slab), and the city's spatial mutiny charges the final image when streets "would walk without looking back." Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elias's urgency. The nexus under starlight bookends the piece, but mid-scene the setting becomes more metaphorical than spatial, slightly reducing constraint clarity during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry is vivid and multi-sensory: slick stone, damp walls, mist that coils and thickens, the drain where the mask was found. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's face-blindness (texture, sound, resonance over visual detail). The setting constrains action—he kneels where evidence had been, uses the crack between stones for the lance—and the historical overlay (ballroom/flood) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (lance-in-crack, ribbon-in-pocket) actively shapes the ritual and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The experimental weather station, brass goggles, and copper nail function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the observation deck glass becomes the threshold, the nail the key. Sensory details (fogging lenses, static in the air, salt-stained ink) are filtered through Elias's urgency. The impossible harbor lights and whole-sailed *Maris Volantis* charge the final reversal. Spatial choreography remains clear across the station's interior and the brief split-world glimpse.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain pullout is vivid and specific (guardrail, pines, ozone/burnt-sugar scent, asphalt that ripples). The glass flake functions as micro-setting: Elias handles it twice, its "method" (scaffold wrap flutters, collodion surface) shapes his perception, and it charges the final image by growing "warm, then weightless, then—nothing." The setting constrains choice (pullout as threshold) and the final act (road dissolving into lattice, asphalt parting) directly involves environment in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The train's rotting floorboards, warped lion cage, and foreign money anchor setting with sensory economy. The cage's "patient and relentless" deformation charges the final thematic turn and the train "settling into the earth" mirrors Elias's acceptance. Spatial choreography is clean across ringmaster's car, animal car, and exterior. Micro-setting (the money as tactile object) constrains one choice (pocketing the lira) and appears in the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting involvement.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory functions as both physical setting and symbolic crucible—brass gears, telescope groans, and the clock striking "the hour when understanding dawns" all anchor and charge key beats. The daylily telegram is handled twice (pressed to lips, crumbles by noon) and its evolving state constrains the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (desk, telescope, ledger), and sensory details (ink warming, breath fogging glass) are selective and purposeful. The variable stars constrain the witnessing action and charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The swirling lake, orchard with whispering fruit, and the seed's thorned husk are vivid and purposeful. The orchard "remembering" and the plant's maw opening with needle-teeth constrain Eldrin's tactics and charge the final image of him walking into the trees while the lake hums behind. Spatial choreography is coherent (shore→soil→vortex→ridge). The key, warm and rusted, is a strong tactile anchor that charges his departure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt glade, willow, and hedge maze are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (scent of damp earth and crushed violets, air thick with anxious elation). The maze's shifting paths and Liora's scars as navigation tools tie environment directly to choice and escalation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling at the dais, running across the root bridge). The glade's final exhalation and the silver leaf tucked behind Liora's ear charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    The catacomb orchard constrains choice: roots that "shivered," bark that receives the stitched card, and bones underfoot anchor the bartering ritual spatially. The half-lit glow recurs and charges the final image ("corridors behind her glowed half-lit and endless"). Sensory detail is selective—damp sighs, fogged breath, scent of rain on dry earth—and filtered through Liora's priorities (the card's edges, the needle's flash). The white flower and wilting petals function as micro-setting objects that carry the closure's conceptual weight. Spatial choreography remains clear across kneeling, stitching, root-coiling, and walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry's rhythmic blasts and yawning wound image constrain Liam's emotional space and charge the final image of leaving; the trailer's coffee-and-cardboard scent anchors his professional drift. Micro-setting (grille cloth texture, dust motes as phantom lighters) functions as setting-surrogate and directly charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV: road dust, feedback squeal, gravel-as-static all filter through his roadie past. The truck cab and radio become the frame for his forward choice, spatially coherent and momentum-integrated. Body (hands coiling cables, cloth edges sharp against thigh) and tool (the scrap itself) do meaningful work in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inverted magnetic Arbor is vividly rendered with specificity (ironwood roots tangled in storm-wracked heavens, sap that glows "as if embarrassed," black iron branch warm and humming). The environment constrains Elias's choices: the two-day climb is a physical cost, the magnetic pull tugs at his tools, and the setting charges the closure when the world tilts and the branch sways outside the window. Sensory selection reflects his scholar's attention to texture and inscription. The micro-setting (tablet, tools, sap) and the macro-setting (the Arbor itself) both shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium is vividly realized—glass ceiling, brackish channels, stairs that ascend downward, fountain running with ink during eclipses—and the creel functions as micro-setting, physically handled and charged with recurring meaning. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's vocational POV (brass dials, salt-stained ledger, woven slats). The atrium constrains the woman's request (she must come to him) and the creel's pulsing objects charge the final image when it grows heavier. The setting participates in closure, pushing this into the 7+ band despite the piece's lyric abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal caves pulse with bioluminescent detail, and the shells constrain the inspector's path through their trail. The pearl's placement "in a hollow of stone" and the cave's "softening" stone at the climax give the setting causal weight. Minor issue: the bunker's "emergency rations" and "rusted doors" are mentioned once without later relevance, and spatial choreography during the pearl-absorption beat is vague ("pressed it to her forehead" → "stone around her softened" without clear mechanics).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The station's crumbling booth, peeling map, sagging roof, and ivy-choked platform ground early anchors (who/where/when clear by paragraph two). The bellows function as micro-setting: their patched leather, weight, and creak constrain Elias's movement and charge the bridge scene when he presses his forehead to them. The bridge pilings and dried riverbed supply the final spatial constraint that forces his turn. Sensory hierarchy reflects his chronicler lens (water stains, ink fading, cracked earth). The ivy "parting" at the end uses setting to validate his choice without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The library as micro-setting constrains choice: shelves labeled, books blank until touched, the watch's humming that triggers vision. Sensory detail is purposeful—mist, amber glow, burnt sugar—and filtered through the dreamer's priorities. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (ladder, stacks, door), though the vision of the confidence man in "a room" momentarily floats without grounding. The final image of the watch on the windowsill and the mist rolling in charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet observatory is anchored early with dual moons, wisteria trellis, brass telescope, and lead-lined case. The gardens supply the final constraint: shards take root in soil, enabling the sung crystallization. Micro-setting (chipped cup, brass counterweight) charges key beats. One weakness: "midsummer" and the dual-moon sky remain atmospheric rather than pressing choices—seasonal heat or lunar phase never narrows Elara's options—holding the score shy of 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora generate vivid, purposeful atmosphere ("walls woven from petrified mist and the bones of forgotten winds"). The emerald chip functions as a micro-setting object that Liora presses to her temple, triggering the threshold vision. The setting charges the final image with its radiant hush and rippling aurora, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: spatial choreography of the "doorway" remains abstract; we never see Liora's hand position or body anchor as she "reaches through."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's moss with bioluminescent veins, the ancient fig tree, and the scalloped hairpin constrain choices and charge the final image (silver fruit). Sensory details—damp earth, twilight-colored shoot—are vivid and selective. The hairpin's scallop pattern recurs meaningfully (shoot edges, bandage edge) and the fruit's weight literalizes "choices not yet made." Spatial choreography (grotto threshold, kneeling, climbing down) remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse, weathered steps, rail, and tide-line sand ground action and constrain choice (Elias kneels to unhook the cloak buried below). Sensory detail is selective (salt foam, wind howl, steam curling) and filtered through Elias's professional attention. The beam's shift from steady to pulse charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor issue: "breezy dark" and "gloriously, terribly unclear" lean toward abstraction when concrete wind effects (chimes, cloak movement) are already doing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock platform, magnetic grotto, lodestone veins, and black pond are vividly rendered and purpose-driven. The pond constrains Elias's teaching method (stone-dropping ritual) and charges the final image when he steps off the platform. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV: "scent of damp earth and crushed sage," "starlight filtering through the fissures," "lodestone pulsed in time with the starlight." Spatial choreography is clean across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone towers and canyon are vividly rendered and recur across beats (groaning towers, twisting echoes, dust layers). The arrowhead functions as micro-setting, constraining the skimmer's choice to press it harder and whisper binding words, then charging the final image when it cools. Sensory detail is selective (bruised twilight, wind howl, shadow blotting) and filtered through the skimmer's mystic perception. Spatial choreography is clear (atop highest rib, predator passing beneath).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire, frostbloom archway, and impossible summer garden are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (climb, summit folly, garden pocket, return via mist). The keystone's pulsing light and veins of gold constrain the final choice by making meaning visible. However, the mist-walking shortcut undercuts the climb's physical stakes retroactively, and the Conservatory's interior at the end lacks grounding detail. The candle flame as micro-setting charges the final image effectively, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken *Marigold* library is rendered with vivid, selective detail: "brine and old promises," "pages fused into brittle sculptures," the silver-thread hum on the single intact volume. The skeleton key and its keyhole "gleamed, untouched by rust" function as micro-setting that gates Elias's passage into the frozen-lantern vision, directly shaping the middle turn. The sky-lantern festival provides a visual and temporal frame, and the contrast between the festival's amber glow and the violet-gold hues beyond the door charges the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (pier → shallows → hull → library → door), though the transition back to the pier after the door dissolves is abrupt and could disorient briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ambered observatory deck constrains the final choice: Liora uses the coins against the glass and amber walls to align wavelengths, and the setting's "trapped light" motif charges the closure image when the amber "gleamed with trapped dawn, not dusk." Sensory detail (cold glass, vibrating walls, fogging breath) is filtered through Liora's perspective. The micro-setting (console, coins, glass) serves as the stage for her transformation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's broken dome, scattered light through rusted brass, and cracked stone constrain the reaper's ritual: "The air between his ribs frosted over" and "observatory groaned as the weight of its new identity settled." The dusk light is not merely atmospheric; it is the necessary medium for crystallization: "The light scatters at dusk. That's when you'll see them." Spatial choreography is coherent (reaper moves from hollow to table to beam to doorway to road). The wax cylinders, atlas page, and observatory dome all function as tools that enable or constrain action. The final image of the road and the coiled shadow charges the setting with menace.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct is vividly rendered ("spine of frozen lightning," "stone veins pulsing") and its dripping rates constrain Elias's method and timing, meeting the 9+ gate test. Dawn light progresses purposefully from "bleary" to "gold." Spatial choreography is clean: highest point, shallows below, bay surface visible. The bell's warmth and fracture-as-seam image charge the final beat. Sensory selection balances sight (silver fish flank), sound (bell's weeping note), and touch (bell warm against palm).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ridgeway, steeple, and reservoir constrain every choice: Elias kneels "where the church steeple broke the surface," nails photos to it, and the waterline's midnight recession structures his patrol rhythm. The liqueur bottle's sapphire hue mirrors "the reservoir at dusk, when the water turned the hue of a held breath," and its scent becomes a purposeful tool ("let the wind take the scent—precise, humane"). Spatial choreography is clean (satchel strap, trail of trees, ridge crest, steeple, water surface) and the newly exposed street sign *Hollow Lane* charges the closure image. The wind chime's return (single note, then sang again) marks environmental change tied to Elias's shift. Minor: "damp stone and…cloying sweetness" could be more POV-filtered through a warden's priorities, but sensory hierarchy holds under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, glass trees, and frozen dew crystal supply strong sensory anchors. The orchard's transformation (petals unfurling, roots twisting) is vivid and tied to the ritual action. Spatial choreography is clean; the alchemist's position relative to flame, crystal, and door tracks clearly. The micro-setting (her kneeling, the fire, the crystal) constrains her physical actions and charges the final door image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting use. Minor deduction: the "ancient orchard" and "glass valley" descriptions trend decorative in the middle beats without altering her tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor setting constrains choice by height and isolation, forcing the parachute descent. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "bioluminescent spores," "scent of ozone," "skeletal glow of the city." The buckle as micro-setting charges the final moment when she "tucked it into her pocket." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from arbor limb to descent to landing. Minor slip: the "prototype that could rewrite atmospheric pressure" reads vague when specificity would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    The floating dojo, storm, and tatami ground the scene with sensory specificity. The jars function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax—Kael must physically bleed onto them to merge. However, the dojo itself remains largely decorative beyond the opening image; it doesn't constrain choice or shift tactics mid-scene. Spatial choreography is clear (jars between them, Veyra catches him), but the valley's echoes and Emperor's banners burning feel distant rather than tactile pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vivid and functional: acoustics twist sound into "something almost holy," the wind curls back on itself, and the space constrains Elias's ritual. The pull cord handle, blower, and hourglass recur with purpose. The tunnel's stillness at the end ("holding its breath") charges the closure image when Elias sets the blower down, its handle "pointing toward the surface like an accusation." Spatial choreography is clean (tunnel, ladder, threshold, household interior) and the autumn leaves at the end tie setting to theme without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen garden, skeletal trees, and thawing soil are vivid and selective. The pendant is handled twice (picked up, then handed over), and the mist "inhales" at the transfer, directly charging the closure image. The garden "unravels" into a breathing page, using the micro-setting to visualize the dimensional shift. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly rendered with molten copper veins and temperature shifts, and the crozier's fracture constrains Elias's choices throughout. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling in the center, the retort in the corner, the nexus's heartstone as impact point. The frozen bloom charges the final image. However, the setting leans decorative in places; details like "sickly gold, like light filtered through bruised skin" are atmospheric but don't alter tactics as much as they ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted observation deck, skeletal transmitters, cracked parabola dish, and gorge are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail. The tower's spiral stairs and the statue's outstretched hand provide spatial grounding that charges the fragment's return. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure—the jump occurs in open air without environmental pressure—so it remains atmospheric rather than indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's bioluminescent algae, shifting starlight constellations, and liquid-silver water are vivid and filtered through Lira's familiarity. The hourglass as micro-setting constrains her action (she kneels, presses it to the deck, whispers timeline names) and the spectral environment charges the final image when "the grotto's entrance seal[s] itself" and ordinary moonlight replaces the glow. Spatial choreography remains clear across the deck and rail.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (beeswax, old paper, angles that bend inward, colors that shift). Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the Möbius Mirror, the void framed in gilded wood, and the ceiling spiderweb of thread all anchor action and pressure. The setting charges the final image—the gallery becomes "just a room" after the eruption—and the transformation serves closure without becoming ornamental. Minor cap: the gallery's physical rules (how walls "breathe inward," how patterns "erupt") remain atmospheric rather than mechanically clear, leaving some reader uncertainty about what is literal versus metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The benthic city provides vivid, purposeful detail: "slow, deliberate light, filtering down through kilometers of crushing dark," bioluminescent fungi, Obsidian Spire's razor edge, and the contrast between abyssal pressure and surface artifacts. The chain link's rusted geometry interacts with the environment's light to enable Elira's teaching moment, constraining her method. Spatial choreography remains clear—Spire's edge, city below, upward gaze—and the setting charges the final image when students look past the abyss to the "prickling pinpoints of fire." The micro-setting (chain link refracted through bioluminescence) directly alters tactics in the climactic lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atrium's glass dome, mist, stone, and bench are rendered with vivid sensory detail (scent of pennies, iron taste, silvered wood). The mist functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it "screams," thickens, and dissolves—actively shaping the scene's pressure and Elias's final encounter. The hearing aid and glove serve as micro-setting objects that charge the ending. However, the atrium's physical layout remains somewhat abstract; spatial choreography (where Elias moves, how far the bench is) is unclear, and the photograph's mechanics (how it "dissolves" the atrium) are unexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    The facility's rusted ladder, collapsed corridor, and silt-covered junction box provide vivid spatial grounding. The phase seam—a groove where "the air itself seemed thinner"—functions as a micro-setting constraint that Elias must cross, and the tidal timeframe pressures his exit. The cables' blue glow and the detector's hiss charge the final image. However, the "other side" corridor described as "wider" lacks choreographic consequence; Elias kneels and retrieves without spatial friction, slightly dulling the setting's role in the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The opal dome, snow, aurora glow, and frost-laced window create vivid atmosphere. The porcelain shard returns with reweighted meaning (warm, no longer sharp) at closure. However, the observatory's physical layout and the console's mechanics remain vague; spatial choreography is minimal. The setting pressures mood but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone towers and canyon setting are vivid and constraining: the towers hum, groan, and finally sing, directly shaping Veyra's final entrapment. The diamond at her throat and the starlings' cipher-patterns are micro-setting elements that alter tactics and charge the ending image. Spatial choreography stays clear throughout, and the environment evolves causally with events (towers silent → groaning → singing) without postcard-stall moments.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underground garden is vividly rendered (crushed sage, bioluminescent mushrooms pulsing with breath, dirt that hums) and anchors the single scene clearly. The garden constrains Elias's final moment—vines coil around his ankles, pulling him under—giving it closure participation and a tactical role. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's urgency and the herbalist's warning, but spatial choreography weakens in the climax: we lose clear tracking of Elias's position relative to phone, thyme, and vines when the transformation accelerates.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The enchanted orchard with brass gears, skeletal trees, and patrolling statues is vividly established and consistently maintained. The sky-bridge, locust shell, and oldest tree constrain the violinist's spatial choices (she clings, steps down, tucks the shell). The setting's transformation (crack splitting earth, green unfurling, statues melting into soil) directly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "the scent of rain and crushed petals," "transparent wings catching the light like shattered stained glass." The setting is integral to closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade, disputed strip, back alley, and haunted post office create a coherent micro-geography; drone patrol gaps and red-eye scanning constrain Elias's route and timing. The storm bottle's "cool against his palm" and the post office's "walls papered with undelivered mail" ground sensation in tactile detail. The arcade's lights "flickered once, then held" at closure charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean (median, alley, Seventh Street post office) and the seven-minute gap functions as both constraint and tactic. Sensory selection reflects urgency (drone hum, wax seals, rain scent) without catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The circus train's rust, bleached paint, and carousel horse anchor space and history early. The "misting hush" and velvet car function as micro-settings that pressure Lior's perception and charge the woman's appearance. The halo fragment (cold/warm shift) and the wind chime (green pipes, motion without wind) constrain sensory attention and recur to charge the final image. Spatial choreography across train cars remains coherent, and the desert exhale at closure reweights the opening bleached-sun frame.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly particular (hyperbolic tessellations, restricted section, titles like *Euclid's Lament*) and its spatial logic—shelves bending into arcs, threads unspooling into grout—constrains and enables the ritual. The scarf functions as micro-setting, its fractal pattern shifting under tilt and its threads physically rewriting the space. The final image of blank pages blooming words in negative space completes the transformation and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    The black sand, tripod setup, and palette with prism shards create a tactile staging that grounds the first photography attempt. The archipelago's "ozone and old parchment" air and "horizon blurred like smeared charcoal" filter through the librarian's sensory priorities. The palette constrains her method (tilting it to bleed refracted light) and charges the closure beat when it "flared—once, twice—like a match in a hurricane," elevating this above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nexus setting is vivid and voice-filtered: "alleys bled into silence," "lamplight beneath the first stars," "the scent of ozone and old parchment." The crookedest pick (forged from meteorite splinter) and the locket constrain choices—she uses the pick to open the ribbon, and the unopened locket charges the final image by paralleling the hair. Micro-setting (shop dissolving into starlight, counter as stage) pressures the protagonist's stance and tilts the closure moment when she pockets both tokens of unfinished work.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken greenhouse with black water, shattered dome, and shipwreck ring supplies vivid, pressure-laden setting that constrains Elias's movement (wading "knee-deep," water "lapping at his ribs") and charges the final image (something coiled around a split schooner hull). The stone pedestal with constellation map becomes a tactical anchor for the mushroom test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (iridescent residue, water hum climbing his spine), and the drowned orchard's mythology shapes stakes. The fairy ring and residue function as micro-setting tools that enable detection and memory recovery, directly affecting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library's "geometry of the room" constrains the shadow and shapes Elspeth's decades of annotation work. The teacup, mirror shard, and desk are handled across beats and charge the final binding. The playground swing's hush filters through Elspeth's POV as a held breath, mirroring the trapped shadow. Spatial choreography (stool pulled with heel, sleeve brushing shadow) tracks cleanly. The setting pressures every key choice and the final image of the library "settling into quiet" completes the accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The parapet, waterfall mist, and moss-slick stones function as micro-setting that enables the veil crossing; the apple's "colors no one had names for" charges the closure image by constraining the villagers' recognition. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (juice "thick, electric" on fingers during the succor beat), and the orchard's silver-leafed sapling anchors spatial consequence. Slight generic drift: "gnarled apple trees," "threadbare dress," and "firelight" lean toward stock texture rather than the perceptual filter that would distinguish Elias's professional eye from a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary concretely shapes the closure: fractured walls cast splintered rainbows, prisms tremble and shatter under the pressure of what is freed, starlight pools like blood where the net had been. Micro-setting elements (the oil lamp's bent flame, the altar, the tapestry needle left gleaming) charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—kelp stench, salt-fogged mirrors, the net's seawater knots—and filtered through Elias's craft-focused perception. The sanctuary's air thickens with "interlaced hush," a textural constant that reweights at closure when secrets are no longer held.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-scoured vault, henge stones, and brass-framed lenses supply vivid, purpose-driven detail that constrains Elara's method and charges the final image. Sensory selection—"drips from the ceiling," "breath fogging the glass plates," "vault's silence"—reflects her professional attention and urgency. The projector, parchment, and pillar function as micro-setting that shapes her discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The vault's physicality directly enables the closure moment when she presses her palm to the stone and the frescoes shiver.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drowned library—warped mahogany, bloated books, brass lamps holding "ghosts of light"—is vivid and purposeful, filtering through Liora's analytical lens. The snow globe and bioluminescent fish outside the porthole create sensory contrast that charges key beats. The Electra's pocked aluminum skin (holes "from something passing through") materially supports the threshold premise and constraints her understanding. The setting pressures her choice to leave the globe behind and surfaces into the storm, constraining access and framing her final renunciation. Spatial choreography (desk, porthole, submersible ascent, ship deck, bunk) remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The misty courtyard "above the clouds like a forgotten server room" anchors early and the slick cobblestones, dying lanterns, and ozone scent filter through the balladeer's perceptual priorities. The bolt plate's warming pulse and the graffiti peeling back "like paper" are tactile, purposeful details that constrain his final action. The mist coiling around ankles and the spatial choreography (ledge, stone, distance to valley below) remain coherent. The courtyard's surreal vertical placement and the "no prints on damp stone" ending charge the closure image with earned strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, frost-laced windows, frozen roses, and ice-slicked shaft create a vivid, coherent environment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (airship wrecks as "forgotten dreams," ozone and old metal). The goggles function as micro-setting: their cracked lenses scatter light and fog with breath, materially shaping perception. The final image—ice burning like fractured stars—charges closure by transforming the oppressive cold into clarity's medium. Spatial choreography across ten floors remains clear throughout the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky gondola frames all action and the brass telescope is handled across multiple beats, both constraining perception and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "the wind carried the scent of rain and old paper," twilight haze, cold breath curling. The gondola's adrift state and the string's snap function as spatial stakes. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) constrains choice and charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate test; however, the miraculous string restoration at the end softens the constraint's bite, capping the score at 7.1.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tree-hollow library is vividly anchored (shelves carved into living wood, scent of sap and mildew) and constrains the artist's final night. The coin's indentations guide her tactile navigation and blueprint the glass ceiling, charging the climax. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the glass-ceiling construction sequence compresses mechanics ("channels to guide the beams") without showing tool-handling in real time. The oak's "dying flesh" and post-demolition ash anchor setting continuity through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The antique airship, brass portholes, and hopscotch board are vivid and constraining; the board's glow guides the final choice, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (study, deck below, window) tracks cleanly. The "dusty hopscotch board" and "stranded luminance" pooling in cracks tie setting detail directly to the puzzle and resolution. Starling murmurations recur as both atmospheric anchor and symbolic cage-then-guide, deepening the textural pressure without forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen library, ice-encased shelves, water-mirror, and spiral staircase all constrain action and charge the final image. The gears scattered on ice, the vial of burnt-sugar oil, and the crescent-moon key function as micro-setting that enables tactics. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "breath curled like old ink," "salt-stiffened leather," "mirrors wept silver." The setting evolves causally—the hall shudders, mirrors weep—as the locksmith works. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The environment participates in closure when "the clouds parted" and morning arrives, reweighting her internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden are vivid and purposeful; the arches cast shadows that frame early mood, and the watering bell becomes a spatial anchor across beats. The soil's hum and crack constrain Liora's first encounter with Kael, and the chalked sidewalk messages recur with tactical weight. However, the nebula itself remains abstract—never grounded in sensory particulars or a constraint that alters a choice—and the final "universe breathed back" dilutes specificity at closure. Micro-setting (bell, soil, chalk) charges the middle but the macro (nebula, arches' mechanics) drifts toward postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lighthouse and sea provide atmospheric grounding; the clock's "inner glow" and puppet head are handled tactilely. The puppet head's "porcelain cheek cracked in a half-smile" and "one glass eye clouded" constrain Elias's final act—he must set it into the clock's maw, not simply any object. However, the setting functions more as lyric backdrop than a constraint that narrows tactical choices; the dusk, salt-spit waves, and stars are vivid but do not alter Elias's available moves. The micro-setting of the clock's interior charges the final image, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard, labyrinth, mechanical birds, and night frost form a coherent constraint system that pressures Liora's choices. The birds' patrol routes and frost-timing govern when she can act, and the nut's shell and the dirt impressions supply a micro-setting solution that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: orchard edge, labyrinth entrance, hut, cliffside descent. Minor deduction: the cursed fruit is vividly described but remains ornamental—it never constrains a present choice or complicates Liora's tactics; removing it would not alter the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The braided ravine is introduced immediately and returns throughout: foam patterns, divergent channels, the flat stone where streams meet. Elias's perception is filtered through his polymer-chemistry lens (lattice, bond angles, Fibonacci). The chrysalis placed "where the braided streams met" directly constrains his final ritual, and the ravine's convergence point charges the wading-in closure image. Spatial choreography (kneeling at water's edge, wading into shallows, sitting back on bank) remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass orchard library is vivid and purposefully surreal ("shelves of crystalline branches," "clouds swirled slower"), and the quartz counter and obsidian needle are handled across beats. The needle's physical act (incising the slate) produces the fracture, linking tool to outcome. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the floating library and clouds do not constrain Liora's choices or alter tactics under pressure, limiting integration to descriptive rather than causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "wet stone and something older—like iron left too long in saltwater," "air was thick, briny," "walls weeping condensation." The pavilion's coral-ice-brine fusion creates a distinct atmosphere. The tidal pools function as micro-setting, actively used when Elias kneels and pours the vial, and their clearing signals the memory's dissolution. The desert fortress anchors the frame, and post-rain scent bookends the piece. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (courtyard → dune descent → pavilion interior → return), though the pavilion's exact scale and Elias's position within it remain slightly vague during the key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The astronomical clock tower and grain elevator supply vivid spatial anchors; the weight as micro-object constrains Liora's climb and Elias's final choice. Sensory detail is selective: "crushed grain and distant rain," the pendulum's arc, the whistle's answering note. The tower's gears "whisper in languages older than the town" charges the setting with thematic resonance. The cuckoo clock weight hanging in the control room at the end—polished, purposeful—closes the spatial loop and ties setting directly to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon as "threshold" and "wound" is vivid and purposeful; the rusted tripod and fractured mirror anchor micro-setting. The mirror constrains choice (she adjusts its angle three times, feeding current through nanites), and the moonlight charges the final image ("pulsating, liquid white"). Sensory detail is selective (ozone, rust, cold air fogging), filtered through Lena's engineer's eye. The mirror's broken edges "warm against her skin" at closure, a tactile detail that supports the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (crouched, knees hit ground, picks up mirror, walks).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine grotto is vivid and functional: quartz teeth, inverted gravity, bioluminescent mushroom threshold, and the mist all constrain Lysara's choices and charge the ending. The one-hour inversion creates urgency, and the manuscript's physical interaction (pressing to glow, smudged thumbprint) drives pivotal beats. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding catalog mode. The setting and recurring objects (manuscript, seed) directly shape the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The siskin alder grove, the sculpture's stress cracks, and the insulator all constrain choices: Elias presses the ceramic to amplify sound, analyzes fissures as sheet music, and the insulator's warming and "weeping" charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (damp needle-bed, glaze catching dawn, beads of moisture), filtered through Elias's symphonic attention. The setting functions as micro-setting and tool, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and driving the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting: its hum and tremor constrain Elias's kneeling analysis and the pieces' final alignment, charging the closure image with environmental specificity. Twilight modulates sensory detail (bleeding sky, vanishing sun, first stars) in step with emotional progression. Spatial choreography is clean—two figures, a board between them, a nexus underfoot. Minor slip: "cracked earth where the old covenant had once bound the land" offers historical weight but remains abstract; no on-page detail ties the crack to present choice or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The workshop is densely rendered: beeswax, old copper, grimy window, brass dials, copper plate. The fireworks function as a pressure clock, tightening Elias's window to decode the diary. The ruins a block away anchor the final move spatially. The device's hum and the clasp's crescent moon are handled tactilely across beats, and the "silence repaired here" sign at the ruins charges the ending image with setting-as-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The treetop village is vivid and specific: bridges swaying, tide below, bark and salt scent, walkways vibrating with the bell. The corpse flower—its husk pulsing, musk of rotting honey, tendrils black as a bruise, silver-veined petals—acts as micro-setting that constrains Liora's choice and charges the closure (new bridge strung with vines). Sensory hierarchy reflects Liora's olfactory obsession. The "tide's thought" and "moon's third face" establish a lyric world logic without over-explanation, though spatial choreography of the Elders' arrival and the balcony-to-village geography could be slightly tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard planet's inversion mechanics, floating arches, upward-flowing river, and bioluminescent moss are vivid and purposefully filter through Veyra's professional attention (glider shudder, rudder adjustment). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the dive and landing. The arch-as-mouth and seed discovery constrain her final choice to plant at the core, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—closer approach intensifies moss-pulse detail—and the world rules (gravity flip, accelerated growth) stay consistent and shape tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly realized through selective sensory detail (rust-streaked grates, vibrating metal, bleached colors) and constrains Veyra's movement and choices throughout. The clearing with severed harnesses and the leaning containers charge the closure image by making the environment's agency palpable. Spatial choreography remains clear across the chase and the flare moment anchors the reversal in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice cavern is vivid and purposeful: "walls veined with frozen rivers," "stalactites," and "thawing ground" create a coherent micro-setting. The amber sheet and chimes are handled on the page, and the environment responds to Liora's actions (ice groans, frost dissolves). However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain her choices—no route is blocked, no resource is scarce—so it supports atmosphere more than it pressures tactics. Sensory hierarchy is strong (visual dominates, appropriate for synesthesia), and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Thunder-Echo Range anchors early and the "avalanchingly quiet air" constrains perception throughout, supporting the tonal throughline. The flute, frost-bitten earth, driftwood, and fissure are handled concretely enough to ground the scene. Spatial choreography is legible (kneeling → driftwood at feet → fissure → threshold crossing). The final marker repositioning charges the ending image ("pointing the way back—or perhaps, the way forward"). Occupational detail ("relic keeper, binding what should not be unbound") remains abstract; the weave and guardianship mechanics are asserted rather than shown through tool or environment constraint in a peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ink, crushed topaz, lead type whispers, topaz dust raining). The halo fragment functions as a micro-setting element that constrains Elias's choices—he presses it into the platen, and it pulses, moves the ink, and rises suspended. The vanishing stars create atmospheric pressure and return transformed at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway supplies vivid atmospheric anchors ("dragonfly-wing pendant...iridescence flickering under the aurora's pulse," "the abyss exhaled—a sound like a thousand wings unfolding") and the abyssal setting creates spatial constraint. However, the ridgeway itself remains a postcard backdrop rather than shaping tactical choices: the courier's path and decisions would work identically on flat ground. The pendant and seeds function as plot tokens rather than tools constrained by the environment, and the bridge's sudden germination solves spatial problems without prior environmental setup or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quartz arbor and frost patterns constrain Elias's method of communion and charge the final image when the arbor "chimes in the wind" after the prism shatters. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"crystalline branches refracting the dawn," "cold bite through his gloves"—filtered through mystic perception. Spatial choreography is clean (arbor edge → car window → inside → heart of arbor). The prism itself functions as micro-setting, a recurring object that enables the communion and forces the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard, bamboo, and apple tree anchor the spinner's world with vivid, selective detail (skeletal branches, loam, bark sealing over bones). The city of glass and ozone appears abruptly without sensory grounding or spatial choreography, functioning as an abstract counterpoint rather than a lived-in constraint. The bead and loom serve as micro-setting, constraining her choice to weave the message and charging the final image when he begins his own thread.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard planet with twin suns, floating rock arches, and abandoned mine shafts is vividly anchored early. Spatial choreography is clear: descent into shafts, fissure at the heart, return to surface. The silk—wound around blade, coiled in belt, fed into fissure—functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when its hum persists in the anvil. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: crushed fruit scent, blue light pulse, ground groan. The floating arches realigning into bridges constrains the villagers' choice to descend, elevating environment from backdrop to plot agent.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned spaceport is anchored early with vivid sensory detail: "ozone and old grease," "rusted girders groaning like bones." The green glass shard functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning (green → clear → green again) and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear—boot striking shard, palm to cargo lift, seam on far wall—and the shard's tactile presence ("burned cold") constrains her choice to close her eyes and expand her map inward. The setting pressures the protagonist's sensory method and shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lantern room functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it's the locus of the stone spiral, the ritual glass placement, and the candle-lighting that charges the final act. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"rust and old wax, the ache of light that used to be"—filtered through Elias's loss and the tower's history. The sea glass and stones are handled tactilely across beats, altering tactics (he stops returning the glass, adds his own stone, lights the candle in the spiral's hollow). The mist and the skiff's dock provide spatial contrast (outside/inside, departure/staying) that supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald lighthouse, salt-worn stone, and star-choked sky are vivid and selective. The lantern's glass and wick constrain Liora's ritual actions (twisting the wick, pressing palm, bending reflection) across multiple beats, and the spatial choreography (spiral stairs, harbor below, water's edge) remains coherent. The "false dawn" and "ozone and old promises" charge the ending image. The lighthouse as micro-setting shapes her routine and the village's hope, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating tea house, valley mist, and the morpho wing create a vivid micro-setting. The wing constrains choice: its dissolution into his palm marks the journey's cost and charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("its steam curling into the shape of a question mark"). Spatial choreography is clean across the tea house, bridge, and village square. The setting's verticality (floating rock, yawning valley) mirrors the protagonist's internal suspension and grounds the final invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Tower, labyrinth, workbench, arrow-slit window, and oaks are anchored early and constraining: the moonlight pools "like liquid silver" to enable the disassembly, the north wall's crack demands tending, and the trees function as final repositories, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-fogged glass, dust-weeping fracture, storm rattling shutters). The oaks appear in opening context and return transformed in the final line ("branches heavy with stars"), reweighting their role from silent sentinels to active absorbers. The body and tool (trowel, sextant parts laid in grid) anchor micro-setting effectively. Minor cap: the labyrinth's "breathing" and "sighing" risk atmospheric decoration in mid-beats, though the closing hum justifies the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: "mica windows set into their bark," "silver-leafed trees," and "fruit that never ripened" create a specific, decayed-magical space. Sensory detail is filtered through Liora's expertise (she knows the trees' shiver, the pulse of trapped light). The environment directly constrains choice—she must dig into soil, press palms to mica, and the trees "leaned in, hungry," pressuring her to continue. The final image of blooming orchard and shattering windows charges the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: rows of trees, kneeling in soil, standing among branches. The "endless night" outside functions as perimeter pressure rather than active constraint, but the greenhouse interior does the necessary work.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library is vividly rendered with purposeful details: the oak door, brass plaque, scent of parchment and ozone, mirrors reflecting fragments. The bakery's warm bread scent at the end provides a sensory bracket. The spiral staircase and circular chamber constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. The library's paradoxical nature (hidden yet plain, silent yet humming) is woven into action and choice, though the constraint is more thematic than tactical—Lena's movements through the space don't face physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tea house courtyard, copper kettle, and wheat constrain Liora's choices across multiple beats and charge the final image of leading the prince into the grain. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("flour once dusted the air like snow," "wild honey unspooling like a memory"). However, the palace's broader geography remains vague—guard posts, fountain, and courtyard spatial relations are unclear, and the reversed river on Tuesdays is mentioned but never dramatized as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library's physicality is vivid (ice shelves, ozone and old paper, "quartz hush"), and the collapsing shelf ("another shelf collapsed into the abyss below") adds urgency. The lantern slide is handled across multiple beats (held up, adjusted, flared, pocketed, guides him on the bridge) and its warmth "strange against his thigh" is a nice embodied detail. However, the bridge itself—"of light, of ice, of something in between"—lacks spatial grounding; we never learn how long it is, whether it sways, or what physical cost stepping onto it entails, so it reads more as symbolic than as a tactile constraint on Elias's final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pirate market beneath the pier is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("tar and stolen rum," "lantern light") and constrains Lena's approach—she uses the stall setting to close distance and the market's unwritten rules anchor the final threat. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, charging both opening and closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "anise on his breath" detail sharpens proximity and threat in the confrontation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender bluffs and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("ozone on her tongue," "petals trembling like static"), and the compass ring constrains her methodology throughout. The bluffs themselves shift state in the final beat ("no longer purple… luminous"), charging the closure image with environmental cost. Spatial choreography remains coherent—kneeling, standing, stepping forward—with body and object grounding the protagonist's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cave's crystals, amethyst vein, and stalactites supply concrete sensory anchors and constrain the painting's discovery. The lock pressed against the amethyst vein is a spatial choice that enables the split; the hollow behind the stone matters causally. Micro-setting (cave as body/tool surrogate) charges the final image: "the cave was singing with him, the crystals humming as the paint bled into the stone." The environment is lived-in and purposeful, never postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse domes, toxic sky, and underground Archive are rendered with precise, pressure-laden detail: "air smelled of damp earth and something older—like the first breath after a long-held scream." The zinc plate's physical warmth and sharp edges constrain Elias's handling across multiple beats. Spatial choreography (studio → postal chute → tunnel → cavern → pedestal → studio) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the final image: the groaning domes contrast with Elias's lighter breath, making the cost of honesty tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff setting is anchored early with sensory specifics (humming, wind sighs, thinning air) and returns in the final image to charge the closure. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Liora's work: its properties (ancient light, trapped shimmer) shape the sculpture's design and the shattering beat. The valley below provides clear spatial and thematic contrast, and the edge of the bluff in the final paragraph grounds the ending stance. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome with twin-sun refraction, desert beyond, and the roses themselves create a micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices (the dome as both protection and prison). The controlled burn's mechanics—ash, blackened soil, new shoots—charge the final departure by literalizing renewal. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, airlock, dome edge). Minor slip: "magnetic north drift" and "landmines" are mentioned but never materially affect tactics or the closure image, functioning more as atmospheric detail than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with jasmine, cracked tiles, and the rusted blue mailbox. Spatial choreography tracks clearly from shop to gate. The locket and mailbox function as micro-setting elements that drive the sequence, satisfying the constraint-on-choice test. However, the ending's "car horns and distant sirens" intrusion feels decorative rather than a force that alters Mira's final move.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken lab is vivid and purposeful: water pressure, corroded metal, emergency lights, and rising water all constrain Lira's actions and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("greenish glow," "cold floor's rhythm," "breath fogging the glass"). The dice as micro-setting object recurs with reweighted meaning (rolled, then sunk). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The lab's sealing mechanisms and flooding lower chambers create physical stakes that drive the final ascent, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrains choice and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with tactile, olfactory detail (ozone, old pennies, salt-crusted floor) and directly constrains the lighter's action—he kneels where the pull is strongest, uses the wildflowers as compass. The docks, whale carcass, and tide provide a coherent micro-setting that charges the final image (emptying his pockets into saltwater). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor gap: the chamber's physical layout and the mechanics of the "pockets of gravity" remain slightly abstract, but the sensory signature is strong enough to elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The brook, reeds, and nocturnal setting are vividly rendered and sensory detail is purposeful (moss, damp earth, scattered stars). The origami wing functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and charging the final third when it becomes "lighter" and "quiet." Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling by the brook, palm, satchel). However, the environment does not force a hard choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it serves as atmospheric stage rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop garden during meteor showers supplies both atmosphere and a recurring frame that charges the closure tea scene. The seal's tactile warmth/cold shift and the brownstone's spatial details (third-floor window, basement stairs counting differently on Tuesdays) ground the language-of-buildings conceit in micro-setting that constrains Elias's interrogation. Spatial choreography across apartment, rooftop, and the final empty room remains clear. The meteor shower functions more as backdrop than constraint; it does not alter a tactic, keeping the setting in the strong-support band rather than indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden is richly textured with specific sensory detail (silver-throated lilies, ozone and old roses, petals veined with gold) and the resonance lattice constrains Liora's archival method. The garden's transformation—petals blackening then silvering, the low thrumming harmony—charges the closure image and reflects internal stakes. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling between lilies, digging at the lattice heart, the patrol on the garden path). The twilight-to-morning timeframe is tracked and the final star's fade ties to the moment of completion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites are vivid and anchored early, establishing mood and spatial coherence. The sanctuary's oculus and marble floor recur at key beats (thorn pressed to ledger, pooled ink, kneeling figures), and the environment subtly mirrors the thematic arc (pearl twilight deepening into dawn). However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a constraint that alters choices; the forger could perform the same acts in another location with minimal plot adjustment. The body and the thorn (a tool/object) do charge the final image, but the sanctuary itself remains ornamental rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine nexus is vividly anchored with bioluminescent veins, coiled walls, and starlight filtered through cracks; spatial choreography tracks Veyra's spiral descent cleanly. The shell's jagged edge biting her palm and the arranged bones provide tactile, purposeful detail. The nexus constrains her path (spiral descent, chamber layout) and the silver threads are concrete props that Kaelis plucks to release echoes. Sensory hierarchy favors the auditory (hums, echoes, sighs) in service of the echo-singer premise, though the "copper taste" of old promises skirts cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glacier shrine as micro-setting constrains multiple choices: the carved hollow frames the ritual, the melted snow globe serves as divination tool, the ice altar holds inscribed names that guide Lena's interpretation. Sensory detail is purposeful—candle flame stretch, salt-and-diesel scent, ice groans—and filtered through Lena's practitioner perspective. The setting charges the final image: kneeling in candlelight as the glacier sighs, the dead quiet. The shrine's physicality (chisel marks, altar, hollow) alters tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering parapet, damp moss, firefly season, and harbor below create a richly textured micro-setting that constrains and charges choices: Kael's bare feet on wet stone, the slick bridge delaying Liora, the moon path guiding their whistles. The whisk's grooves, the net's fraying, and the tea's steam are handled tactilely and recur with reweighted significance. Sensory hierarchy is strong—scent (wet stone, crushed mint), sound (whistle, harbor sigh), and touch dominate in ways that reflect the characters' attentive, artisanal priorities. The harbor's breathing nets in the penultimate beat transform backdrop into thematic mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The wasteland orchard, radioactive twilight, and thriving fruit establish a vivid, purposeful environment. The stillpoint's "thick air…ozone…static" and the lead-lined pit with AEC insignia ground the scene in tactile, historically specific detail. The diamond itself and the shattered vials contribute to spatial coherence. The fruit on the truck dashboard charges the final image, and the orchard's roots constrain Elias's understanding, meeting the 9+ gate partially—but the environment does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—cobalt glass veins pulsing, ozone taste, static hum—and the portico functions as both lens and door, constraining Elias's final choice. The storm operates as environmental pressure that tightens across the piece, and the spatial choreography (Elias at the glass, the receivers, the soldering iron) remains clear. The portico's dual nature (seal or open) directly shapes the climactic action, charging the final image when he throws the receiver through it. Micro-setting (the glass, the iron, the carved walls) all contribute to the closure beat, elevating this above mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The feral loft beneath dunes, the sagging balcony, warped floorboards, and sand creeping through cracks create vivid spatial grounding. The music box and glass jars function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice—the broken mechanism limits what Elias can offer, and the filled jar becomes the bridge to the girl. Sensory detail is purposeful: "scent of damp earth and brine," "planks groaning," the dunes' "low, mournful tune." The setting charges the final image as the sun "paints the dunes in gold."

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drift-ice marina's groaning plates and "language...of cracks" establish the setting as a living constraint early. The sphere's cradle, spiral stairs with pearl-dust, and the resonator all anchor spatial choreography. The ice's "natural dampener" and thinning status directly shape her choice to act now. The final image of the lighthouse beam and the stirring presence "beneath the ice" uses environment to charge the closure. Sensory selection (brass, cold metal through gloves, subsonic whine in molars) is POV-filtered and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and purposeful. The viaduct's humming iron, moon-aligned arches, and warm metal under Lior's palm create a micro-setting that constrains his final choice to step onto the rising bridge. Sensory detail is selective (frost cracking on cheeks, electric tang, ice groaning) and filtered through Lior's patient attention. The lake's freeze and the viaduct's ascent both charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test for setting as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is vivid and selective: damp concrete, rust, 1890s tiles, fresh mortar. The sealed brick wall constrains Elias's investigation and directly charges the closure (water pressing, symbols scratched in grout). Sensory hierarchy reflects his professional focus (stress fractures, vibrations, mortar dampness). The lantern's broken glass becomes a recurring anchor that charges the final constellation image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shop's stained-glass windows, workbench, and tools anchor the setting and enable the key action (repairing the music box). The storm functions as atmospheric pressure and as a physical constraint Elias walks through to reach the post office, charging the final sequence. Sensory detail—lavender scent, brass key, fractured light—is selective and filtered through Elias's chaplain-watchmaker perspective. Spatial choreography is clean across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating workshop, acid sea, kaleidoscope, and Pip's patchwork body are vivid and purpose-driven. The arrow tip and kaleidoscope constrain her choices—she peers into it for blueprint guidance, pries the arrow free to repurpose it, and the sea punishes failed attempts. Spatial choreography is clear (workbench, ceiling kaleidoscope, sea below, cliffside perch). The final image of her perched on ruins with "two borrowed" fingers grounds the ending in tactile consequence. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Pip's priorities (gears grinding approval, acid sea burping). The workshop's destruction alters the environment causally. Micro-setting (her own frame, the arrow tip) functions as constraint and charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive setting is rendered through sensory specifics—"servers pulsing with ghost-light," "firewalls flaring like angry stars"—and the neural lace provides embodied tech interaction. Server Farm 26 coordinates anchor the climax spatially. The patch functions as micro-setting, warm against her palm and vibrating at the key moment, constraining her choice to engage. Slight dock: the transition from terminal to hologram corridor lacks spatial grounding, making the final approach feel abstract rather than navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse-orchard-ice setting is vivid and specific, with strong sensory detail (frost-rimmed doorframe, clicking branches, groaning ice). The setting shapes the final choice: Elias angles mirrors toward the cliff's edge, and the ice's proximity pressures the decision to step forward. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact geography of orchard-to-cliff-to-ice remains slightly abstract. The vintage mirrors and fragment constrain Elias's method of seeing the future, charging the closure when they shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drift-ice marina, groaning hull, jagged canal, and parasol tip as divining rod all ground the piece in tactile immediacy and constrain the ice-crossing choice. The village, trawler galley, and fjord are filtered through Lior's attention (silver glinting, salt and rain scent). The parasol tip returns in the final beat, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography across the ice crack is clear and the frozen setting pressures her test of solidity versus fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber pavilion recurs with specific detail (sagging silk banners, low table, brazier's ashes) and constrains Lior's reflective work—he sketches on the pavilion table, pours wine from the half-empty bottle. The vineyard's silence and the vines "whispering his name" filter through his POV and pressure his stance. Sensory selection is strong: crushed grapes, damp earth, twilight violet. The setting charges the final image when he steps back into the vineyard, reweighting his sentinel role.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The parapet as micro-setting object constrains Lysan's choice—she must press, coax, stay until its song fades—charging the final act. Sensory detail (crushed mint, damp earth, silk walls sighing) is selective and modulates with pressure, sparse during concentration, richer when the clearing stabilizes. The half-mask recurs as physical anchor (bone cool, catching light "like a blade"). Spatial choreography is clean: clearing edge, pavilion heart, parapet curve, then stepping back into "the murmuring world." Minor limitation: the dunes and prophet's followers remain atmospheric rather than spatially navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered ("purple haze," "metal bones half-swallowed," "scent of crushed lavender and old iron") and constrain the archivist's final shot—she waits for shadow to stretch "just so." The micro-setting (fence, field's edge, light shift) directly shapes the photograph's composition. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the archivist's professional eye, grounding the abstract work in concrete place.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library at dawn is vividly anchored with fractured gold through stained glass, oak floors, and the sagging chandelier. The crystal constrains Elias's action (climbing the ladder, pressing his lips to it) and charges the final image as the locus of discovery. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's fixation. Minor limitation: the broader library space remains somewhat generic beyond the chandelier and desk, but the micro-setting (crystal, ladder, desk) functions as purposeful constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog sculpture garden is specific, textured, and atmospheric—rusted dancer, seawater-filled eyes, driftwood—and the chalk spiral pulsing "like a heartbeat" charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (garden center, shore) remains coherent. The environment constrains Elias's ritual and the final act of releasing arrows to the tide directly shapes the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting supplies concrete constraints (thin air, turret height, cameras, gears) and the spinning clock hand functions as a micro-setting object that charges the climax and final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's vocational bias (lenses, shutters, brass), and the lunar/above-clouds locale shapes the metaphor of escape velocity without postcard cataloging. Spatial choreography remains clean across the ascent and descent. The hand itself—its brass, its blur, its shadows—constrains Elias's choice to touch or refuse, meeting the 9+ gate for object-driven pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The recurring vinyl shard (jagged, pressed to lips, dropped at the edge) charges the final image and constrains Lena's stance throughout. Sensory anchors—rose gold dusk, chamomile, lavender scent, lemon soap—are selective and purposeful, filtered through Lena's priorities. Spatial choreography (common room, window, edge of the haven, sink) tracks cleanly. The "radiant haven above the clouds" remains somewhat postcard-generic, but the body (hands, ribs, palms) and the vinyl function as micro-setting that alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is concretely anchored (brass dome, gears, workbench, frost) and the floating isle context colors perception. The key's physical presence—etched runes, weight, frost—recurs and charges the closure when it "glowed once, then dimmed to ash," making the crossing irreversible. Spatial choreography is clean until the transition "through" the sun, where the mechanics blur. The nocturnal observatory setting pressures Elara's solitary access but does not materially constrain her choices within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden is vividly rendered—vines, pulsing flowers, stone well with tooth-aching symbols—and it constrains Liora's approach (she slips through a gap, touches the tooth, presses it to her palm to trigger the well's symbols). The well's physical properties (carved symbols, black-and-silver water forming constellations) charge the final image. Micro-setting detail (crushed mint, iron-in-rain scent) is selective and purposeful, rooted in Liora's bone-setter perception.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's serpentine walls, quartz veins, and mist create a distinct micro-setting that charges the atmosphere and recurs purposefully. The sea glass functions as both object and setting element, constraining Liora's ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; the grotto "leans in" and "exhales" integrate environment with pressure. The setting does not force a hard choice, but the final image (grotto wrapping them in peace) elevates closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The data-center-turned-garden is vivid and purposeful: "server racks now skeletal arches draped in emerald velvet," soil-filled hollows with sprouting ferns. Spatial choreography is clean (rows, aisles, distances tracked). The moss and soil constrain Javier's physical choice to kneel and plant, and the setting charges the final image by creating a "protected vulnerability" space that contrasts the "distant static" city. Sensory selection is filtered through Lena's watchful attention (scent "green and slightly bitter," the drip of thawing ice). The environment functions as micro-setting that alters tactics and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral nexus—"jagged meeting of three rivers where the water fought itself in whirlpools"—is vivid and specific, and the mist coils, thickens, and parts to frame key moments. The seashell fragment functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pressed to lips, warm in pocket) and charging the final image when travelers see him "tracing the spiral." The water's behavior (stilled heartbeat, then surge) constrains Elias's final choice: he lets it take him, not drowning but dissolving. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dampening pages, water whispers), filtered through Elias's writerly focus.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The verdant arbor is sensory and purposeful: brittle tendrils, vines that sag and later unfurl, gourds that wrinkle and plump. The setting constrains Mira's choice (she must kneel, press her palm, feel the pulse) and charges the final image (the arbor "stood tall," leaves "trembling with new stories"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the dawn light bookends the piece. The arbor functions as micro-setting that alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Minor deduction: some phrases ("liquid gold," "rivers that ran with starlight") lean decorative without sharpening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subarctic crater, frost, skeletal trees, and the hollowed apple function as purposeful micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "frost on iron," "bone needle," "flash-paper thin as dragonfly wings." The orchard constrains the alchemist's work through its stillness and scarcity of materials, and the apple hollow serves as vessel and vault. Spatial choreography is clean, though the world beyond the crater remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The marble cavern with silver veins supplies atmosphere and the reflection-angle mechanic that drives the reverse-engineering. The "wounded season" and melting ice create temporal pressure, and the cold fogging breath anchors sensory presence. However, the cavern's architecture (how echoes loop, how acoustics synchronize) remains abstract; we see diagrams sketched in dust but no tactile engagement with the space that alters a tactic. The final image of ice weeping adds mood but doesn't constrain the locksmith's departure or choice to leave the timer running. Micro-setting (the timer mechanism itself) does more work than the cavern, which functions mostly as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bronze grotto is vivid and purposeful: its shingled plates, fissures admitting starlight, and humming resonance constrain Elira's ritual and charge the final absorption. The lamp burner's flame orientation and the grotto's exhalation are tactile, micro-setting details that shape her method. Sensory selection is strong—"kelp" thickness, "rust" flaking, "whalebone harp" vibration—and filtered through her weaver's perception. The timeframe "first snowmelt" softens the earth and sets the grotto humming, a seasonal anchor that ties physicality to the opening beat and the epilogue's cyclical return.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loft functions as micro-setting throughout: rain-beaded skylight filters light onto the widow's work, the ladder becomes a daily threshold, sawdust clings "like a second skin." The ash blank is handled across multiple beats, its grain and resistance shaping her physical engagement. The final image—lion on the windowsill catching morning sun, rain droplets scattering light—charges closure by transforming the setting from workspace to shrine. Spatial choreography remains clean (loft above, kettle below, ladder between) and the widow's movements through this vertical geography anchor each transition.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carousel platform, kinetic lagoon, and camera wheel supply tactile constraint: the lagoon's mist-memory surface "rippled only when the wind hit just right," dimpling where younger Lira once stood. The floating-island geography and glass towers sketch class structure without catalog. At closure, the lagoon refuses to ripple but "remembers," and the skeletal bridge below charges the jump with prior failure—environment directly shapes the final act. Spatial choreography stays clear across all ghost positions and the leap trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The terminal's corroded steel ribs, algae-thick reservoirs, and graffiti arrows constrain Lena's tactics—she must trace flows and align the sextant to unlock the hydroponics bay. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (burnt sugar scent, fogging breath, static-laced screens) and filtered through her engineer's bias. The sextant piece as micro-setting object charges the closure when it slots into the recess and triggers resurrection. Spatial choreography is clean; the labyrinthine layout and circuit-board floor plan are specific to this voice and advance the maze-of-intentions concept.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystal forecourt constrains and enables: it "sighed beneath his bare feet," the fracture spreads as he allows it, and it becomes the base for the orrery assembly. The tower sanctuary frames expectation early and recurs with specificity (stained glass, soundless, the clock's "tick"). The petrichor-laden air anchors the present stimulus that triggers action. Spatial choreography is clean: desk to forecourt, kneeling, retrieval from hiding places, arrangement on the fractured surface. The forecourt's wetness and the crystal's yielding texture charge the closure image when the orrery finally chimes. Minor: the elders' later discovery is told rather than shown, slightly reducing environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The twilight canal, algae-slick piling, and marsh mist are vivid and filtered through Liora's seeker's lens. The sundial's shadow "pointing inward" and the radio's dying broadcast supply small constraints that shape her final choice to release the ledger. Spatial choreography (stern → canal split → marshes → docks) remains clear. However, the barge itself—central to the setting—remains functionally inert; Liora steers it but its weight, cargo constraints, or mechanical needs never pressure a single choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor are vivid and selective; sensory detail (groaning planks, frost on rope, breath as ghost) is filtered through Elias's patient, reverent attention. The fulgurite glass functions as micro-setting: it constrains his choice to listen and charges the final splice by nesting the seed pod beside it. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling at water's edge, standing, stepping into fog), and the setting accumulates atmospheric pressure that supports the oceanic-hush tone through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The shadowed garden in autumn is vivid and purposefully atmospheric, with skeletal vines, weeping willow, and loam providing concrete anchors. The stone bench and willow charge the locket discovery, and the harbor returns at the end to frame Elias's next move. Spatial choreography is clean (garden corner, bench, harbor). However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—no environmental detail forces a choice or alters Elias's tactics. The garden waits passively rather than pressing him.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    The suspended palace and stalactite canyons constrain Aldric's choices throughout: the lowest vault where air "tasted of rust and old sorrow" anchors discovery, the mechanical lungs (gears, pipes, steam) pressure his motivation, and the creature's glass wings scraping stalactites at closure physically embody the struggle. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "damp earth and something electric, the bitter-sweet tang of rot and renewal." Spatial choreography remains clear across the vault-to-chamber-to-open-air flight sequence, and the abyss below/stalactites above frame the final image with concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, and fireproof coat anchor setting with specificity. The coin's weight "steady against her ribs" provides recurring tactile pressure. The lagoon functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—the boy could bleed anywhere. Strong sensory texture ("kelp-drift peace," "clouds...like kelp on an unseen tide") occasionally tips into decorative lyricism that pauses momentum rather than charging action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The city of forgotten fountains supplies vivid, purposeful detail: rust pump, green coins, calcified wishes, Bone Fountain, tarnished brass door. Spatial choreography is clean (alleys → fountain → door → chamber → outside). The stained glass box as micro-setting object constrains the action (box-to-door alignment solves the puzzle, threads cling to her fingers). The final image (fountains weeping light) charges the closure and reweights the opening rust-pump descriptor. Sensory selection is strong (damp wool, burnt sugar, lavender scent) and filtered through urgency, though the vault's "suspended light" and "threads of color" lean slightly generic in the climactic chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nebula garden is vivid and sensory ("ionized gas," "luminescent blooms," "frequency as her heartbeat"), filtered through Veyra's reverence. The gear—a tangible, handled object—anchors micro-setting and constrains her choice (demands memory as cost). The spatial sequence is clear (moves through garden to heart to transit edge). The final image charges when she steps into untouched light. No occupation or technical depth is needed here; the fantastical setting remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse at dusk anchors the opening with vivid sensory detail (cracked glass, bruised violet, wet soil, fading jasmine). The butterflies function as both atmosphere and a constraining presence that blocks light and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The stone, chisel, and ribbon roll are handled tactilely across beats. The greenhouse-to-house transition is clean, and the storm outside mirrors internal pressure at the dinner table without becoming overtly symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower function as micro-setting that charges the closure: salt-spray glistens on black stone, the sea hisses "like a held breath released," and arrow slits admit the kelp-and-iron wind. The rake handle (splintered oaken tool) constrains Elias's gesture when he presses inscriptions to the bob. Sensory detail is filtered through vocational focus (gearwork, bob's curve, oil). Spatial choreography is clear across the tower's interior. The setting does not directly narrow a tactical choice during escalation, limiting high-band entry, but the ridge's tidal threat and the tower's penitent posture deepen thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt silo, marigolds leaning toward headstones, and the weeping cherry tapping the roof create a lived-in micro-setting that constrains Elias's nocturnal ritual. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("damp earth and rust," "wet stone and lavender"). The tapestry becomes a tactile object whose threads "breathe," and the silo's door that never latches pays off when it "at last, clicked shut" in the final line, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (hairline crack, ice as ledger). The quill's kingfisher feather returns at the end, reweighting "trusting dive" as method. Spatial choreography is clean. The environment constrains the choice (kneeling at the fissure, noon shadow) and the final image charges the spire's hum into the village lights, satisfying the 9+ gate at threshold level.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember alcove is vividly anchored (yellowed sheet music, damp paper, mist coiling through cracked windows) and the shortwave radio's glow functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's broadcast and charging the final moments when "the glow flared bright enough to cast their shadows on the wall." Spatial choreography remains clear across the single location. Sensory hierarchy reflects the copyist's priorities (ink, paper, static). However, "ember alcove" itself remains slightly abstract—ember suggests heat or residual fire, yet damp paper and mist dominate, creating a register drift that never fully resolves into tactile lived-in use.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The vanishing point gallery is vivid—damp plaster, walls that never resolve, thin walls bleeding city noise—and its illusory depth mirrors Liora's practice. The mask, powder vial, and rocking chair function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice: the mask's weight and fractures recur, charging her smile and her act of standing. The chair's final silence marks the end of the cycle's current iteration. The gallery pressures her work by offering patrons who will lean in and debate, making her ephemeral art momentarily legible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (charcoal stains, porcelain edges pressing temples, dust motes hovering).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sewer is rendered through sensory specifics (copper stench, dripping grates, brackish water, rusted iron) and layered history (plague victims' silt, child's shoe, doctor's spectacles, dockworker's bones). The environment constrains Elias's choices—he works in a vault the Archives will flood, and the tunnel's mouth becomes his final stand. The cog's weight, the rising water, and the clerk's gleaming office above all charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (workbench, grates, lower tunnels, tunnel mouth), and the "sedimentary layers" function as both metaphor and literal excavation site.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet library with stained-glass windows and autumn wind is vividly rendered and constrains the mood (traveled stillness). The rosette functions as micro-setting, handled twice (tracing, placing on table, pressing ear to it) and charging the final image when it vibrates. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (scent of aged paper, crushed oak leaves, amber light). The setting does not overtly constrain a tactical choice during conflict, but it anchors the reflective mode and modulates tone at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse's "iron ribs rusted into lace" and "cracked glass panes" provide vivid specificity and recur meaningfully—the ruin mirrors Elias's state and constrains his work spatially. The seed's physical handling (knelt in dirt, pressed into soil, sliced open) grounds the mystical premise. However, the city remains generic and faceless; the homeless gather but lack spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy is uneven: visual dominates while taste—central to the protagonist's gift—appears only in abstract metaphor until the fruit-tasting scene.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning tower's copper ribs, warm rungs, and ozone-scented wind constrain Elias's climb and charge the planting moment. The beehive's control panel becomes the locus of transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's attention: burnt sugar ink, the seed's gold veining, firefly-like drone lights. The vertical farms and Skybridge establish the city's designed seamlessness, motivating the stakes. Spatial choreography remains clear across tower base, ladder, and bridge edge. Minor gap: the toll booth itself never pressures a choice, and "nectar dusk" tone occasionally drifts into poetic register ("raw as honey from a crushed comb") that feels observational rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dock, bay, and scattered objects (teacup, key, ribbon) constrain Liora's ritual choices and charge the final image. The orris shard's scent and the stilling water create sensory specificity that reflects urgency. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The recurring objects—teacup trembling, key pressed into wood—shape the ending's resonance. Setting detail is filtered through Liora's perception and integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater garden is vividly particular: marble arches, coral plaques, barnacle showers, mosaic grooves. Setting constrains choice—the dome's seam is the structural weakness that the human must exploit to release the child's song. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (intruder approaches, kneels at mosaic, presses seam). The ampoule and mosaic function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail (silt, bioluminescence, fogged helmet) filters through both POVs without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The staircase as micro-setting charges the final image: the steps "reassemble beneath her feet" after she turns back, making the environment a responsive partner to her choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (stone thud, dice clatter, gray haze, burnt coffee scent at the threshold). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (upward spiral, twenty paces above, sideways leap, door ajar). The chipped die functions as setting-scale object, constraining her choice when it stutters and reveals the loop's flaw. Minor gap: the café behind the door receives scent and sound but no visual anchor, slightly undercutting the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rooftop greenhouse supplies concrete constraints (slats, air quality, moonlight access) and the fig tree functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—the vanished leaf and new growth directly alter the painter's understanding. Smog, jasmine scent, and rain-that-won't-fall create a sensory hierarchy filtered through the painter's priorities. The brush as tool-object returns with reweighted meaning (worn tip, midnight use). Spatial choreography is clean; the city hum and rooftop child's laughter anchor scale and proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's waterfall, lichen-painted walls, and communal ovens recur with purposeful specificity and constrain Liora's final choice (she must return to the waterfall's heart to understand the absorption). The emerald lens functions as micro-setting anchor that charges the closure when shattered into dispersed stars. Spatial choreography (museum, ovens, waterfall's heart) tracks cleanly across moves. The hives reappearing on cliffs at the end adds a charged environmental reprise tied to the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse, hunger stones, and yoyo are tactile and specific; the stones' carvings deepen at the climax, constraining Elias's path downward and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (beach, lighthouse base, descending path). The body is less present—Elias's breath and pulse appear once, but the cold fire wrapping his ankles is the only sustained sensory constraint during the key action. Micro-setting (the yoyo, the corroded iron hook) successfully functions as setting by altering tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    The funhouse setting is vivid and specific: breathing mirrors, peeling wallpaper, burnt sugar and copper scent, the tilted tea table with dream dictionary. Spatial choreography is clear (ticket booth → mirror → spiral hallways → center). The opera cloak clasp is handled twice (adjusted at the start, clicked shut around the ember at the end), constraining the final image. The setting pressures choice: the oil-like mirror yields, the spiral of cursed photographs forces confrontation. The final puddle reflection charges the exit. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Gothic idiom. The micro-setting (clasp, mirror, filmstrip) functions as constraint and closure charge, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and improvised instruments (iron pot, coconut husk, seashells) create a vivid, tactile micro-setting. The blue hour and cloud movements are filtered through Leeward's perceptual signature and directly affect his actions (striking, listening, adjusting). Spatial choreography (tide lapping, orchard tilting) remains coherent and pressures his physical stance. The setting constrains and enables choice across multiple beats, meeting the 9+ gate, but some descriptions ("bruise," "hand conducting") veer toward forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and purposeful: the grooves encode maps, cracks speak, the turtles' exhalations mark time and anchor the watchers' shifts. Spatial choreography is clear (horizon, edge of city, gate), and the shells constrain Elyas's knowledge-gathering method. The reed whistle and the cracked shell function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection (pressure in the grooves, harmonic resonance in his ribs, gate's scream) is filtered through Elyas's cartographic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered: ivy strangling iron, peeling DANGER signs, cracked platform. The rosebush bookends the piece purposefully, its bare branches mirroring the stripped lie. Spatial choreography stays coherent throughout the confrontation. The setting constrains choice modestly—Elias uses the shadows to vanish—pushing this toward the 9+ gate, though the constraint feels more atmospheric than tactical. Sensory detail is strong and POV-filtered without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion constrains movement (waders, waterline, silt) and supplies resources (cracks for notes, mortar seams). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "rust and old paper," algae-slick marble, muffled clocks. The inkwell's brass edges "worn smooth by decades of hands" anchors material history. The pavilion's drowned state charges the final image—his dream of it whole, then waking to carry the inkwell to the library—micro-setting (body, tool, architecture) all support the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken library is vividly rendered through "dappled silence of filtered seawater," water "lapping at his knees," and the pressure lock mechanism. The blackout functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it gives Elias time before "surface teams would restore power." The stamp (object-as-setting) drives his movement through space: adjusting lamp angle reveals coordinates, leading him to the sealed chamber. The final image of him at his worktable with "the stamp's impression still fresh in his memory" charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass basilica, tea garden, and origami cranes supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through the maker's grief-work. The basilica's glass "rippling" and the cranes' transformation from paper to "something lighter, something made of the same substance as the dreams" charge the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (isle's edge, central pillar, garden stones), though the basilica's simultaneous "descend while ascending" creates a brief directional blur that the text treats as metaphysical rather than spatial. The smoky quartz gem as micro-object constrains the maker's final action (pressing it triggers transformation), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. The tea garden's shift from "graveyard of origami cranes" to blooming "petals of steam and shadow" effectively mirrors the maker's internal arc without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's spatial anchors (dome, console, emergency lights) and the geode's tactile shifts (cold→warm→cold) are vivid and filtered through Lena's priorities. The circuit-breaker cooldown timeframe and the storm below create atmospheric pressure, though neither materially constrains her console choice—she acts despite the warning. The geode's "fractured planes refracting…into something almost holy" charges the final image and recurs with reweighted meaning (gift→map→awakening tool). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; no occupational depth for "atmospheric research" is needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory at dusk is concretely rendered: "stone domes into silhouettes," "carved celestial maps," "brilliant dimness," and the oculus pierced by starlight. The drone's descent and the seam's revelation are spatially clear and constrain Lena's choices. The chip's placement in the newly exposed slot directly charges the closure image (constellation projection, shadows on ceiling). Micro-setting (chip, drone, carved maps) functions as setting and drives the final turn, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt terrace, ocean mist, and driftwood shore are vividly rendered and constrain Elias's movements: he kneels, presses his ear to wood, hurls the watch hand into surf. The driftwood splitting to reveal the note charges the closure image by transforming setting into catalyst. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("tiles slick with ocean mist," "driftwood bones jutted"), filtered through Elias's professional eye for objects that hold memory. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent from terrace to shore.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The parapet—windblown, slick with mist, groaning under the storm—is not postcard description; it constrains the negotiation (both parties exposed, no banners cross the chasm) and charges the final image when Elias and the boy step away from the edge. The chasm functions as a persistent spatial threat, and the boy's raw wrists from ropes are tactile, lived-in detail. Spatial choreography is clear: Elias at the parapet, Kaelis emerging from mist, the boy waiting below with a lantern. The setting modulates with pressure: mist parts to reveal the void's depth at the negotiation's hinge, then the storm swallows footprints as they leave.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal launch, compass, and utility poles constrain Elias's final choice—he navigates by poles rather than stars, micro-setting as setting. Sensory detail is purposeful: saltwind, kelp, jasmine. The poles function as both spatial anchors and thematic markers, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean across the launch, post office, and bar.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underground lake is vividly rendered with bioluminescent specificity and sensory detail (algae, ozone, warm water). The baseball functions as charged object across beats, and the lake's symbolic mirroring constrains Liam's choice to throw vs. drop. Spatial choreography through tunnel and fissure remains coherent. However, the city surface scenes (clinic, diner flashback, park) lack equivalent textural grounding, reading as placeholders rather than lived-in environments.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight is vivid and purposeful: silver gaze, humming soil, roots cradling bones. Spices (cinnamon, cardamom, saffron, vanilla, nutmeg) function as ritual tools that constrain her attempts and charge the closure—when she grinds nutmeg her skin sears, the scent glows, pulsing like a heartbeat. The stag's breath and beasts' gathering create spatial pressure. Micro-setting (her palms, the oldest tree, the silvered grass) anchors each turn, and the final spice-glow on her skin recharges the environment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The midnight glade "suspended above the clouds" with "spongy moss" and trees that "lean in" provides vivid sensory grounding and actively constrains Liora's movement ("boots sinking... as if the earth itself was reluctant to let her go"). The saucer on the flat stone becomes a functional tool for the ink ritual, and the setting's properties (clouds churning, canopy knitting) respond to the ritual's progress, charging the final image. The micro-setting of the saucer and inkwell at her belt does meaningful work across beats, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice or charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Eulogy's bone construction and recycled hull provide tactile atmosphere. The photograph, needle, and thread function as micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (observation deck, floating, gravity flickers) remains coherent. The "other side" is sketched lightly—warm halls, voices, green grass, closer stars—sufficient for closure contrast without catalog depth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Black sand, violet sky, cave mouth, and lava-sea interface are anchored early and constrain Elira's movements (the detour, the tide receding). The volcano's groan and the pumice raft shape the final departure. Sensory hierarchy is strong—heat warps air, dust smells of salt—and spatial choreography is mostly clean. However, the "island no map had named" and its leaning trees arrive too late to constrain choice; they ornament the ending rather than pressuring it. The body and vials function as micro-setting, but the pumice raft's warmth and buoyancy feel convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort "humming with trapped daylight," the bronze quill holder, and the half-painted sundial all constrain Kael's tactics and charge the final beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the hatch "groaning," tumblers "singing"), and spatial choreography from gate to courtyard to armory tracks cleanly. The fort's stored light as a ticking threat adds pressure. However, the twilight return at the end feels convenient rather than causally earned, and the ravine/villagers remain abstractly positioned rather than spatially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and dust function as micro-setting that charges the final image: the bluff's "slick as a breath held too long" establishes friction loss, the aurora's pulsing threads mirror Liora's ritual, and the dust's warmth/weight constrain her final act. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("paint flaking like dead skin," "grains bit too deep"), filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography is clean—tideline, sand, rocks, rising water—and the environment's frictionless property directly enables the eels' return. The "borrowed dawn" tone integrates setting and atmosphere, meeting the gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit observatory above clouds is vivid and purposeful: lightning illuminates the dome, rain seeps through cracks to blur the poem's ink, and the space functions as both refuge and crucible. The darkroom timer, rusted workbench, and 1978 bus timetable anchor the setting in concrete, character-filtered detail. The storm's sensory pressure (wind howling, rain lashing glass, ozone scent) modulates with emotional beats and the observatory's isolation charges the final descent. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting enables the symbolic dissolution of the poem and the final walk out.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Glass atrium, brook, sundial, and heron anchor space vividly with sensory detail (dappled light, damp earth, crushed mint). The sundial's hidden notch and needle card's shadow constrain Elias's blade work, charging the final reveal. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout fencing moves.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and specific—“cathedral of glass and steam,” “jagged panes…like broken teeth”—and remains active throughout. Environment shapes what’s possible (no more cultivation, only decay and observation) and deeply informs the mood. The recurring broken glass and damp soil charge the final image of him stepping into the evening. Setting could constrain a concrete decision slightly more, but it’s already doing substantial thematic and atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, frost, and stars are richly realized and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility as a glass artist, which keeps the lyricism grounded. Frost in particular functions as a micro-setting and a tool, shaping how she searches for meaning and ultimately how she orients without the ledger (“The path was written in the frost…”). Weather and terrain quietly constrain her options to an inward, solitary journey rather than action spectacle, perfectly suiting the piece’s scale. The final image of stepping into “the quiet kind” of light is charged by all the prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conservatory and “winterglass” storm are vivid and integral; the frozen air literally prevents sound, making the environment a hard constraint rather than backdrop. Details like frosted panes, the untouched grand piano, and windows that “didn’t shatter. It *sang*.” are specific and functional, not decorative. The tuning fork case and piano also operate as micro-settings/tools that charge the final image (doors blowing open into the white-out). This is very close to exemplary; an even sharper sense of physical peril from the environment could nudge it into rarefied territory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater city, library-morgue, rusted lighthouse, and bioluminescent anemones are vividly realized and tightly integrated with mood and action. Environment constrains and shapes choice (the long swim, the climbing of a rusted “ribcage,” the glass jars for light) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The recurring lens and the submerged architecture charge the final images (“Somewhere above, the surface of the water held the memory of light”), giving setting thematic weight. A slight step back from 9+ because the physical environment, while evocative, rarely forces tactical improvisation beyond the initial effort to reach the lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The valley, ridge, river, abandoned chapel, and especially the terra-cotta arbor create a vivid, coherent physical and social landscape with minimal strokes. The sanctions-inflected environment and the arbor’s destruction directly pressure choices and mark escalation. The bell and arbor together function as micro-setting and recurring objects that strongly charge the final image. A touch more sensory variety in the patrol confrontation scene could have pushed this into truly immersive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct, fog, jasmine, and river are not backdrop; they’re structurally and thematically charged, culminating in the viaduct as literal/figurative threshold and the river of embers as the storage of unused love. Environmental details are vivid and multi-sensory, and objects-as-setting (jade, camera obscura) strongly charge the ending. The setting constrains what can happen—this specific haunted threshold and its legend make the shard’s use and his new “keeper” role feel inevitable. A slight tendency toward luxuriant description over functional constraint keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered and more than ornamental: its vines, arches, and hyperbolic layout directly shape what Liora can do (climb, run “sideways,” reach an “edge” from which to cast the halo away). Sensory detail (old-silver sky, pulsing vines, ozone and lavender, the rough grain of the bridge) is selective and charged rather than touristic. The environment constrains options and explicitly charges the final image of her hand on the wood, so it functions as both setting and conceptual machinery. A marginally tighter sense of physical risk on the bridge itself is the only thing missing from a truly top-tier execution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned carnival is vivid and functionally integral: the Golden Wheel stall, piano, duck-pond pit, and ticket booth seed vault all constrain tactics and enable key beats. Environmental details (rotting prizes, rusted frames, the creaking “Every Ticket a Winner” sign) are filtered through Lena’s mission-focus yet carry thematic charge. The setting directly shapes the central reversal (guard falling into the repurposed duck-pond) and the final image’s irony. Weather and ruined landscape (“dry earth stretched like a held breath”) also underscore the stakes of planting.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck “reef,” and aurora are vividly realized and tightly integrated with mood and theme. Environmental shifts (water seeping in, wrecks settling, the promise that the greenhouse will be underwater by morning) directly pressure his options. Recurring objects—the forge, the copper, the aurora—charge the final images of wading into the tide and letting colors “drown” him. The only slight limitation is that the physical layout never quite constrains a specific tactical choice beyond the general inevitability of flooding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald station, brass rails, portraits, orchids, and moonbeam jar create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables choices: the glass case, flower codes, and jar placement determine her tactics, and the last train/vanishing station charge the ending. Environmental detail is well-filtered through Liora’s sensibility, keeping the focus on light and time. The final image of the station swallowed by a memory-only night shows the world itself reconfigured by her theft.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly realized and tightly integrated: the abandoned control room, frost, groaning ice, and meltwater are not just backdrop but active pressures that enable the “controlled collapse” tactic and thematically echo revelation through thaw. The environment evolves (thaw, flood, path revealed, observatory ridge), directly shaping what she can do and how she repositions her mission. Recurring objects-as-setting—the bookmark, glass orbs, valves—charge the final images and constrain choices, satisfying the high-band gate for environment/tool charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted, bone-like library and star-thick sky create an immediate, specific atmosphere that suits the themes of decay and forgotten identities. Setting is woven into action—the sagging shelves, the ladder, the atlas hiding the ledger—rather than presented as static backdrop. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain choice beyond providing concealment and the hiding place, it does subtly mirror her precarious status. The recurring physicality of iron, rust, and stars charges the final walk out with a quiet, earned lift.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge fort, storm, wet stone, old iron, and pebble shore are vividly rendered and tightly fused with Eldrin’s perceptions and the story’s concerns about silence and memory. The environment does work, not just mood: the fort “remembering” the defender and the booklet’s gold leaf catching in the stone charge the final image and make place inseparable from theme. Weather and time (storm passed, last star dimming) evolve with the narrative rather than sitting as static wallpaper. This is high-level atmospheric integration.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight is vivid and purposeful, with weather, light, and the violin all integrated into action rather than static backdrop. The courtyard as a “pocket of time” and “edge of time” charges the metaphysical turn and makes the environment feel like an active container of the experiment. Sensory detail (frost, ozone, dying light) is selective and supports tone without excess cataloguing. The setting constrains scope and helps the final re-formation of the courtyard and violin resonate strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, integrated, and thematically charged: the crystal forecourt, the rain’s “ghost,” and the lens all echo the story’s concern with refracted/indirect truth. Details are filtered through Lena’s sensibility as someone attuned to subtle signals, and the acoustics of the space concretely enable the inciting eavesdropping. The final images—morning light turning the tickets luminous, the forecourt “sighing”—show the environment and recurring objects actively charging the closure rather than serving as backdrop. The only slight limit is that the space shapes atmosphere and perception more than hard tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    The garden maze is vivid and specific—hedges that whisper, roses that mark where she wept, ivy spelling her name—giving the environment real texture and emotional charge. The maze and its center shape the action, especially in leading the elders to the heart where the marbles and mending vines become visible. The recurring interplay of plants and glass charges the final image of paths shifting “to welcome the lost, the curious.” While the setting doesn’t impose hard logistical constraints, it strongly inflects meaning and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    The xenobiology station in a gas giant’s twilight, the groaning frame, the aviary, and the gas bands outside are vivid and specific, all filtered through Elias’s tactile familiarity with machinery. Setting is not postcard: the research purpose (xenobio in stasis), AI oversight, and the isolated station context all shape what’s possible and what’s forbidden. The recurring images of twilight bands and wings/aviary charge the final moment where “the station held its breath, and for a moment, so did the sky.” The environment could constrain his options a bit more explicitly (e.g., physical or procedural limitations) to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The flooded opera house, water, lanterns, and pit are richly realized and tightly integrated with mood and action. Environment constrains movement (wading, swollen boards) and participates in the haunting (ripples, shivering water, darkness swallowing light). The micro-setting of the orchestra pit and balcony feels tactile and coherent in space. The recurring water and lantern imagery charges the final image of lanterns burning out and water claiming the light, giving the setting thematic as well as atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain weather station and storm are vividly rendered and tightly tied to Liora’s perceptions: iron ribs groaning, frost-laced windows, ozone and wet stone, ravens and aurora all feed both mood and meaning. The environment constrains options (isolation, dependence on instruments and radio) and directly charges the final image of Liora stepping into the storm and vanishing. Recurring objects—the barometer, hygrometer, ledgers, and the illustration—operate as a micro-setting ecosystem that embodies her role and its erasure. A hair more tactile engagement with the station at the moment of destruction could push this to outright exceptional, but as-is it’s elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel and factory environment are exceptionally vivid and tightly filtered through Elias’s perceptions (“ribs of rusted track,” sump of black water, wet wool/burnt sugar air). Setting is not mere backdrop: the tunnel’s low point, the sump, and the isolated valve directly shape what he can do and how the haunting manifests. The beaded valve wheel functions as a micro-setting/object that constrains choice and is charged in the final image, fully satisfying the 9-band gate except by a hair on overall ambition. Atmosphere and specificity carry a large share of the story’s power without ever feeling like a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The overgrown underground library and obsidian refuge are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone (“regenerative silence,” moss, backward river, dust-languages). Setting functions as more than backdrop: the refuge’s rules, the river, and the collapsing shelves embody the story’s temporal and thematic stakes. The recurring objects (books never read, origami swan, river) charge the final images. While the environment doesn’t constrain tactical choices in a plotty sense, it decisively frames and reweights the keeper’s enduring stance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sage Ridge, the singing stones, and the eclipse light are vividly rendered and tightly linked to Elias’s perception as a musician, creating a strong atmospheric frame. The environment meaningfully shapes choices (canceling appointments, driving to the ridge, the ridge’s hum as catalyst) rather than serving as backdrop. Recurring objects—the vial, tuning fork, ukulele—are integrated into the spatial logic and final reweighting. It falls just short of the top band because the ridge’s constraints on action are more enabling than limiting, so the setting pressures rather than truly boxing in decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    The silo-library is vividly realized—metal skin, spiraling shelves, smell of damp parchment—and it feels lived-in and particular to this narrator. Setting is not mere backdrop; the walls as memory-reservoir and the silo’s final “sigh” meaningfully charge the ending image. Environmental details (fireplace, cracked seal, wind) are integrated into action and theme rather than listed decoratively. The setting shapes mood and final resonance more than concrete options, but it’s deeply interwoven with the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, island, brass-lined study, Fresnel lens, and encroaching sea are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Chen’s professional and philosophical gaze. Setting actively charges choices and closure: the isolation and boat engine create real threat, and the image of the lighthouse going dark functions as both literal and thematic cost. The environment is not just backdrop but a working metaphor for “open secrets” and warnings in plain sight, culminating in the empty study and dark tower as a final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dimensional anchor chamber, with its “unraveled stillness” and indigo-seeping geometry, is vivid and integrated into action; the environment literally channels the paint and governs what’s possible. The loop pedal, palette, and anchor work as a micro-ecosystem, constraining tactics and charging the final images of the novice at the threshold. Sensory specificity leans visual and conceptual but is strong enough to carry atmosphere. World rules (silence looping, anchor geometry) feel internally consistent within this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Li Wei’s sensibility—the cracked mirror lake and humming glass directly mirror his fractured, amplified inner life. The nautilus shell functions as a micro-setting object, with its fracture lining up with dawn light to literally mark the seam between his old role and new stance. Environment doesn’t physically constrain his choices, but it charges the final image: he conducts between spire and sky as the ice “sings,” making the world itself part of the orchestra. The sensory detail is rich without devolving into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The viaduct, wet stone, neon arches, and post-rain atmosphere are vividly drawn and tonally apt, giving a strong sense of liminal, synthetic space. The setting is integrated with the concept (bridge as procedural generator, arches as fractured timelines), not just as backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond being a symbolic threshold; Elias’s choices don’t hinge much on spatial or physical constraints. The final image of the viaduct fading is strong, but the setting could tighten its grip on action to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern, drumheads, cracked horn, and rustling seasonal frame are vividly drawn and deeply integrated with Elias’s tactile perception, reinforcing the theme of silence-as-presence. Environmental details (drumheads like held breath, the phonograph horn he presses his palm to) are not decorative—they shape how he accesses music. The outside world (wind, wet earth, distant woodsmoke, village) contrasts the interior hush and charges the final walk back. Setting could constrain choice one notch more explicitly, but it already functions as a meaningful pressure-cooker of quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard, weather, lavender, fountain, pigeons, and the storm recorder create a richly textured, coherent environment filtered through Elias’s professional and personal gaze. Setting isn’t postcard; it participates in pressure (“The courtyard held its breath with him,” the door creak, the too-loud fountain) and charges the final image as an inhaled stillness before something breaks. Worldbuilding around the Bureau and the quarantine zone feels spare yet specific and consistent. This is near publish-ready; to push higher, the courtyard could constrain his options in a more concrete way, not only atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants and the ultraviolet-lit Luminara are vividly, economically drawn and deeply entwined with the premise; details like silver-veined stems and "ghostly script" both worldbuild and signal otherworldliness. Setting is filtered through Elias’s sensory bias, especially smell and light, which keeps atmosphere bound to character. The environment materially constrains the conflict—the flowers literally feed on light and tears, and the greenhouse’s "dying glow" mirrors the dying ecology his grief sustains. The final contrast between the harsh, "too alive" dawn outside and the greenhouse interior powerfully charges the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto, warm clay, crushed sage, rearranged constellations, and the stalactite anchor the scene with vivid, selective detail that always runs through the poet’s sensibility. Setting isn’t postcard; the grotto and stalactite literally enable his experiment with the rope’s pendulum and the eventual ladder, and the rope+ladder function as micro-setting objects constraining and transforming choice. The evolving sky and the ladder’s final shadow under dawn charge the closing image thematically. A slight cap comes only from the world outside the grotto remaining more suggestive than concretely operative.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and jutting shipwrecks are vivid, specific, and recur throughout, evolving from eerie ruin to a kind of consecrated hall for their duet. Environmental details (condensate drips, bonfire embers, creaking timbers) are integrated with action and theme rather than tacked on. The final image of the greenhouse sighing and shipwrecks settling charges the ending strongly. The setting doesn’t much constrain tactical options, so it stops short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber grotto, dusk light, cuffs, and petals form a tightly integrated micro-setting that feels lived-in and particular to Liora’s work. Environmental details (pulsing amber walls, thickening light, static build-up) are not just pretty—they shape how she operates and heavily charge the final images. The motif of dusk completing its transformation in parallel with the petal and the client’s realization deepens atmosphere and theme. A hair more direct constraint (e.g., something she cannot do because of the grotto’s nature) would push this into unquestionable 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The seaside library courtyard—salt-kissed breeze, lantern light, distant waves—creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Environmental details (donation box, musicians, clock tower) are well integrated into action rather than bolted on. The setting underwrites tone and theme (public culture, quiet labor, invisible giving) but doesn’t significantly constrain tactical options beyond providing a plausible donation box and nocturnal meeting place. Strongly evocative, but not yet using environment as a full pressure instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater are vivid and specific, with details like fruit that refracts light into unreadable stories and air humming with lost languages. These aren’t postcard backdrops; they shape action (the search pattern around the crater, tags on its rim, the arbor’s placement) and charge the final image when Reed presses her palm to the obsidian and feels the crater answer. The recurring environment of crystal, obsidian, and linguistic murmur tightly mirrors and supports the story’s kinship/voice themes. A touch more tactile interaction with the orchard itself during the search could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific—rooftop canals, bone-like towers, ink-black water, and the sense of the city as a sleeping giant all feel integrated and coherent. Environmental details are not postcard-only: the canal water becomes ink, then a key, then the medium through which she retrieves the echo’s leash, and the rooftop height enables the encounter. Time-distortion is dramatized through the city’s clocktowers and the boy’s boat drifting backward, making the rules felt rather than told. The atmosphere supports the story’s tonal ambitions without drowning clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cavern orchard is vividly realized—the mineral drips, bioluminescent lichen, black fruit, and silent vines all feel specific and tonally unified. Setting is not mere backdrop: stalactite droplets “answer” his incantation, the orchard’s decay embodies his ambiguous loss, and moonlight at the end reframes his internal shift. The mosaic stone and cavern environment also constrain the ritual mechanics (where he kneels, where the eyes fit). Overall, the world feels integral to both mood and meaning, if more pressure-bearing than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library at dawn, stained glass, vents, pipe chases, and sub-basement all feel tactile and lived-in, with details consistently filtered through Elias’s occupational eye. Setting actively shapes tactics (using the vent draft to deliver the laugh, the lofty stacks for elevation, the book spine as cache site) rather than serving as backdrop. The dawn light and steadied city grid explicitly charge the final image, tying environment to emotional shift. Sensory specificity is high without turning into a static tour; the world evolves as the scene’s stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nursery, storm season, and especially the mossy trellis are vivid and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility, with strong sensory detail (“wet earth,” “glistened like a living tapestry”) that supports tone and theme. Setting is not mere backdrop: weather and plant structures literally and metaphorically shape what’s possible—the trellis sags under new growth, the storm enables metamorphosis, the wet soil invites her barefoot surrender. The environment directly charges the final images of rain and intertwined vines. All of this feels integrated rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The island setting is vivid and integrated: tidal erosion, salt-cracked mud, derelict desalination rigs, the chapel, and the bioluminescent cavern all feel tactile and specific. Weather and geography actively shape action (the crooked rain trail directs him; the island “hunger” and wounds mirror his own state). The brooch and amber veins function as object-as-setting, charging both the descent and the closing image. At this length, it’s an exemplary balance of atmosphere and function without sliding into decorative worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cave and its crystals are vividly rendered and tonally integrated (“air humming,” “song would unravel her,” “music made her heart ache with recognition”). The environment functions as more than backdrop—it’s thematically a “lens” and acoustically active—but it doesn’t often constrain concrete tactical choices beyond drawing pilgrims and focusing the vision. Still, the selective sensory detail and recurrent musical imagery create a strong, coherent atmosphere. The setting’s logic holds consistently with the world’s implied rules.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivory harbor, slick cobblestones, lighthouse hut, and reopened café are rendered with vivid, selective detail that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting and objects (harbor, lighthouse, valve, ship) are tightly integrated with the emotional stakes around silence, return, and proclamation. While the environment doesn’t overtly constrain physical options, it strongly charges the final images (the rooftop, the ship’s horn, the harbor listening). The sensory palette and atmospheric consistency significantly elevate the piece’s mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: mist, clocktower, cracked cobblestones, and the starlit vault all feel tactile and tonally unified. The environment constrains choices (the vault only opens at a specific hour; cracks guide his path; the platform is accessible via the punch) and charges the final image (vault sealed, mist and shifting cracks as new questions). Details are selective yet rich, like the schedule board of departures such as “The Hour You Missed,” which deepens both world and theme. This is vivid and purposeful rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower, wind, salt, whales, and tide pools are vivid and consistently filtered through Liora’s attention as a stargazer and mourner. The environment is not mere backdrop: the tower’s “bones,” the softening stones, and the open door all participate in the magic and the final reconfiguration. Sensory detail is rich but usually purposeful, with the recurring whale song and tile acting as micro-settings that charge the final image. A hair more physical constraint from the space (e.g., vertigo, cold, height) could make the setting’s pressure even more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prismatic escondite, fractal ice pillars, and solar storm are vividly realized, with strong visual and conceptual specificity (“spatial mutiny,” “a crack split the air, not a sound but a concept”). Setting rules—magnetic fields as the escondite’s language, geometry arguing with space—are introduced through action rather than exposition. Environment directly shapes and constrains the choice to drop the amulet, as the storm and mutinous physics are the medium for transformation. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding (body, sound, temperature) under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The funeral home prep room is sharply and economically rendered—the cold porcelain, formaldehyde reek, coffins, and death certificates all feel lived-in and functionally integrated. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the embalming fluid turning to water and coffin locks clicking open at the climax literalize the rule-breaking and charge the moment. World rules around the ink and the mortuary environment are consistent enough for this length, with the ouroboros ink pot as a micro-setting object that shapes choices. A slightly deeper use of the physical space to constrain tactics (e.g., exits, bodies) would push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly particular: the mountaintop bonsai pavilion, glass dome, and silent town below create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details are filtered through his sensibility (gilded leaves, fluorescent hum) and evolve with the scene, culminating in the dawn light gilding the forest. The bonsai labyrinth and glass dome do more than decorate—they literalize his invented histories and charge the final image. While the physical setting does not strongly constrain tactical choices, it deeply shapes meaning and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly evoked (“salt and rust,” “labyrinth’s maw”), and the environment tangibly shapes events: shifting alleys, upper tiers, and flooding lower paths constrain Daniel’s movement and frame the climax. The setting is consistently filtered through his sensibility (hearing “layers” of sound, containers “leaning in”), and the final image of dawn on the label inside this space is charged. A slight increase in how physical constraints directly force micro-choices could nudge this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned cliffside observatory is sharply rendered and tonally apt, from the “broken teeth” windows to the sea hammering the rocks. Environmental details (wind howling, rafters shaking, dust falling) are woven into action rather than paused description. The shell and half-finished cello function almost as micro-settings, anchoring the fantastical mechanics. The one limitation is that the physical environment mainly charges mood rather than constraining specific choices beyond “this is the place where it all converges.”

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The raft city carnival is richly and economically realized—frying dough, kite lanterns, neon fortune stalls, and the floating infrastructure all feel specific and lived-in. Crucially, the setting isn’t postcard-only: Lumina’s literal fluidity (redirecting water, shifting stalls, rafts bobbing free) directly informs tactics and theme against the developers’ bedrock anchors. The clocktower, cuff, and foundation chip recur as charged objects tied to order/time vs flux. A touch more sensory variety under peak pressure could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lunar setting is sharply rendered—the “silvered dust,” Earth as “a pale jewel,” the dawn’s “knife-edge of light”—and strongly colored by Elias’s gaze. Environmental details (vacuum, dust, mining drones, Earthrise) are integrated into his actions and ritual rather than offered as static postcard description. The recurring objects (crater rim, Earth, canister, grain of sand) charge the final images and define the mood of fragile impermanence. The setting lightly constrains choice rather than tightly forcing tactics, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The misted rail depot, water barrel, navigation array, and cramped shop are all vividly evoked and consistently filtered through a blind artisan’s non-visual perception. Setting isn’t just backdrop: mist and water shape his tactics, the depot’s hum and anchor chain cue timing, and the shop plus water barrel recur to charge the final image. World rules—the guild, crystalline array, hummingbird drone—are economical yet coherent. This environment materially constrains and enables his choices, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly realized and tightly integrated with mood and action: the groaning beams, black-glassy ice, and unmoving lake all foreshadow a place where time and water behave differently. The environment constrains tactics—she must go onto the dock, test the ice, wait for the “breath” to still—and the closing image of the outpost’s “rusted bones groaning…in relief” charges the final turn. Recurring physical details (condensation on glass/skin, the lake’s immobile center) are filtered through her professional eye, preventing generic atmosphere. This is strong, immersive setting work with direct closure charge, even if not aggressively obstacle-like.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: the “ancient archway,” cobblestones, well, forge, and empty houses all both evoke atmosphere and respond physically to his actions. Environmental elements aren’t just backdrop; the archway groans and “deciding whether to stand or surrender” and the warming cobblestones actively charge the stakes. The sensory palette (sound, heat, scent of bread, tactile stone) is rich but not bloated, always filtered through the tuner’s focus on resonance. The tuning fork and the town itself effectively function as micro-settings that constrain and shape his choices at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater temple and abyss are rendered with vivid, selective detail—the jellyfish “like slow, indifferent stars,” the mosaic constellations, the corroded plate—and all are filtered through Liora’s purpose and mood. Environment constrains options (oxygen, pressure, entrapment) and enables the hush encounter, not just decorating it. Recurring setting images (jellyfish, temple pillars) meaningfully bookend the story and charge the final sense of what’s “left behind.” A slight additional use of physical constraint in her moment of choice could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight beam are not mere backdrop; they shape every beat, from climbing the wall with the lattice to bodies caught in gears and the reef’s “teeth” waiting below. Environmental details (door always ajar, scuffed threshold, cracked glass) meaningfully constrain and frame his choices. The final images—the beam flickering blue and the reef “holding its breath”—reprice the whole story and charge the thematic stakes. Sensory specificity is vivid and selective without feeling like a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly particular and tightly woven into the action: poison, frost, endless night, and the oldest tree’s splitting all materially shape what can happen. The bead beneath the tree and the greenhouse’s sealing at the end charge the final image with environmental constraint, not mere backdrop. Sensory selection (rotting roses, black sap, frost-weep) supports the tone without tumbling into undirected cataloguing. World rules around the orchard’s alchemical nature stay consistent and are learned through event rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The red canyon labyrinth and emptied tide pools are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Elias’s history and vocation. Environmental features (grooved prayers, dead-end stairs, the Heart Chamber, tide’s retreat and return) actively shape both his ritual and the story’s metaphors of ruin and renewal. The setting charges the final images—the humming red stone, the scent of salt, the horizon as “canvas” for new stitches. The world feels specific and lived-in, though not quite at the absolute pinnacle of constraint-driven worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, economical, and integral: catacombs, roots through bones, the orchard above, and the sundial base all interlock and evolve through the piece. Details are strongly sensory (smell of damp earth and overripe figs, pulsing roots, faint sweetness) and always filtered through Elias’s work and attention. Environment meaningfully shapes action—he “follows the roots,” plants in the sundial hollow, and the final image depends entirely on this specific ecology (sapling splitting stone, orchard stirring). The world’s quiet fantastical rules stay consistent and are learned through observation rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The golden arcade, neon ghosts, chalk, and rusted mailbox are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Lena’s sensibility, establishing a cohesive futurist/retro atmosphere. Setting seamlessly integrates with action (chalk under Galaga, the back alley mailbox, the cool air fogging her breath). While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain options, it does meaningfully charge the theme of analog trust versus digital ubiquity. The final brightening of the gold trim nicely reweights the “edges” motif at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory, its clockwork, telescope, and the illegal flame are all tightly integrated into character, conflict, and resolution. Environmental details like the dome, the loom, and the emerging constellations are not just decorative—they literally shape what Elias can do and charge the final image of the dome shattering into stars and embroidery scattering as seeds. Autumn functions more as tone than constraint, but the micro-setting is so specific and consequential that it fully compensates. The world’s rules around censorship and illegality remain consistent and legible through setting cues.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mangrove labyrinth, black water, spirits, and moonlight are richly specific and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility, avoiding tourist-list description. Environment and objects (the labyrinth’s reluctance to “let go,” the water as mirror and conduit, the shard drinking moonlight) meaningfully constrain and charge her choices, especially at the end. World rules (spirits humming, shard healing) stay internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. The final image of leaving the labyrinth, the shard warm and smooth, and the scent of “a door left ajar” is powerfully environment-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass “bruise,” and ivy like “old barbed wire” are vivid and tightly interwoven with Lena’s perception and history. The coral fragment functions as a micro-setting object, its ridges mirroring the atrium and literally passing between characters to charge the final image. Environment and object together constrain meaning and options: this liminal, enclosed space feels like a triage ward for psychic injuries. The setting is never postcard; it is consistently doing psychological and thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ruined orchard, fog-bound district, and patched greenhouse are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful sensory detail that strongly colors Liora’s perception (“fruit no one dared eat,” fog as projection surface). Setting meaningfully shapes action—the fog literally becomes canvas, the ruined trees hold the film, and the environment’s history charges the final transformation. World rules around light, film, and fog are consistent and absorbed through action, not exposition. The final image of the fog-claimed orchard as “promise” is directly powered by the environmental specificity laid earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sound wave garden is vividly and economically realized—metal sculptures tuned to hum, soil holding the nickel, frescoed walls—and its rules stay consistent. Environment isn’t just backdrop: pressing the nickel to a sculpture triggers the first crossing, the sculptures “sing” to escalate later crossings, and their hum “approves” the door choice, so setting actively shapes options. The hobo nickel as recurring object is tightly braided with the garden and decisively charges the final image (now embedded in the wall, winking, then “yours to find”). The tonal atmosphere—sonic, vibrating, liminal—is specific and sustains the thematic focus on thresholds and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse and city are sensually and specifically realized—the damp earth and crushed mint, fogged glass, rusted shelves, drones, and Neural Ledgers all feel grounded and coherent. Setting is not postcard dressing: the gardens and greenhouses directly constrain tactics (drones avoid green spaces; plants are the code; the morning glory at the door is the final cue). World rules about surveillance and taxation are embedded through setting details rather than expository dumping. The only slight ceiling is that environmental constraint is strong conceptually but rarely forces a moment-by-moment tactical improvisation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gargantuan shell, sea, and war-marked environment are exquisitely specific and deeply integrated with action: acoustics “bend sound,” the shell mouths to the sea, and finally seals around her like a cocoon. The world’s physical logic (wind, tide, jellyfish, coral) is consistent and constantly in dialogue with the metaphoric work. The setting constrains and charges choices—how she sings, where she places the postcard, how messages arrive—culminating in a final image that would fail without these environmental terms. Sensory detail is rich yet mostly purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Liora’s relationship to it—opal library, glass-orchids, dome, clouds, bamboo chime all accrue meaning. Environmental elements do real work: orchids respond to sound, the dome shakes in the wind, and the clouds parting/sunlight at the end reweight the entire space as changed. World rules feel coherent in a lyrical, magical-realist register. The setting meaningfully charges the final image rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive is sensuously and functionally rendered—from the “scent of crushed violets and slow decay” to indigo mist weaving through shelves—and it directly constrains choices (imminent burning, fragile scrolls, the inkwell’s position and shattering). The inkwell and shard operate as micro-setting objects that charge both the climax and final image. World rules around the archive-as-loom and truth-ink are consistent and revealed through action rather than exposition. A slight reason this doesn’t edge higher is that the external physical environment (beyond torches and dawn) remains secondary to the lyrical interior and magical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The volcano amphitheater, drowned valley, and physicality of the chain and gates create a vivid, coherent world filtered through Liora’s engineer sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the amphitheater’s acoustics explain why the letter was hidden there, the “breathing” building and groaning volcano mirror the story’s tension about pressure vs. release, and the chain physically bridges the secret blueprint to the elders’ table. Environmental details are selective and purposeful, with recurring motifs (breath, stone, water, metal) charging the final image of the valley—and Liora—finally able to “breathe.”

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The attic of Holloway’s Rare Books is vividly realized—smell, light, dust, rafters, ledgers, pigeons all feel tactile and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the skylight and dust-mote “sheet music,” the ledgers, and the confined attic become extensions of his former life and current exile, directly informing his methods and emotional state. The meteorite and almanac function as micro-setting objects whose placement (windowsill, pocket, tucked into the book) charges the final image. This is nearly exemplary; only a slight sense that the dust-mapping “method” never quite constrains a concrete choice keeps it from absolute top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The corn maze, farmhouse porch, prisming terrace, and sinkhole quilt-nest are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Elias’s tension and guilt. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables action: the maze’s design and the sinkhole’s prior danger shape choices, and the beam and terrace literally hide the clues he must decode. Environmental detail (“flashlights that cut the dark like poorly aimed scissors,” the crows’ silence, the humming wood) sustains a numinous, slightly uncanny atmosphere that supports the threshold theme. A hair more physical jeopardy from the environment at the sinkhole could have pushed this into true 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The submerged facility, cracked domes, bioluminescent “constellations,” and jellyfireflies are vividly rendered and thoroughly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental pressure—the ocean’s weight, the groaning city bones, the clock of the tide—shapes mood and subtly frames her endurance choice. Small objects-as-setting (feather, glass shard, lens) charge the final images, especially the echo between deep glow and surface fireflies. The world feels specific, not generic SF seafloor dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The iridescent geode-cave, crater glass, sea foam, and migrating bird form a vivid, coherent environment whose textures (color, hum, mist) are consistently filtered through the recollectionist’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the cave’s rules (memories in glass, opalescent mist, the sealing geode) underpin the premise and charge the final image of the cave sighing shut. The outside sea foam reprise ties world and emotional arc together in a specific way. The environment could constrain choice a bit more explicitly, but as a lyric, textural engine it’s strong.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade is vivid and specific—the slick cobblestones, retreating tide, pilings, torch smoke, and gulls all feel lived-in and atmospheric. Crucially, the environment is not mere backdrop: the tide’s rhythm and spray literally time and shape his playing, and the “tide turning” in the final line charges the closure image. The recurring outdoor elements (stars, water, smoke) echo his obsession with hidden pattern. It’s rich, controlled description that supports both mood and method without bogging the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight garden and blackened pond are vivid and purposeful: lilies “sharp enough to draw blood,” Orion’s reflection as ink source, the garden “holding its breath” at closure. Setting is tightly filtered through her ritual and charges the final image of the night leaning in to listen. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain options, it meaningfully frames and amplifies her transformation. Specific world hints (nostalgia ban, coast) add texture without derailing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, sensorial, and tightly filtered through Elias’s craft—mist, prisms, wood, and water are all working objects, not postcard scenery. Pearl Bay at dawn and the atrium’s interior both shape what he can do (ritual before boats arrive, reading light and water) and charge the final image of the bay “exhaling.” The recurring specifics—the floating walkway, salvaged prisms, central pool—anchor space and atmosphere without bloat. Environment and object-as-setting (the atrium) directly charge the closure, earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge, burned vs untouched valleys, and fire-scarred pines are vivid and specific, filtered through a firefighter’s eye and trauma. The setting is not postcard décor: the ridge as “spine between two valleys” and the unburned valley he descends into directly charge his final choice and thematic direction (from ruin toward potential renewal). Recurring environmental details (charred trunk, pine sap, damp earth, forest “breathing”) subtly mirror his internal shift without feeling over-signaled. The environment shapes the final image and reweights prior material, even if it doesn’t impose concrete physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tide-polished grotto is intensely felt and integral: the tide erases and then “writes,” the walls capture light, and the space becomes a literal and thematic threshold. Setting details are filtered through Liora’s mind (equations in shells, patterns in kelp), which deepens both world and character. Environment meaningfully constrains and charges choice—the recurring erasure of her equations is the problem the story resolves by transforming the grotto’s behavior. This is elite-level atmospheric integration, just shy of truly transcendent originality at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-veiled passage, damp stone, sealed door, and shrine-like room are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Elias’s perception. Environmental elements constrain and shape choices—the split passage, the sealed door, the ivy-throttled path—and recur meaningfully (the ivy at dawn, the vanished door, the glowing mural). World hints like drowned coasts and acid rain are light but sufficient to place this in a distinct ruined future without bogging the scene. The final threshold image is strongly charged by the physical setting, though the broader climate-collapse backdrop remains more atmospheric than pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terrace, rain, prism parapet, and cathedral bells are vividly realized and tightly integrated with mood and ritual, avoiding any white-room feel. Environmental elements like the rainbows and bells recur and charge the final image (“The rainbows faded… the last bell tolled”) in a way that reweights the entire scene. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, it does function as a liminal stage whose temporal and sensory features frame Liora’s choices. Details stay selective and purposeful, with no tourist-catalog drift.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient terrace, midsummer sun, lavender, dust, and star imagery create a rich, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting is consistently filtered through Veyra’s ritualistic perspective, and the terrace’s “memory” of past treaties charges the negotiation. The clipboard functions as a micro-setting object, physically mediating the conflict and prominently shaping the closing images. The environment doesn’t overtly constrain tactical options, but it very much charges the emotional and thematic stakes of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt flat, cracks, and distant thunder are vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through Elias’s history with drought. Setting constrains and enables choice: only this dry, preserving environment makes his chosen “preservation” logic plausible and charged. The fissure as cradle and the salt sealing “like a scar” powerfully charge the final image. Atmosphere supports theme without lapsing into generic weather or landscape description.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the prism dome, silver courtyard, snow, and glowing threads are not just pretty—they shape action (she must work barefoot in the cold, untangle threads by touch, cross threshold and courtyard). The refracted starlight and “harvest of echoes” visually and conceptually frame the sanctuary as both beautiful and imprisoning, charging the theme. Environmental details evolve with events (snow sliding, light turning to “blades of color”) rather than staying static. The final image of snow melting where she stands uses the environment to underline her transformation and the cost of bearing the voices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The decommissioned radar dome, salt flats, and *Static Hound* are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with strong sensory and tonal specificity. The dome’s history as a listening machine turned “shrine to misheard things” and its acoustics both mirror and frame his ethical concerns, especially in the closing shadow image. The recurring campfire and salt-flat imagery further deepen atmosphere without feeling like generic scenery. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it decisively charges the thematic and emotional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto above the clouds, muffling moss, shifting valley glimpses, and church bell form a vivid, selective environment that mirrors and deepens the theme of removed, fragile remembrance. Setting is consistently filtered through Lior’s noticing and tangibly affects images (the wind carrying the wing, the light catching the spiral, the bell marking the world below). While the grotto does not force a discrete tactical choice, it meaningfully charges the final image and the valley/grotto contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the glacier, sanctum, ice, and aurora are not mere backdrop but function as participants in the ritual, literally responding (walls weeping, aurora pulsing) to Elira’s actions. Objects as micro-setting—the rope, wax, punched card—are tightly bound to the world’s logic and the final image of names “humming just beneath the ice.” Environmental constraints (cold, ice, glow, sound-into-light) shape what this ritual can be and charge the ending as she walks into the aurora. A small limit is that practical physical constraint rarely pressures her choices; the setting is more spiritual than logistical in its influence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bunker and rewilded forest are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“rusted hatch half-buried under ivy,” “vines lashing out,” walls dissolving into loam and sky) that feels both tactile and symbolically charged. Environment isn’t just backdrop; it actively reconfigures at the climax and directly shapes the final image of the path and storm. The recurring physicality of vines and weather constrains how transcendence can look and feel. This integration of setting with transformation is strong enough for high-band, even if not quite maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The palace, desert night, underground sanctum, and observatory are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through an astronomer’s perception (tiles as counts, stars as “indifferent arcs”). Environmental specifics—looted palace, usurpers’ torches, ziggurat, the central pillar—anchor time and place and justify his ability to move unseen. The recurring contrast between the stars above and the hidden mechanisms below charges both the descent and the final image. Setting also lightly constrains choice (between-regimes decay allowing access; the pillar as the only plausible “lock”), weaving atmosphere into function.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The soundless sanctuary is vividly realized—"where sound died before it could form," walls breathing, air scented like rain on dry earth—and its rules meaningfully shape the scene. The silence and later single note directly charge the choices around the music box and the brothers’ ability to speak. The music box itself works as a micro-setting/object that constrains action and anchors the final image. A bit more tactile interaction with the environment (beyond pulsing walls) could have deepened the constraint, but what’s here is strong and efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ruined orchard, frost, and thick fog are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with mood and meaning rather than feeling like mere backdrop. Objects-as-setting—the sextant, mirrors, fruit of light—evolve and charge the final images, especially the orchard bearing stars and the workshop’s mirrors becoming windows. The environment constrains perception (fog muffling memory) more than physical options, but it does shape what tactics are available (using fog as medium for erasure/recreation). World rules are consistent within the lyric-magical frame, and sensory detail is well-chosen rather than encyclopedic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard-cathedral hybrid is vivid and specific—apples “smelled like forgiveness,” roots through marble, the broken rose window, ghosts-as-wind—and consistently filtered through the mender’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: it supplies key constraints and resources (the spot “where the light bends,” the apple as forbidden/claimed, the tree that holds the ribbon and doll). Environmental details evolve with action (digging in loam, unearthing the box, the sprout emerging) and charge the final images. The world rules are lightly sketched but coherent for the story’s purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the museum-on-asteroid, bathroom, and astral orchard all shape how Veyra thinks and what she can do. The orchard as a violet, fractal library of blossoms is not just pretty but functionally constraining—it is where visions, choices, and the door occur. Recurring small objects (cameo, pistachio shell, blossoms) function as a micro-setting and charge the final image. World rules remain consistent even in their surrealism, and the environment clearly underwrites tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore and living shelves are vividly and economically realized, with details like pulsing spines and shifting aisles that feel integrated with the magic system. The environment constrains and shapes action—Elias has to navigate rearranging aisles, the stone door appears only when needed, and the mountain’s “sigh” at the end recharges the final image with menace. The botanical diary and the unwritten light work as micro-setting elements that charge the climax rather than static props. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual/abstract (e.g., sound/texture as he approaches the door) could deepen atmosphere even further.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned carnival ship is vividly evoked—rust, cotton candy, funhouse mirrors, weeping carousel horses—and the fog and mirrors recur in ways that charge both mood and the final passage. Setting is tightly integrated with the uncanny memory logic (faces in the fog, mirrors as thresholds), and the ship’s physical shuddering and eventual sinking concretize the abstract stakes. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options beat-to-beat, it’s inseparable from the story’s ontology and cost. The closing contrast between the dead ship and humming garden gives the world a satisfying before/after contour.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vivid and purposeful—the “cathedral of brass and silence” with oil “thick as incense” establishes mood and stakes of time, ritual, and machinery. The rope, gears, and door all act as environmental tools/constraints: the rebraiding interrupts the gears, the door is literally embedded in the mechanism, and the final chime reframes the whole event. The surreal library beyond extends the setting logic (books of frozen breath, woven shadow) in a way that clearly expresses the story’s thematic concerns. This is strong enough for a high-tier venue, though the middle library section is more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harmonic caves, frozen seep, and ripple-marked walls are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Eldrin’s professional attention, making the environment feel like an active archive. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the caves’ memory function and the ice’s fractures directly enable his method and the central act of conjuring the bloom of hush. The final images (rewriting ripple-marks, caves as home, wind carrying a new language) show the world materially altered, charging the closure. There’s still room for deeper tactile and spatial constraint under peak pressure, but as-is it’s very strong and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass beacon-tower, humming pavilion, carved star paths, and salt-worn glass steps are vivid, selective, and strongly filtered through her functional familiarity. Setting is not postcard decoration: the star paths and pedestal directly mediate her attempt, and the beacon/pavilion’s hum and later “song” charge the climax and final image. The post-collapse landscape and first scent of rain subtly mirror the thematic reweighting without feeling forced. Environment and recurring objects clearly constrain choice and emotionally load the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, storm, fog, and crystal flags are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Summer-Quill’s sensibility, avoiding tourist-list description. Environmental elements recur and evolve—the humming flags, the solid fog, the storm’s “lullaby”—and they clearly charge the final images (rain as an old friend, hush as the past making room). The world’s memory-physics are consistent and serve the premise without over-explaining. The setting mostly pressures mood and realization rather than constraining physical options, which is the only thing holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fortress, creeping glowing blooms, lavender/gunpowder dust, and starless sky are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Liora’s pyrotechnic sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the starless curse defines the central problem, the fortress height supplies her launch platform, and the blooms respond to her fireworks, charging the transformation. The recurring environmental elements—fortress, vines, sky—explicitly constrain and then reframe the final image. A slight tilt toward decorative lyricism in a few lines keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and shoreline are rendered with precise, sensorial detail—moonlight like spilled ink, metallic tang of the cicada, drip of water—which create a lived, liminal atmosphere. Setting is tightly filtered through the chronicler’s attentiveness, so every detail feels like an extension of her mind rather than a catalog. The grotto as a place where “time moved differently” and the tidal pool as a site of small transitions both charge the thematic arc and the final images. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it does constrain and shape how she seeks answers, which is enough at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bunker and trellis are intensely realized through taste, texture, and spatial logic, with the xenial lattice above the clouds functioning as both environment and living mechanism. Details like the coppery bunker air versus the honey-and-lightning silence of the trellis directly track the child’s shifting options and desires. World rules around inversion and sprouting are revealed through action rather than exposition and stay consistent enough to feel governed. The setting decisively charges the ending image (biting the vine at the peak), making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and fully integrated: canals, prism terrace, storm glass, and train tracks all filter through Elias’s practiced attention and shape his tactics. Environmental tools (prisms, dial, vial, copper spoon) literally mediate sound and grief, so the world’s rules are learned through his work rather than exposition. Spatial and sensory choreography are coherent and grounded despite the lyricism. The final image of the terrace humming in a “vaulting hush” clearly depends on this built environment and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the silver-leaved orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and subterranean atrium are rendered with strong sensory detail tied to Elsin’s task. Objects and environment constrain choices—the flake in the bark, the murals in the tree, the hatch, the mirrored dome, and the physical throne all shape her path and options. The orchard and its fruit return in the final image, reweighted from mystical to ordinary, charging the new era with quiet significance. World rules (ascension tech as buried machinery, living murals) stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sanctuary is vividly realized—ash, incense, cracked dome, starlight pooling into non-Lior shapes—and always filtered through Lior’s history with the place. The environment isn’t postcard; it actively structures the conflict via the threshold, the scars in the wood, and the doorknocker as conduit. The final image of a new door and rain after drought is charged precisely because the earlier spatial and textural work has defined how enclosed and parched this sanctuary-world was. The setting’s rules stay consistent and quietly fantastical without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and surrounding desert are vivid, tactile, and tightly integrated with mood and stakes: the mushrooms’ pulsing, fracturing, flaring, and final dimming track the narrative turns. The setting acts as a micro-environmental constraint and barometer for the glitch, housing the bolt and then receiving the diamond into its mycelium. Outside, the desert and ozone smell charge the choice to walk away with a sense of scorched promises and new, unstructured space. The only small limitation is that physical constraints of the farm/desert don’t materially shape tactics beyond atmosphere—they’re more emotional and thematic scaffolding than practical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sepia reading room is vivid and tightly integrated: every key object (shelves, floorboard, gramophone, golden shadows) grows from and belongs to this space. The final realization that “the ledger wasn’t a book. It was the room” makes the setting itself the central mechanism of truth. Environmental specifics consistently filter through Elias’s sensibility, avoiding generic description. The room constrains options in a conceptual rather than physical sense, but it does charge the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard/greenhouse is exquisitely realized and fully integrated: sensory-rich (“glass panes wept condensation,” “crushed silverleaf”) and rule-bearing (plants that unfold and stop, glass clearing to reveal a stage). The environment doesn’t just decorate; it transforms at the climax—greenhouse to stage, endless night holding its breath—directly charging the final image and the story’s metaphysics. This is worldbuilding in tight concert with theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The file room is vividly and efficiently evoked in the opening line, and the sensory specificity (yellowed paper, sour coffee, dust patterns) grounds the mood. Setting details are always filtered through Elias’s occupational lens, which keeps them purposeful. The button functions as a micro-setting object that accrues meaning and charges the middle and closing beats. The only thing holding this just shy of the highest band is that the environment constrains mood and theme more than concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The auric lagoon, dusk puddles, and vanishing reappearing booth are vivid, specific, and filtered through Lena’s practical urgency (waiting for “the reflections to align”). Setting rules—dusk timing, reflective maps, auric water speaking with erased voices—are consistent and shape tactics rather than feeling like postcard description. The final image of the booth still under the stars, awaiting the next reader of puddles, clearly charges the ending and reweights the world’s magic as a persistent, subversive infrastructure. A few secondary settings (diner, broadcast) are more generic, but they serve as mundane contrast rather than dead space.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the radiant grotto, mist, prism atrium, dewdrops, and even the city club are vividly rendered and filtered through his sensibility. Environmental details evolve with events (prism panes weeping rainbows, dimming when the whisper collapses) and mirror the internal struggle with silence and sound. The saxophone and grotto function as charged tools/places that shape what tactics are even possible (subtractive playing, “negative space” as method). While the environment doesn’t rigidly lock his choices, it powerfully charges and constrains the final images and options.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skyborne arbor, ashen sky, floating islands, and tiny votive monuments create a vivid, coherent secondary world that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Environment is not just backdrop: the arbor’s roots become a ladder, the monuments melt and rise to embody past bargains, and the entire tree vanishes to be replaced by a grove, all of which shape options and closure. Details are selectively chosen and strongly POV-filtered through Liora’s tactile, listening relationship with seeds and leaves. The only limit is that sensory range stays heavily visual and conceptual; a bit more embodied immediacy could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the workshop under a bone-yard, the fire-scarred greenhouse, the subterranean waterfall—are vivid, sensorial, and tightly tied to his psyche (“earth still smelled of charcoal and half-burned letters”). Environment and objects-as-setting (clock, compass, glowing leaves) repeatedly constrain and channel his actions, especially the greenhouse path and waterfall encounter. “Beneath the ashes” and the hum of the greenhouse charge the final image of the wildening city. A 9+ would require the physical constraints of setting to bear slightly more explicit tactical pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rain-washed foundry with “iron ribs” and rust is vivid and atmospherically integrated, not a backdrop; the crucible, torches, and storm all shape what Liora can do and when (staying after everyone leaves, risking an experiment in isolation). The object-micro-setting of coin, vial, and crucible functions as environment, constraining choices and charging the final image. The later shift to her own workshop is brisk but clear, and the furnace there meaningfully reframes the initial foundry. Weather and physical space mirror and support the internal arc without feeling like blunt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge and the dawn are vividly rendered—“pale gold mist curling through the jagged teeth of the cliffs”—and consistently filtered through Liora’s work and mood. The gorge’s echoes, the misaligned harp, and the smell of “wet earth and old secrets” all mirror and modulate the spectral business of regret and laughter. The gorge and harp jointly charge the final image (the echoes laughing, the lingering note), though they rarely impose hard physical constraints on choice. Still, as a textural and symbolic environment, the setting is rich, specific, and tightly woven into the story’s emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultraviolet forest, black-leaved canopy, bruise-colored light, and stone-pillared shrine are striking and specific, with sensory variety (pressure, taste, texture) integrated into action. Environment actively shapes the experience: roots guiding him, the basin and pillars catalyzing the central ritual, the UV light bending gold at his exhale. The pewter strap as a recurring object functions almost as micro-setting at the end, charging the final image. World rules stay consistent, though the forest’s agency is more mythic than materially constraining of concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s market, the suspended stalls, scents, and the sea-loaded air are vivid and consistently filtered through Lior’s sensibility; specific details (ropes “singing,” ink that smells of salt and rust) do real atmospheric work. The lighthouse, docks, and rooftops form a coherent liminal geography that supports the “between-worlds” theme. Setting mostly charges tone and theme rather than constraining concrete choices, which keeps it just shy of exceptional. Still, the environment feels singular and memorable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly evoked through specific, character-filtered detail (popcorn, sawdust, “forgotten acrobats” of dust) and remains spatially coherent. Setting directly shapes action—ceiling cracks as disguised seams, the hidden mechanism above, the skylight admitting dawn—and charges the final image (“The cracks in the ceiling were just cracks now.”). The circus-world logic (a machine that keeps the show running) is consistent and learned through Elias’s encounter. This is near top-tier atmospheric work, only shy of utterly singular world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass orchard library, frost-veined windows, and sea of clouds are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s practical engagement with them (reading frost as omen, using the press, stepping onto the clouds). Environment meaningfully constrains and charges choices: the frost patterns force action; the dissolving glass and tumbling books manifest the rupture; the sea of clouds becomes both ground and consuming force at the end. World-rules—whispers, liquid time, mirrored libraries—are weird but internally consistent and taught by action, not exposition. The final images (shattering into starlight, clouds swallowing him, “rustle” of the world) are inseparable from this setting and give the ending much of its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the baroque asteroid, time-strands, storm, and hollowed cathedral all feel specific and grounded in the story’s logic. Environment materially shapes the action (the storm enables the ritual; time-strands and altar make the vision possible) and charges the final image of Elias with the altar. Details are filtered through Elias’s priorities and grief, maintaining strong atmospheric coherence. A hair more tactile interaction with the space under peak stress could have pushed this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The resonance chamber, brass walls, and clocktower history are sensorially vivid and integral to how the magic operates (“the chamber sang,” “walls screamed as they unspooled”). Sound, metal, rust, and light are bound into both setting and mechanism, not just backdrop. The environment actively shapes the climax—its walls peel back into dawn, making the world-change tangible rather than abstract. The final image of the empty chamber and warm gear feels impossible to detach from this specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the dead factory, limestone cliffs, black lagoon, and mineral-slick walls are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The subterranean lagoon and arches directly constrain action and possibility, shaping the central encounter rather than serving as backdrop. Sensory detail is selective and apt (“air tasted of ozone and old pennies,” “water rushed upward in a reverse waterfall”) and the world’s slight strangeness remains internally consistent. The factory’s shutdown frames tone and theme, though it is more atmospheric than structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal storm and archway are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the premise: “ribcage of some ancient leviathan,” “turbine-hum,” and the storm stilling when the slide activates all feel lived-in and purposeful. The environment constrains options (he’s stranded, the arch is the only locus of action) and then literally shapes the solution as the storm’s behavior becomes a navigational tool. Detail is selective yet rich, consistently filtered through Elias’s maker’s eye. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of the path opening rather than sitting as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber pavilion, stained glass, melting snow, and night-blooming jasmine are vividly rendered and tightly braided with the emotional and thematic core. Setting is consistently filtered through Liora’s attention—glass as memory, twilight as hush—so the atmosphere feels earned rather than decorative. The cathedral window and garden actively shape the key discoveries and her final choice not to paint, charging the ending image. A slightly broader sensory range beyond sight and scent could deepen it further, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The zeppelin library, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly imagined and filtered through Elias’s sensibility (“cataloging the silences of history” made physical in the lagoon and offerings). The environment shapes action—there is literal “restricted memory” territory, the shoreline as ledger, and the lagoon as both key and final ritual site. Recurring objects (lagoon, shells, diary, zeppelin) all return with reweighted meaning by the end. The piece balances lyric description and functional spatial clarity with only minor flirtation with atmospheric excess.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“Paper-Lantern Cove,” phosphorescent tide, cinnamon and charred meat, night markets, docks thick with merchants—and these details recur to charge the final image of crowded docks and swaying lanterns. The environment is filtered through his memory and profession, tying atmosphere to theme rather than feeling like a postcard tour. While the cove doesn’t physically constrain his choices, its loss and revival clearly shape what matters and what counts as success. The object-as-setting move with the bottle rolling into the tide nicely fuses place, magic, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rooftop orchard is vividly realized and integrated: pear trees older than the skyscraper, the marsh-into-city history, the fog and distant subway hum. Setting isn’t mere backdrop; the garden’s mnemonic quality (“the garden will remember what the stone forgets”) becomes a governing rule that shapes both the prophecy and Elias’s response. Environmental details—roots deciding whether to keep or discard the sealed shaving—directly charge the final image and constrain his choice. The world feels coherent and lived-in without exposition dump, with the lighthouse and city below adding temporal depth.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium, iron ribs, frost-bitten glass, and overhead stars are vivid and integrated into action (ice cracking, shattering, then melting as outcome). The setting’s rules (vortex beneath, hatching-trigger, permafrost) are consistent and shape tactics; she must kneel on ice, work with cold-stiff hands, and use the atrium’s specific occult ecology. A recurring object-as-setting (the oak seed and cap) charges the final image, tying place, magic, and inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sanctuary above the clouds, the perpetual wind, and the solstice storm are vividly and economically rendered, with details like pine-needle tea and whale-sinew giving the world a distinct texture. Environment is not decorative: wind and altitude directly affect the bell’s behavior and Elias’s tactical choice to leave slack in the rope. Spatial and atmospheric choreography remain clear from stairwell to belfry to final lamp lighting. The final image—world raging outside, measured sound and lamp inside—shows the setting actively charging the ending rather than just framing it.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station, observation dome, and relic lantern are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Eli’s attention, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Environmental details (“metal ribs groaning,” “scent of ozone and old metal”) support the tone and parallel his inner life without feeling like a tourist catalog. The setting constrains choices: isolation, obsolete alarms, and the dome’s glass make the star-contact scene and his long quiet tenure believable. The healed lantern and starlit walls at the end directly charge the final image, tying environment to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Hollow Scarp, swallowed hives, melted combs, and grieving wind create a vivid, coherent physical and atmospheric container that’s active rather than ornamental. The stained glass box and the oasis/hive complex recur as charged objects/places that constrain meaning and charge the final images (box left atop the oldest hive; oasis in bloom). Environmental evolution—from dunes to thyme-scented oasis—mirrors the story’s reconfiguration without feeling like mere allegory. A touch more tactile engagement with the environment in the climax (how the hum/wind/heat physically bear on him) could have pushed it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The silo and its interior are vividly and economically rendered, with details (emerald patina, spiral staircase, labeled detritus) that carry thematic weight. The environment functions as more than backdrop: the vertical climb, the layered junk, and the workbench at the top all mirror the “garage sale of time” idea. Recurring objects—the pocket watch, urn fragment, and capsule—charge the final image and reframe the setting as loom rather than tomb. This is richly imagistic without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lagoon setting is richly yet economically rendered—cobalt water, rain aftermath, reeds, boats, heron—and it is tightly tied to theme through reflection and distortion (“like a bruise healing”). Environment is not mere backdrop: water, shore, and shallows structure his movements and choices (kneeling, wading, dipping the feather, retrieving the kite). Recurring environmental elements (water’s reflections, the cobalt shallows, the heron’s comings and goings) charge the final images. The only thing holding this just shy of top-tier is that the lagoon shapes mood and metaphor more than concretely constraining options.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly realized and tightly integrated with character and theme (pillars as “bones,” roots and fungi trading nutrients, copper spiraled around boughs). Setting is filtered through Elira’s professional and emotional lens so it never reads like a neutral tour, and key objects (pillars, copper wire, diary) recur to charge the final image. Environment constrains choices—the sapling must grow around a flawed pillar; architectural cavities dictate her interventions and the elders’ objections. The world’s rules (bio-architectural symbiosis, “heresy” of metal) feel internally consistent without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and interior observatory tech are vivid, sensorial, and thematically tuned to memory, absence, and reception. The environment meaningfully shapes action—there is literally a path to follow, a sealed door to confront, and a terminal that frames the encounter as pilgrimage rather than lab experiment. Recurring objects (tower, sculptures, amber fly) charge the final images of the empty, remembering space. While the setting mostly serves as charged stage rather than hard constraint, it’s specific and alive on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the jetty, dead reef, battlefield furrows, and Gloom Hill are sensorially rich and tightly integrated into action. Environmental details (salt, silt, bones as fertilizer, bleached coral) directly support the premise of reclamation and charge the final image of a glowing, sweet-water jetty. The landscape feels lived-in and rule-consistent without exposition bloat. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment mostly reflects and supports rather than actively constraining specific on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scrapyard, cracked wasteland, fissure, and glass dome are vivid, tactile, and sensorially specific (“ribs of twisted metal,” “veins still glowing amber”) and feel consistently filtered through Rook’s nose and age. Environment meaningfully constrains and charges choice: he must traverse the wasteland by landmarks described in the cylinder, and the dome’s glass and script physically mediate access to the garden. The recurring objects-as-setting—the leaf, the cylinder, the vines—anchor both orientation and the final image. World rules are sketched, not exhaustively explained, but remain internally stable and tonally apt.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observation deck, thin air, curved glass, and station wreckage are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Lira’s attention. The compass rose and glass aren’t just décor; they meaningfully constrain and enable action (she aligns the sketch to the stars on the glass; the compass needle “snaps” to indicate the route). Atmosphere—cold, silence, groaning metal—consistently supports the lonely, post-shutdown context. World rules about time dilation and the station’s past are sketched lightly but feel coherent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the “needle of black ice,” violet sun, fish-like stars, and ice that reshapes into footholds all feel bespoke to this piece. Environment and objects (spire, wrong sky, window, chessboard, sundial) actively shape options and closure, especially the sky’s mending and the spire singing at the end. World rules are consistently implied through action rather than explained, which supports the atmosphere. A tiny gap is that the physical danger of the spire and climate could bear even more on tactical choices to hit a truly top-tier mark.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering gallery, the dust, and the warped chessboard form an integrated micro-setting that both reflects and constrains action (she must walk and spell in dust; the board becomes a physical conduit for change). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“arches humming,” “voices layered like sediment,” “luminous absence as a wound”—and consistently filtered through Liora’s preoccupation with echoes and gestures. World rules (penumbra devours memory but not pain/silence) are conveyed through interaction rather than exposition. The environment strongly charges the final image (reassembled chessboard, empty gallery, drifting penumbra), though a slightly clearer spatial sense of where the dark is relative to her body in the climax could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain-as-bookstore is richly and economically rendered—“shelves spiraling like the grooves of a fingerprint,” mercury streaks on spines, dust like “shattered stars.” The environment meaningfully shapes action (labyrinthine stacks, hidden section, false wall becoming a door, circular room of empty shelves) and charges the final idea that “The mountain would remember.” World rules feel internally consistent for a mythic-lyric piece, learned through his movement rather than exposition. A small further constraint—some practical limit or danger tied to the architecture—could push this to absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the emotional arc. Setting elements actively charge choices: the frozen figures and the girl’s suspended laughter force him to face specific past harms, while the labyrinth’s empty, mirror-like state at the end reweights everything that came before. The final image—tapestry gone, only the board remaining—uses environment as conceptual punctuation, not mere decor. Weather/sound (thunder) is also woven in as an atmospheric counterpart to his internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon of bone, towers, and echoes is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility, with images like “walls of bone humming with the weight of unspoken names.” Setting actively shapes tactics and meaning: she chooses the fissure because the bone is thin and the echoes will carry her words, and the world’s rule that sin feeds the bone underpins the entire ritual. The final image—carving into the spire’s remains so light will refract her poem—charges the environment with lasting thematic weight. It’s richly atmospheric without slipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and thematically integrated: brass ribs, acid sea, corroded copper, and the statue all mirror the theme of corrosive regret and attempted repair. Environment actively constrains choice—the rising sea and groaning hull force a now-or-never decision and charge the final image of the charm over the waves. Object-as-setting is excellent: the workshop, keys, and statue are all used, not just toured, and their states evolve with the action. At this length, a slightly more concrete sense of broader world context (beyond the workshop) might deepen the “soul of the world” claim, but the immediate milieu is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: drowned docks, rust-red cliffs, and breathing caves all shape tone and meaning, not just backdrop. The coastal cave network and the still pool directly govern what is possible (temporary eternity, a place “where the water forgets to move”) and charge the closing image of the shell under water. Specific sensory choices—bioluminescent moss, metallic tang of a held breath—are both atmospheric and character-filtered. Environment and recurring objects decisively charge the ending, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is rich and purposeful: the cobalt lighthouse, humming iron ribs, cool glass, and harbor geography are all filtered through Elias’s perceptions. The lighthouse is not mere backdrop; it shapes tactics (horn vs “whispered” alternative) and charges the final image when it becomes “no longer just a warning, but an invitation.” Sensory details—sea-scent, lavender, jasmine, temperature shift—are selective and thematically aligned with intention and memory. The environment meaningfully inflects mood and choice without sliding into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The signal station, cliffs, and ocean are rendered with striking specificity (“clung to the edge of the cliffs like a barnacle,” rusted antennae, salt wind), and these are consistently filtered through Lena’s sensibility. The environment is not just postcard texture; the station’s communication infrastructure and isolation enable the midnight calls and her vocation, while the censer foot functions as a charged micro-setting object that returns in the final image as “listening.” Weather and sea erosion underscore the ongoing cost and fragility of her work. Setting, mood, and theme are tightly braided, especially in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ravine-orchard is vivid and specific (“hung like a broken chandelier”), and the storm-damaged terrain directly affects options (fewer truffles, exposed roots to swallow the eye). The setting is consistently filtered through Lior’s sensory and professional priorities (loam, musk, mist, wind pitch), avoiding generic fantasy landscape. The final image of the ravine and roots taking the eye by spring effectively charges the environment as accomplice in his choice, though one more tactile interaction under peak pressure could push this toward 9-level.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are excellent: the opal dock, nautical twilight, and the physical lighthouse with its stairs and lens all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental details consistently mirror and inflect the theme of isolation and witnessing (“built for witnessing isolation,” the dock as “vein of forgotten bone”). The micro-setting of the workshop and lantern room meaningfully charges the final image—Elias adjusting the beam so the light can “do the rest.” The setting doesn’t quite constrain choices in a hard way, but it absolutely charges the closure image, which is enough for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern is richly particular—wet earth and crushed mint, bioluminescent fungi, limestone banks—and those details constrain options (the rising creek, the fissure behind roots, the residue on his skin). Environmental elements (chip’s glow, fungi, water pressure) are not postcard description; they actively shape route, pace, and consequence. The final lingering glow on his skin elegantly ties the setting to the closure image and the theme of marks that persist. A hair less ornamental lushness in a couple of descriptive lines could sharpen the sense of physical risk even further.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ridge, cobalt stone, ember grotto, and bleeding starlight are vivid and consistently filtered through her perception, giving the world a tactile, uncanny logic. Setting materially shapes events: the forbidden altitude, smoldering veins, and fissure of starlight both constrain access and enable the transformation. Recurring details like the fireflies and the metallic taste of the air evolve across beats and charge the final image of her voice carried down the ridge. A touch more interaction between her body and the hostile environment under stress could push this to absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember nexus is vividly realized—bridges like molten copper, hidden furnaces, steam vents—filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting details are integrated into action (the railing’s warmth, the jump from the bridges, the city “exhaling”) and mirror the thematic concern with directed energy and presence. The nautilus shell also functions as a micro-setting/object, charging the final image when its light threads into their clothes and bodies. Still, the environment rarely constrains options in a tangible way; it’s more resonant backdrop than active obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain ranger cabin, grave, wind, pines, and birch scroll are concrete and atmospheric, all filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The setting sustains tone (weather as a knowing presence, the cabin as a palimpsest of selves) and charges key choices, especially the grave reveal and the step outside at the end. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, it functions as a crucible for his temporal and narrative entrapment. The final image of the empty grave against the mountain air recharges earlier setting details effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the fog, harbor, water clock, and smell-less shop all mirror and pressure the story’s concern with occlusion and perception. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s particular biases (knowledge of scents held only in memory, attention to tools and mechanisms). The water clock and fog both return at the end to charge the final image: time dripping, fog lifting, perception shifting from blur to clarity. This micro-world feels lived-in and thematically integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea platform, valley, mist, and gathering storm are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Lian’s ritual focus. Environment meaningfully shapes choice: the high, precarious, liminal platform and the storm’s ebb create a literal “between” space that constrains when and how she acts. Recurring objects-as-setting (tea, quill, crow, scars) interlock with weather and altitude to charge the final descent and first raindrops as welcome rather than threat. Detail density is high but controlled, with specific sensory touches like ozone and damp earth deepening mood rather than feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sheet music archive and orchard are vividly rendered, with tactile and olfactory specificity (“yellowed paper and old roses,” the sap-scent of the magic) that feel filtered through Mara’s sensibilities. Environment actively shapes the story: the archive is the channel the current runs through; the orchard’s planned destruction is the ticking clock and emotional core; the final image of the orchard humming beneath pavement is charged and inextricable from place. The setting does constrain choices (they can’t save the trees, only how they’re remembered), which supports this higher band. A slightly stronger use of the archive’s physical layout to affect tactics in the middle beat could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The temple library is vividly and economically rendered—dust motes, fractal corridors, bone shelves, blood ink—and the later tree-world is a sharp, tonal counterpoint. Setting clearly reflects thematic concerns (history, embodiment, death/rebirth), and the library’s identity as a sentient, dying being raises the stakes. However, the environment rarely constrains his options in concrete ways; it is more metaphorical pressure than tactical obstacle. The recurring objects (temple, dictionary, tree) strongly charge the final images, but not quite at the level where place itself shapes every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station, cliff, fjord, and brass-and-water machinery are vivid and selective, with details like “pipes vomiting black water” tightly tied to the turning point. The environment is not mere backdrop: the horizon line’s behavior is how he detects and tracks the anomaly, and the clockworks physically respond to his action. The recurring objects (the key, pipes, pendulum, horizon) all contribute directly to the stakes and charge the final image. A slight expansion of how the hostile cliffside/isolated fjord might constrain his escape options could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and permeable dome are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with both action (stepping on reactive mycelium, scanning) and theme (permeable walls, living network). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—teal light, damp earth, birdsong—without feeling like a tour. The environment directly charges the final images of dawn, walls as membranes, and light passing through. It could press on her choices a bit more explicitly, but as a microcosm for her conceptual shift it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rainwashed library and the sensory detail (“wet paper and old glue”) are vivid, POV-filtered, and tonally aligned with the piece’s melancholy rational-magic blend. The lantern functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice (gold vs blue paths) and returns, cracked, to charge the final image. Environmental details (rain returning, midsummer, humming books) evolve with the action rather than sitting as static backdrop. The broader library space affects mood more than tactics, but the object-as-setting work is strong enough to carry this category.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subway utility tunnel is atmospherically rich—ozone, damp metal, rats, streetlamp hum—and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory bias. The environment supports the liminal theme (between trains and streetlamps, above and below) and the emotional isolation. While the tunnel doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does charge the premise and final image (rat as metronome, candle and glass as constellation). Object-as-setting via the glass harmonica is also well integrated into the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor, jetty, twilight, violets, and salt-bleached wood are textured and specific, with details woven into action rather than static description. The setting strongly mirrors and charges the thematic concerns: cracks filling with “stubborn green,” twilight as a liminal time, the jetty as a place where vows decayed into whispers. While the environment doesn’t much constrain physical choice, it absolutely charges the final images (the jetty blooming again, the harbor “dreaming of ink and violets”). This is high-level atmospheric work just shy of the very top because its influence is symbolic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The station, overgrown platforms, freight car, and small offerings create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports the themes of abandonment and residual connection. The moon rock and ivy-covered nameplate serve as charged objects/images that resonate at the end. Setting is well-integrated into action (offerings on tracks, ledgers of the rail empire, the flatbed “train”), though it rarely constrains tactics in a hard way. The balance of concrete detail and mood-driven description feels purposeful and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ultrasonic forest and its rules (trees humming frequencies, sound-as-light, languages tasted through skin) are vivid, original, and fully integrated with action. The environment constrains perception and navigation, and the stillpoint clearing—trees “listening,” branches like cupped hands—is a powerful, charged spatial reconfiguration at the climax. The platinum ring and constellations further function as micro-setting elements that shape options and charge the final image. Detail is lush yet purposeful, always filtered through Elian’s non-visual senses.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, gravitational anomaly, hydroponic bays, and meteorite-nib pen create a vivid, specific milieu that shapes the story’s metaphors and logic. The anomaly’s sensory presence (“ozone and old parchment”) and behavior (unbending moments, rearranging stars) meaningfully charges both the pen’s function and the ending image. The setting feels integrated with Elias’s profession and worldview rather than decorative. It lightly constrains choice (his work, his coming here after the “wrong seeds”) but mostly operates as a richly atmospheric, concept-bearing field rather than a direct physical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor is vivid and active from the first line, with sensory specificity across sight, sound-as-absence, smell, and later synesthetic color. The environment does more than decorate: the water becomes the battleground and instrument (“waves…crashing not with noise but with color”), and the harbor’s glow and flinch signal the supernatural pressure. The moonlight and reflections recur and are reweighted at the end when the harbor’s silence turns “alive,” clearly charging the final image. Spatially and atmospherically, the scene remains coherent and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archive and desert are vividly and economically rendered (“charred parchment and old regret,” “buried beneath the desert”) and stay present as tactile constraints shaping what Elias can do—burn, unearth, descend. Recurring objects (tapestry, third pillar, key, ledger) double as setting anchors and thematic devices and culminate in a charged final blaze. The environment’s hostility and emptiness support the tomb/womb conceit without feeling like a generic ruin. A touch more interaction with the physical peril of fire and architecture collapsing could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, crystalline reeds, and auric lagoon are sharply specific and deeply integrated with action: the environment literally enables her method (sound shaping time, water remembering) and transforms at the climax. The setting details evolve with the stakes—from humming reeds laden with sorrow to a lullaby after release—and the final image of stars fracturing into the lagoon is charged and memorable. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned via interaction rather than exposition. The only thing holding it below perfection is that some sensory modes (beyond sight/sound) are less tapped, though the current focus feels purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly and economically rendered; images like “shipping containers stacked like a child’s abandoned blocks” and aurora-twisted neon create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting constrains action: scrambled compasses, shifting routes, and metal that “peels back like a curtain” all determine tactics and possibilities. The recurring containers/maze motif directly charges the final image of them “settling into their newest lies.” A touch more use of non-visual senses under peak pressure could make the environment feel even more physically present.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt dock, canal, rain, and shutters are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail always in service of mood and meaning rather than touristic description. The environment doesn’t drastically constrain physical options, but it deeply charges the emotional grammar: water, reflection, and star-light become the operative “space” where change can happen. The dental mirror and its placement on the father’s windowsill function as a micro-setting in the final image, concretely housing the story’s emotional shift. World rules (slightly numinous but grounded) stay consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, selective, and functional: the cobalt library, mist, stained glass, and humming grotto are all sensorially rich and consistently filtered through Elias’s chess-and-rebellion lens. Environment isn’t just backdrop—the grotto’s magnetism literally shapes the tactic (metal chains, singing filings) and the final charged stasis of the library standing “patient as a held breath.” World rules (whispered words, magnetic resonance) are stable enough to feel coherent within the piece’s slightly numinous logic. The atmosphere sustains tone and theme without lapsing into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor, shrinking island, and “sublittoral fringe” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a dock worker’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong physical and atmospheric anchor. The environmental turn—water glowing, revealing the island as a cage—recharges prior details and crucially shapes the final conceptual image. Weather and sea conditions (fog, tide, trench, waves) interact organically with events without bogging the pace. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactics in a practical sense, it deeply charges the stakes and closure image, which is appropriate for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, economical, and thematically integrated: turbines as “slow, indifferent gods,” the groaning farmhouse, and the brittle bouquet all mirror enforced and then remade silence. Environment actively shapes the emotional dynamics—Lena’s scream being “swallowed” by the turbines is a crucial closing image. Objects like the happiness tin and bouquet are rooted in place and recur with evolved meaning. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear, and there’s no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action—the humming quartz shapes her experience beat by beat, and the ice’s groan and fracture literalize the internal and societal shifts. Environmental details consistently mirror and modulate the internal stakes without feeling like decor (“the lake’s frozen surface…until you listened close enough to hear the water moving beneath” is particularly effective). The setting directly charges the final image (the lake answering, poets approaching) and feels inseparable from the story’s logic. There is minimal sense of a broader world beyond atrium + lake, but at this length that focus works.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, kiln, cracked vase, plants, and phoenix ash form a cohesive micro-world that’s sensorially rich without bloat. Details are consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility (texture and vibration over color), which sharpens specificity. The environment subtly charges and mirrors the stakes—heat and cracks, rebirth and ash, living plants and fragile glass—with the final image of the courtyard “blooming” tying it all together. The setting stops short of overtly constraining tactical choices in a concrete way, but it deeply charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: extinct instruments, the brass resonator etched with unheard frequencies, the warm power grid, the cavern-like room. Setting and objects aren’t backdrop; they actively shape possibilities (the resonator-lens interaction, the path of golden shadows, the final bell appearing in place of the lens). The micro-setting of lens, dish, and shadows evolves with the action and charges the final image. A slightly broader tactile or non-auditory sensory palette could deepen embodiment further, but what’s here is strong and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vivid and integrated: brass telescopes, cracked glass, dome, steps, clockwork—always filtered through Lena’s grief and craft. Setting repeatedly interfaces with action (where cranes are placed, where the box is hidden, where light enters) and charges the final images (curtains opening, sky like old silver, steps lined with cranes). It feels less like postcard backdrop and more like a character-shaped environment, though its constraints are emotional rather than physical.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the rain-beaded skylight, shuttered exchanges, protest graffiti, and stacked eviction notices all concretize the crypto-collapse world. The loft, tools (measuring tape, cards, candle), and urban remnants are consistently filtered through Elias’s symbolic gaze, tying environment to theme. Weather and skylight return in the final image, charging the last beat—"trace the distances between them"—with a clear sense of pattern-making projected onto the world. The only constraint is that, functionally, the loft and city rarely limit or alter tactics; they primarily shape texture and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive is vividly and economically rendered—cracked dome, rust-and-amber twilight, dust like “atoms of nostalgia”—and the bronze pagoda and saffron veil function as charged micro-settings. Environmental elements evolve with the action: hum to scream, trembling chamber, dust raining as the structure destabilizes. The setting meaningfully shapes stakes (knowledge as poison/cure, whispers that unravel minds) and charges the final images of the faded veil and sealed archive. While rich, the atmosphere never quite forces a specific tactical constraint beyond general danger, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating library, blooming books, and high-altitude clouds are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme and action. The setting constrains the story’s logic—the library as a repository for unbound hopes—and directly charges the final image of Liora becoming “part of the library” and the shadow binding to place. The river stone on the sill, the light blooming from pages, and the humming shelves all recur to frame the cost and the earned stasis. Environment is not postcard; it’s inseparable from the story’s premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The misty workshop under the stars is vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elias’s sensibility (herb smells, groaning beams, fogging glass). Setting details aren’t postcard-like: the terrarium, shed cicada shell, and herbs directly furnish the means of Lumen’s healing. The mist and stars recur as charged images, with the mist thinning and morning appearing at closure to mirror his internal shift without over-explicit symbolism. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, but it consistently shapes mood and method.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, dawn, frost, and courtyard flora are vividly and economically rendered, with details consistently filtered through Liora’s scar-and-wound sensibility. The environment is not mere backdrop: the frozen hourglass, groaning beams, and whispering ivy all constrain and mirror her understanding of time and injury, and the final quiet tower image charges the ending. World rules around plant telepathy and frozen time are internally consistent and taught through observation rather than exposition. This is just short of 9+ because the spatial reality of “tunneling through stone” remains more poetic than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The projection booth and storm are vividly rendered and tightly integrated: the reels, bulb, and humming machinery are not backdrop but the medium that literally stores and reveals the “letters.” Environmental details (ozone smell, thunder, dust replacing popcorn, the dying bulb) mirror and amplify her emotional state without feeling on-the-nose. Crucially, the booth and projector constrain tactics—she must work through film and light, and the final turn is enacted via the setting tool (switching the projector off). This meets the “object-as-setting charges the final image” test cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the aurora-lit archway, silver-veined stone, ozone and “remembered stardust,” and the well of liquid darkness all shape how Liora moves and what she can do. The astronomical instrument and the well function as micro-setting elements, directly constraining action (how she follows the star, how she unlocks the prison). World rules stay consistent—the arch as prison, the well as reservoir of ideas, the auroras as indicators of flux—and they culminate meaningfully when the arch dissolves into “silver motes.” A slight drawback is that the outer, mundane world remains mostly generic; almost all the specificity is concentrated in the liminal realm.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: “glowing dunes in bloom,” bioluminescent sand, the skeletal last rail line, and the dead-forest past all build a coherent, textured world. Environment participates in action—the dunes sigh and part to reveal the spark—and charges the final image (sand turning green, a real dawn), which reweights everything that came before. Detail remains selective and filtered; we never get museum-tour exposition, only lived-in, mythic-feeling glimpses.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “mechanical rainforest” is richly imagined and sensorially varied—ironwoods as cellos, copper ferns as glass, binary rustle, fractal spirals—and it’s consistently filtered through the philosopher’s altered perception. The setting does more than decorate: it models the mind’s frontier and supplies the governing metaphors for change (gears, hum, equations in branches). However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it shapes understanding more than tactics. The recurring gear-as-object and forest-as-engine images help charge the final tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridgeway, mist, vigil fires, and shoreline are vivid and consistently filtered through Liora’s perception, creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. The setting isn’t just decorative; it embodies the liminal choice—“where the land hesitated before becoming water”—and the vigil fires concretize the idea of staying at the threshold. The recurring shoreline sounds and twilight deepen tone and charge the final image of her staying put. The only thing keeping this shy of the highest band is that environment constrains mood and theme more than practical tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt fortress under snow is vivid and specific, with details like the wax-sealed fifth floor, the moat full of piano keys, and snow sliding off to reveal “the color of a bruise” all doing double duty for mood and theme. Setting actively shapes action: the forbidden floor, cracked sigil, and history of dismantled pianos inform the risk Elias takes. The environment also charges the final image—the fortress “answering” and the bruised cobalt emerging from snow—as more than mere backdrop. A touch more functional use of physical constraint in the climax (e.g., doors, distances) could push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ancient, time-lost library is richly realized and fully integrated: the folding of time, drifting constellations, and rune-veined scepter all constrain what can happen and where. Setting is filtered through Veythas’s long-lived, stone sensibility (“sound like shifting sand”) and evolves with the action—the shuddering shelves, splintering walls, and final sigh of completion. The environment directly shapes stakes (a place chosen by the pretender, where time and truth are manipulable) and charges the final inscription on the dais. This is very strong, just shy of flawless because the physical mechanics of time drift stay evocatively vague rather than fully leveraged as tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sea-level station is concrete and tactile—the tide gauges’ “clink-clank,” barnacled stone, bioluminescent-like lights—avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. Environmental elements constrain and charge choices: the monitoring tech surfaces the anomaly; the receding and then rising water compresses the window in which she can test the road. Recurring objects (the atlas page, sonar screen, road stones) are strongly tied to place and reappear to power the final images. World rules (post–fossil fuel, still-rising seas, vanishing routes) are sketched economically yet feel internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly and economically rendered—“rusted girders,” “cracked concrete,” margin-of-daylight light—and the bay’s physicality evolves as the metal wakes and ships lift. The stone circle and opera glasses function as charged environmental tools, shaping both tactics and the final image. Setting details are always filtered through Lena’s body and attention (bare feet, breath fogging), giving the world texture and bias. The final shadow stretching across the concrete elegantly recharges the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The volcanic hot springs, black sand, whisper-vines, and reconstructed valley are specific and sensorial, always filtered through Liora’s gardener consciousness. Setting meaningfully constrains and enables action: the springs and vines are the medium through which she unlocks the amber, and the grove and temple ruins become the canvas for the new order. Environmental details evolve with the plot (springs as cradle of glowing tendrils), charging the final image. World rules (plants speak, script as light-veins) feel internally consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The arboretum-on-a-cliff setting is vivid across senses (salt wind, foghorn ghosts, olive leaves, tide, fig trees) and consistently filtered through Lena’s attention. Environment is not decorative: the cypress roots mirror her desired rootedness, the cliff edge and tide echo precarious persistence, and the branch physically catches the photograph, forcing a charged misreading by the child. The final images—the cypress swaying, sea answering, and her returning to prune deadwood—are inseparable from this specific place. The setting clearly constrains and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse-library setting is vivid, textural, and omnipresent: salt, parchment, groaning shelves, the tower’s “breath” all filter through Elara’s eye and mood. Crucially, the environment constrains choice (collapsed stairs, walls pressing in) and charges the final image (lighthouse exhaling as she does). The forgotten library’s hunger and the false beam are not postcard garnish; they directly embody the story’s stakes around memory, lies, and unmaking. Description flirts with being dense, but it remains purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The wind-carved encampment, frozen gestures of the inhabitants, and the eclipse-hung atmosphere are vivid and integrated into the mood of temporal distortion. The micro-setting of ink, earth, and drone functions effectively, especially as the ink literally reveals symbols and thresholds. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it does shape perception and tone in a way that feels purposeful. The final return of wind and rain cues adds a subtle evolution of setting through the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The snow-muted, echoing library is vividly and economically rendered, with details like pneumatic tubes, frost-laced ledgers, and stained glass all filtered through Elara’s professional eye. The environment meaningfully charges the story’s sound/silence motif, culminating in “for the first time in years, the library *screamed*.” While the physical layout isn’t deeply choreographed, the setting’s sensory specificity and thematic integration are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass dome, desert roses, wrecked airship, and fallen tower are vividly realized and tightly tied to Liora’s perception and choices. The dome’s fissure and the sealed environment versus burning desert directly shape what’s possible, both practically and symbolically. Recurring objects (sandbag, knife, sapling) are integrated into the setting rather than floating props and help charge the final image. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains more thematically than through urgent on-page logistical dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, the forge-warm rail spike, the black star-swallowing water, and the restless constellations form a coherent, tactile environment that is inseparable from the story’s mechanics. Setting details aren’t postcard decoration: the humming soil, the tree where his daughter is buried, and the dock water all constrain or channel his choices and the cosmology. The rail spike and garden both return at the end charged with new meaning, and the “dark that didn’t reflect stars—only swallowed them” elegantly reweights the cosmic imagery. A hint more concrete spatial choreography around where the mouth opens relative to the tree could further sharpen the geography.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is vividly evoked—the glass dome, humming silence, acoustics, and the caretaker’s distant tea cup anchor mood and space. Details are filtered through Lydia’s sensibility, with celestial imagery echoing her preoccupation with orbits and regret. However, the environment rarely constrains her options; it’s more atmospheric than structurally necessary. Objects-as-setting (pen, plates, ledger) do more work in charging the ending than the observatory itself.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lab, wax cylinders, rusted speakers, and analog firmware form a vivid, coherent environment that feels tactile and conceptually unified. Objects-as-setting (amber, clock, tattoo, mosquito) are tightly integrated and directly charge the final image of the wings “singing.” World rules for sound, time, and memory are consistent enough to support the premise without clunky exposition. The setting could perhaps exert more explicit physical constraint on her choices, but as a micro-setting it’s doing substantial, purposeful work.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, mist, tiles, and village square are vivid, tactile, and tightly woven into action—the acoustics, whispering flake, and mandala void are not backdrop but functional machinery. The setting actively constrains and enables choices (he must go to the grotto to hear, the mist responds to his drawings, the square mural creeps toward bonfire ashes), and the final image of mist devouring the void-line is charged by everything established. World rules are consistent and learned through use, not exposition. It’s immersive and purposeful, fully meeting high-level expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    The plaza, shattered sky, and mosaic are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention, avoiding generic ruin imagery. The tesserae and cracks are not just background; they function as both map and medium for the magic, and then charge the final image when the cracks fill with gold. Sensory detail (smoke, charred cedar, ghost of rain) is selective and purposeful, aligning tone and theme. The environment genuinely constrains what is possible—this act can happen only in this ruined, remembering plaza.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard-maze is richly sensorial—“fruit that shimmered like bruised silver,” petals “like brittle applause”—and always filtered through Lydia’s stage-centric, synesthetic gaze. Crucially, the setting constrains and enables choices: the maze creates the encounter, the orchard “obeys” her and manifests futures, the path sealing is the story’s physical closure. The distant theater and ghost light charge the final image, tying environment directly to Lydia’s ongoing fate. Description is dense but purposeful rather than touristic, and it consistently supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The light-painting studio is vivid and tactile from the opening ozone-and-burnt-sugar smell to the fiber-optic brushes and custom rigs, and it functions as a tool-set rather than décor. The environment actively enables the climax: only in this studio, with these pigments and walls, can she “paint” a door that might also serve as a beacon for Mira. The recurring object-as-setting of the geode sliver integrates smoothly into that space and charges the final image once it’s dissolved into her skin. This is excellent, economy-driven worldbuilding that shapes options rather than pausing the story.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The caves and coastal environment are vividly realized through multi-sensory detail—salt, damp, bioluminescent lichen, calcite crunch, ozone—and consistently filtered through Lior’s professional and mystical lens. The setting is not mere backdrop: the breathing walls, pulsing lichen, and unstable “off-limits” networks actively shape what’s possible and charge the final communion. The elm leaf fossil and rain work as micro-setting elements that recur and meaningfully reweight the final image. The only ceiling here is that while the environment is deeply atmospheric, it constrains mood and perception more than it drives tactical choices under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, canyon, and iron-tasting well are vivid, sensorial, and tightly filtered through Elias’s profession and stakes; details like “walls veined with fossilized resin” and “the canyon’s teeth” feel lived-in rather than ornamental. Setting actively shapes options: the cliffs’ brittleness raises the danger of the hourglass shattering, the canyon wind provides the whispers, and the well is a specific, perilous site Elias must confront. The hourglass and button function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image (“The cliffs stood steady. For now.”). This is near top-tier atmospheric craft; the only thing keeping it just short of a 9-band is that the physical treachery of the cliffs and well is more declared than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: thawing earth, mist that “swallowed sound,” and Zephyr Bluff’s vantage all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details actively constrain and charge choices—she selects the bluff for its silence and concealment, and the snow/mist function as both cover and message medium. Seasonal detail (late winter tilting toward spring) interlocks with theme and returns at the end (“Spring was coming. And so, it seemed, was she.”). The final image of her footprints in melting snow and the abandoned pillbox makes the environment inseparable from the story’s emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, and groaning bridge are vivid and tightly integrated; they’re not wallpaper but the actual mechanism that governs when and how they cross. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the mist “shivering,” gutters marking time, current whispering against wheels—creating a coherent, almost tactile microclimate. The setting actively constrains choice (they must wait in the fog until the conditions of the promise are met) and charges the final image of the girl dissolving into “spindrift serenity.” World rules around fog and gutters stay consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The oasis, hives, kiln, smoke, and honeyed air are vivid, sensorial, and tightly bound to the potter’s perception; the environment never feels generic. The setting is not mere backdrop: the beekeeping ruins and their fractures in time are exactly why he comes here and why the bowl must be left here, charging the final image. World rules around “time thinning” and overlaps are sketched economically yet feel internally consistent. A bit of sensory lavishness skirts excess, but it remains purposeful and filtered through his craft and attention.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, fire escape, and moonlight are vivid and consistently filtered through Lena’s sensibility (“moonlight silvering the water like a blade,” thorns scattering light like fractured stars). The micro-setting constrains choice—this elevated, liminal perch is exactly where someone half-withdrawn, half-facing the world would live—and the environment’s hush and light pattern charge the final images. The recurring tools (fire escape, pots, gauge) all feel tactile and lived-in rather than touristic. The setting never drops into postcard mode; it’s inseparable from mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal library above the clouds is vivid and specific—floating shelves moving with the tide, mist-damp pages, the stone circle, the jewel-box exterior image. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tide and hum govern when the translator’s hour occurs, while the library’s sealed nature embodies Lior’s isolation and makes the doors’ opening meaningful. The brass sundial and stone circle function as environment-linked tools that shape action at the climax. Sensory choices (cloud-rhythm, hum like grinding teeth, smells of wet feathers/gunpowder/rain) all support tone and stakes without lapsing into travelogue.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, wet walkway, and glass orbs are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility; details like “boots sinking slightly into the damp wood” and domes “glistening with residual mist” are specific and atmospheric. Recurring environmental elements—the pond’s ripples, orbs catching light, thrush-shadow—charge the final images thematically. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it deeply colors perception and meaning. World rules (monks, installation) feel coherent without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The basement radio station, old physics hall, and campus above are vividly evoked and feel lived-in, with details like the "building’s bones" shivering and charts fluttering under the ventilation. The environment materially enables the plot (old unlocked station, functional equipment) and allows her to affect the whole campus. Sensory detail leans visual and auditory in a way that suits the subject matter without becoming touristic. Setting does not fully corner her choices, but it meaningfully frames and charges them.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and integrated: the weeping stone, writhing roots, copper-and-ink air, and the black oak table all feel lived-in and specific rather than decorative. Environment and tools constrain choices—the shaft and tightness activate his claustrophobia, the table and slab dictate what he can do, and the roots and shifting walls literalize the city’s mutiny. The starlit nexus and falling snow in the final image reweight the whole piece, grounding the conceptual rebellion in a tangible world. Description occasionally edges toward lush, but it always serves atmosphere and stakes rather than stalling them.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry-in-mist is vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s tactile, sound-focused perception, avoiding generic atmosphere. The history of the place (ballroom → flood → wound) deepens mood and theme without clumsy exposition. The environment and objects—slick steps, mist, drain, lance, ribbon—act as more than backdrop, becoming the medium for the echo and charging the final departure. While the setting doesn’t drastically constrain physical options, it strongly shapes the story’s emotional and conceptual field.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The experimental weather station, the howling jet stream, the observation deck glass, and the furnace are all concrete and repeatedly used, not just scenic. Weather and environment constrain choices (Elias shouldn’t be outside; alarms, pressure drops, shattering glass) and charge the final “sky as a door” image. Professional detail is light but plausible and filtered through Elias’s map-obsessed lens. The Maw itself functions as both setting and looming entity, deepening atmosphere without breaking the rules the story teaches.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain scenic pullout is vividly rendered (ozone, burnt sugar, whispering pines) and functions as an active threshold rather than a backdrop. Environmental elements—guardrail, road, storm-scented air—literally transform into the portal and then seal behind him, directly constraining choice. The recurring sensory palette (ozone, burnt sugar, wind) ties the beginning and ending atmospheres together. Setting is tightly integrated with theme and closure without lapsing into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned circus train is memorably concrete—rust, greasepaint, sagging cars, warped lion cage—and every car he enters adds texture that mirrors his internal state. The tech-campus graveyard and highway hum extend setting outward in a way that reinforces theme without feeling like a tour. The environment charges the final image (the train settling deeper, the dusk, the highway) but doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices in the scene. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are excellent, with just a hair less functional pressure than the very best work.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, telescope, and variable stars are vivid and functional—tools that directly enable the core act of “witnessing” and the climactic thread of light. The temple appearing as a lattice of light rather than stone elegantly yokes setting to theme, and the daylily telegram/ledger operate as meaningful micro-settings/objects. Environmental details consistently pass through Elias’s professional gaze, reinforcing his character rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The setting actively charges the final images (dawn, steady stars, single daylily) rather than sitting as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cursed lake and remembering orchard are vivid, specific, and sensorially rich (black still water, rotting blossoms, whispering fruit) while always filtered through Eldrin’s wary perspective. Environment constrains choices—he works at the lake’s edge, plants the seed where the pull and expanding circles are strongest, and the lake’s rules about “keeping” souls define the conflict. Recurring elements (lake, orchard, cold, key warmth) clearly charge the final image of the humming lake and warm key. Weather and terrain register as lived pressures rather than postcard details.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt glade, shifting hedge-maze, ancient willow, and root bridge are vividly rendered and filtered through Liora’s sensibility, giving the world a tactile, mythic specificity. The maze’s behavior and the root-bridge materially constrain and enable her actions, not just decorate the scene, and the willow/glade frame both opening and closure. Sensory details (damp earth, crushed violets, bruised sky) are purposeful and harmonize with the tone. The final silver leaf in the same setting nicely charges the last image, though one more moment where the environment forces a concrete trade-off could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard—roots threading bones, fruit like forgiveness, blossoms drinking from pelvis hollows—is vivid, specific, and integrated with the rules of bartered destinies. Setting is never postcard; the environment literally eats what’s traded and gives back altered options, directly constraining the ritual. The half-lit corridors and damp earth tone the mood and charge the final departure into daylight. Nearly everything meaningful in the story is inseparable from this place, which strongly charges the final image of her walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the smell of “old coffee and damp cardboard,” the shaking trailer, and the quarry blasts as ghostly drum machines all mirror and charge Liam’s interior state. The quarry as a “wound in the earth that had no use for applause” powerfully underwrites the theme and final image. Environmental details are consistently filtered through his musician/appraiser sensibility (dust as crowd lighters, gravel like static), and the recurring contrast between enclosed trailer and open road shapes his choice. The world feels specific without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Sky Arbor is vivid, strange, and integrated: inverted ironwood, magnetic pull, weeping luminous sap, and the humming iron branch all shape both imagery and what Elias can do (floating tablet, tools tugged, climb, planting site). Environmental rules are consistent and discovered through use rather than exposition, and the Arbor’s crown is the literal and conceptual site of transition. The setting also charges the final image: “The Arbor’s hum followed him… as he began to translate the silence between the lines,” tying world-physics, vocation, and theme. Minor deduction only because, while beautifully rendered, the environment seldom constrains his tactics beyond providing the necessary locus for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal atrium, glass ceiling, brackish channels, and tide that erases footprints create a vivid, specific environment filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard-only; tools like the crucible and objects like the creel and spoon are embedded in the space and return to charge the final image. World rules (lunar pull, vanished tomorrow, paradox-smelting) are consistent enough to feel coherent in this compressed length. The water, glass, and light directly frame closure via the spoon’s reflection, satisfying the object-as-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is striking and specific: crystal-veined caves that “acquire abandoned hopes” and a decaying bunker frame both atmosphere and stakes. Environmental elements are not mere backdrop; the crystals’ pulsing, the shells in silt, and the bunker doors at the end all shape perception, choice, and the final imagery. The “womb” reframe of the bunker and the sky streaked with pearl-light charge the ending image without feeling like generic symbolism. Sensory detail is mostly visual and tactile but well-chosen and consistently filtered through the inspector’s mission and growing awe.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the ivy-laden, abandoned station, ghost-train tracks, and the dry Blackthorn bed mirror and pressure Elias’s inner drought. Key objects (map, bellows, graffiti, ivy) are inextricable from place and recur to charge the final movements (“the ivy parted for him,” the empty riverbed under the bruised sky). Environment constrains options in subtle but real ways—there is literally no water left, only memory—and that lack shapes his tactics (listening instead of playing, walking a bed that used to be dangerous). A slight reason for not going higher is that the physical journey itself could carry a touch more environmental friction or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The misty, glowing library is vividly realized and more than backdrop: its imminent dissolution under the pressure of the second letter’s posting constrains time and forces choices. Details like shelves labeled “Epistles Never Sent” and parchment-over-bone books integrate setting with premise rather than feeling ornamental. The environment directly drives her sprint for the exit and charges the sense that this access to the unsaid is rare and costly. The final return of mist and path in the waking world echoes and reweights the opening image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet observatory, dual moons, wisteria, and gardens are sensually vivid and tightly bound to character perception and stakes. Environment actively shapes the outcome: the garden is the medium for propagation, the glass wall and roof become thresholds the ice-vines pierce, and the observatory’s velvet and violet palette charge the final image. World rules (telepathic plants, ice crystal instruments) are taught economically through action rather than exposition. This is high-level setting work that’s both atmospheric and functional without lapsing into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are richly specific (“petrified mist and the bones of forgotten winds”) and filtered through Liora’s sensibility. Crucially, the aurora’s static isn’t just backdrop; it’s a code she reads and the very bridge that enables the encounter, and it returns in the final “slow and endless exhale” to charge the closure. Sensory emphasis is mostly visual and conceptual but well-chosen and coherent with the tone. The setting feels integral to premise and ending, not a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, fig tree, bioluminescent moss, and silver fruit are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with character and theme, never feeling like postcard description. Environment shapes action—she must climb, kneel, press the pin into soil; the grotto’s response and the altered fig tree directly produce the story’s magical and emotional outcomes. The use of recurring objects as micro-setting (hairpin, scallops) further charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, sea, wind, and chimes are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with theme and action—e.g., the tide revealing the cloak, the beam shifting from slice to pulse. Details feel filtered through a professional keeper’s eye but repurposed to his moral crisis. Environmental elements also charge the final image (wavering beam, sighing chimes) in a concrete, memorable way. The setting shapes mood and symbolism more than hard constraints on what he can or cannot do, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is unusually vivid and integral: the floating rock, magnetic grotto, lodestone veins, starlight fissures, and the black pond all shape what’s possible (weightlessness, reverse aging, levitation, the teaching method). The pond and its rings recur as an object-as-setting that directly charges the final image. Details are sensorial and selective (damp earth, crushed sage, overripe plums), always filtered through Elias’s attention. The only thing keeping this from a 9+ is that the environment constrains mood and metaphysics more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of bone towers and swallowed echoes is vivid, specific, and constantly active: humming spires, twisted echoes, wind and dust all shape what is possible and how danger operates. The environment meaningfully constrains tactics—stillness and sound become survival tools, and the final silence of the canyon is a charged reversal of the opening premise of “endless echoes.” The arrowhead functions as a micro-setting tool, binding pulse and reshaping how the environment responds. It’s richly atmospheric and tightly integrated, just shy of absolute top-tier only because we don’t see the physical constraints tested under more varied tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spire, storm sky, and ice are vivid and immediately anchor us; the pocket garden’s impossible summer and “flowers bloomed in colors that had no name” deepen the atmosphere and echo Marlin’s way of seeing. Setting is filtered through his priorities (the Conservatory, the engines of creation, the frostbloom arch), and the candle/keystone function as micro-settings that charge the final image. The environment constrains action modestly (treacherous climb, isolation of the spire) but more importantly shapes meaning and tone than tactical decisions. World rules (automation of creativity, arcane exam culture) are sketched with selective, effective detail rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is a major strength: the salt-crusted pier, half-submerged Marigold, drowned library, and lantern festival are vividly rendered with strong sensory cues and a clear spatial logic. Environment actively shapes choices—the snagged lantern draws him to the wreck; the precarious, groaning hull and submerged shelves make the library feel like a liminal, costly space. Objects-as-setting (lamplighter’s boots, lantern, tinderbox, key, lectern) are integrated into action rather than merely displayed. The final return to pier and waves reuses the setting to charge the new perception of sound, giving the environment a clear role in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ambered observatory, dying stars, and glass walls are vivid and tonally apt, and the environment feels like a pressure cooker at the lip of annihilation. The “amber walls vibrate like a struck bell” as the coins harmonize is an excellent moment of setting interacting with action and choice. The reset to “trapped dawn, not dusk” charges the final image and clearly reweights the earlier spatial anchors. The only thing holding this back from the very top tier is that the setting constrains mood and symbolism more than it concretely limits or enables specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory at dusk is vividly rendered and functionally integrated: cracked dome, broken lenses, and the scattered light are not just mood but the literal mechanism for crystallizing fear. The atlas, telescope, and dome evolve with events—the dome cracks open as the named monsters rise, directly charging the final images of stars and departing creatures. Sensory detail is selective and aligned with the reaper’s focus on light, ink, and bone. The only small gap keeping this from the very top tier is that beyond enabling the ritual, the environment doesn’t further constrain tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sapphire viaduct, bay, dawn light, and dripping water are vivid and tightly integrated, not just scenic; the environment literally provides the “language” Elias decodes. The bell and viaduct function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image (“the viaduct sang back”) and directly shape his method. Sensory specificity is strong and consistent, especially visual and tactile, with water and stone mirroring the world’s “imbalance.” A slight bias toward the visual over other senses keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting—ridgeway, steeple, submerged town, Hollow Lane sign—is vivid and tightly integrated, with water level, time of day, and weather all feeding atmosphere and meaning. Details like “the church steeple broke the surface like a broken finger” and the liqueur’s sapphire hue echo and charge the reservoir as both grave and mirror. The environment doesn’t greatly constrain tactical options, but the resurfacing rooftops and street sign do shape what he can perceive and thereby what he can release. Recurring objects (bottle, wind chime, photographs) are spatially coherent and carry accrued weight into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and specific—the hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and later glass valley all feel tactile and visually fresh. Environmental details are tightly tied to theme and emotion (waterfall’s fractured light mirroring her fractured epistemology; orchard exhaling as the ritual succeeds). The door of blue flame and glass trees charge the final image meaningfully. The world’s rules are intentionally fuzzy but internally consistent; the only limitation is that the setting rarely constrains her tactics beyond serving as a symbolic threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds, bioluminescent spores, and skeletal city glow are vivid, coherent, and strongly filtered through Elara’s priorities (height, isolation, fragility). Environment and objects (the arbor, spores, city’s empty streets) all echo the themes of suspended catastrophe and unseen labor. The arbor’s sway and height concretely shape the action choice to parachute and the final image (“an arbor would sway, its leaves whispering to no one at all”) carries charged resonance. This is lush but controlled description that materially supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating rock dojo above a storm-wracked valley is a striking, specific setting that’s woven throughout, not just front-loaded. Weather and environment interact with the stakes—the storm walk emphasizes Veyra’s commitment, the storm breaking and dojo rising mark the shift in history and self. The brains in jars function as powerful micro-setting objects, both constraining and enabling the choice. A minor limitation is that the broader world’s mechanics (how a dojo halts timeline edits) stay abstract, though at this length the focus on immediate physical and atmospheric detail mostly compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the brook, willows, and liminal edge of town infuse nearly every beat and culminate in the final gathering by the water and corpse flower. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a designer of thresholds, which gives the space specificity and thematic charge. The brook and willows genuinely constrain choices (where to plant the seed, where everyone waits). A slight cap comes from the fact that, beyond mood and that planting choice, the physical layout doesn’t significantly complicate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel as echo chamber is vividly rendered and functionally crucial: its acoustics enable the distorted laughter and justify why Elias can operate unseen yet influential. The interplay between below (tunnel, blower, damp air) and above (household, floorboards, golden light) gives spatial and emotional orientation throughout. Recurring objects—the hourglass, pull cord, leaf—serve as micro-settings that charge the final images rather than as decorative motifs. The environment constrains his tactics (he can only influence via sound) and inflects the theme without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen garden, mist, skeletal trees, and breathing page are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Lyssa’s perception. Setting and objects (garden, library ruins, pendant, mist) meaningfully charge the final image of “the other side of light” and the unraveling world. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it mirrors and pressures her liminal state and the thinning veil. The only minor ceiling is that the garden itself doesn’t much constrain tactical options, functioning more as psychic atmosphere than physical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember nexus, molten copper, unnatural cold, and glass-petal garden create a vivid, specific environment consistently filtered through an alchemist’s sensibility. Setting is not decorative; the nexus and heartstone are functional constraints—this experiment can *only* happen here, in this way—and the crozier-as-tool fuses with place. Environmental transformations (embers shifting color, frozen bloom, glass garden) evolve causally with events and charge the final image. The piece hits the “object/setting charging the ending” test squarely.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned radio tower city over the gorge is vivid, specific, and consistently exploited: she climbs it, the dish focuses the act, the gorge amplifies the signal, and the statue at the base physically redirects the fragment. The environment also charges the final beat, as the gorge and towers become instruments in the cosmic “tuning,” and the jump only makes sense because of this geography. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility (“drunken sentinels,” wires as a “dying symphony”) so atmosphere and world-building feel of a piece. The setting actively shapes action and the final image rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The spectral grotto, bioluminescent algae, and pulsing star-ceiling are richly drawn and tightly integrated with the mechanics of travel: the changing constellations are literally the navigation system. Environmental shifts—the grotto collapsing the route, the water turning to liquid silver, the entrance sealing—directly constrain options and charge the climax. This is a deeply atmospheric, functional setting that shapes both stakes and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, precise, and integral: beeswax and old paper, impossible geometries, the Möbius Mirror, and the humming void all feel lived-in and purposeful. The gallery’s logic (optical illusions as “rational enchantment”) shapes what is possible and directly hosts the climax. The final reversion—gallery as “just a room” after the illusions resolve—reweights everything we’ve seen and charges the last image. It’s hard to imagine the story stripped from this specific environment without losing its core effect.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The benthic setting is vivid and integrated: crushing dark, bioluminescent fungi, the Obsidian Spire, and pressure-adapted bodies all color how navigation and “looking up” work. The chain functions as a tool-in-setting that physically interacts with stone, light, and current, and returns in the final image charged with new meaning. Environmental constraints (depth, darkness, elders’ reliance on vents and charts) are tightly tied to the thematic question of where to look for orientation. The atmosphere of submerged awe is consistent and feels inseparable from the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass dome, iron-tinged air, and age-silvered bench are vivid and tightly selected, establishing mood without bloated exposition. Setting details are consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory attention (smell of pennies on corpse’s eyes, damp stone) and match the haunting premise. The hearing aid, glove, and photograph function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and the story’s rules of lingering echoes. The environment mostly frames and mirrors inner stakes rather than constraining tactics, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drowned research facility, tide, and undersea cables are vividly and economically rendered, with details like the rusted ladder, collapsed corridors, and “crashing hush” of the other side creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment meaningfully constrains choice: his window is bound to the tide and phase seam, and the weight of earth and water above him informs his movements. The setting also charges the final images (tide swallowing the shore, the facility “breathing,” cables that “remember”). It falls just short of the very top tier because the physical choreography of risk inside the altered facility remains fairly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The opal observatory under snow, auroras like a “dying heartbeat,” and the frost-laced window are vivid and thematically keyed to fragility and signal/noise. Setting is consistently filtered through Lena’s concerns (heartbeat, static, archives) rather than feeling like a neutral backdrop. However, the environment mainly charges mood and metaphor; it rarely constrains action or tactics beyond providing the obvious tools (radio, servers). This keeps the atmosphere strong but stops short of fully inextricable setting-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canyon of endless echoes, bone towers, and flock of starlings form an integrated, tactile environment that constantly interacts with action (towers tremor, then sing; starlings reconfigure with her breath). Setting is not postcard—its rules govern tactics and stakes: echoes can be harnessed, the canyon “inhales,” the towers remember. The final images (bone towers humming, starlings still flying, diamond in dust) are charged by all the prior environmental work. It fully meets the 9+ gate: recurring objects and landscape decisively charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underground garden is richly sensory—sage, bioluminescent mushrooms, humming dirt—and consistently integrated into action (arrowhead unearthed, vines seizing him, phone half-buried, notebook sprouting flowers). Environment is not mere backdrop; it is the operative force that swallows Elias and embodies the “harmony untamed,” charging the final images of roots, static, and blooming arrowhead. The aboveground pines and moving stars widen the frame without diluting focus. The setting’s rules feel internally consistent in a weird-fiction register.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard’s brass-geared trees, patrolling statues, and sky-bridge form a vivid, integrated environment that both pressures and enables action. The setting’s rules stay consistent (mechanical rhythm choking song; organic life returning once that rhythm is disrupted) and evolve in step with the conflict. Key objects (oldest tree, locust shell, sky-bridge) charge the final images without feeling like mere décor. A slight reason this stays shy of a 9 is that physical constraints never strongly limit her tactics beyond “play from above, then step down.”

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vividly realized and purposeful: the disputed strip, cobalt arcade, drone-patrolled median, and “haunted” post office all constrain tactics and channel the action. World rules—drone patrol cycles, blind alleys, places drones avoid—are shown through movement and choice rather than explained. The storm’s sensory expansion (thunder, smell of rain on hot asphalt) fuses environment with emotional state in a way that charges the middle and ending images. The piece balances evocative detail with forward motion, with almost no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly, economically rendered—the rusted wagons, nets, wind chime, and mirrors all feel tactile and lived-in. The environment meaningfully shapes the story’s magic (impossible car, funhouse mirrors that “expand,” the carousel horse as working surface), and recurring objects like the halo fragment and chime charge the final image. The circus ruin atmosphere supports theme without feeling like a generic spooky backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “scientific poetry library” is vivid, original, and omnipresent—hyperbolic tessellations, titles like *The Topology of Longing*, and the dust-mote atmosphere all feel both specific and thematically tuned. Environment actively shapes events: he uses particular books to anchor the scarf, the restricted section defines risk and access, and the transformed air/pages forge the story’s final cadence. The scarf’s dissolution into carpet, grout, and wood at the end is an excellent object-as-setting move that charges the final image. A hair more sensory range beyond the visual and conceptual (e.g., sound/texture under strain) could lift this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly realized—the whispering archipelago, black sand, saltwind, ozone, and the library’s humming shelves—and it’s filtered through her professional and artistic eye. Environment constrains action: she must work at dawn with the “cipher” of sunrise and the sea as both medium and threat (the tide erasing the watercolor footstep). The archipelago’s liminal quality mirrors the dream’s fugitive state without becoming heavy-handed symbol. The recurring palette, sand, and sea images charge the final dew-filled palette on her nightstand with concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nexus shop under starlight, lamplight sliver, ozone-and-parchment atmosphere, and the skylight star all create a vivid, coherent environment. Details are filtered through the locksmith’s sensibility in a way that supports tone and theme rather than feeling touristic. The setting inflects choices a bit (the first star literally cues her method) but mostly works texturally rather than as a hard constraint. Overall, strong, economical atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elias’s professional gaze (“glass bones and iron ribs,” “drowned leviathan”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the wreck ring evidences the long pattern of trades, the submerged pedestal physically anchors the discovery, and the broken/reknitting constellations merge environment with cosmology at the end. The space does not constrain tactical movement in a granular way, but it absolutely charges the final image and underwrites the story’s mood and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten library is vividly realized and functions as more than backdrop: its architecture and “angles Elspeth had spent decades perfecting” literally restrain the shadow, and its founding principle (“reversible exile”) is thematically and mechanically central. The lone window and trapped shadow, plus the bleed of sound from the playground, maintain a pressure between inside and outside that charges the closing image. Detail is selective and filtered through Elspeth’s professional, almost ritualistic perception. This is near top-tier micro-setting work for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is lushly realized—the waterfall-veil, parapet, and layered orchards—and always filtered through Elias’s craft, so the environment feels lived-in rather than decorative. The waterfall and parapet materially enable the world-crossing and charge the final sense that “the waterfall laughed” as a participant rather than backdrop. Spatial and sensory choreography remain clear, with recurring objects (trees, apples, seed) functioning as micro-settings that shape action. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top is that the physical environment rarely constrains choices; it’s more enabler and chorus than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, harbor, and shattered prisms create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral to the piece’s mood. The prisms and light are not mere backdrop; their trembling and eventual shattering mirror and charge the release of the spirits. The harbor and silvered water extend the consequence into the town with concrete, sensory implications (doors unlatched, salt-fogged mirrors). The setting doesn’t quite constrain tactics, but it strongly charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: damp stone, rain-scoured frescoes, and the henge’s acoustic properties all feed the central idea of silence as something shaped and heard. Details are filtered through Elara’s professional sensibility (sound curving around pillars, frescoes rippling like water), which grounds the world. The environment constrains choice—the vault’s silence and the henge’s hum are the only “tools” she can truly use—and it charges the final image of her stepping into the rain with the hum in her ribs. Rain and vault recur meaningfully from first line to last, giving the world a strong, unified presence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drowned library, warped mahogany, pulpy books, and bioluminescent fish create a striking, coherent environment filtered through a professional, haunted gaze. The snow globe, as micro-setting/object, strongly charges the final image and underpins the story’s physics-of-letting-go motif. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics (she is relatively free to move), but it profoundly shapes what she can discover and how she reinterprets Amelia’s pursuit, which is appropriate for this lyric-accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The misty courtyard above clouds, slick cobblestones, and dying lanterns create a vivid, coherent environment that matches the story’s liminal stakes. The courtyard and its lanterns are not mere backdrop; they house the ghost, register its presence, and react to its dispersal, while the bolt plate is a charged object that shapes the final act. Sensory specificity (ozone, wet silk air, parchment) is purposeful rather than touristic. The world’s “forgotten server room” metaphor hints at broader rules without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the icebound spire, observatory, frozen gardens, glass domes, and airship wreckage all feel tactile and visually fresh. Crucially, the environment and recurring objects (ice, light, goggles, height) explicitly charge the final image where the ice “burned” and the spire becomes a lens; the setting is inseparable from the thematic turn. Details are consistently filtered through Liora’s perceptions and history, avoiding mere postcard description. Weather, height, and cold all subtly constrain choices and perception, qualifying strongly for the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sky gondola, upper currents, and city below are vivid and consistently filtered through a meteorologist’s sensibility, with clouds and light doing heavy atmospheric work. The brass telescope and the luminous string function as micro-setting objects that recur and are crucial to the final image. Sensory detail focuses on sight and touch in a way that fits the calm, suspended mood, and the “dusty starlight” motif helps anchor tone. The only ceiling here is that the physical environment rarely constrains tactical choices; it’s more lyrical backdrop than a force that alters what he can do.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oak-library setting is vivid, sensorially rich (sap, mildew, groaning wood) and consistently filtered through her tactile, craft-focused perception. The environment constrains and shapes action: the hollow’s architecture dictates where glass and light can go, and demolition/fire determine the stakes. Recurring objects-as-setting (coin, tools, glass, ash) charge the final images of embers, warped coin, and blank page. A tiny bit more spatial specificity during the ceiling’s collapse could further heighten physical consequence, but current clarity and atmosphere are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The antique airship, brass portholes, and looping skies are vivid and consistently filtered through Liora’s map-obsessed gaze, with strong images like “clouds curled like ink on old parchment.” The hopscotch board and stranded light meaningfully function as micro-setting, constraining tactics and enabling the solution. Starlings and sky imagery return at the end to charge the final image (“no longer a cage, but a guide”) in a way that feels earned rather than ornamental. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint from the airship’s failing systems could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen library, Hall of Whispers/Mirrors, and water-mirror are vivid, specific, and continuously integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment is not merely ornamental: the hall being a literal clock, the ice, mirrors, and suspended water all shape what she can do and how time is imagined, and the final image of “mirrors wept silver” charges the closure. Sensory detail, especially visual and tactile, is rich but purposeful, anchored in her specialized perception as a locksmith and mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard planet and arches are vividly realized—“fruit pulsed with starlight,” “ribs of a god”—and integrated into action (arches tremble at the bell, the soil hums with old explosions). The butterfly garden and watering bell are concrete, memorable anchors that recur and charge the final image. Environment isn’t mere backdrop; the war-scarred soil and responsive arches shape what’s possible and what healing means. One could push the physical constraints of the arches/planet further into the characters’ tactical choices, but what’s here is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lighthouse, sea, and clock form a unified, tactile environment that is inseparable from the premise (“pane of hush,” “salt-spit of waves that never quite broke”). Setting constraints and charges choice: Elias is alone on the edge of the world, inside the mechanism whose behavior he must change. The final images—beam flaring inward, tide coming in, lighthouse keeping its secret—directly carry the closure. Details are selective, not cluttered, and consistently filtered through the job and the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: cursed violet fruit that steals memory, brass birds with glass eyes, frost that locks their joints, cliffside crevice, and the mechanical labyrinth system all shape tactics and possibilities. Time and weather (night frost) and geography (cliffside patrol versus hidden descent) directly constrain choices, e.g., why the crevice matters and why birds fall still at the end. Details are economical but textured, filtered through Liora’s long familiarity rather than tourist cataloging. The final images—frost silvering wood and fruit, birds frozen, traveler walking free below—are strongly charged by earlier environmental rules.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ravine, braided river, and foam patterns are vivid, specific, and fully integrated with Elias’s perceptual biases as an engineer/chemist. Setting is not mere backdrop: the braiding and convergence directly shape his realization about separation and his physical act of placing the chrysalis where the streams meet. Environmental detail evolves with his emotional state, culminating in him wading deeper toward the convergence. This is near exemplary, missing only a slight sense of environmental risk or constraint beyond symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass orchard library above the clouds is vivid and specific, with recurring details—crystalline branches, bottled moonlight, quartz counter, slates—that are sensorially rich and clearly filtered through Liora’s attention. Setting is not just backdrop; the library “leaning in to hear,” branches chiming, and clouds as “restless pages” all charge the core metaphor of stories-as-fruit and silence-as-soil. Environmental details evolve with the action (moonlight flaring during the incising, the library feeling “different now”) and directly support the ending’s tone. This is the piece’s standout strength and reads fully integrated rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and thematically integrated: wet stone, brine, fossilized grief, and kitchen scents all filter through Elias’s professional and emotional biases. The coral pavilion functions almost as a character and clearly constrains action—it is the only place to offload remorse. Environmental details (rain-slick fortress, dunes, tidal pools) consistently mirror and charge the internal stakes without feeling ornamental. The final contrast between buried pavilion and waking fortress leverages setting to underline the hidden cost beneath ordinary life.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The astronomical clock, grain elevator, and sensory details (“scent of crushed grain and distant rain”) create a rich, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly braided with theme. The clock tower and weight function as a micro-setting that directly shapes the central confrontation and charges the final images (the polished weight, the chiming clock with laughter). The only thing holding this just below the highest band is that the environment constrains emotion and symbolism more than it constrains concrete options under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon, moonlight, rust, and fractured “ribs” image create a strong, specific atmosphere that’s tightly braided with theme. The mirror-object functions as micro-setting and is beautifully integrated, evolving from abandoned instrument to charged tool and then companion at the end. Environmental details feel filtered through Lena’s technical and lyrical sensibilities rather than tourist description. The setting charges the final image more than it constrains tactical options, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, quartz “teeth,” inverted gravity, and glass-shelved chamber are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Lysara’s sensibility. Environmental rules (gravity inversion, one-hour window, threshold of bioluminescent mushrooms) are consistent and materially affect what can happen. Setting is not postcard: the grotto’s constraints and the inversion snap directly dictate the story’s central loss. The final plan to plant the seed in the grotto’s dark, where mist “feeds it secrets,” charges the place as an ongoing, living pressure rather than a spent backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The siskin alder grove, the needle-bed, the old oak sculpture, and the insulator are vividly rendered and always filtered through Elias’s acoustic awareness. Environment and objects are not decorative: the grove “listens,” the birds react, and the insulator’s changing state (warming, weeping) directly charges the final image. The setting feels lived-in and rule-consistent, with the world’s silence implied by the dead wires. Atmosphere and setting deeply support theme and closure without lapsing into static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “magnetic nexus,” “cracked earth where the old covenant had once bound the land,” and twilight all create a charged threshold atmosphere tied to the story’s stakes. The environment actively participates—the hum, tremors, and magnetic field that realigns the pieces give the world rules that shape action and the climactic image. The recurring worry stone functions as a micro-setting object, grounding his interiority and then charging the closing gesture when he passes it to the girl. The final stilling of the nexus and appearance of stars provide a clear before/after that’s inseparable from this specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The beeswax-and-copper workshop, grimy window, and fireworks-lit sky create a vivid, lived-in atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Elias’s sensory priorities (sound and its absence). The fireworks and approaching noise actively shape his options, forcing him to work before quiet is lost, and the guild ruins become a charged site for his new beginning. Tools and environment (device, copper plate, clasp, ruined guild) remain consistent and reappear to charge the final images. Setting is integral without tipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The treetop village, the tide’s "thought," and the olfactory-saturated atmosphere are vivid and integrated into Liora’s perception, not just postcard dressing. Setting meaningfully charges the premise—the constant sway vs desired serenity—and returns in the final image with the corpse-flower bridge and the unlocked vault. Environmental elements like the suspended walkways and tides are more metaphorical constraints than concrete tactical ones, but they feel coherent and lived-in. The world rules (vault, moon’s third face, tide-linked thought) are consistent and introduced through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and singular: golden groves, inverted gravity, floating arches, sap-bleeding stone, and bioluminescent growth-moss all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental rules (inversion hour, upward river, arches as mouths) are learned through her actions and directly constrain choices. The orchard-planet and arches meaningfully charge the final image—she heads for the core to plant the sapling, with arches humming in chorus. World detail is rich without becoming a static tour, and it consistently supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly rendered and constantly integrated into action: funnels of wind, rusted grates, tight squeezes between stacks, and the clearing with harnesses all shape what Veyra can do. Tools (anemometer, flare) and objects (map, patch) function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the final images. Weather and silence aren’t generic; they feel concrete and hostile, with the wind behaving like a “living thing” that interacts meaningfully with the geometry. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9+ band is that, while excellent, the environmental constraints remain within familiar thriller parameters rather than revealing an entirely new spatial logic at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and amber sheet form a highly specific, integrated environment; details like “frozen rivers that hummed” and the cavern’s shifting breath are vivid and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensory bias. The setting is not mere backdrop: the ice groans and thaws, the cavern’s mouth frames the aurora, and by the end the walls become “gateways,” directly charging the final image. World rules about sound-becoming-light and sculpted hush are coherent enough for this lyric mode and evolve as she acts. A slight limit is that the environment rarely boxes her in or forces tactical adaptation beyond enabling her ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Thunder-Echo Range, the frost-bitten pass, the fissure, and the charged quiet generate a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s contemplative pressure. The flute and driftwood operate as micro-setting elements that anchor action and also charge the final image (flute left behind, driftwood realigning and later guiding the next keeper). Weather and terrain don’t heavily constrain tactics beyond mood—they shape perception more than physical options. Even so, the environment feels specific and lived-in rather than generic fantasy mountains.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The workshop, ink, topaz dust, and letterpress are vivid, tactile, and constantly in play, not just backdrop. The halo fragment as tool/mirror and the vanishing/returning stars bind micro-setting and cosmos, directly charging the final image of the stars “speaking back.” Environmental elements (press, dust, skylight) evolve with events—the workshop trembles, dust rains, the fragment levitates—so the setting feels dynamically entangled with the arc. This integration is excellent, though there’s minimal sense of a broader social or physical world beyond this chamber and the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, abyss, and “fade where memory dissolved into myth” are vivid and tightly integrated; the environment isn’t backdrop but the terrain of the story’s metaphysics. The ridgeway and abyss directly constrain choice (the crumbling path, need for a bridge, the temptation/possibility of stepping into the fade). Recurring objects as micro-setting—the pendant, seed pods, dragonfly—are embedded in the world’s logic and recharged at the end. The final images (bridge, germinating seed at the world’s edge, the brightening aurora) are inseparable from the setting and carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost aren’t just decorative; they create a liminal, acoustically “still” environment that makes his method plausible and frames the final act of hurling the prism into the arbor’s “heart.” The recurring physical details (crystalline branches, frost patterns, mist) evolve with the plot—frost moving, then melting; branches refracting and “shattering” light—so the setting effectively charges the closure image. The environment constrains tactics (this is specifically where he must come, and where the prism can be “broken” in a meaningful way). It’s richly imagined without bogging the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vividly rendered and recur as active agents—the apple tree branch as the hanging point, the roots that claim her, the “patient” orchard waiting at the end. The later “city of glass and echo” contrasts thematically and visually, sharpening the sense of distance bridged. Environment meaningfully charges the final image (the forest holding her, the city seam touched with silver dust) rather than acting as a neutral backdrop. A bit more tactile interaction with the loom/trees under pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard planet, twin suns, floating arches, fissure, and mine shafts are vividly specific and consistently filtered through the smith’s practical focus. Setting directly shapes options (he must descend via abandoned shafts, feed silk into the core fissure) and charges the final image (travelers asking how the rocks stay aloft, the anvil’s hum). Environmental changes—arches realigning, fruit ripening explosively—visibly track the narrative’s turning point. This world feels both strange and internally coherent, with almost no wasted detail.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly evoked (“rusted girders groaning like bones,” “air tasted of ozone and old grease”), and the seam’s green light and the shard’s physicality integrate setting with the speculative mechanism. Sensory detail is well-chosen and filtered through Liora’s perception, extending to the other side with “rain and burning paper.” While the environment mostly shapes tone rather than constraining concrete tactics, the decayed technological context makes seams, static, and glass feel organic, not arbitrary. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong, even if the setting could pressure her choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse island, mist, and especially the lantern room are sharply rendered and fully integrated into the emotional arc. The environment is not backdrop: isolation, rust, old wax, and the dead lamp directly shape Elias’s options and mood, while the stone spiral and glass concretely charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with weather and sea-state quietly constraining choice. The only ceiling here comes from scale: we get one primary locale exquisitely, not a broader world, which fits the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald lighthouse, its gears, salt-worn stone, and the star-thick sky are richly, economically rendered and fully fused with the premise. The lantern, light, and storm feel like extensions of the environment rather than pasted-on effects, and details like “the world below had long since abandoned print” deepen atmosphere and theme. The setting’s rules hold and the environment meaningfully shapes what she can do (steering via light, being atop the lighthouse, distance from the village). It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains more in concept than in a specific, pressured tactical bind at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly particular—the floating rock tea house, suspension bridge, valley mist, colored-glass lanterns—and always filtered through the dye master’s visual, tactile attention. Environmental details are not postcard flourishes; they mirror and charge the internal state (the creaking beams as he leaves, the thickening mist at the end, the wing at the eastern window) and recur meaningfully. The wing and the tea house function almost as micro-settings that shape choices and the final image, though they rarely constrain tactics in a literal sense. Atmosphere is superbly controlled and tonally aligned with the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stormlit tower, breathing labyrinth, and ring of oaks are vivid, textured, and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention to stone and weather. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain his options, but it deeply colors every choice and image, especially the final branches “heavy with stars,” which recasts the setting as an active repository of sorrow. The sextant as a tool-object bridges sky and stone in a way that charges the atmosphere and the closing image. World rules—trees absorbing, tower breathing—are stable and legible within a quiet magical-realist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse, alchemical orchard, mica windows, and endless night are vivid and tightly integrated with action—the environment is not backdrop but mechanism (trapped light, hungry trees, dawn net). Details like fruit that never ripened and glass panes fogged by “a realm that had forgotten how to wake” both ground and thematically charge the space. The setting actively shapes what’s possible (only here can she gather and release the shards), and the final image of the orchard blooming against the unraveling night feels earned by earlier specifics. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond light and sound could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the taxidermist, ever-warm bakery, and “unmarked” oak door frame the library as a liminal anomaly, while interior details (dust, ozone, mirrored chamber, labyrinthine cover) all echo the paradox/threshold theme. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables action—the unlocked/locked door rule, the hidden staircase, the mirrors reflecting other Lenas, and the ovens’ breath at the end all shape options and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered, avoiding tourist-list description. The only slight limit is that the city outside stays impressionistic, but that suits the focus on the library as primary stage.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The city, tea house, and overgrown palace courtyard are vividly and economically rendered, with details like backward Tuesdays on the river and birds flown south doing real atmospheric work. Setting is consistently filtered through Liora’s noticing, so it feels inhabited rather than scenic. The courtyard and tea house directly enable the wheat miracle and provide a liminal space for the climax, charging the final image of leading the prince into the wheat. The environment could constrain her options a bit more explicitly to push this higher, but as-is it’s strong and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly realized through ice shelves, frostbitten leather, ozone, “quartz hush,” and collapsing stacks; sensory detail is specific and purposeful. Environment constrains choices (creaking ice, shelves falling into the abyss) and charges the climax as the entire library dissolves into stardust. The bridge of light/ice/clouds and the contrast with the spring-scented air at the end sharply reweight the world. Setting is both atmospheric and structurally embedded in the story’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly textured and specific: the groaning pier, salt-bleached planks, tar and stolen rum, and the hidden market all feel tangible and lived-in. Environmental “rules” (the tide enforcing the truce of hush) constrain tactics and effectively substitute for overt violence. The recurring harbor imagery and the watch fob together charge the final moments, with the tide swallowing the night as both worldbuilding and thematic echo. A hair under 9 because the physical environment doesn’t significantly complicate her movements beyond mood and the social rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: lavender bluffs, aurora, forest elections, and the metallic air all feel specific and consistently filtered through Lira’s sensory biases. Environment is not just backdrop; the forests “vote,” the bluffs pulse with her heartbeat, and the aurora forms a compass rose pointing at her chest, directly charging the final image. Physical geography stays legible despite the lyricism, and the world’s rules (taste as sensorium, sentient forests) feel coherent within this speculative frame. The only limit is that the setting constrains mood and symbolism more than tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal cave is vividly evoked through smell, sound, and light—“prismatic ghosts,” wet stone, humming crystals—firmly banishing any white-room feel. The environment is not ornamental: it literally houses the embedded painting, the hidden paints, and the echo-driven opening frame, and it shapes what is possible there versus the world above. The cave’s properties charge the ending (lantern left behind, colored smudges on rungs) with concrete stakes about where his true life resides. A slightly clearer sense of the cave’s physical constraints during the unlocking and painting frenzy could push this to an even higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “greenhouse domes…like blisters,” copper haze, rusted postal chute, and bone-lined tunnels all create a strong, integrated atmosphere. Worldbuilding is economical yet suggestive (oasis dried, postal folklore, toxic sky) and consistently filtered through Elias’s perceptions. The Archive as a cathedral-like cavern of glowing letters both situates and thematically charges the central scene. Environment shapes mood and meaning more than tactical options, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bluff, wind, and altitude aren’t just backdrop; they actively shape what’s possible (kinetic sculptures driven by gusts, isolation from the valleys’ “loud and brittle” world, the edge where she listens to empty air). The recurring iceberg fragment and chimes function as micro-setting objects whose physical states evolve and charge the final image. Environment and tools directly constrain her methods and the story’s logic, especially in the closing beat at the bluff’s edge. This is vivid, selective, and purpose-driven atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dome, twin suns, desert, and bioengineered roses are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s perspective as caretaker. Setting directly shapes options—the dome must burn; the desert is a hazardous unknown—and the recurring roses charge both the fire scene and the final image of tucking a bloom behind his sensor. Environmental rules (magnetic drift, domes post-war) feel coherent and lived-in without over-explaining. The closing contrast between contained dome and open dunes reconfigures the entire story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The courtyard-at-dawn setting is sensually rich and specific—cracked tiles, jasmine, Old Man Chen’s radio, Mrs. Delgado’s gossip—and these elements do more than decorate, since the shared space makes the mystery public and communal. The mailbox, gate, and shop are spatially coherent and recur as charged objects, especially the mailbox transforming into a ritual site by noon. Weather and time of day ("first light of dawn") support the tone of tentative awakening. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does shape social dynamics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken lab and surrounding ocean are vividly rendered and consistently integrated with action—water pressure, emergency lights, glass, and currents all shape what is possible and what is lost. The environment directly constrains choices (the flooding, the need to surface) and charges the final images of the rising water and the lab becoming a tomb. Specific, recurring objects (glass, dice, console) are located clearly in this space and evolve as the scene unfolds. It’s richly atmospheric without devolving into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and pressure-bearing: docks with a beached whale, salt air, rotting kelp, and especially the crystal chamber where “little pockets of gravity” physically and metaphysically shape events. The environment constrains and drives choices—the lighter must seek the chamber’s strongest pull, and its gravity-field literally tears at memories and objects. Recurring objects-as-setting (lantern, stone, coffee, flowers) are well integrated and charge the final images of tide and lanterns. A hair’s breadth more evolution of the physical environment during the climax (e.g., navigation under shifting gravity) would push this toward the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The brook, reeds, nocturnal air, and stones are vivid and integrated into the magic, not just decorative: the water is the interface for the ritual, it stills, shatters, and resumes. The setting’s mood (“nocturnal haven,” “whispered secrets”) aligns tightly with the thematic work around silence and fear, and the closing images (brook, reeds, dawn) reweight what came before. The origami wing as a tool-object bridges body and environment in a charged way. Overall, the scene feels texturally rich and specific without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The brownstone, rooftop garden, and meteor shower are vivid and purposeful, with details like “wisteria vines curled like question marks” and bricks that remember tenants’ grief doing double duty as atmosphere and worldbuilding. The seal and the building itself function as micro-settings that constrain choice, especially in the contract and interrogation scenes. The rooftop garden/meteor setting recurs at key pressure points and charges the final image of the garden “already set for tea.” The only thing holding this just short of 9+ is that the physical environment rarely forces tactical constraints beyond mood and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden, the resonance lattice, and the twilight/morning transition are sensorially rich and tightly integrated into action (digging, burying, the garden “shuddering,” singing, blooming her name). The environment constrains and enables choice—this must happen here, in this lattice-soil, before morning—and the garden’s transformation charges the final image and theme. Details like “iron and sunglass” and “petals…silvered” feel specific and character-filtered rather than generic. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical mechanics of the lattice are evocative but remain somewhat abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and ink create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific and thematically charged rather than generic. Details like “aurora bled violet and silver” and stalactites dripping “slow as regret” are integrated into mood and motif, not just scenic wallpaper. The sanctuary reads more as a ritual chamber than a tactical constraint, so it shapes tone and symbolism more than concrete options. Still, the recurring environment and the ink on marble clearly charge the final images of rewriting and forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine nexus, bioluminescent veins, and starlight filtering through “cracks in the world’s skin” create a strong, integrated atmosphere that feels both otherworldly and concrete. Setting is not mere backdrop: the spiral descent, carved warnings, bone arrangements, and thread-webbed chamber shape the story’s progression and imagery. The canyon’s echoing nature and the abyss at the end charge the final image of the shell shattering and the wind’s plain echo. A slight bias toward visual/metaphorical texture over tactile constraint keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glacier shrine, candles, and snow globe create a sharply atmospheric, coherent micro-world that feels tactile and lived-in. Details like “blue veins pulsing” and the ice groaning “like a ship’s timbers” are both concrete and thematically charged without turning into a tourist catalog. The setting charges the final beats—the glacier’s “laughter,” the carved altar, the quiet of the dead—so the environment is inseparable from tone and meaning. It doesn’t strongly constrain literal tactics, but it fully anchors and colors every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly tactile—wet stone, moss, harbor, moon road, fireflies—and consistently filtered through character priorities (nets, tide, tools). The parapet, harbor, and nets are not mere backdrop: they frame the lesson, make possible the fish’s appearance, and charge the final recognition that the nets are “breathing.” The bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting object whose worn grooves embody hidden labor and then anchor the baton-passing at the end. Description occasionally verges on lush, but it remains purposeful and supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard and stillpoint are vividly and efficiently rendered—the radioactive twilight, skeletal trees with faintly glowing fruit, lead-lined pit, and humming fruit on the dashboard are all concrete, memorable images. Environment meaningfully constrains events: the calm zone, the lead lining, and the thriving orchard amid fallout all signal that this is a special physical space, not just a backdrop. The final image of the single perfect fruit, plus the distant radio tower, feels fully charged by everything we’ve learned about the setting. A marginally deeper sense of physical consequence (radiation, bodily risk) in the present tense might push this toward elite-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, cobalt portico, and storm above the clouds are vivid and integral, not backdrop; the environment literally functions as lens, door, and finally throne. Details like “carved from the ribs of the mountain” and “older than the stars he charted” are specific and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The setting constrains options (isolation, only access point via the portico) and heavily charges the ending image when the storm becomes a crown. World rules feel internally consistent even as they’re surreal.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “feral loft” beneath shifting dunes, infused with sand, brine, and creaking beams, is vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment is not mere backdrop: the dunes’ song becomes a literal resource he captures and then passes on, and the loft’s hidden, liminal position mirrors his role “in-between” generations. Recurring objects—the jars and music box—function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the ending. The final image of sun gilding the dunes ties atmosphere directly into thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly realized and function as constraints: the ice is literally the bomb’s dampener-turned-conduit, and its groans are both language and structural pressure. Sensory specificity is high (subsonic ache in her molars, dust like crushed pearl), and the environment evolves with the action (ice fracturing into geometric patterns as the sound aligns). The final images—the ice settling into a new pattern, the beam as hymn, something ancient stirring beneath—are deeply charged by prior environmental detail. Minor ceiling: the physical navigation within the lighthouse is straightforward, so spatial complexity is limited by design.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action (“its iron bones singing a low, persistent note that vibrated through the soles of his boots”). Setting is not backdrop: the ice’s integrity and the lake’s “held breath” directly shape the stakes of Lior’s crossing, and the rising viaduct’s shadow is central to the final image. The cosmological detail of the viaduct’s alignment to the moon elegantly embeds worldbuilding in action. This is near top-tier scene grounding; it only falls short of perfection because the physical risk of the environment is more implied than fully exploited in moment-to-moment choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: damp concrete, rust, 1890s tiles, and water pressure all shape what Elias can sense and do, especially at the bricked dead end and the scramble for the ladder. The maintenance tunnel isn’t a backdrop; it encodes history (Underground Railroad), conceals the central crime (flooding routes), and physically constrains choice. The lantern as a tool within that space and the glittering glass at the end charge the environment with thematic weight. A slight limit is that the broader system of tunnels and city infrastructure remains sketched rather than felt as a fully coherent world.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    The music box shop and storm are vivid, selective, and charged: stained glass, brass key, lavender, hymnals, and rain on cobblestones all filter through a chaplain’s sensibility. The environment directly shapes action—only in this shop can he integrate the clockwork heart, and the storm makes mailing the letter a costly, embodied choice. Recurring objects (heart, music box, shop, storm) charge the final image where the “vibrant hush of second chances” is inseparable from place. Setting detail is economical yet thematically resonant throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The acid sea and floating, gear-and-cog workshop are richly specific and constantly present as constraint: fall too far and you dissolve; the workshop’s precarious suspension creates tension and eventually collapses. The kaleidoscope and arrow function as charged objects that evolve and inflect the final image. Environmental logic holds and is learned through use—cranking, leaping, crashing—rather than static cataloguing. The world feels idiosyncratic, tactile, and thematically tuned to corrosion, improvisation, and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archive as environment is vivid (“hummed like a dying star,” “data graves”) and consistently refracted through her job and stakes. The social network archive’s logic—redirected files, limbo directories, physical server coordinates—grounds the speculative premise without over-explaining. Recurring objects (patch, servers, data crystal) interact with the setting and charge the final image of the suddenly “silent” archive. A slightly more tactile sense of the physical server farm and her bodily environment during the breach could deepen the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and singular: a lighthouse orchard over groaning ice floes, with weathered mirrors and an eerie, animate environment. Details are POV-filtered and support mood (“trees swayed in a wind that wasn’t there,” “ice floes below groaned, restless, hungry”). The environment directly charges the stakes and final image—his stepping toward the cliff and ice, the beam sweeping like a metronome, the ice breathing. Setting is not mere backdrop; it presses on the choice and thematically mirrors fragility and fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina, groaning hull, thawing fjord, and weather are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the emotional tone. The environment constrains action (the ice canal, the risk of crossing) and charges meaning (ice as unstable ground and as voiced “endings” she’s listening for). The parasol-as-tool functions as a micro-setting object, literally testing ice and finally riding in her pocket as a reweighted talisman. A touch more tactile interaction with cold/physical risk during the crossing could push this fully into the 9-band, but as is, the setting is strong and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, wine, and stars are vividly rendered and tightly bound to Lior’s identity as a “sentinel.” Environmental details (vines curling like fingers, banners frayed by harvest winds) echo and deepen the emotional stakes without feeling like mere symbols. The final image—him stepping back into the vineyard under unreadable stars—charges the setting with thematic weight. Setting is more atmospheric than constraining, but it still quietly shapes what choices feel available.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: dunes, murmuring pavilion, silk walls, scents (crushed mint, “first word ever spoken”) all filter through Lysan’s perception and thematic preoccupations. The kinetic parapet and the clearing’s fraying borders are not decorative; they constrain action and literally manifest the stakes. Environmental details evolve with the ritual—the clearing sharpens, scents shift to damp earth and petals—mirroring the work she’s doing. The final image of the desert remembering charges the whole environment as an active witness, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lavender field and rusting factory are vividly rendered and recur with evolving significance: scent, color, and decay frame every emotional move. Details like “vines…like stitches in a wound” and the factory’s shadow stretching across the field elegantly mirror the healing premise without feeling purely ornamental. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it decisively charges the final images (vines climbing, ruins standing “a little straighter”). Overall, setting and atmosphere do heavy thematic lifting with good economy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library at dawn is vivid and purposeful—the stained glass, sagging chandelier, and dust all reinforce the sense of obsolescence and suspended time. The crystal-as-setting-object meaningfully constrains action (he must climb to it, handle it, speak into it) and charges the final image as it “hums with stolen words.” Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s scholarly, language-focused lens in a way that supports theme. Weather and light (“fractured gold,” damp coat) subtly echo the fractured, half-alive state of language.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The seaside sculpture garden and fog are exquisitely realized, with details like “rusted bones of forgotten art” and seawater-filled eyes doing double duty as worldbuilding and emotional mirror. Environment meaningfully shapes action: the fog and arrows dictate navigation, the garden’s center focuses pressure, and the sea literally receives what he lets go. Recurring objects (tape, chalk, driftwood) and weather (encroaching sea, static-tasting air) all charge the final image of the tide hissing “like a tape rewinding.” The setting feels indispensable rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lunar observatory “above the clouds” with gears, domes, and impossible leaves creates a distinct, textured atmosphere that’s tightly tied to the premise. The setting meaningfully shapes the imagery of escape and elevation (earth as “launchpad,” sky welcoming him “home”). Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a repairer of instruments, which keeps description purposeful rather than touristic. The observatory and its mechanisms also function as a charged object-as-setting that constrains and charges his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is vivid and focused—the haven above the clouds, chamomile and old paper, lemon soap, and lavender all feel purposeful and filtered through Lena. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but the edge of the haven and the act of dropping the shard use the setting to charge the final image. Sensory details recur with variation (scent, light, texture) to mirror the thematic concern with hope and release. There’s no white-room syndrome and no touristic clutter; the space feels lived-in and thematically tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, floating isle, and later the “library of sealed doors” are vivid, specific, and tightly tied to function—the observatory as a literal lock, the sun as portal, the isle tilting as something unspools beneath. Details like the unmelted frost, brass dome, and runed key are filtered through Elara’s professional eye, avoiding touristy description. The environment constrains options (she must use the observatory’s mechanisms; the only path is through the light) and charges the final images of doors and shadows. A touch more tactile interaction with the space during the climax could push this to an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hedge maze, impossible garden, and well are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—the scent of crushed mint and iron, pulsing flowers, and aching symbols create a distinct, charged atmosphere. Setting is not postcard decoration: the garden is the liminal space where rules bend, and the well literally mediates memory, magic, and closure. The recurring objects (well, hedge, river) evolve meaningfully toward the ending image of Liora stepping back through the hedge to a reconfigured village. A slight gap is that physical constraints of the garden rarely force hard choices; it functions more as a metaphysical stage than an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, tide-breath, and quartz veins create a vivid, coherent micro-world that’s tightly fused to Liora’s interiority. Setting details recur and evolve (mist exhaling/retreating, grotto as serpent and constellation chamber), charging both the opening and closing images. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain specific physical choices, it meaningfully frames the alternative “light” she practices in opposition to village torches. Sensory detail is rich and selective, though the focus is heavily visual and metaphoric rather than fully multisensory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned data center turned moss cathedral is vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated—server racks as planters literally shape tactics (planting moss) and charge the final image. Environmental details (icicle drips, creeping thistle, “honeyed hush”) mirror and constrain emotional choices: this is a place chosen precisely because of its capacity for silence and growth in ruins. The setting’s logic is consistent, and world rules are learned organically through use rather than exposition. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment doesn’t overtly block any options or force a specific sacrifice beyond mood and symbolism, though its charge is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The feral nexus and mist are richly realized and tightly integrated—the three rivers “fighting,” the whirlpools, and the thickening/stilling water all mirror and modulate the internal stakes. The setting actively shapes what’s possible (the cameos in the mist, the manifestation of the faceless man, the rivers’ surge that takes Elias), and the seashell as a recurring object meaningfully charges the final image. Sensory detail is primarily visual and tactile but feels selective rather than touristic, and the “feral” quality of the place coheres with the story’s feral narrative current. At this length, the environment more than suffices as both atmosphere and pressure without lapsing into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The verdant arbor, harvest moonlight, and Mira’s tools create a vivid, textured environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The arbor isn’t just backdrop: its physical state mirrors the stakes and its transformation charges the final image. Details like “wings of spun copper,” “liquid gold” dawn, and vines forming an arch are specific and sensorially rich without losing clarity. Setting constrains options—this is the place of blessing and loss—but the pressure is more thematic than logistical, just shy of 9-band indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crater orchard and subarctic stillness are vividly rendered and deeply tied to mood and meaning (“a subarctic crater where the wind died before it could howl”). The environment constrains choice—silence, cold, and withered apples shape her tools, techniques, and the hiding-place for the map. Recurring objects (orchard, apples, plate, snow) recur with reweighted meaning at the end, charging the final image of glowing starlight under drifts. The specificity and integration of setting with theme and action reach a publish-ready level.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The marble cavern, veined with silver and humming with old harvests, is vividly rendered and never feels like a backdrop; acoustics, reflections, cold, and thaw all matter to what’s possible. The environment constrains tactics (he studies reflections, aligns gears in the peculiar light, works fast before echoes thin) and charges the final image with the weeping ice and the soft tick. Details are filtered through his locksmith’s and listener’s eye, avoiding tourist cataloging. The cavern’s changing state across the wounded season directly underwrites both the stakes and the emotional timbre of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bronze grotto, starlight fissures, and lamp burner form a vivid, unified micro-setting that is strongly filtered through Elira’s perception and tightly tied to the action. The environment is not just decorative: the bronze plates store past burdens, the fissures dictate the “orientation” tactic, and the grotto’s hush becomes an active, almost sentient pressure demanding she take its weight. Weather/season and village are sketched efficiently around this core, supporting atmosphere without clutter. The only thing keeping this just under 9 is that the outer world doesn’t constrain choices as sharply as the inner grotto space does.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and tightly woven to mood: the rain-beaded skylight, damp cedar, kettle, and laddered loft are all concrete and sensorial. Crucially, the loft and skylight charge the final image as the carved lion catches “rain on the glass” and the droplets scatter “rust-hued” light, so the environment materially shapes closure. The tools and materials (ash blanks, knife, sawdust) are used as lived-in, occupational details rather than decorative props. The only thing holding this just below 9 is that the physical environment constrains emotion and image more than tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the stalled carousel, brass horses, and viscous memory lagoon above the clouds are sensorially specific and never feel like backdrop. The lagoon’s behavior (dimples, ripples that spell words, hands reaching up) is consistent and directly structures the climax. Environmental details like the skeletal bridge below concretize Lira’s failed ambitions in space. A touch more tactile interaction with the decayed carousel during the decision to jump could link the opening image even more tightly to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is richly and precisely rendered (“arched ribs of corroded steel,” “hydroponics bay,” “rusted weather vane”) and not merely decorative—the hydroponics system, observation decks, and scavenged scaffolding all directly enable Lena’s plan. Atmosphere (carnival ghosting, “sky the color of old bruises”) supports the themes of failed escape and redirected motion. Setting also charges the final image (vane pointing to the horizon), satisfying the object/setting-as-closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the soundless sanctuary, tower heart, and crystal forecourt are rendered through selective, tactile detail that matches his obsessions. Environment actively shapes events—the crystal preserving whispers, cracking under his hand, and serving as the surface for the orrery pieces is structurally central rather than decorative. Weather and time (rain, hidden sunrise) modulate tone and action rather than sitting as backdrop. The final image of the orrery ticking in this once-hushed space feels inseparable from the described environment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canal, marshes, mist, and barge are rendered with vivid sensory specificity and are consistently filtered through Liora’s mindset. Setting is not just backdrop: the canal fork forces a choice; the marshes’ quiet amplifies introspection; the water provides a literal medium for swallowing the ledger. The sundial functions as a micro-setting object that directly charges the final image, satisfying the high-band constraint. A minor limitation is that environmental constraints are more emotional than logistical, but they still meaningfully shape the story.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor—snow, fog, groaning dock, absent bell buoy—forms a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly interwoven with Elias’s perceptions. Objects-as-setting (rope, fulgurite, seed pod) are sensorially concrete and return to charge the ending. Environmental details evolve (“the fog thickened,” “the dock settling deeper into the snow”) and mirror the deepening temporal entanglement. The setting strongly supports tone and theme, though it shapes mood more than it constrains concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The garden, harbor, and bruised sky are vividly rendered and tightly braided with the emotional stakes; the autumnal, shadowed garden both hides and reveals the locket, and later becomes a waiting, almost sentient locus of absence. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful (weeping willow as wound, loam, skeletal vines) rather than touristic. The setting actively shapes the plot beat of discovery and charges the final image of return. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength and clearly integrated with the story’s logic and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The suspended palace, chains, stalactites, abyss, and failing “lungs” are vivid and specific, and they evolve with the action (shuddering, groaning, refracted light). Setting is not mere backdrop: the altitude, iron infrastructure, and abyss beneath charge the risk of the creature’s first flight and the possibility of catastrophic failure. The final image of prince, creature, and palace hanging over the abyss crystallizes the thematic stakes through environment. A slight trim of descriptive density in the midsection would sharpen, but the integration is already near elite.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: obsidian lagoon, black sand, salt and scorched-earth wind, and the station hearth all echo the fire/ash motif and Liora’s inner state. Environmental details feel filtered through her profession and history, especially the line that the obsidian “remembered heat the way she remembered her father’s laughter.” The lagoon meaningfully hosts the key turn (the boy’s injury and rescue) and the sand/obsidian recur conceptually at the end. While the geography doesn’t tightly constrain options, it strongly charges the central images and final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and particular: “city of forgotten fountains,” rust-gurgling pump, Bone Fountain, and the chamber of memory-threads create a strong atmosphere that is inseparable from the premise. The environment constrains and charges choices: the last working pump signals scarcity and decay, the Bone Fountain door is the physical obstacle, and the fountains weeping light at the end reconfigure the whole city. Details are tightly filtered through Liora’s gaze and consistently support tone. This is rich, purposeful worldbuilding without feeling like a postcard tour.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered and thematically charged—petals, luminescent blooms, and the garden as both cradle and cage all feel specific and integral. The environment meaningfully shapes meaning at the end: the act of leaving the garden reconfigures the core situation, and the “final petal” exhale charges the closing image. The gear as a handled object also functions as a micro-setting tool. A slightly stronger sense of spatial or sensory constraint on her movements could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse, cracked glass, wet soil, dusk, and storm are vivid and consistently filtered through the carver’s sensibility, creating a palpable, almost ritual space. The butterflies and thunder are not just pretty; they charge the final images and world-logic (“breath of the dead,” thunder as voices). The setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics, but it powerfully shapes the emotional and spiritual terms of the scene and the closure image. Economy is good—no museum touring—though a hair more interaction with the physical constraints of the space could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the tidal obsidian ridge, salt-slick stone, and hissing sea make the tower feel precarious and penitential, not just a backdrop. Environmental and object details—the pendulum, gearwork, arrow slits, broken rake—are all filtered through Elias’s craft and guilt. The sea and tide motif meaningfully echo the theme of erasure versus acknowledgment. The tower's physical isolation and height constrain the scene’s options, though the ridge itself could pressure choice even more to reach absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the cobalt silo, the cemetery, the river, the cherry tree, and the marigolds all matter to how the magic and history manifest. Environmental details like the groaning iron ribs, blue lantern flame, and clicking silo door directly charge mood and the sense of constraint. The final image—marigolds trembling, petals like hands in prayer, silo door clicking shut—reconfigures the entire space into a charged, watchful environment rather than mere backdrop. Sensory details are rich but purpose-driven, filtered through Elias’s tactile, earth-focused gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, fissure, and comet-ink tools are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the magic system. The environment actively constrains and enables action—the ice as ledger, the spire’s hum and song directing her hand, the precise crack where “the past bled into the present.” Setting details are selective and purposeful, charging both process and final image. This is near-publishable level atmospheric work, just shy of utterly transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting work is exceptional: the ember alcove, mist, ruins of the broadcasting tower, damp paper, and dust all feel tactile and lived-in, filtered through Elias’s musician/copyist sensibility. Environmental elements are not mere backdrop—the radio’s glow, the mist “listening,” and the dust learning to whisper are structurally important and charge the final images of the empty alcove and graffitied walls. World rules around censorship and the story famine are sketched with just enough specificity to feel coherent and oppressive without bogging the piece down. The final image of a stubborn dial glow mapped onto ash-and-salt graffiti exemplifies setting-based closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vanishing-point gallery, damp plaster smell, and the rocking chair create an atmosphere that is both tactile and thematically charged. Objects-as-setting (mask, ashes, powder, chair) are woven into nearly every beat and decisively charge the final images. The “vanishing point” and the chair’s motion/stillness directly mirror the story’s concerns with illusion, stasis, and fading safety. Setting feels integral rather than ornamental, though it shapes mood and meaning more than concrete physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sewer and sunken city are vividly particular (“old copper and newer lies,” “the sunken city’s ribs groaned”), and environmental features—tides, dripping grates, impending flooding—directly constrain options and culminate in Elias’s death. Detail selection feels POV-driven: he notices discarded objects, bones, and mechanical remnants over generic scenery. The cog and water jointly charge the final image, turning the silt into both grave and archive. World rules (post-plague, New Archives, flooding the lower levels) are consistent and legible without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “velvet library,” stained glass like “slow fire,” and autumn stripping trees all mirror the themes of erosion and remnant beauty. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a musician and teacher, not as neutral description. The rosette functions as a micro-setting object that literally and symbolically charges the final image when it vibrates in response to their humming. Environment and recurring objects don’t just decorate—they frame and constrain how the characters can respond, especially their decision to be “not loud” within that traveled hush.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly evoked (“iron ribs rusted into lace”) and consistently filters Elias’s perceptions and choices. The setting isn’t mere backdrop: its abandonment enables his rebellion, its ruin mirrors his own “pruned” life, and its later vitality charges the final image. The environment constrains and characterizes his work as marginal and fragile, not institutional. A slightly stronger sense of physical limitations (weather, resources) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: lightning tower, copper ribs, dark drone hive, and vertical farms all feel textured and specific without exposition bloat. Environment directly shapes choices—Elias must climb the tower to access the hive; the blackout and storm-scented air frame the moment as liminal. The beehive-as-infrastructure and drones-as-fireflies beautifully charge the final images. World rules (drones, scheduled sunlight, credits as tolls) are consistent and taught through action and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid, tactile, and tightly integrated with theme: the softened dock, quiet bay, salt-stiff ribbon, and humming streetlights all echo the idea of accumulated, breathing silence. Details are filtered through Liora’s sensibility so they never feel touristy, and the displaced objects concretely stage the ritual. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (the bay sighing, her softer steps) and functions almost as a character. This is one of the story’s most publication-ready strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned garden and underwater city are sensuously rendered—marble arches, silt, bioluminescence, mosaics—and always in service of pressure rather than postcard description. Setting actively constrains and enables action: the crushing dark, the structural seam in the dome, the necessity of the pressure suit, and the city’s physical rising all shape what’s possible. The final images (kelp-wrapped light, statues sloughing stone, ampoule settling into the mosaic) charge the thematic reconfiguration. World rules (telepathic statue, underwater breathing at the end) read as mythically consistent within the piece’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite staircase is cleanly drawn and functionally integral, not a backdrop: its geometry and recursion logic govern every choice and directly enable the final sideways escape move. The gray haze and absence of sky/ceiling reinforce tone without overpainting, and the later café doorway feels like a precise, grounded rupture in that atmosphere. The staircase’s reassembly under her feet after she refuses the door elegantly ties environment to closure. A slightly richer sensory palette (sound/smell/temperature) in the staircase itself could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are sensuously rendered and tightly integrated—“the only place” with green air, a fragile oasis whose existence shapes his choices and is necessary for the fig-tree canvas. Recurring environmental elements (smog, moon, jasmine, non-falling rain) evolve meaningfully, with the thinned smog and rain-scent at the end explicitly signaling the story’s conceptual stakes. The brush, fig tree, and moon together function as a micro-ecosystem that constrains and charges the final image. Description is rich but never feels like a static postcard; it constantly relates to his work and state.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vivid and particular—mist-shrouded cliff hives, lichen-glow, communal ovens—and the environment meaningfully shapes customs (shouting over the roar, bread to counter dissolution, bees in the falls’ spray). The waterfall functions as more than backdrop: it is both eroding force and carrier of song, and ultimately becomes part of the safeguarding mechanism. The museum, ovens, and cliffs are used tactically in scene (taking the lens to spray, to heat, to the carved names), not as static postcards. A slight reason this doesn’t climb higher is that physical constraints (danger, logistics of the hives/cliffs) are more atmospheric than choice-limiting in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, island, hunger stones, and low-tide shoreline are all concretely and atmospherically rendered; the setting is not postcard but mechanism, map, and gate. Environment constrains choice (path only appears at low tide; the lighthouse’s base filled with scavenged gears is the only place the sequence can happen) and charges the final images (tide erasing his reflection, lighthouse beam’s last flicker). Details feel selected through Elias’s clockmaker sensibility—gears, teeth, counter-clockwise motion—rather than generic spookiness. A slight spread in sensory range beyond the visual and mechanical might deepen immersion, but what’s here is purposeful and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is richly and efficiently particular—“burnt sugar and copper pennies,” breathing mirrors, weeping silver—and always filtered through Lysander’s curse and goal. The environment constrains and shapes choices: the mirror as threshold, the hall of distorted selves, and the funhouse’s final “exhale” all function as more than backdrop. The raven clasp and filmstrip operate as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and closure. It stops just shy of 9-band only because the physical geography of the inner spiral stays largely symbolic rather than materially affecting tactics beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the floating orchard, driftwood circle, improvised instruments, and blue-hour sky all feel tactile and integrated into action. Environmental shifts—the orchard’s tilt, the charged air, the sea’s hum—directly influence his tactics and the story’s emotional temperature. The mallet, roots, and sky together charge the final image of him raising the mallet as the world “leans in.” It’s immersive and thematically apt, though the world remains narrowly focused on this one ritual space rather than broader contextual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and singular: a city carved into Great Turtles’ shells, rusted gate, heat-mirage watchers—all filtered through Elyas’s occupational gaze. Environmental elements meaningfully constrain and charge the story: the shells as memory and language, the gate as barrier and instrument, the horizon as a line of pressure. The final image of the city trembling as the turtles remember how to move ties the worldbuilding directly to the narrative turn. A slight pullback from 9+ comes from the atmosphere staying largely tonal rather than letting the physical environment more directly complicate Elyas’s on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    The disused, ivy-strangled station and the rosebush are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s task-oriented attention. Setting and recurring objects (ivy, rails, rosebush) do thematic work, mirroring suffocating lies and exhausted beauty, and the final image of tracks into darkness is charged by everything that preceded it. The environment slightly constrains tactics (shadows to withdraw into, no trains, ghost whistle), though it’s more atmospheric than logistical. Overall, the place feels integral rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The submerged pavilion and canal are vividly realized—algae-slick marble, blackened water, silt, muffled clocks—and are always filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Environment and objects (waterline cracks, mortar, waders, drawbridge, inkwell) actively shape what he can do and how he does it, not just how things look. The setting’s decay and partial erasure echo the thematic concern with absence and preservation without feeling like blunt symbolism. The final image is charged by place and tools even when we’re briefly in the library, keeping the world cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken library under a glass dome with ocean pressing in is vivid and purposeful, with details like “water lapping at his knees” and the pressure lock directly shaping his actions. The environment supports tone and theme—the submerged, rusted quiet mirrors the “reclaimed stillness” he values—and the blackout’s absence of hum and screens is concretely rendered. Setting constraints (flooded corridors, sealed chamber, decaying map) influence tactics without devolving into tour-guide description. A slight opportunity gap is that the physical danger of the ocean remains mostly atmospheric, never quite becoming an active threat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the floating isle, tea garden, origami cranes, glass basilica—anchored in sensory, emotionally charged details that recur and evolve (“graveyard of origami cranes” → cranes of dream-stuff taking flight). Environment and objects tangibly shape events: the basilica’s physical structure, the isle’s descent, and the tea garden’s tilting undercut any sense of abstraction. The final images explicitly rely on setting elements (tea garden blooming, cranes carrying dreams, basilica breathing, isle rising into dream-space) to carry meaning. World rules (sinking through the sea, dream-recording glass) are consistent enough for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating observatory, storm lattice, and glass dome are vivid and tightly bound to the premise; the vantage above the city is essential to seeing the “threads” of the past. The geode as recurring object doubles as micro-setting and charges the final image when she tucks it back into her pocket to “step into the dark, hunting.” Environmental elements (storm, power-down, emergency lights) are woven through action rather than dumped. The setting does constrain options—this work can only happen here, in this way—though the physical precariousness of the station could be exploited even more.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ancient observatory at dusk is vividly realized and tightly integrated, from the “stone domes” silhouettes to the “carved celestial maps” the drone skims. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the spire seam, the floor slot, and the oculus star all actively shape what can happen and charge the final image. Details are filtered through Lena’s sensibility (she sees “gaps in the world” and “star trails” in half-erased lines), reinforcing theme. It stops just shy of 9+ because environmental constraints, while present, don’t force a hard tactical trade-off beyond serving as the ritual device.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt terrace, mist, driftwood “bones,” and sea are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and theme; details like the iron railing “groaned in the wind, a sound like a man clearing his throat to speak” bind environment to the pressure of unspoken truth. The setting isn’t just a backdrop: the sea receives the watch hand, and the driftwood literally hides the note that turns the story. Sensory specificity is strong without feeling like a tourist catalog, with repeated sea/shore images charging the final walk away. It stops just short of 9+ only because the physical environment shapes discovery more than it constrains a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and chasm are vividly rendered and recur as emotionally loaded geography, especially when the mist parts to show a void “where forgiveness and apology both drowned if left too long.” The environment supports tone and theme more than tactical constraint; the storm and edge do not materially restrict movement or options. However, the parapet as neutral high ground and the chasm as a visible border between warring valleys do meaningfully stage the negotiation’s stakes. The drawer pull as a small, handled object functions as a micro-setting anchor that helps charge key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and tightly integrated: the saltwind, skeletal buoys, sagging wires, and tilting utility pole all mirror the dereliction of his promises. Crucially, the environment constrains and charges choice: sea vs inland, tide turning, sun dipping, and the physical map of poles become his new navigation system and directly shape his path. The recurring micro-setting of poles evolves from mere wayfinding trick to the emotional architecture of “coming home.” The final image—first star ignored, dusk gathering, poles as “silent witnesses”—beautifully binds setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings—the clinic echo, damp tunnel, and especially the underground bioluminescent lake—are vivid, sensorial, and integrated with character perception. The lake is not mere backdrop: it reads him, talks inside his chest, and physically opens and closes his options, making environment a direct pressure on choice. The city above, returning unchanged-yet-different, reinforces the theme of inner change against a fixed world. A hair more lived-in specificity topside (e.g., how this future city has changed) could push this toward truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard under a never-setting moon is vivid and purposeful, from soil “that hummed” to roots cradling bones. Environment and objects (trees, moon, beasts, roots) are not postcard garnish but active components of the magic and grief work being done. The setting charges the final image—orchard holding its breath, beasts gathered—as a space where her new role is legible. World rules around the phoenix, veil, and celestial spices feel internally consistent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific from the outset (“midnight glade… suspended above the clouds like a forgotten breath”) and remains tightly tied to mood and action. Crucially, the glade is not postcard backdrop: as a “reservoir” where time pools, it directly enables the encounter and frames the cost of leaving. Recurring objects (the saucer, satchel, acorn) work as micro-settings that charge the final image. A slight excess of atmospheric description in early lines flirts with overrichness, but it still serves character and tone rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bone ship, failing AI, flickering gravity, and patched hull create a distinctive, lived-in environment that shapes both tone and the mechanics of Lien’s work. Setting is filtered through her needs: she favors the dark where gravity falters, uses the console and photograph as tools, and the ship groans and “bones sang” in response to her stitching. The shift to the green grass and closer stars at the end reweights everything we’ve seen, making the new world feel like a hard-earned contrast rather than a generic afterlife. The world’s rules remain consistent even in their strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, cave of oracles, and pumice raft are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action and theme (lava-sea contact as “texture of transformation,” tide as active agent, volcano’s “sigh” at closure). Environment consistently guides choices: the detour to the cave, the decision to throw vials into lava, and the raft’s emergence from the returning tide all arise from specific physical conditions. Recurring elements (black sand, embers, celestial bodies) charge the final images rather than functioning as static backdrop. A hair more concrete sensory variety beyond visual/thermal (sound, smell, bodily strain) during the lava sequence could deepen embodiment but isn’t strictly necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The luminous fort, stored light, cliffside, and gearwork beneath the sundial are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Kael’s professional eye. Setting directly constrains tactics: the blackout, the stored orbs that could flare, the cliffside ravine, and the central lock mechanism all shape what’s possible. The sundial and quill holder function as micro-setting/objects that charge key choices and the final image. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding under peak pressure could elevate this further, but it already feels tightly integrated and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal bluff, frictionless world, aurora, and gathered stardust are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Liora’s attention as a working eel herder. Environmental conditions (no friction, where dust collects, the rising water mirror, aurora lines linking to stones) directly shape what she can do and charge the final image of her walking as “the only friction left in the world.” Details are economical yet lush, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. The setting’s rules feel coherent and learned via action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, storm, and dome are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility; details like the crack in the glass literally allow the storm to alter the poem. Environment shapes meaning and action (he comes “above the clouds” to shed masks; the place’s isolation enables this vigil) and recurs in the final image as he leaves the creaking observatory behind. Weather isn’t just backdrop: it presses on him and charges the closing sky-as-blank-page image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass atrium, brook, heron, and sundial are vivid and tightly integrated with action: light through glass guides the blade, the sundial literally contains the key, and the brook’s patience metaphorically reframes the conflict. Spatial choreography is clear—card to stone to dial, bodies around it—without white-room moments. The final image of the city as an “unfinished argument” reweights the setting conceptually rather than physically, but the sundial and atrium have already constrained tactics enough to count as charged environment. A touch more sensory variety under peak pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the rusted, skeletal library, prison context, cold air, and wind through broken bars all serve tone and theme rather than functioning as backdrop. Objects and environment (tin, sagging awning, single lamp, iron shelves) recur and evolve, especially the library-as-heart metaphor that charges the ending. The physical space plausibly supports their clandestine resistance work and underscores their isolation. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain moment-to-moment options, but it deeply colors every choice and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds, salt-yellowed piano, and ozone-and-old-paper refuge are vivid and coherently strange, with sensory details selected through Lena’s obsessions (music, time, navigation). Setting elements function as charged tools: the arbor as liminal node, the station as reliquary, the maps and compasses as navigational logic. Environmental rules—tides above clouds, invisible currents—stay consistent enough to feel like a lived-in, if uncanny, world. The final image of the arbor “settling like the hands of a clock” elegantly fuses place and theme, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridge, nightshade, seeds, and monsoon weather are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Liora’s perceptions. Setting materially constrains action (the seeds in the fissures, the ridge as memory, the need to act before the rains) and strongly charges the final image (barefoot in mud, ridge trembling, rain filling her). World rules about the island’s memory and the monsoon’s exhale stay coherent and are learned through events rather than exposition dumps. A slight further integration of practical physical constraint (e.g., difficulty or danger of reaching the ridge) could have heightened embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The islet, damp sand, wind in saltgrass, and the bonsai/compass ensemble are vivid and tightly selected, with sensory detail doing double duty as emotional atmosphere. The recurring objects (bonsai, compass, shears) act as a micro-setting, charging the final image and embodying the new relationship to grief. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it consistently mirrors and supports the internal tide motif. Economy is strong—no touristic clutter—and world rules for the mild magic feel coherent at this scale.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is rendered with evocative, sensory-rich detail ("cathedral of glass," "damp soil") that grounds the abstract themes. The environment actively frames the protagonist’s internal shift, serving as a functional constraint on his observations.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric work is excellent, grounding the reader in the sensory reality of the cold canyon and the scorched studio. Details like "molten tears" and "damp charcoal" effectively merge the setting with the protagonist’s history. The environment feels tangible and pressurized, even if the character's interaction with it becomes vague at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "tomb of winterglass" and the frozen acoustic space are vivid, atmospheric concepts that ground the magical realism. The sensory details effectively convey the cold and the tactile nature of the sound, though the imagery occasionally leans into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is evocative with "bioluminescent anemones" and "ghostly blue" light. However, the physical reality of the library—how a ledger stays dry in a room with waterlogged books and fractured glass under "deep water"—strains spatial credibility, creating a distraction from the otherwise strong mood.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details like "preserved plums" and "unraveled sweaters" provide some grounding, but the setting largely remains a generic "exile valley" fable backdrop. While the terra-cotta arbor is visualized, the lack of specific, immediate scenic grounding distances the reader from the physical reality of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The camera obscura is well-integrated as a tool that mediates the setting, grounding the magical elements in a specific mechanism. Atmospheric details are vivid and establish the "foggy lucidity" tone effectively, though the lush description sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "living bridge garden" is an excellent, active setting that exerts physical pressure on the protagonist, shuddering and recoiling to constrain her path. The sensory details ("old silver," "ozone") successfully establish a cohesive, dream-like atmosphere that supports the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    The atmospheric details of the decaying carnival ("chipped teacups," "yellowed like old bones") are vivid and effectively ground the scene. However, the spatial logic of the trapdoor mechanism undermines the realistic texture established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "sunken orchard greenhouse" ringed by wrecks is a vivid, specific, and atmospheric anchor that grounds the surreal elements effectively. The environment actively contributes to the mood and the "rust" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere is vivid and cohesive, successfully blending the mechanical ("brass rails") with the fantastical ("jar of captured moonbeams"). The sensory details, particularly the lighting and the specific flowers, ground the magical realism effectively in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rendered with distinct sensory pressure; the "groaning ice" and "rust" provide a tactile counterweight to the delicate glass imagery. The control room functions not just as a backdrop but as an antagonist and eventual tool, constraining Elara’s choices. The transition to the observatory offers a vivid contrasting space that supports the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "rusted library" and "sky thick with stars" create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that supports the tone. The sensory details of the shell and the cast are specific and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "splinter of ice" and "bones of the ridge" create a vivid, textured setting that mirrors the internal state. The environment actively supports the mood, though the specific phrase "ambered hush" loses impact through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The frozen courtyard provides a suitable atmospheric backdrop, and the "ice violin" is a vivid central image. However, the setting relies on several stock descriptions ("dying light," "scent of ozone," "practiced ease") and dissolves entirely into an abstract void at the climax, stripping away the environmental constraints just when they should matter most.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the crystal pavers and rain establishing a cohesive mood. However, the sensory details often veer into the ornamental ("whisper of light," "ghost of it") rather than constraining the characters' choices. The environment provides a stage but does not exert pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid ("cracked marbles," "roots cradled them"), effectively grounding the immediate scene. However, the setting operates more as a generic fable backdrop than a specific, lived-in geography that constrains choice beyond the immediate metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, blending the "skeletal" station sounds with the surreal visual of the nexus. The sensory details ("hush of beating wings," "twilight deepened") effectively ground the abstract concept of time manipulation in a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional integration of the flooded setting, which acts as both a physical constraint (wading through resistance) and the medium of communication (water-damaged ink). The "topographic map of shadows" and the water resisting like a "held note" ground the supernatural elements in concrete, sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sensory details are sharp and immersive ("ozone and old blood," "wet stone"), grounding the metaphysical stakes in physical reality. The station and the storm function effectively as constraints that force the protagonist's hand, and the "margins" of the station serve as both setting and thematic metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's standout feature, with sensory details like "wet wool," "burnt sugar," and the "pitted... molared jaw" of the valve creating a visceral, distinct texture. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, and the valve wheel serves as a perfect micro-setting element that bridges the industrial and the supernatural.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details ("walls exhaled dust," "fingers tracing the spines") that ground the surreal elements. The obsidian refuge and the library are realized with tactile specificity that supports the tone. The setting actively shapes the ritual, meeting the 8+ criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sage Ridge is rendered with specific, evocative sensory details ("taste like iron," "shadows would stretch long") that ground the fantastical elements. The setting actively participates in the climax, though the "singing stones" push the boundaries of the established realism.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The silo-as-phonograph is a striking, grounding image that effectively marries the physical setting with the story’s thematic obsession. The environment is tangible and active ("metal skin groaned"), providing necessary pressure to a quiet scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong, specific sensory details ("ink still damp with something heavier than soy sauce," "brass-lined study") effectively ground the noir atmosphere. The setting is not just a backdrop but integral to the character's identity and the final image of the dark tower.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "dimensional anchor" is atmospheric ("frost on glass") but spatially vague, relying on abstract geometric terms rather than concrete sensory grounding. The specific props—the loop pedal and palette—effectively anchor the surreal environment, but the "hall of forgotten doors" feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are not just backdrop but active participants that shape the acoustics and the light/shadow play essential to the "conducting" metaphor. The "air tasted of ice and old electricity" establishes a distinct, pressurized atmosphere immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing the surreal logic of the viaduct quickly ("neon glow," "jagged shards"). The environment actively pressures Elias, stuttering and fracturing to force his hand, though the description occasionally leans on telling ("procedural generation of moments") rather than purely showing the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cavern is rendered with excellent sensory specificity, prioritizing touch and smell over sight, which aligns perfectly with the protagonist’s POV. The atmosphere effectively mirrors the internal state, though the timeline of "seasons turning" outside blurs the immediate scene anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the story's mood and closure; the damp, silent courtyard and the "storm recorder" tool effectively ground the abstract threat. The sensory details (lavender, ozone, damp stone) are vivid and charge the final image of recording the "silence," meeting the 9+ standard for setting utility.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The greenhouse is an active participant, trapping the "breath of forgotten things" and providing the UV context for the reveal. The contrast between the "dying glow" inside and the "harsh, alive" dawn outside effectively charges the final transition. The setting actively constraints and shapes the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory details like "damp clay" and "crushed sage" effectively ground the setting. The focus on texture supports the central motif well, though the "energy beings" remain visually vague.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting—a sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks—is exceptional, providing both the acoustic constraints for the music and the central imagery for the theme. The environment actively charges the final image, satisfying the criteria for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "amber grotto" is established quickly with distinct sensory details, particularly the synesthetic blend of scent and electricity. The progression of dusk serves as an effective pacing mechanism, grounding the magical transformation in a concrete temporal window.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with clear anchoring in the "seaside library courtyard," though the description leans heavily on romantic clichés like "salt-kissed breeze" and "murmur of turning pages." While functional for the tone, the environment acts more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater provide a cohesive, atmospheric backdrop that anchors the fable-like tone. While the imagery is vivid ("fruit that refracts light"), it occasionally drifts into decorative "postcard" description rather than constraining character choice. The obsidian arbor serves effectively as a physical anchor for the plot's convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Veyth is rendered with exceptional sensory specificity, integrating the "interrupted cadence" concept directly into the physical environment. The canal setting is not merely a backdrop but the essential medium for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is active and constraining; the stalactites and mosaic are not just scenery but the specific interface for the magic. The sensory details ("slow, silver pulse," "pulp black and glistening") are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric details are vivid ("cobalt," "dust-moted"), creating a strong sense of place. However, the color palette feels slightly repetitive ("amethyst," "sapphire," "cobalt") and decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with tactile details like "waxy resistance" and "wet earth" grounding the magical realism. The trellis and the storm serve as effective, recurring anchors that reflect the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The integration of industrial scars ("desalination rigs") with ancient mythic elements creates a distinct, constrained physical reality that effectively grounds the fantasy. The specific atmospheric details, like the "salt-cracked mud" and "warped" chapel door, strongly support the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cave setting is serviceable, but the visionary sequence relies on generic stock imagery (baker kneading dough, child's handprint) rather than specific, sensory details unique to Liora's experience. The environment essentially functions as a white room for the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with strong sensory details like "slick cobblestones" and "smelled of ink and damp parchment." The environment is not just a backdrop but actively shapes the mood and the "ivory harbor" imagery grounds the fable-like tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric, utilizing the "starlit vault" and "mist" effectively to mirror Elias’s internal state. However, the imagery leans on familiar tropes (fog, cobblestones, clocktowers) without offering a distinct, specific sensory texture beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "brass eyepiece," "obsidian," and "salt wind" grounding the magical realism effectively. The integration of the environment (whales, tower bones) into the emotional arc is seamless and high-quality.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "escondite" is visualized with distinct, vivid details ("bruise-blue," "fractal ice") that ground the abstract concept of spatial mutiny. The setting actively participates in the shift, though the description occasionally leans into "purple" abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral, not just a backdrop; the porcelain table, the specific "ozone and old parchment" smell, and the ink pot constrain choices and drive the plot. The "ghosts of names" on the table and the behavior of the ink create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like the "scent of damp earth" and the "fluorescent lamp" hum are vivid and establish a strong mood. However, the conflicting geometry of the workshop relative to the bonsai forest disrupts immersion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not just atmospheric but dynamic; the shifting alleys and rising tides actively constrain Daniel's movement and force the timing of the climax. The container labyrinth functions as a physical manifestation of the premise, integrated fully into the narrative logic rather than serving as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory is a vivid, atmospheric setting that anchors the magical realism effectively. Specific details like the "warped wooden floor" and "broken teeth" of the dome successfully mirror the protagonist's internal state of decay and reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like the "acrid tang of frying dough" and the visual of the raft city are vivid and establish a distinct atmosphere. The setting actively informs the plot, though some elements (neon fortune-teller) lean on familiar genre tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory details are evocative, particularly the "chemical cocktail" and "green shimmer" which ground the atmospheric description in specific action. The setting is integral to the plot. Some descriptions ("silence so vast it hummed") lean toward cliché, but the visual specificity of the ending compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "clatter of the anchor chain" and the cooling mist effectively ground the scene. However, the mechanics of the "water refraction" diagnostic tool strain plausibility within the established physical setting, leaning heavily on "magical artisan" logic rather than grounded specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and actively pressures the narrative; details like the condensation map and "old parchment" sky tightly integrate with the protagonist's editorial lens. The atmosphere successfully carries the weight of the story, making the environment an essential antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details are vivid ("rust and gold," "smooth as still water") but rely heavily on generic fantasy tropes of "forgotten things" and "crumbling bones." The setting responds to the protagonist but does not constrain him or offer friction, functioning more as a responsive stage set than a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    The underwater atmosphere is tactile and oppressive, effectively constraining the protagonist's choices. The image of jellyfish as "slow, indifferent stars" anchors the surrealism in specific, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is active and tactile, acting as both antagonist ("jagged reef") and accomplice (the wall holding the lattice). The sensory details—copperlight, salt, the humming wood—are interwoven with the action, constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional—the greenhouse is not just a backdrop but an active participant, "weeping frost" and humming with "sleeping poisons." The sensory details are vivid and specific ("blackened vines," "glowing veins"), creating a thick, immersive atmosphere that perfectly supports the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric specificity is strong, anchoring the reader with vivid sensory details like "scent of rusted iron" and "veins of red dust." The environment feels tangible and ancient, though the magical "shifting" of the geometry leans on abstract dream-logic rather than spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with strong details like the "smell of overripe figs" and the "roots snaking between ribs." The physical environment grounds the magical elements well, though the "fruit that tasted of memory" is a bit abstract compared to the concrete underground imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and thematically integrated, using the "golden arcade" and "rusting mailbox" to ground the analog-digital conflict. Sensory details like the "grit of chalk" and "cool air" effectively anchor the scene in a specific physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific, successfully integrating the tools of the trade (loom, telescope, flame) into the atmosphere. The "cobalt observatory" and "silver needle" ground the magical realism in tangible textures. The environment actively participates in the climax, transitioning from a workspace to a broadcasting instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth and the "glass-smooth water" acting as a window for condensation are vivid, specific setting details that constrain the magic system effectively. The atmosphere is thick and consistent, though it occasionally strays into standard pathetic fallacy ("mangroves breathed," "roots cradling"). The setting actively participates in the ritual, which elevates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and immersive, effectively using the "mist" and "twilight" to mirror the internal state of limbo. The specific details of the atrium and the debris of war ground the scene well, though the atmosphere is relentlessly heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "edges soft with moss" and "skeletal and silvered" trees grounding the fantasy. The setting of the fog-bound ruined district effectively establishes the mood, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "sound wave garden" is a strong, inventive setting that actively creates constraints and drives the plot mechanics. The integration of auditory and visual details ("sculptures... tuned to hum") anchors the magic in a specific physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details in the greenhouse ("damp earth," "crushed mint") are vivid and effectively establish atmosphere. The setting grounds the rebellion in tactile reality, though the "sterile" city outside feels comparatively generic.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "gargantuan shell" with its acoustic properties and "calcium veins" effectively constrains the action and grounds the high-concept magic in specific, tactile details.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is evocative, effectively using the "glass-orchids" to mirror the tension, as they recoil from the sound. While the imagery is vivid, reliance on high-fantasy staples like "moonstone shelves" and "bound in starlight" feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of the chime mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric details are vivid and specific ("crushed violets," "sylph-touched indigo"), grounding the magical elements in sensory reality. The setting of the archive feels lived-in and distinct, though the external threat remains somewhat faceless.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "amphitheater in a volcano" acting as a strong atmospheric container that shapes the acoustics and mood ("crumbling throat of stone"). The integration of the environment into the character's sensory experience—dust, cold brass, the groaning earth—is excellent. The location feels lived-in and ancient.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The attic is an active participant in the story; the dust motes serve as both atmospheric texture and a plot-driving tool for decision-making. This specific, functional use of setting elevates the narrative significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the sensory details of the maze, the kerosene smell, and the "shimmering" terrace build a cohesive, eerie mood. The setting actively participates in the plot, with the "grain of the wood" and the sinkhole serving as necessary constraints for the discovery. The environment successfully blurs the line between the physical farm and the magical realism elements.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like "bioluminescent algae" acting as constellations and "jellyfireflies." The atmosphere of the submerged facility is palpable, though occasionally leans into generic "ruined future" tropes (e.g., "ghost in the corroded wiring").

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "iridescent cave" and "crater glass" providing a strong textural grounding for the piece. The atmosphere is well-established, though the sensory details occasionally stack up ("opalescent mist," "damp crystal floor") without constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory details are a strength; the salt, kerosene, and tidal sounds create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that grounds the abstract premise. The specific props—the cracked ivory bishop, the moth-eaten shawl—add necessary texture. The setting actively provides the variables for Lior's equation, integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details are vivid ("crushed nightshade," "blackened pond") but lean heavily on standard dark-fantasy tropes that feel generic. The "nostalgia ban" is an intriguing world-building hook that remains decorative, failing to constrain the protagonist's options or the immediate environment.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atrium setting is vivid, specific, and functionally integrated, constraining the character's perception and grounding the "light" mechanics. The sensory details ("smell of salt and damp glass") effectively establish the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent, providing not just atmosphere but the specific tools (charred stick, flat stone) required for the resolution. The contrast between the burn zone and the untouched valley mirrors the internal arc without feeling overly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Specific sensory details like the "brass face tarnished" and "kelp braided into knots" ground the mystical elements effectively. However, the opening descriptor "smooth as glass" is a cliché that weakens the initial immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like "plastic brittle between his fingers" and paint peeling "like sunburnt skin." The post-climate shift setting is integrated well into the decay, grounding the surreal elements in a palpable, gritty texture.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The terrace setting is rendered with vivid, sensory-rich detail that anchors the magical elements effectively. The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, though the "fractured rainbows" imagery borders on decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting and the central prop (the ebony clipboard) are excellent; the clipboard functions as a micro-setting that constrains the interaction and carries the story's history. The sensory details (lavender, gunpowder, warm stones) successfully ground the abstract negotiations.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with tactile details like "crust brittle" and "scent of old rain" effectively grounding the mood. The landscape actively mirrors the protagonist's internal desolation, though the "sky leaning in to listen" is a touch pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "prism sanctuary" and "silver courtyard" are established with vivid, if slightly generic, high-fantasy imagery. The sensory details ("shattered glass," "frozen floor") are consistent and support the ethereal tone. While atmospheric, the setting functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting of the decommissioned radar dome is vivid and acoustically specific, serving as an effective amplifier for the protagonist's introspection. Details like the "salt flats" and the "damp wool" smell ground the scene well, though the environment functions more as an atmospheric backdrop than an active source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using sensory details ("damp earth," "moss so thick") to ground the abstract premise. The vertical contrast between the grotto and the "straight lines" of the valley below effectively frames the narrative space.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like "blue-dark" and "ribs like marrow" that ground the fantasy. The environment feels distinct, though the specific "street organ" element feels slightly anachronistic to the ancient glacial fantasy setting without further grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details like the "ghost of machine oil" and the "wafer seal" establish a distinct, ethereal grit. The setting effectively mirrors the internal state, though the transition from bunker back to forest feels slightly disjointed spatially, relying on surreal dissolution rather than navigated geography.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is a primary strength; details like the "cracked mosaic" and the "warm" tile ground the scene physically and sensually. The setting actively constrains the protagonist's movement (avoiding guards), though the specific "Babylonian" elements are somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sanctuary is atmospheric, with sensory details like "thick as wool" and "scent of rain" effectively grounding the surrealism. However, the environment responding to emotion ("walls breathing") is a familiar trope that lowers specificity; the setting accommodates the protagonist rather than pressuring him.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details like "frost clung... like shattered glass" establish a cohesive, melancholic mood. However, the setting primarily serves as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of friction or constraint. The "fog" functions more as a convenient plot device than a tangible environment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptional, merging the cathedral and orchard into a single cohesive metaphor that constrains the action (roots in marble) and drives the theme. The imagery of "ribs" and "rose window" provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that feels essential to the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, grounding the surreal premise with specific sensory details like the "violet blossoms" and the bathroom acoustics. The environment actively participates in the narrative, pressuring the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere is palpable, with the "blooming in reverse" diary acting as a distinct, constraint-inducing prop that anchors the magic. The "mountain loomed" opening is functional but slightly standard compared to the specificity of the interior details.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, employing specific, sensory details like "rusted hull painted with peeling stripes" and "scent of salt and old cotton candy." The atmosphere effectively supports the surreal tone and grounds the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is strong, with sensory details like the scent of oil and the humming wood grounding the fantastical elements. The clock tower setting is utilized well to frame the inciting incident, though the "gears" serve more as backdrop than physical constraint during the rope ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral to the action; the ice fractures and ripple-marks function as necessary tools that constrain Eldrin’s method. The sensory focus on vibration and tactile sound grounds the abstract magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; details like "glass worn thin," "star paths carved in spirals," and the "hum" of the pavilion ground the abstract magical elements in a tangible, tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent, with the "crystal flags" and "Spear" interacting directly with the protagonist's method. The atmospheric details ("clouds curled like smoke," "frosted glass") effectively ground the abstract concept in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric details are vivid ("petals like embers," "crushed lavender"), effectively establishing the mood. However, the setting remains largely decorative; the "curse" is atmospheric rather than a concrete constraint that forces Liora to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the grotto's acoustics and the tide's rhythm constrain the conversation and trigger the protagonist's insights. The environment charges the final image (the damp sleeve, the rising water) with thematic necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sensory hierarchy is exceptional, prioritizing taste and touch (vibration) to define the setting. The contrast between the rusty, coppery bunker and the "honey and lightning" trellis creates a distinct, immersive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("prism terrace," "storm glass") but functions as a permissive "solution box" rather than a source of friction or constraint. The magical elements solve the conflict automatically (the vial absorbs the noise), reducing the environment to a backdrop that removes difficulty rather than shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details are vivid (ozone, peeling paint, damp earth), establishing a clear atmosphere. The environment actively yields clues (murals under bark), integrating setting with plot progression effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "smell of charcoal and old incense" and "tarnished bronze" effectively establish a mood of decay and reverence. The setting operates well as a psychological space, though it lacks concrete spatial grounding outside the immediate sensory details; it functions as a "white room" filled with metaphor, which fits the dream logic but limits physical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and reactive; the mushrooms dimming and flaring in response to the bolt integrates the environment directly into the conflict. Sensory details like "dampest corner" and the "scent of ozone" ground the high-concept premise in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "sepia reading room" is atmospherically established, anchoring the surreal elements effectively. The shift from the room as a container to the room as the "ledger" itself is a strong use of setting to drive the resolution. The specific lighting ("golden shadows") creates a consistent, if slightly repetitive, mood.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard is a vivid, high-pressure setting that mirrors the knight's internal state. Sensory details like "crushed silverleaf" and "ozone and old roses" are specific and evocative. The only slip is the "color no human eye had named," which relies on a label-only description rather than a concrete sensory equivalent, but the overall atmosphere is immersive and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The file room is anchored with sensory details ("sour tang," "yellowed paper"), though these are somewhat standard for the genre. The button and the specific contents of the file (Polaroid, shop class grade) add necessary specificity. The setting functionally constrains the action, though it feels a bit like a backdrop rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "auric lagoon" and "shimmering with trapped starlight" create a distinct, immersive atmosphere that grounds the magical elements. The sensory details of the booth (static, ozone, rust) effectively anchor the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto is atmospheric and integral to the plot, acting as an antagonist itself. However, the description leans heavily into purple abstraction ("weep rainbows," "skin of the earth") rather than grounding the magic in tactile, concrete reality.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the floating arbor and the specific, tactile monuments (thimble of salt, pebble stack) creating a vivid, memorable world. The environment actively shapes the narrative possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with evocative sensory details like "smelled of charcoal and half-burned letters" grounding the surrealism. The distinct environments (workshop, bone-yard, subterranean cavern) are vivid and support the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The foundry is an active participant in the story, its "weeping rust" and "corroded roof" mirroring the themes of decay and mending. The sensory details are specific and vivid, effectively creating a claustrophobic yet reverent atmosphere that constrains and colors Liora's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of Echo Gorge is established with specific, atmospheric sensory details ("mist curling," "wet earth"). The harp acts as an effective micro-setting that constrains the interaction. The atmosphere is consistent, though it leans heavily into a standard gothic-ethereal register.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "ultraviolet forest" is realized with vivid, specific sensory details ("bruise-colored glow," "black-leaved canopy") that establish a cohesive and oppressive atmosphere. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, with the roots and "singing" pillars serving as tangible forces that drive the ritual. The transition from the "bruise-colored" night to the "gold" dawn effectively mirrors the internal arc through environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, successfully evoking a liminal fantasy space with sensory details like "ropes groaning." However, the geography remains vague, serving as a backdrop for metaphors rather than a physical space that constrains the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "damp sawdust" and "forgotten acrobats" of dust evoke a tangible, specific sense of place. The environment actively participates in the narrative, with the dust and cracks serving as clues rather than just backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting title "glass orchard" promises specific imagery (trees, fruit, organic-glass fusion) that the text fails to deliver, leaving it as a standard "floating library" with "groaning shelves." Sensory details rely on genre defaults ("swirling sea of clouds," "books bound in frost") rather than specific, unique observation. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices; it merely provides a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is an active participant; the physics of the "time-strands" and the specific geography of the cathedral dictate the ritual's mechanics. The atmosphere supports the tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The resonance chamber is a vivid, active setting that constrains the character and reacts to the plot ("walls leaning in"). While the sensory details (ozone, brass, humming) are immersive, the "city of liars" outside remains somewhat abstract until the final summary, slightly reducing the grounding of the broader stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmospheric details like "ozone and old pennies" and the "scent of rain on dry earth" effectively ground the magical realism. The setting is vivid, though marred slightly by a few stock descriptions ("jagged maw," "windows like empty eyes") that feel less curated than the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and active; the archway functions effectively as both a physical constraint and a metaphysical loom. Sensory details are vivid (“salt-crusted,” “turbine-hum”), though the “ribcage of a leviathan” imagery leans on familiar coastal tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and visually evocative, effectively establishing the "umbral" tone requested. However, description often leans into abstraction ("forgotten skies," "perpetual twilight") rather than the concrete, tactile grounding that would heighten the sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, blending the mechanical zeppelin with the surreal, memory-saturated lagoon effectively. The "obsidian lagoon" and specific debris (spirals, notches) anchor the mystical elements in tangible, sensory details that constrain the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory details are vivid and transformative, effectively contrasting the "phosphorescent tide" of the ruin with the "cinnamon and charred meat" of the restoration. The setting acts as a dynamic participant, shifting physically in response to the protagonist's internal work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting of the rooftop garden over the ruined city is visceral and essential, constraining the action and deepening the theme. The contrast between the ancient pear trees and the &quot;glass and steel abyss&quot; charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the conflict; the "iron ribs," "frost-bitten glass," and the "vortex humming beneath the floor" actively constrain Liora’s movement and choices. Sensory details like "blue half-light" and "smell of ozone and old growth" create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere that heightens the pressure. The atrium feels like a crucible rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The strongest category. The tactile details—whale-sinew, salted rye, the vibration in the stone—ground the fable-like premise in a specific physical reality. The rope functions as a brilliant micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's choices through physics and material properties.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    The yellow lantern glass serves as a strong, grounding object that interacts with the plot. However, the broader setting relies on generic atmospheric descriptors ("forgotten machinery," "metal ribs") rather than specific, resistant details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the stained glass box serving as a strong, grounding artifact that organizes the imagery. The sensory details—from the "skeletal frames" to the "scent of wild thyme"—effectively anchor the mythic tone in concrete specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "garage sale" silo is a vivid, specific environment that integrates well with the central concept. The sensory details ("damp with melted snow," "cracked porcelain") ground the surreal premise in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting specificity is a strength, with vivid sensory details like the "cobalt lagoon" and "broken mussel shell" grounding the abstraction. The environment actively mirrors the thematic focus on imperfection, though the "bruise healing" simile feels slightly derivative.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral, functioning as both the antagonist (the unyielding stone) and the medium of the protagonist's art. Sensory details are vivid and thematic ("stone curved like a ribcage," "pulse of roots"), creating a tangible atmosphere that constrains and shapes the action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory detail is evocative and specific, particularly the &quot;wrong-order&quot; sculptures and the tactile warmth of the amber. The setting actively contributes to the mood and constraints of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, specific sensory details ("silt of drowned things," "humming faintly") that ground the abstract theme. The jetty and the "broken rib" imagery effectively constrain the action and establish the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on standard post-apocalyptic tropes ("twisted metal," "cracked wasteland," "gutted bus") without idiosyncratic novelty. While sensory details like the "smell of rain" work well to contrast the rust, the "glass dome garden" is a familiar genre staple that lacks a fresh, specific texture here.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere of the wrecked station is established with solid details like the "frost-bitten metal" and "curved glass." However, the "breathless hum" in thinned air strains physical credibility slightly, and the "cosmic dust" feels like a genre standard rather than a specific textural choice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with strong sensory details like "stars moved like schools of fish" anchoring the surreal atmosphere. The environment effectively mirrors the "wrongness" of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "whispering gallery" is an effective, atmospheric setting that exerts pressure on the protagonist through sound and memory. The chessboard functions well as a micro-setting that grounds the abstract magic, though the "wings" transformation leans heavily on dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting—a mountain that is also a library—is vivid, integral to the plot, and actively responsive (groaning, shivering). The atmosphere is cohesive, though it occasionally leans into "purple" description ("spiraling like the grooves of a fingerprint").

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "time-frozen" village and "platinum veins" creating a strong, surreal container for the story. The imagery of the threads and the labyrinth effectively grounds the magical realism, though the "sound that wasn't sound" leans slightly into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is visceral and functional; the "bone" nature of the canyon constrains movement (climbing the lattice) and enables the plot (carving the fissure). Sensory details like the "vibration of the coming chant" and "condensation of a thousand held breaths" effectively ground the high-concept fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The acid sea gnawing at the workshop creates visceral, active pressure that effectively constrains the scene. The environment is distinct and integral to the stakes, though the "brass ribs" imagery leans on genre staples.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established, but relies heavily on genre clichés (e.g., "bioluminescent moss," "jagged shadows like broken teeth") that reduce specificity. The "warped planks" and "ochre" offer grounded details, but the magical elements feel like stock fantasy assets.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically charged, with the lighthouse’s "iron ribs humming" and the "scent of crushed lavender" grounding the magical elements effectively. The sensory details strongly support the tone, though the "bruise" simile feels slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Strong atmospheric grounding with tactile details like the "warped floorboards" and the "greenish bloom" of the censer. The setting actively mirrors the protagonist's internal decay and reconstruction, effectively functioning as an extension of character.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ravine and orchard are active tools rather than static backdrops; the roots explicitly "swallow" the secret, and the truffle’s physical properties (rough surface, paste) enable the resolution. The "wet mouth" of the ravine charges the final image with necessary atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and serves the tone well, particularly the "jars of preserved storms" and the "opal dock." These elements ground the magical realism effectively. The environment actively participates in the ritual (saltwater), though the "mist" and "twilight" verge on standard atmospheric tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sensory details like the smell of "crushed mint" and the "insistent growl" of the creek create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that grounds the fantasy elements. The cavern’s bioluminescence provides a stark, effective contrast to the mundane "Hush" of his shop, reinforcing the thematic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details like "cobalt stone" and "air tasted of copper" establish a vivid, distinct atmosphere. However, some descriptors ("wind hummed like a blade," "thin air") lean on familiar fantasy tropes rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using the "ember nexus" to establish a mood of industrial fantasy. Sensory details are strong ("veins of molten copper," "ozone and old parchment"), though they occasionally veer into purple prose that distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is tightly integrated with the narrative arc; the cabin functions as a trap and the grave as a ticking clock. The specific details—the dying light, the pine needles, the "timber bones"—successfully create a claustrophobic atmosphere that pressures the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strength, effectively establishing the damp, quiet shop and the water clock mechanism. However, the sensory work occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("curled through the alley like breath on glass") that calls attention to the writer rather than the scene. The shop feels vivid, but the exterior world is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific ("obsidian," "ozone," "lattice of frost"), effectively grounding the fantasy elements. The environment constrains the pacing and atmosphere, fitting the "breath between storms" concept well.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sensory details of the archive ("yellowed paper and old roses") and the magical perfume ("sharp, green tang of sap") are evocative and precise. The setting effectively pressures the characters, contrasting the preservation of the past with the impending destruction of the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, utilizing the "infinite library" trope with some vivid, if occasionally derivative, imagery (books of bone and skin). While the "fractal corridors" and "collapsing logic" establish the mood, the sensory details often lean on abstract nouns rather than tactile particularity until the final garden scene.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hydraulic nature of the clock provides a fresh, tactile constraint on the standard time-manipulation trope, particularly the image of water turning black. The specific atmospheric details ("wet slate," "burnt copper") effectively ground the fantastical elements. The setting is not just a backdrop but the mechanical interface for the plot's central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bioluminescent environment is vividly rendered and actively constrains the interaction; the "permeable walls" and "teal shadows" serve the theme well. The setting functions effectively as a micro-world that mirrors the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details are specific and evocative ("wet paper and old glue," "fractured into a dozen jagged reflections"). The atmosphere of the library effectively mirrors Lila's internal state. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, shifting from a place of study to a threshold of the surreal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is tactile and vivid, using sensory details like "ozone," "damp metal," and "liquid constellation" to ground the magical realism. The environment effectively isolates the characters, though it functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with "salt-bleached wood" and "water the color of old parchment" effectively grounding the magic. The sensory details of the blooming jetty and walnut ink are integrated well into the action, establishing a strong, specific atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "stubborn ghosts of timetables" and "boots crunching on glass" grounding the fable-like tone. The environment actively shapes the plot, serving as both the obstacle and the resource for Lena’s trade-based tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly realized, with synesthetic details ("salt for sorrow," "copper for longing") that effectively ground the magical premise. The atmosphere is consistent and immersive, blending the mechanical (compass ring) with the organic (humming trees) seamlessly. The setting actively shapes Elian’s perception, functioning as more than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "unbending" anomaly functions as both atmosphere and a plot mechanism that physically manifests the theme. The sensory details ("ozone and old parchment," "vibration that settled in Elias’s ribs") ground the high-concept premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric, establishing the "luminous harbor" effectively. However, specificity often dissolves into poetic abstraction ("fracturing into a thousand trembling notes") rather than grounding the reader in concrete, sensory details of the environment or the vintage equipment.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric tropes ("charred parchment," "soot," "desert wind") rather than specific, tactile grounding. While the spatial relationship between the protagonist and the pillar is clear, the "lost civilization archive" feels like a standard fantasy backdrop without distinct, choice-constraining features.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "sound wave garden" and "auric lagoon" are vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively grounding the surreal premise. The setting functions well as a tool for the protagonist's agency (using the reeds as resonators), though the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hush of the universe") that distances the reader from the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "labyrinth of shipping containers" is a vivid, constraining environment that effectively pressures the protagonist. While atmospheric details are strong, modifiers like "sickly greens" and "frost-kissed" lean on convention rather than specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.7)
    The specific imagery of the "dental mirror" on the "cobalt dock" is vivid and grounding. However, the mechanics of "weaving" light with shutters are abstract, making the physical reality of the communication difficult to visualize.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library and grotto are vividly described with sensory details like "ozone and old parchment," though the "bruise in the mist" simile is visually confusing (bruises are dark/purple, cobalt is bright blue). The setting does heavy lifting for the atmosphere but feels static and ornamental rather than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric details like "salt-stiffened ropes" and the crumbling edges of Veyth create a vivid, specific setting. The "sublittoral fringe" is used effectively to ground the magical elements in a quasi-scientific reality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral to the mood; the "indifferent gods" of the turbines and the "splintered porch" mirror Lena’s internal state. The dried bouquet and the whittling wood serve as excellent micro-settings that ground the abstract grief in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and active; the quartz colonnade and frozen lake aren't just backdrops but participants that react to the protagonist. The sensory details (humming vibration, shifting glyphs) effectively ground the abstract magical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong sensory atmosphere with specific textures (fern fronds, brass edge, crushed petals) creates a vivid, consistent mood. The glassblower’s courtyard and the post-phoenix ash are well-integrated into the sensory experience, grounding the more abstract emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, specific details—warm copper, extinct instruments, the carbide lamp—that successfully ground the abstract magical realism. The environment actively constrains the interaction between sound and light, serving as more than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is excellent, with the observatory’s "brass telescopes" and "cracked glass" actively framing the protagonist's isolation. The integration of the jewelry workbench as a micro-setting for the emotional work is specific and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The atmosphere is excellent, blending noir tropes with a post-crypto aesthetic to create a vivid, tactile setting. The rain-beaded skylight and the physical tools (tape, cards) are integrated well, serving as active filters for the protagonist’s perception rather than just static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Vivid, atmospheric description ("rust and amber," "bronze prism") establishes a strong mood. However, abstract phrasing ("atoms of nostalgia") occasionally detaches the setting from physical reality, making the environment feel more like a metaphor than a place.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like books "blooming with light." The imagery anchors the magical realism effectively, though it leans on familiar genre tropes (floating library, yellowed parchment). The environment functions well as a container for the story's logic, even if it doesn't strictly constrain the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the mist, workshop, and sensory details (herbs, damp earth) vividly ground the reader. The setting actively reflects Elias's internal state ("mist-choked workshop" clearing to "pale streaks of morning").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmospheric pressure is excellent; the "splinter" tower, frost, and humming ivy create a tangible, claustrophobic environment that constrains the protagonist. The setting acts effectively as an antagonist, forcing the internal confrontation through sensory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The projection booth is rendered with specific, evocative details ("buttered popcorn instead of dust," "ozone") that ground the magical elements. The atmosphere supports the melancholic tone well, though the storm outside borders on pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is described with vivid, if standard, fantasy imagery ("liquid darkness," "veined with silver"), but it fails to constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment acts as a facilitator for the plot rather than a source of pressure or atmosphere that resists the character.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and cohesive, effectively blending industrial decay ("iron veins") with bioluminescent renewal. The environment actively mirrors the internal shift from rust to bloom, though the "divergent archive" concept remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mechanical rainforest is rendered with vivid, specific imagery like "brass trunks" and "binary rustles" that effectively grounds the surreal premise. The setting establishes a strong, consistent atmosphere, though it serves more as a backdrop than a source of constraining pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sensory details of the ridgeway—damp wool, salt, mist—are vivid and establish a strong, distinct atmosphere. The setting effectively mirrors the liminal internal state of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid and active, with the "cobalt" turning to "bruise" providing a spectacular, emotionally charged image at the climax. The atmosphere of heavy, repressible silence is palpable and constrains the characters effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist; the "sagging" shelves and "stuttering" constellations actively pressure the narrative. The sensory details—iron gall ink, basalt, dust—are specific and tactile, grounding the high-concept fantasy. The library’s physical reaction to the climax integrates the environment directly into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, grounding the speculative elements in the tactile reality of the "clink-clank" of gauges and the resin-coated table. The sensory details of the rising water and the decaying station effectively support the mood of inevitable loss and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, tactile details ("toes curling against the grit," "brass warm against her palms") that ground the speculative elements. The environment feels lived-in and specific, successfully establishing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and functional, with specific sensory details like the black sand and mineral-rich steam grounding the ritual. The environment actively participates in the climax, though the "healing the wasteland" imagery treads familiar ground.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is active, not static; the cypress tree, the wind, and the stone wall directly constrain the action and facilitate the somatic grounding. The specific sensory details—citrus oil, rough stone, salt air—anchor the abstract concepts of grief and time in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistent, effectively blending the library and lighthouse. However, the reliance on mutable, metaphorical descriptions ("walls a slow exhale") prevents the physical constraints from feeling solid or inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "graveyard of pauses" with frozen victims is a compelling, highly specific atmospheric concept that anchors the stakes physically. Sensory details like the "humming" air and "wind-carved" earth create a vivid, cohesive world. The setting actively demonstrates the thief's impact, integrating background and plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    The atmosphere of the Silent Vaults is the story's strongest asset; the "swallowing sound" of the snow and the "frost-laced" quiet effectively ground the stakes. The sensory details are vivid, though occasionally dipping into melodrama ("cathedral of secrets").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the tactile "vibration" of the panic outside felt through the glass. The atmospheric contrast between the humid, breathing interior and the dry "scream of dust" outside effectively grounds the stakes in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "sound wave garden" is not just backdrop but a physics engine for the story; the fisher digs where the soil *refuses* to hum. Imagery like "teeth made of broken echoes" and "air split like wet silk" creates a vivid, consistent sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is established with vivid, specific details like the "rosewood pen" and "brass telescopes" that ground the atmosphere. However, the "above clouds" requirement is not explicitly realized, leaving the verticality vague.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, effectively blending the analog (wax cylinders) with the speculative (firmware, amber). The sensory details, like the "hiss" of the firmware and the "warmth" of the amber, ground the magical elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto is a vivid, sensory-rich environment that actively shapes the plot through its acoustics. The atmosphere is tangible, though "mist coiled... like a held breath" is a slightly standard opener.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details like "charred cedar" and "cobalt blue" effectively ground the scene, creating a vivid atmosphere. However, the tone is disrupted by the clinical/sci-fi descriptor "retrocognitively," which clashes sharply with the established mythic/fantasy aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a strong, distinct atmosphere ("bruised silver," "burnt caramel"). The setting feels lived-in and active, though occasionally the descriptive density threatens to stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    The sensory details in the opening (ozone, burnt sugar) effectively ground the scene in a tangible reality. However, as the magic takes over, the setting descriptions become more abstract ("walls breathed," "node in a lattice"), losing the specific gritty texture established in the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the bioluminescent, breathing cave is rendered with specific, tactile sensory details ("exhaled salt and damp," "scent of ozone"). The integration of the tech (wrist display) with the organic setting is seamless, though the cave's "instability" is mentioned but never physically felt as a constraint on movement.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with high-density tactile imagery ("walls veined with fossilized resin," "water tastes of iron") that effectively grounds the fable logic. The atmosphere is cohesive and supports the mythic tone without over-explaining the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is active and thematic; the thaw mirrors Lena’s return to action without being overly intrusive. Specific sensory details—the scent of thawing earth, the mist swallowing sound—ground the scene effectively. The environment actively constrains the meeting (mist hiding the approach) and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is immersive and inextricably linked to the plot; the fog and ticking gutters create tangible pressure. The sensory details—silvered nothing, the weight of damp—effectively ground the fantastical premise in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.0)
    Visual descriptions of the oasis ("hives split open like old wounds") are evocative and establish a strong mood. However, the functional logic of the setting fails; the presence of a working kiln in an abandoned wasteland is unearned, and the lack of fuel or preparation details reduces the setting to a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vertical constraint of the fire escape and the scarcity of soil are excellent physical limitations that ground the scene. The atmosphere is vivid, though the "blade left too long in the rain" simile is physically contradictory (rain rusts iron; it doesn't silver it) which slightly mars the visual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "tidal library" and "atomically reflective" sundial grounding the surreal logic effectively. Sensory details like "old ship timber," "wet feathers," and "gunpowder" create a tactile, immersive world that supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with "damp wood" and "wet stone" grounding the more ethereal elements. The lotus temple and floating walkway establish a strong lyric space, though the environment functions more as a static backdrop for the ritual than a source of friction or constraint on Liora’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The basement setting is grounded with specific details like "smudged" ink and "old physics hall" equipment. The atmosphere supports the "ethereal grit" tone well, though the broader campus chaos is told in summary before the student's arrival validates it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, blending tactile claustrophobia with surreal, high-concept imagery ("petals of rock," "spatial mutiny"). The setting acts as an active antagonist during the climax, with the shifting room exerting palpable pressure on the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.5)
    Setting specificity is exceptional, particularly the juxtaposition of the industrial quarry and the submerged ballroom. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's sensory experience and charges the final image, fulfilling the high-band requirement for setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific, blending scientific instrumentality with eldritch atmospheric pressure. The "Eye of the Maw" and the static-charged air create a tangible constraint that shapes Elias's choices. Orientation is immediate, grounding the reader in the specific isolation of the station.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pullout is anchored well, and the glass flake acts as a strong micro-setting that constrains attention. However, specificity suffers from reliance on genre clichés ("ozone and burnt sugar") and some opaque descriptions ("scaffold wrap flutters") that blur the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the rotting circus train with the "glass skeletons" of the tech bust is vivid and thematically potent. Sensory details—"damp wood," "old greasepaint," "bent iron"—effectively ground the philosophical musings.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is evocative, with specific details like "brass gears" and "daylily-pressed telegram" grounding the scene. However, the "temple ruins materializing" leans into vague magical imagery that lacks the tactile specificity of the observatory itself.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "rotting blossoms" and "needle-teeth" of the plant providing tactile grounding. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, particularly the cold and the sensory details of the orchard's "remembering." Specificity is generally high, though some descriptors (e.g., "black and still") lean toward genre standard.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if conventional, fantasy markers ("cobalt glade," "shifting hedge"), and the maze topiary clipping serves as an effective micro-setting element. However, reliance on "time's greedy mouth" and other abstractions prevents the environment from feeling like a tangible, dangerous physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "roots twisting through ribs" and "blossom that drank from a pelvis’s hollow" are vivid, specific details that ground the fantasy elements. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant (roots pulling, exhaling) that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent; sensory details like the "old coffee," "damp cardboard," and the "ghost of a drum machine" blasting create a vivid, tangible atmosphere. The quarry’s specific acoustics integrate well with the thematic focus on echoes and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Sky Arbor is a vivid, integral setting that constrains action (magnetic pull on tools, the climb). Sensory details like the "weeping bark" and "ironwood" effectively ground the fantastical premise in physical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically charged, with the "titan-gear" elements and "tidal atrium" providing a specific, surreal textures that constrain the magic. The physical rules of the space (stairs ascending downward, ink fountains) are a bit standard for the genre, but the specific interaction of the moon's pull on Elias's mechanical parts adds excellent tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, cohesive imagery of the bioluminescent cave and the "skeletal" bunker. The atmosphere of "resonant hush" is palpable and supports the fable-like tone, though the "pulsing veins" and "electric air" lean slightly toward adjectival saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting of the dried riverbed and the ivy-choked station is vivid and thematically integrated, mirroring Elias’s internal desolation. The sensory details—damp stone, peeling maps, cracked earth—are specific and tangible, anchoring the memory-heavy narrative in a concrete physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the library's physical reaction (warping, collapsing) directly pressures the protagonist's choices. The "parchment stretched over bone" is a vivid, specific detail that enhances the atmosphere. The environment effectively externalizes the internal stakes of unspoken words.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is integral to the action; the telescope weight is the tool of resolution, and the wisteria vines actively constrain the protagonist's conscience. Sensory details are vivid and thematic (cold ice, violet scent), charging the atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is evocative, establishing a strong mood of "radiant hush." However, the description suffers from purple abstraction ("bones of forgotten winds," "petrified mist") that privileges sound over sensory logic. The setting feels more like a poetic construct than a physical place with tactile constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant; the moss pulses, the vines recoil, and the grotto "exhales." The specific atmospheric details ("twilight just before the stars remember themselves," though slightly purple, builds the mythic tone) create a vivid, immersive world that constrains and enables the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is tactile and atmospheric, effectively grounding the fable-like tone. The lighthouse is not just a backdrop but a tool for the resolution. The "screaming" chimes and "howling" wind, however, push the description briefly into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is excellent; the &quot;grotto’s pull&quot; and &quot;magnetic field&quot; are integrated into the character's physical experience, acting as a functional constraint on the trance. The sensory details (scent of sage, hum of lodestone, prismatic threads) effectively ground the metaphysical elements in a concrete place.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like the "groaning" bone towers and the vibration of the arrowhead. The setting feels distinct and oppressive. However, phrases like "bruised twilight" drift into cliché, and the geography remains somewhat abstract ("white room") beyond the immediate perch.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid, contrasting the icy, organic spire with the automated city below effectively. Specific details like "frostbloom" and the "veins of gold" ground the scene well. However, some descriptors drift into standard fantasy rhetoric ("jagged tooth," "storm-wracked sky"), missing opportunities for fresher sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sensory environment is vivid and immersive, effectively utilizing the synesthesia concept to blend sound and color. The "library smelled of brine and old promises" and the "salt-crusted deck" ground the magical elements in tactile reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist (cold water, jagged ribs) and shapes the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the "amber walls" and "trapped last light" create a distinct, claustrophobic yet beautiful constraint that shapes the narrative. The sensory details of the coins and the static ground the abstract cosmic concepts effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like the "rust brass," "wax cylinders," and the coordinate "thirty-four south" grounding the mythic elements. The transition of light within the observatory is handled with sensory precision, effectively creating atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit purple, imagery ("spine of frozen lightning"). The dripping water serves as a nice micro-setting detail that grounds the magic system. However, the description often leans into decorative high-fantasy tropes rather than constraining the character's physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details are vivid, establishing a strong sense of place with the "damp stone" and "skeletal trees." However, the setting occasionally dissolves into pathetic fallacy, where the environment mirrors the protagonist's emotions too perfectly to feel resistant or real.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting details are vivid and establish a strong, magical atmosphere ("glass trees," "blue flame"). The transition from the organic orchard to the crystalline valley provides a distinct visual progression that anchors the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, particularly the "arbor" and the verticality above the clouds. The sensory details ("cool press," "ozone") ground the scene well, though "bioluminescent spores" leans on a familiar trope.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of the floating dojo is vivid and atmospheric ("moss-slicked edges," "amber fluid"), effectively mirroring the protagonist's fragmented state. The storm serves as a solid pressure cooker, though the visualization of "history rewriting" remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting specificity is excellent, anchoring the abstract concept in tactile details like the "beetle-shell" ink and the "residue of failed solvers." The environment actively mirrors the thematic shift from mechanical puzzles to organic growth. The brook functions as a constant, grounding presence that contrasts effectively with the artificiality of the escape room.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sensory environment of the tunnel—the "echo chamber" and the mechanical roar—is vivid and serves as a strong metaphor for Elias's internal state. The spatial relationship between the damp tunnel and the warm household creates a functional vertical geometry that grounds the abstract conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but the medium of the story itself, transforming from a "frozen garden" into a "breathing page." This transformation charges the final image powerfully. The sensory details ("mist... like a second skin," "sickly dawn") effectively establish the atmosphere of "foggy lucidity."

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is active and distinct, with the "ember nexus" and "glass garden" acting as constraints that shape the magic and the ending image. Sensory details like "sickly gold" and "unnatural cold" effectively ground the fantastical elements in a specific physical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the "rusted radio tower city" with the cosmic "gorge" creates a vivid, distinct atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the imagery, particularly the "skeletal transmitters" and the "old parabola dish."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and immersive, effectively using the "grotto" and "currents" to constrain the ferry's movement, though some descriptors ("liquid silver," "trapped starlight") lean on familiar genre tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story’s engine, vividly realized with "pulsing geometries" and "fractal irises." The environment actively participates in the plot, acting as the storage medium for the memories and the agent of the climax. The sensory details ("beeswax and old paper," "scent of rain") ground the surrealism effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The benthic setting is vivid and integral, acting as a physical constraint that shapes the central conflict of blindness versus sight. Details like the "crushing dark" and "bioluminescent glow" effectively ground the metaphysical navigation concept in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Specific details like "pennies left on a corpse’s eyes" and "jagged blues" create a distinct atmosphere. However, the atrium itself functions mostly as a backdrop; the environment doesn't force tactical shifts or constrain movement.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details ("thick, coiled serpents," "ghost of data") effectively build the "crashing hush" tone. While some descriptors are standard ("damp concrete," "jagged shadows"), the integration of the setting with the core concept of living cables creates a distinct, immersive environment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    The underground garden functions as an active antagonist rather than a backdrop, exerting pressure through sensory details like "whispering basil" and "hungry" loam. The bioluminescence and tactile elements ground the surreal events perfectly, constraining Elias's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong atmospheric grounding with vivid, specific details like the "prism shards" and "black sand." The setting actively shapes the method of capture (refracting light), integrating the environment well into the narrative action rather than just serving as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional; the "sunken orchard" and "glass bones" of the greenhouse create a unique, constraining atmosphere that shapes every beat. The physical environment—water, silt, wreckage—directly influences the protagonist's tactics and the story's mood. This element anchors the surreal premise in visceral reality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; sensory details like the "smell of wax," the "chipped teacup," and the "hush of an empty playground swing" create a vivid, cohesive world.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details are vivid ("brass cables singing," "frozen roses"), but the description frequently relies on abstract pathetic fallacy ("sky's indifference") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strength, effectively blending the technical (gondola, telescope) with the ethereal. The clouds function well as a projection screen for memory, though the "city map" imagery is a bit standard. The setting actively frames the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sensory environment is vivid and strictly filtered through the POV's tactile focus ("breaths pressed into metal," "scent of sap"). The setting is not just a backdrop but the mechanism of the climax; the physical destruction of the library charges the final realization about limits.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details like "brass portholes" and "starling murmurations" establish a vivid steampunk aesthetic. However, the hopscotch board feels like an ungrounded prop inserted for whimsy rather than an integrated part of the world's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like "salt-stiffened leather," "waxed canvas," and "book bound in fish-skin" grounding the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory details like "beeswax," "old copper," and "scent of gunpowder" effectively ground the fable-like tone. The atmosphere supports the theme well, though the "ruins" remain somewhat abstract until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    The swaying treetop setting is excellent, acting as a physical constraint that actively drives the protagonist's psychological need for stillness. Olfactory details are specific and purposefully filtered through the herbalist’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered, with the environment actively responding (humming, groaning, thawing) to the protagonist's actions. The sensory details effectively bridge the gap between sound and light, though the reliance on standard elemental tropes prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with effective atmospheric details like "blue-gray dusk" and "frost-bitten earth." While the "driftwood" adds a unique textural element, its presence in a mountain range feels slightly unmoored without further grounding context.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and active, blending the sensory details of the trade (ink, lead) with the fantastical (crushed topaz, halo fragment). The workshop is not a static backdrop; the "topaz dust raining from the ceiling" during the climax integrates the environment directly into the emotional turn. The halo fragment functions effectively as both a tool and a micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("aurora’s pulse," "ridgeway"), fitting the mythic tone well. However, the "fade" and "abyss" remain somewhat abstract concepts that function more as backdrops than tactile constraints shaping the courier's minute-by-minute tactics. The bridge of living wood is a strong image, though it arrives as a magical solution rather than a utilized environmental tool.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quartz arbor is a vivid, integral setting that mirrors the central motif of refraction and shattering. Details like "skeleton of light" and "fractured rainbows" ground the supernatural elements in a specific physical space. The environment actively supports the climax rather than just serving as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere is distinct and sensory, effectively blending the "salt-worn" physical reality with the "static of old radio broadcasts." However, the description occasionally slips into abstraction ("teeth of time," "color that bent") that weakens the specificity of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "floating rock" and "mist" establishing a strong tone of isolation. However, specific imagery occasionally lapses into twee over-articulation, such as the steam curling into a literal "question mark," which breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere is established with consistent tone, but the setting relies on generic descriptors ("storm howling," "ancient oaks"). The labyrinth functions as a passive container for the magical realism elements rather than a spatial constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the mica windows in silver trees providing a specific, vivid locus for the magic. The sensory details of the greenhouse are grounded and tactile, though the "mirror world" context remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with specific details like the "bakery whose ovens never cooled" and the "scent of ozone" grounding the magical elements. The physical space of the library integrates well with the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, effectively blending the surreal (backward river) with sensory grounding (scent of yeast, cold copper). The setting of the abandoned tea house provides a solid anchor, though the rapid passage of time dilutes the sense of immediate physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, offering vivid sensory details like "books bound in frostbitten leather" and the "smell of ozone" that ground the fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, particularly the gustatory mapping of weather (salt, copper, ozone). The environment reacts to the character in a way that creates a strong, cohesive atmosphere. "Terrestrially cosmic" is an oxymoron that blurs rather than sharpens the image, but the "lavender bluffs" ground the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal cave is rendered with vivid sensory detail (&quot;wet stone,&quot; &quot;prismatic ghosts&quot;), effectively grounding the surreal events in a tangible atmosphere. The setting actively supports the lighting effects crucial to the imagery, though the transition to the magical hollow feels spatially convenient.

    The setting details—copper haze, greenhouse domes—create a suffocating atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The zinc plate functions as a tactile, transforming key that anchors the climax. The environment actively pressures the character, forcing the journey underground.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong textural details like the "wired bone," "copper chimes," and the "pale blue" ice. The contrast between the "humming" bluff and the brittle world below is established effectively through sensory language, though the "world below" relies on slightly generic abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)

The dome serves as a meaningful constraint, and the contrast between the "jagged rainbows" inside and the "untamed" dunes outside charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with sensory competence ("cracked tiles," "jasmine"), but relies on stock genre markers of the "curio shop" aesthetic without unique specificity. While the atmosphere is cohesive, the description often filters through heavy-handed similes rather than direct, tactile interaction that would heighten the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmospheric details—greenish glow, corroded metal, pressure—are excellent and serve the tension. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active constraint (the crushing ocean) that heightens the stakes of the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not just backdrop but physics; the "salt crystal chamber" and "pockets of gravity" actively constrain the ritual and generate the climax. The sensory detail—ozone, old pennies, the clicking hook—grounds the weird elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic fantasy signifiers (moss, reeds, moonlight) without unique grounding details. The description creates a mood but does not constrain the character's tactics or choices beyond the basic requirements of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistently uncanny, effectively blurring the line between the physical apartment and the metaphysical text. While specific details like the "ink-stained fingers" and "warm seal" are tactile and grounding, the reliance on language-based similes for natural elements borders on heavy-handed at times.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmosphere is established early with sensory details ("scent of ozone and old roses"), though the specific mechanics of the garden's "lattice" remain vague. The description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("breathed in the twilight") rather than grounding the reader in the physical labor of digging.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "heritage rose thorn" serves as an excellent micro-setting tool that constraints the action and drives the magic system. The sanctuary atmosphere is cohesive, though descriptors like "pearl twilight" and "dripping stalactites" border on generic fantasy staples. The setting successfully pressures the mood but essentially serves as a backdrop for the internal drama.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; details like "sticky with sap" and "ghost of static" create a visceral, specific texture. The "stillpoint" environment effectively constrains the pacing and forces the protagonist's focus inward.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt portico is not just scenery; it actively "pulses," "drinks," and reflects, functioning as the central tool and constraint of the climax. The sensory details of the observatory (ozone, cold glass) ground the fantastical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "feral loft" and the auditory landscape of the dunes are rendered with specific, atmospheric detail that grounds the story effectively. While some imagery leans toward the melodramatic ("sun bled," "restless giants"), the sensory environment consistently reflects the protagonist’s internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sensory details of the marina and the resonator are vivid and specific ("dust that glittered like crushed pearl"). The setting actively constrains the plot (thinning ice), though the spatial layout of the marina itself remains slightly impressionistic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("single breath of glass," "iron bones singing"), establishing a strong, mythic atmosphere. The setting effectively grounds the abstract concepts, though the "sanctuary" remains somewhat vague as a physical space beyond the cliff edge.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)

The atmosphere of subterranean pressure effectively mirrors the narrative stakes. The environment actively constrains the character, particularly the water pressure acting as a ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The shop atmosphere is established with sensory details ("lavender," "stained-glass"), though the "prison box" smelling of lavender strains credibility. The setting supports the tone well, creating a "vibrant hush" that frames the action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the "acid sea" acts as both antagonist and testing ground, while the workshop’s "brass ribs" and "fractured light" shape the atmosphere.

Specific sensory details like the "half-chewed schematics" and "sliver of obsidian" ground the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting of the "data grave" is atmospheric, effectively using light and sound to build a ghostly digital tone. However, the imagery is occasionally repetitive (using "star" similes twice for high-impact descriptions) and some descriptions lean into cyberpunk clichés ("confetti across the Kuiper Belt").

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "gnarled apple trees" and "smell of wax and damp wool" grounding the fantastical elements. The juxtaposition of the orchard and the ice floes creates a strong, constrained atmosphere that serves the story's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere is vivid and sensory ("violet dusk," "smelled of crushed grapes"), effectively establishing the autumnal mood. However, the lush description borders on overwrought ("amber pavilion sagged under the weight of autumn’s gold"), distancing the reader from the grit of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the "kinetic parapet" and "murmuring pavilion" are not just backdrops but active constraints on the ritual. Sensory details like "crushed mint" and the "warm metal curve" create a vivid, tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with clear, vivid imagery (lavender, rust, vines), providing a coherent backdrop. However, the descriptors often lean into standard atmospheric tropes ("purple haze," "metal bones") rather than specific, lived-in details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "sonically reflective" crystal serves as a strong micro-setting element that constrains the action and drives the central discovery. Sensory details like "fractured gold" and the "groaning" ladder effectively ground the abstract premise in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but spatially confused; "lunar observatory above the clouds" with "trees that didn't exist" blurs the line between location and metaphor to the point of disorientation. Specifics like "silvered domes" are vivid, but the physical grounding of the repair work is overtaken by abstract imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "radiant haven" is atmospherically described but spatially vague; it is unclear if this is a literal high-altitude location, a sci-fi setting, or a metaphor. Sensory details are present (chamomile, lavender, lemon) but lean on generic soothing tropes rather than specific, grounded textures that constrain the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The observatory and the "pulsing stars" create a solid atmospheric start, and the "floating isle" is a functional, if late, addition. However, the world-building is brittle; the "Spooning" concept is integrated as a proper noun that clashes violently with the serious, arcane tone of the rest of the piece, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "waxy green" and "pulsed faintly" grounding the magical elements. The garden functions well as a pressure cooker for the confrontation, though the transition from maze to garden is a standard portal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric work is strong, effectively using the grotto and mist to mirror the theme of "stillness." The sensory details ("damp hush," "cools against skin") ground the lyric mode well, though the descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("trapped storm," "impatient tongues").

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but structural; the server racks acting as planters and the icicles as maps constrain the characters' options and provide the tools for resolution. The specific imagery of the data center reclaimed by nature charges the final metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "feral nexus" is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal chaos. The interplay of mist, river, and ink grounds the magical realism, though the description occasionally dips into standard gothic tropes ("coiled... like a living thing").

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, but relies on stock fantasy imagery ("liquid gold," "spun copper") rather than fresh, specific details. The environment reacts to the plot, satisfying functional requirements, but lacks a constraining texture that forces unique tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, providing strong sensory grounding ("skeletal trees," "hollowed husks"). The environment acts as a constraint (silence, frost) that shapes the ritual's pacing and method effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is excellent; the physical properties of the marble cavern are causally integrated with the mechanism's function. The "weeping" ice and specific lighting angles create a tangible, atmospheric constraint that shapes the locksmith's method.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory details—the smell of cedar, the rain on glass, the ash wood—effectively ground the abstract grief. The skylight and rain serve as a functional atmospheric constraint that mirrors the internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as an antagonist that physically manifests the story's themes. The "kinetic lagoon" is vivid and integral to the plot, constraining choices and delivering the final consequence; the atmosphere of "fractured stillness" is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "burnt sugar" and "algae-thick water" grounding the fabulist elements. The metaphor of the floor plan as a "circuit board" effectively filters the environment through the protagonist's engineer POV.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmosphere of decay is consistent, but the "shadow" imagery defies logic: if the shadow is "long" (morning), it respects the hour, contradicting the claim that it "defied the hour." The timeline is slightly blurred between "twilight" (opening) and "morning broadcast" (middle) without clear anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The specific physical details—the "sliver of fulgurite glass," the "braided ledger"—ground the scene effectively. The atmosphere is vivid, though the "creeping fog" and "swallowing" harbor rely on standard atmospheric tropes rather than fresh sensory interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and clearly anchored, but the description often prioritizes "purple" aesthetics over grounding details. The garden feels more like a stage set for the metaphors than a physical space constraining the character.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The physical setting is vivid and specific, particularly the "obsidian lagoon" and "jagged" sand, grounding the abstraction of the theme. However, the pathetic fallacy at the end ("lagoon’s surface rippled with gold") softens the otherwise sharp imagery. The setting creates atmosphere but stops short of imposing physical constraints on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "city of forgotten fountains" is rendered with tactile specificity—rust, green coins, calcified wishes—anchoring the fantasy in decay. The atmosphere effectively mirrors Liora's internal state of being "stuck," creating a cohesive aesthetic container for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nebula garden is established with vivid, consistent imagery that anchors the ethereal tone. The "petals of ionized gas" and the "slow gravity" effectively blend the cosmic with the botanical. While the setting is atmospheric, it remains somewhat static until the transit path opens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sensory environment is vivid and active; the greenhouse acting as a lantern with butterfly patterns is a standout image that charges the ending. The setting directly influences the atmosphere and the final realization, integrating well with the "hollows" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting details—the obsidian ridge, the salt-spray, the groaning gears—are not merely atmospheric but exert causal pressure on the clock and the protagonist. The environment feels hostile and lived-in, actively constraining the character's sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, anchored by the specific "cobalt silo" and the sensory details of the knots (scent of lavender, sound of breath). The "velveteen gloom" tone is established through imagery even without the phrase, though some descriptions ("ribs groaning like old bones") lean toward gothic cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, anchoring the abstract concept in concrete imagery ("black glass surface," "glass domes half-sunk"). However, descriptions occasionally veer into ornamental territory ("shimmering blackness thick with potential") rather than strictly constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset; the sensory details of the "damp paper," "coiling mist," and "warm brass" create a tangible, lived-in world. The environment actively presses on the character, with the mist and radio glow serving as dynamic constraints rather than static backdrops. The "dust" effectively functions as a micro-setting element that bridges the physical and the thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    The opening line’s "smelled of... old secrets" is a cliché abstraction that weakens the sensory authority immediately. While the "vanishing point" concept is intriguing, the setting remains largely a generic atmospheric backdrop ("dim light," "damp plaster") rather than a specific, pressure-exerting environment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is visceral and active; the "old copper," "silt," and rising water actively constrain the protagonist’s choices. The environment serves as both a resource for his collection and the weapon of his destruction, integrating perfectly with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with the "velvet library" and "amber" light creating a vivid container for the scene. The rosette functions excellently as a micro-setting, grounding abstract themes of loss in "lacewood petals" and "old honey." The integration of the autumn season mirrors the narrative arc of stripping down to essentials.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with rust, glass, and sensory details ("silence... thick and warm as rising dough") grounding the fable. The greenhouse feels lived-in and specific, though the setting becomes less tactile once the narrative accelerates into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory-rich details like the "scent of ozone" and the "humming" tower. The contrast between the rigid city grid and the wild drones is spatially clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details ("hair ribbon stiff with salt," "weathered dock") that actively shape the mood. The environment participates in the narrative arc (streetlights humming, bay sighing) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and active, acting as a pressure chamber that shapes the narrative; the "pressure" of Liora's voice and the "silt like fallen stars" create a tangible atmosphere. The environment actively constrains choice (the dome's seam, the mosaic), though the score is capped by the Global 9+ gate (Q2 &lt; 9.0). The imagery of the foxglove stain becoming pigment is a standout integration of object and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The minimalist setting is handled well, with the sensory focus on the "gray haze" and the tactile "thud" of boots creating a coherent atmosphere. The specific detail of the "seam where the stair met the riser" grounds the surreal glitch in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the rooftop greenhouse and the "dying fig tree" as a canvas provide a vivid, constraining environment. Specific details like the "veins pulsing" and "script of curved thorns" ground the magical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric detail is the story’s strength, with evocative imagery like "lichen that glowed faintly, like old regret" establishing a strong mood. However, the spatial geography is vague; the museum, ovens, and waterfall feel like floating set-pieces rather than a cohesive physical environment where the character moves and acts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is visceral and active; the lighthouse and hunger stones are not just backdrops but mechanical participants in the puzzle that constrain action. The imagery ("splinter in the throat") effectively establishes the antagonistic relationship between the structure and the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, with sensory details like "burnt sugar and copper pennies" grounding the surrealism. The funhouse setting actively constrains the encounter through the mechanics of reflection and distortion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting—a floating driftwood orchard—is exceptional, functioning simultaneously as atmosphere, instrument, and constraint. The physical details of the "salt-stiffened cloth," "iron pot," and "gnarled root" ground the fantastical premise in tactile reality. The environment actively participates in the plot, acting as the primary antagonist and eventual partner.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The concept of the city carved into turtle shells is excellently integrated, with the shell's physical grooves serving as both map and communication medium. This high-specificity constraint grounds the fantasy elements in tactile, plausible detail.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with details like "mildew climbing the timetable boards" grounding the scene. The station's decay mirrors the theme well, though the rosebush timing feels slightly convenient as a narrative bookend.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the submerged pavilion is rendered with tactile specificity ("split like a wound," "smelled of rust"). The environment constrains the action effectively, as the work must be done before the bridge lowers. The sensory details reinforce the theme of decay and preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmospheric detailing of the "sunken library" and "dappled silence" effectively anchors the tone. The sensory environment—ocean pressure, salt air, dim light—is the story's strongest asset, creating a tangible sense of isolation that supports the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot, particularly the specific physics of the isle sinking *through* the sea rather than just into it.

The environment actively constrains the protagonist's time and options.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric, actively constraining the action through the storm and cooling breakers. While imagery like "steel ribs" and "burnt sugar" leans toward genre standards, the "splinter in the sky" and specific interaction with the console ground the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details of the observatory (carved maps, stone domes) are vivid and establish a solid visual anchor. However, the sensory experience is primarily visual, missing opportunities for tactile or auditory texture beyond the drone's hum. The setting effectively frames the action but remains somewhat static until the mechanical activation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the "cobalt terrace" and "driftwood bones" create a strong, specific sense of place that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The imagery effectively anchors the tone, though the bruise simile in the opening is a touch familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on familiar fantasy tropes and clichés ("mist that curled like ghostly fingers"). While the physical space of the parapet is anchored, the descriptions often prioritize purple phrasing over sensory details that constrain the characters' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The kayak launch and the utility poles create a distinct, grounded atmosphere. The "skeletal remains of buoys" and the brass compass are strong specifics, though the "bar’s neon sign... like a dying star" leans into generic noir imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmosphere effectively blends noir grit with bioluminescent wonder, grounding the supernatural elements in sensory experience ("scent of algae," "sickly yellow"). The setting of the lake serves as a functional crucible for the climax, though the "glowing veins" imagery leans on familiar tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is lush and immersive, effectively using the scent of spices to ground the magical elements in sensory specificity. While the "permanent moonlight" and "silvered grass" establish a strong mood, some descriptions lean slightly on generic atmospheric tropes ("older than memory") rather than fresh, singular details.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "cloudbound" glade is realized with tactile specificity ("spongy moss," "damp earth"), functioning as a liminal space that enables the plot's magic. The sensory details are vivid, though the "moonlight bled... like a forgotten breath" image in the second paragraph is a mixed metaphor that slightly blurs the visual. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, fulfilling the high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "ship of bones" is a visceral, original setting that establishes tone immediately. The specific constraints—flickering gravity, the needle of collapsed star, the photograph as a portal—are tightly integrated into the plot's mechanics, grounding the surrealism in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)

The environment actively constrains the plot through the sundial's alignment and the blackout condition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmospheric details are vivid (the pulsing aurora, the mirror-water), but the physical setting fails to operate under the rules established by the premise. The "slickness" of the world is described but not demonstrated in the mechanics of the character's interaction with her environment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the observatory and the storm providing strong sensory grounding ("ozone and wet pine," "rusted workbench"). The specific detail of the "1978 bus timetable" adds a nice textural anchor that contrasts with the more abstract storm imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "soot and rainwater" ink and the coffee tin are vivid and grounding. While effective, some descriptors ("skeletal thing," "rusted heart") veer into generic dystopian shorthand, slightly diminishing the setting's unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "tidal arbor" is a vivid, specific setting that anchors the surrealism effectively, with details like "ivories yellowed by salt" establishing a cohesive atmosphere. The environment interacts well with the mechanics of the plot, grounding the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and anchors the action well, using the ridge and weather to apply pressure. Some descriptors tilt toward generic fantasy ("ancient stones humming," "pulsed like slow heartbeats") rather than specific, grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with details like "damp sighs" and "saltgrass" effectively grounding the magical realism in a physical reality. The bonsai's twisted form serves as an excellent micro-setting that mirrors Elias's internal state and constrains the final action.

    The drowned library, rusted lighthouse, and bioluminescent jars are not backdrop but gear: shelves sag under waterweight, lens edges bite flesh, anemones pulse like secondary hearts. Every sensory pick is filtered through Elias’s professional eye—what can be catalogued, carried, etched. The micro-setting of the lens itself constrains the final choice and recharges the ending image. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and objects track across a 3-D ruin without a single impossible position.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Terra-cotta arbor, root-cellar chapel, moonlit orchards, and frost-silver ridge are filtered through Elias’s tactical attention—tiles pried loose, baskets counted, thorns planted. Sensory hierarchy narrows under sanctions: taste of salted fish, clang of bell against chest, scent of cooling bread overtake visual catalog. Final image of skeletal arbor wrapped in climbing roses reconfigures ruin as promise, constraining future exile choices.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Twilight viaduct is more than postcard: the blooming jasmine narrows scent memory, wet-iron air signals past blood, and the fog literally curls around wrists to invite the next breath. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting—its brass warmth anchors touch and projects the past onto present stone. Environment guides every beat: arches frame silhouette splits, river embers literalize “sparks.” Final reconfiguration is charged by this exact place turning from relic to living threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The living bridge’s vine-pulse and ozone-lavender scent are filtered through Liora’s designer eye, constraining her choice to climb the spiral that wasn’t there a breath before. The final palm-to-wood grain anchors the closing image, charging the reconfigured future with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The carnival’s broken piano, rusted ring-frames, and cracked soil are not backdrop but toolkit: the piano becomes trap, the duck-pond becomes prison, the yellowed keys become timing device. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lena’s thief-perception—she notices sound resonance, floor stability, seed weight. Micro-setting (arrow notches, oilcloth) directly constrains vault opening. Final image of poppies blooming in ruins reuses early detritus with repriced meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass panes “sagged like held breath,” submarine “crushed spine,” coal’s last embers reflecting in the wrecks—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s acoustical obsessions. Micro-setting (copper shard, anvil pit) constrains the final choice when he grips the searing metal. Spatial choreography holds as water rises ankle-to-knee; no floating props. Atmosphere marries rust-salt decay with aurora spectacle, mirroring internal corrosion without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Brass rails, glass case, cracked pavement, and jar-light function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the moonbeam jar literally unlocks the mirror and later becomes the projectile that dissolves the station. Spatial choreography is clean: case beneath portraits, stationmaster in doorway, orchids wilting in real time. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—silver heartbeat, fractured light—then widens to horizon gore at the leap. Environment evolves: emerald station vanishes, leaving only the dahlia still warm in her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Frost-starred window, jagged bookmark, dripping ceiling—each object is handled and re-handled, constraining choice (she flips valves because the thaw exposes the blueprint). Micro-setting of the console and the cracked dome feels tactile. Sensory pick is biased to glass-worker’s eye: light fractures, breath sculptures. Final shard held to sunrise recharges every prior image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rusted library is sketched with selective, POV-filtered detail—“warped bookshelf,” “iron shelves sagging like old bones”—and the atlas slot functions as a micro-setting that constrains the final discovery.

No spatial drift; weather affects choice—storm’s passage permits the ultimate quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frozen courtyard operates as micro-setting: temperature constrains bow friction, twilight governs visibility of memory shards, refracting ice surfaces dictate perceptual focus. Sensory hierarchy is robot-exact—optical zoom, core-temp delta, audio resonance—never tourist-catalogue. Spatial choreography clean: violin/bench/robot triangle tracked across every motion. Tool/ice-object reappears charged at closure, crystallizing identity, satisfying 9+ gate. Only hairline slip: “ghost of a fire” scent drifts toward generic atmospherics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    The crystal forecourt is more than postcard: its acoustics force Lena to hear, its light fragments become the lens’s refracting echo, and the wet pavers literally release whispers underfoot. These micro-details constrain her eavesdropping and later let her “scatter” tickets like light splinters. Environment thus charges the final image without over-description. Slight over-reliance on visual; a tactile sniff of rain-metal or shoe-squeak could have sealed 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden is rendered as a tactile, reactive character—roots cradling marbles, ivy curling her name—rather than backdrop; the cracked marbles themselves function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual and finally converts the elders, meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Twilight gas-giant bands, skeletal hull groans, cobalt holographic lattice, and gel cradles are filtered through Elias’s technician-eye—tools, pressures, seams noticed first. Magnetic nexus and lever function as micro-setting, constraining every action; their material response (hum, warp, cold) decides when Elias can act. Final image reuses twilight but now reweighted: color bands shift “with something older” that no longer obeys chronology—setting charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object moves.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opera house is not backdrop but crucible: water resists thighs like a held note, lanterns turn sheet music into a “topographic map of shadows,” the bow becomes crowbar—each environmental detail constrains the next physical choice. Micro-setting qualification met: the antique program’s fibre-softness and ink-bleed alter Elias’s tactile threshold and decide him to pry the floorboard. Final image—the dry program—evolves from the same object, charging closure with conceptual cost. Sensory hierarchy obeys musician POV: pitch of air-hum, vibration of strings, echo-location in blackened mirrors.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tunnel, valve wheel, and water-sump function as micro-setting that constrains every move: crunch of glass under foot, valve’s brass jaw, black water climax.

The vial and tuning fork act as micro-settings, constraining the final transfer gesture. Spatial choreography stays clean across the three bodies and props. Sensory hierarchy narrows under eclipse darkness, mirroring Mira’s contracted then expanded voice. The environment does not merely backdrop; its humming stones supply the acoustic catalyst that makes the closure plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The reclaimed silo-library is not backdrop; its spiralling shelves literally force Elias to climb for knowledge, and the groaning metal skin supplies the audible hum that becomes the story’s tonal metronome. The tapestry’s heat against his chest in the final beat is a micro-setting object that recharges every prior dragon image. Environment thus constrains the single on-page choice—keep walking—and passes the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse tower, brass-lined study, and Fresnel lens are not backdrop—they constrain every move: the beam’s blade-like sweep limits how long Chen can safely copy specs; the spiral stairs enforce the single exit that lets the girl arrive unobserved. Inkwell, joss paper, and salt-soaked oilskin coat create a tactile micro-setting that charges the final incense curl. Spatial choreography is clean: fisherman → pocket slip → study desk → doorframe fortune. Only the mainland lab remains abstract, but that off-stage vagueness serves the “open secret” concept rather than breaks it.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dimensional anchor is never described in panoramic detail, yet its geometry is revealed through the indigo seeping into “cracks,” turning the chamber itself into a constraint that rewrites its own rules. The palette, pedal, and rising color function as micro-setting, each altering tactics: the palette empties, the pedal keeps spinning, the color climbs the priest’s robes—objects that literally consume the agent. This tactile integration charges the final image without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass spire, frozen lake, rice-paper ink, and nautilus fracture form a tactile micro-setting that literally channels sound and light; each object is handled, turned, or pressed, so environment steers choice. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5—no orientation penalty. The mirrored horizon is not backdrop; it splits dawn into audible pressure that forces the conducting gesture. Specificity is high, but one slip—“tasted of ice and old electricity” drifts toward brochure—holds it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The viaduct’s wet neon arches, the living warmth of the clay, and the barefoot chill function as micro-setting that constrains every step; when the stone finally holds, the environmental shift signals closure. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold skin, pulsing rune, reverse-shattering sound—mirrors Elias’s oscillation between weightlessness and final weight. Spatial choreography is clean across fracturing timelines; no floating rooms. The glowing viaduct charges the last image—its vanishing is the visible price of conquest—meeting the 9+ gate, but slight over-reliance on atmospheric lyric keeps it just below.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cavern is not backdrop; its damp earth smell and drying hides literally supply the drum-tension Elias reads with his fingers, making the setting a tool that constrains his next choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cracked dome, salt-stiff wrecks, and condensate dripping into the bowl are not backdrop; they constrain where Liora can sit, how she harvests water, and supply the acoustic shell that keeps sound alive. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: she hears humidity, smells old fire, feels callous against bow. Spatial choreography is immaculate—girl enters at fire-edge, sleeps curled, dome groans overhead. Final image recharges the greenhouse as resonator; environment shapes the note that reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amber walls, wrist cuffs, and the blotter petal operate as micro-setting that actively constrain choice: cuffs meter lies, petal absorbs rewrite, walls trap the light that eventually pools in her hands. Sensory hierarchy filters through Liora’s professional nose and static sense—no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: chemist’s hand → her wrist → petal crumble → light pool. Final image charged by these objects, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Salt-kissed breeze, lantern on silver hair, oleander shadow—details are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final smoke-under-stars image. Library courtyard geography stays coherent; no white-room risk. The setting does not actively constrain tactics, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere supports the soft pivot from commerce to compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and violet-spray crater are never backdrop: the orchard’s tuned-fork hum decides when Reed walks at dusk; the arbor’s skin-slicing edge literally limits who adds a hand. The crater’s lost-language murmur supplies the story’s sound-track and forbids easy translation—pressure felt in every tag. Final image recharges the same refracting light, now carrying communal fingerprints. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains the final ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rooftop canal as vein-of-time micro-setting directly shapes the climax: water receives the jar, rewinds the boat, births the silver echo-leash. Sensory hierarchy is illustrator-biased—ink viscosity, stained-glass wing-veins—grounding abstract time in tactile surfaces. Spatial choreography stays clean: parapet → boat below → canal surface → upward moth spiral. Setting constrains the final choice; without the black-ink water the jar sacrifice fails, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Cavern orchard, stalactite drips, and mosaic stepping stone are not backdrop but interactive instruments: the droplets spell Morse, the fractures accept the glass eyes, the lichen dissolves under a tear. Micro-setting (eyes as twin moons) constrains the final gesture—when he reaches, the mist dissolves, proving the environment cannot be held. Sensory hierarchy skews to tactile and visual filtered through grief-biased perception—silver pulses, phosphorescent mist, damp earth under palm. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library’s stained-glass dawn, vent drafts, and sub-basement keyhole are not postcard flourishes—they constrict movement and decide transmission routes for sound and objects.

The island’s desalination rigs and scrap scabs ground the post-war timeframe without exposition dump. Micro-setting object—the brooch—constrains every major choice and recharges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: stair descent, cavern center, paintbrush hand-off track. Weather shift from crooked to straight rain mirrors internal reconfiguration, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cave as micro-setting constrains every move: translucent stone that breathes, shadows that overlap into entity, pearl that pulses—each detail charged and repurposed at exit. Musical crystal cave is not backdrop but instrument that re-tunes her perception. Spatial choreography holds: single entrance, central quartz bed, escalating light-to-sound ratio. Final image reuses “song” now internalized, proving environment has colonized her.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivory harbor’s salt-stained cobbles, lighthouse hut ink-air, and the valve’s warped brass constrain every choice: access to fragments, acoustics of listening, height for dispersal. Micro-setting (the valve as mouthable absence) functions as mobile terrain that alters tactics—carried, warmed, tossed. Weather remains felt slick under Elias’s knees, never backdrop. Final image of lanterns “like stars dropped into the sea” charges earlier rain-gloss with returned civic light, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mist, starlit lattice, and the pedestal’s arrow-cracks constrain every move; the phantom punch even serves as micro-setting that finally tears open the platform. Selective sensory triage keeps the ruin vivid without catalog bloat; spatial choreography stays clean as Elias steps, places, and withdraws.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tower itself functions as micro-setting: its stones soften under whale-song pressure, bending space for the closure beat—environment literally shapes the impossible reunion. Brass telescope, obsidian tile, and ink-stained fingers recur as handled tools, each state change tracked. Salt-wind scent and whale-song vibrations are filtered through Liora’s astronomer bias, never tourist checklist. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prismatic escondite is not backdrop but active antagonist—gravity flickers, corridor breathes, walls peel back—each environmental shift alters Lysander’s tactical options. Micro-setting (fractal-ice pillar, copper-veined fragment) doubles as tool and body extension, constraining the final release. Sensory hierarchy obeys immortal perception: color-knives, magnetic surges, dimension-flips. Final sky-sea-void recharges every prior visual motif, cementing 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The embalming table, moving ink, and locked coffins constrain every choice; the pot’s serpent motif recharges the final “no end” image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Container labyrinth is no backdrop; its breathing steel and tide-flooded alleys physically steer Daniel’s path and final act. The poison-label’s creased edge recurs as micro-setting that constrains choice—he handles it, hides it, finally embeds it. Spatial choreography is exact: 47-B, knee-deep flood, sagging heart. The port’s salt-rust breath is filtered through a dead man’s senses, never tourist-catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Observatory-as-body: cracked dome = broken skull, warped floor = rib-cage, wind as breath. Micro-setting of shell-cello dyad constrains every tactic; blank shell at end recharges first image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s myth-buster eye—he catalogues, then feels. Spatial choreography clean; no floating props. Weather is pressure, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)

The closing image of reflected lights on water reprises the city’s fluid ontology, charging the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The moon is not backdrop but countdown mechanism: low gravity extends his shadow, vacuum carries the canister’s hiss, photon angle sets the bioluminescent schedule. Suit, camera, and canister together operate as micro-setting that constrains every tactic—he has only three pulses of light before launch. Earth’s “pale jewel” is reused twice, each time refracted through new emotional optics. Spatial choreography is flawless; the footprint he plants beside the rock is the same dust the drill bit will breach, making orientation future-facing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist, depot, and water barrel function as micro-setting that literally refracts choice; the iridescent film’s properties constrain the fix. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory, matching blind POV; “mist curled cooler near the docks” is selective, not catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: stool → barrel → flank → shop. Environment evolves—mist parts only after patch—causal, not decorative. Gate satisfied: tool (film) and micro-setting (water lens) charge final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Outpost rust, frozen lake, dog-eared page, condensation on glass—each re-appears and constrains choice (ice thickness dictates where she kneels; page dissolves to rewrite currents). Sensory hierarchy reflects atlas-editor bias: visual patterning first, then haptic (palm on ice), finally olfactory (wet stone). Micro-setting (condensation) functions as map and mirror, charging the final image. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly from window to dock to ice center.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Micro-setting triumph: the fork, cobblestones, and archway each constrain gait and sound, directly enabling the revival mechanic. Visual dominance is earned—sound is the plot—yet rust/gold light, cold well-stone, and warped door give tactile anchors. Spatial choreography immaculate; we track his looping route and feel stones warm underfoot. Only gap: no olfactory or temperature shift at climax to match rising sun, but the charged fork and child-laugh fulfill the 9+ object test.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Environment as micro-setting: the vial, rebreather timer, and jellyfish dome constrain every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Liora notices corrosion patterns, not tourist grandeur. Spatial choreography is clean; distance to surface and oxygen maths stay consistent. Final image of jellyfish above intact temple recharges the opening vista, now weighted by her refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse-prison and reef act as a single micro-setting that dictates every move: bars dictate whisper acoustics, spiral glass frames the final choice, reef teeth literalize consequence. Copperlight vs. blue beam is a recharging image that constrains Elias’s tactics—he can only exit once the beam shifts hue. Sensory hierarchy is POV-slanted: salt-thick voices, mortar that smokes, tide that hisses through iron. Spatial choreography is clean—door scuffs, gearworks, cracked spiral—no floating bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass-and-venom greenhouse acts as micro-setting: frost weep, blackened vines, glowing heart-veins constrain every move. Bead-as-soil-object and Keeper’s bark-hands supply sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Red canyon walls function as micro-setting that constrains choice—stone veins literally rise to meet the plate, guiding Elias’s hand. Sensory hierarchy favors iron-salt scent and copper air over visual catalogues, reflecting a weaver’s tactile bias. The Heart Chamber’s “second heartbeat” is a charged environmental detail that mirrors Elias’s internal shift and supplies the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean: plate, stone, and body track continuously through the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is never dumped; temperature and taste (“overripe figs”) arrive through Elias’s attention. The sundial’s hollow is a micro-setting that literally holds the seed and later fails under vegetal pressure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean—lantern shadows, skeletal fingers, sapling splitting stone track without drift. One minor slack: “valley” remains a placeholder name, but the locale is felt through touch and breath, not map.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Golden arcade at dawn is a living filter: chrome reflections, chalk grit under thumbnail, mailbox hinge squeak—all steer Lena’s micro-moves. The clipboard’s flex-screen and rice-paper envelope act as micro-settings that physically constrain procedure. Light glare at the end mirrors the over-brightness of giving a name away. Spatial choreography never slips; every object is handled, not displayed.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt dome, autumn twilight, and needle-glint are not backdrop but tools: the dome’s color determines how starlight refracts, the season’s slant light dictates when the flame shadow grows long enough to hide messages. Micro-setting mastery: the loom’s wooden gears, the ink smell on courier’s hands, the mortar breathing stitched starlight—each tactile detail constrains the next move. Final image of flame burning “in the cracks between worlds” recharges every prior thread; environment is the protagonist’s co-conspirator.

    Mangrove dome, black-water mirrors, and salt-mist are filtered through Liora’s synesthetic bias; every sensory note pressures her toward either secrecy or exposure. The shard functions as micro-setting: its changing texture (jagged → smooth) tracks her internal arc and literally charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—root, current, moonlight paths track cleanly. Environment constrains the choice (only here can condensation letters form), satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: glass ceiling bruise, ivy like barbed wire, cool coils round ankles—environment mirrored inside her ribs. Coral fragment and plaster cast act as portable set-pieces; their grooves dictate finger choreography and constrain whether she keeps or gives. Spatial choreography is spotless—bench, shadow, pocket—no drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys medic-translator attention: radio static, saline odor, shrapnel ache. Final image of ember-glow smudges is charged by setting’s twilight fade—specificity indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ruined orchard is no postcard: skeletal trees heavy with forbidden fruit, loam that softens fresco edges, fog thick enough to swallow festivals. Micro-setting—the fragment’s palm-size warmth—constrains Liora’s decision to project rather than hoard. Spatial choreography stays clean: fragment on table → film pressed → banners strung between dead trunks → crowd reaching through projection. Weather (fog, dusk’s last gold) directly affects visibility and emotional stakes, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sound-wave garden is sketched with selective synesthesia—metal hums bend air, fresco ripples—so setting actively constrains her shifts. The nickel’s evolving texture (soil→palm→star) functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse humidity, rusted shelves, and crushed-mint scent on sleeves are filtered through Elias’s entomologist bias—he notices leaf veins the way an ex-reader of wings would. Spatial choreography stays clean as bodies lean, trace stems, pocket seeds. The final public-garden row acts as micro-setting that constrains pattern placement under drone sightline, charging the ending image. No slips; only thing holding it sub-9 is that the cityscape itself stays silhouetted rather than materially blocking an escape route.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Shell, postcard, and poet’s ink-veined body function as micro-setting that constrains every tactic—sound bends inside the spiral, light is borrowed through the postcard’s nebula. Sensory selection is urgent: salt-tanged gunpowder pollen, off-key wind carrying lullabies. Spatial choreography tracks ghost-helmet → seawater → coral buds without drift. Setting never stalls momentum; crushed-violet breath charges the final image. Missing 9+ gate only because environment does not physically block the new war drums—merely refracts them.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    The moonstone shelves, glass-orchids, and bamboo chime are not backdrop but instruments: orchids bloom/contract under touch, chime’s crack directs plot, dome panes rattle from internal pressure. Micro-setting (the chime itself) constrains the final choice—she must break the object she once mended. Sensory economy is tight; scent of ozone/foxglove regret arrives only when stakes demand it. Setting evolves with event: sunlight enters only after the song is silenced, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive body-and-tool micro-setting constrains every beat—shelves dictate reachable scrolls, inkwell glass physically shatters to enable restoration. Sensory hierarchy (violet scent, silver stopper, iron-taste breath) filters through Elara’s linguist priorities. Spatial choreography is flawless across “pressed her palm / parchment / mist coiling through shelves.” The shard-as-final-talisman charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate, just held back by one purple phrase (“sky split like a promise finally kept”) that momentarily over-leans into overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Volcano-amphitheater breathes and sags, constraining acoustics and secrecy; the brass chain’s tactile cold anchors every beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: rust, dust, slanting light, the groan of stone — all filtered through Liora’s engineer-eye. Spatial choreography clean: kneel → stand → unspool onto table; bodies tracked without drift. Final image recharges setting: the elders’ shadows “pool like ink” on the blueprint, marrying geology to politics.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The attic as instrument—skylight conductor, dust-mote score, pipe-smoke resonance—literally constrains flight tactics; misread the motes and birds scatter. Micro-objects (meteorite, ledger margins, harness) function as movable set pieces whose altered states shift choices. Sensory economy favors sound and smell over visual clutter, mirroring Elias’s composer bias. Weather evolves from smoke-ghost to sea-breeze, tracking his internal re-oxygenation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Terrace prism, cornstalk whip, kerosene logbook—each detail is filtered through Elias’s designer gaze and either steers choice (grain arrow) or reappears charged (sinkhole quilts). Spatial choreography is clean: porch → terrace → maze rows → ladder descent. Weather/threshold shimmer stays consistent, constraining perception. Micro-setting (folded corn-husk boat) guides discovery and constrains the note’s placement.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment acts as micro-setting: the cracked dome and dying emergency lights constrain oxygen and sightlines, forcing the two characters onto the narrow observation deck. The brass celestial scope and burnt feather function as tools that charge the final image—feather pressed to lips, scope abandoned. Bioluminescent algae and jellyfireflies are not backdrop; their shifting constellations literally rewrite the maps Elara lives by. Setting detail is selective, never touristic; every sensory shard (rusted steel, condensing breath) mirrors internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The geode-cave is protagonist-stage: walls shimmer with merchant deltas, seeds sprout through skin, crater glass constrains what can be carried out. Spatial choreography is dream-logical yet traceable—thumb cut, satchel filled, bird-shadow spelling hurry. Every descriptor is filtered through her synesthetic vocation; no tourist catalog. The final image—foamed ankles, horizon line thin as memory—recharges every prior iridescence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal arcade functions as both literal stage and metaphoric chessboard: waterline, cobblestones, torch-smoke, and gull-cry supply immediate tactile constraints (wet ankle, breeze that gutters flame). Selective sensory hierarchy—sound (violin, laughter), touch (spray), sight (bishop crack catching starlight)—mirrors Lior’s filtering attention. Setting never stalls for postcard vistas; each detail is weaponized into musical variable. Micro-setting object—the bishop—charges the final image when its cracked miter refracts starlight, sealing the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Twilight garden is not backdrop but instrument: pond fractures Orion, lilies cut flesh, reeds swallow heron—each detail constrains the method (gaps) and charges the final inscription. Micro-setting (her own wrist) functions as altar and canvas, body-as-setting fused to stakes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: tide dancer notices tide-less things—crushed nightshade, dust refusing scatter. No spatial drift; every object tracked across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pearl Bay is not backdrop but pressure: the groaning walkway, lung-like atrium, salt-damp glass dictate pace and posture. The prism atrium functions as micro-setting—its walls and pool constrain every move and charge the final flare. Dawn mist and tide are not described but used: they decide when colors vanish. Sensory hierarchy is glazier-specific: weight of stone, temperature of glass, angle of light—never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The blackened trunk, porcelain coolness, and pine-sap crack-filling are tactile anchors that constrain action (he can’t clutch the box and draw at the same time). Moonlight and ridge geography mirror internal transit from scoured to untouched valley, charging the final image. Weather (gust shaking needles) times the exact moment he opens the box, welding setting to beat. Micro-setting qualifies: the stone surface becomes the canvas that externalizes transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    Tide-polished grotto, brass gauge, and kelp-thread constellations are rendered with sparse, sensory precision; each chosen detail either refracts light or measures potential, anchoring the lyric concept. Micro-setting works: gauge, shell, and driftwood function as both tools and topography, constraining her pattern-building ritual. Orientation is taught early; the cave never dissolves into white-room. Final image—gauge needle sliding sideways—recharges the entire location with unasked possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivy, damp stone, and lantern flicker act as tactile gatekeepers, constraining every step and lighting the film negative reveal. Micro-settings—rocking chair mid-sway, rusted toy—mirror Elias’s suspended grief. Sensory hierarchy tightens to smell of wet earth when air thickens, guiding him deeper. Environment literally charges the final glowing mural; without it the epiphany would deflate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism parapet refracts dying light into fractured rainbows that literally color every beat; the terrace’s wet stone guides Liora’s barefoot stillness and the final slide of the mirror. Spring air and cathedral bells function as a live clock, forcing her exit. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the last image—no rainbows, no song—making the absence a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Terrace stones, lavender/gunpowder scent, midsummer light are filtered through Veyra’s war-weary perception and constrain ritual placement. Ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting: its polished grief dictates where pen can be set. Spatial choreography clean—bodies, blade, parchment occupy fixed stage. Final rain promise evolves setting causally, prepares next cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Salt flat as micro-setting: its brittle crust literally guides every footstep and metaphorically records his drought ledger; the egg fits the fissure only because the drought cracked it. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s engineer eye—cracks as “map,” crust as “brittle,” no tourist catalog. Weather (distant thunder) is not backdrop but countdown that fails to deliver, tightening the poise. The environment’s refusal to yield water forces the absurd preservation act, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prism sanctuary and silver courtyard function as micro-setting: crystalline dome refracts starlight into “blades of color” that cut visual field and mirror the cutting cost of freedom. Snow and frost are not backdrop; barefoot cold forces bodily endurance and sharpens every tactile gesture. Spatial choreography is clean—gates, threads, vault—no impossible positions. The final image—snow melting where she stands—literalizes the heat of absorbed voices and recharges the setting with earned symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    Radar dome as micro-setting constrains acoustics and metaphor—its “deaf” dish mirrors Elias’s experiment in listening; salt-flats erase footprints, charging the final image of carried untold tales. Campfire stick evolves from grandfather relic to tool of tomorrow’s exposed strings. Sensory triage favors damp wool, ash scent, meteor hush—selective, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto is not backdrop but instrument: moss swallows sound, wind tests knots, altitude isolates. Each sensory note is filtered through Lior’s esoteric realism—he registers “the weight of wind” and the monarch’s “amber veins”—so environment and body constrain every move. The final spiral-shadow on the wall is a setting-made image that reconfigures the meaning of temporary structures; without that wall, the echo could not land. This is micro-setting at its most indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glacier-heart sanctum is no postcard; its ice walls breathe, its rope serpent sleeps, its aurora veins thread marrow—all constrain Elira’s gesture and charge the final image. Micro-setting (card scrap, rope strands) doubles as crucible, each perforation a syllable she must choose to re-weave. Spatial choreography is pristine—kneel, trace, exhale, press—no impossible positions. The environment’s cold glow literally warms under the rising names, a causal flip that fuses setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bunker’s corroded wall becomes a tactile constraint that dissolves into vines at the climax, literally re-configuring Lior’s options. Micro-settings—wafer seal, terminal screen, murals—are handled, change state, and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (ozone, machine-oil ghost). No static postcarding; each detail foreshadows the eventual forest re-absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The palace is rendered through tactile micro-details—warm tile, damp breath from the passage, torch flicker on etched angles—that constrain when and how Qishti acts. Body-as-setting functions when his ink-stained robe and later skin-trace serve as the final "walls" he must inhabit. Sensory hierarchy is astronomer-specific: light angles, temperature differentials, schematic lines优先 over tourist filler. The black tile as micro-object charges the ending by becoming part of his body; environment literally enters him. Gate cleared: recurring object constrains final image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sanctuary’s breathing walls and rain-scent act as micro-setting that literally suppresses sound, constraining every utterance; the music box cylinder functions as tool-as-setting, its snapped pin determining when grace can re-enter. Spatial choreography is crisp: pin passes from Lior’s palm to ghost-Kael’s hand back to cylinder without drift. Final image—“gleamed in the dirt like a question”—recharges the entire space, making the ground itself the new bearable silence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ruined orchard, frost-lensed twilight, and sextant-as-micro-setting constrain every beat; fog density literally governs visibility and memory, while frost melt marks the pressure shift. Sensory selection stays biased to the maker’s tactile precision—calloused fingers, brass chill—so environment and body interleave without tourist excess. One minor slip: “glass mountains” is invoked as tone label rather than lived terrain, preventing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-as-cathedral is not postcard scenery: the apple boughs sagging through broken marble literally determine where the mender can dig and where light bends for the seed. Micro-setting objects—ribbon, trowel, doll—constrain tactics (they dig with the trowel, bind the ribbon, leave the doll as cradle). Sensory selection is POV-driven: the smell of forgiveness, the pulse under loam. The final image of the sprout pointing at the ribbon is charged by the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Micro-settings—the bathroom acoustics, the hollow cameo, the single dissolving petal—continuously constrain tactics (where she thinks, how she carries memory, what she swallows). The final pistachio shell with her etched face literalizes the body-as-setting, charging the closing image with irreversible cost and satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mountain-as-ribcage, shifting shelves, books that pulse under finger—select sensory strikes that mirror Elias’s own shifting ribs of knowledge. Bookstore constrains every tactical move: aisle rearrangement funnels him, blank-spined volumes cue the Library door, the chasm itself is the final trap. Micro-setting (diary, cracked spectacles) doubles as terrain and costs him when pages blank. No missteps in geography or world rule.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Every descriptor is sensory and utilitarian: carnival lights reflect in mirror shards that later cut the portal, salt-rust smell clings to the ledger Liora steals. The ship’s decayed geography (carousel, hall of mirrors, captain’s cabin) is mapped through her body—stairs groan under her weight, mirrors ripple when touched. Environment is literally the antagonist; its collapse forces the final renunciation. Micro-setting (emerald card, ink-less paper) constrains the magic rules and charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    The clock-tower mechanism room is not backdrop but instrument: brass scent, oil incense, and gear-proximity constrain how she handles the rope and times her breath. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rope coiled at feet, seal impression on handle, gears stuttering with each reweave. Micro-setting (the rope itself) functions as lever and key, literalizing the “archive-as-tool” axiom. Final image—warm wax initials—re-anchors the entire space inside her body, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The caves function as both macro-environment and micro-tool: fracture patterns in ice and ripple-marks on stone directly guide Eldrin’s choices and supply the literal method for conjuring. Spatial choreography is immaculate—knees, fissure, palm, chest—every repositioning tracked. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual, reflecting a mapper’s priorities. Final image of fresh cracks “like the beginning of an answer” recharges the setting as an active conversational partner, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pavilion’s glass walls function as micro-setting: their hum constrains her pacing, their star-path grooves guide her fingertips and literally enable the rekindling. Salt wind, skeletal ruins, and first-rain scent are filtered through her retrocognitive bias—she notices what once was, not what is. Spatial choreography is clean: boots on stairs, palm on fracture, kneeling to trace floor spirals. Environment never stalls momentum; every detail either mirrors her internal hush or supplies the tactile cue that triggers the beacon.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Stormlit observatory above clouds” is more than postcard; the thinning air, creaking tower, and crystal flags that hum under rain after-echo physically constrain movement and hearing. Micro-setting rules: the crystal flags act as both archive and mirror, guiding the moment she abandons measurement. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, press, stand, turn, door sigh—no impossible positions. Weather front (solid fog → softening fog) tracks internal shift and is causally tied to the memory offer, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glowing blossom vines, kerosene scent, and tower spatial logic all constrain action: she climbs what once was a fortress of war now made flammable by nature. The rag knot reappears as charged micro-setting. Final starlight re-illuminates the mosaic, reweighting the visual rule-set. Selective, never catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Grotto, cicada, and tidal pool function as micro-settings that constrain attention and supply metaphorical vocabulary for transition. Moonlit stone, metallic tang, hairline-cracked shell—each detail is filtered through chronicler’s professional gaze and later re-appears to rewire meaning at closure. Environment never neutrally described; it dictates how grief can be observed, not solved. Meets 9+ gate: cracked shell in final paragraph directly charges the image of repaired-yet-fragile future.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Bunker’s rust-exhaling walls, doll’s frost-burn silence, and trellis veins carrying “honey-lightning hush” are selective, pressure-driven details that double as tactical resources. Micro-setting (porcelain doll ≤ thumbnail) constrains every sprout attempt and charges the final palm-brand. Spatial choreography is immaculate: reader can trace child’s cot → grate → trellis knot → bloom → back to cot with hair-vines. No static cataloguing; every sensory hit either foreshadows a rule (taste = key) or marks a cost (gold threads writhing).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: mirrored terrace planes and storm-glass vial are not backdrop but instruments—prisms bend sound, vial absorbs it, directly shaping Elias’s final dial turn. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true (Elias notices rope-callus, copper taste of water, never tourist vistas). Spatial choreography immaculate: gondola rocks, vial pulses, passenger palm-presses glass—all tracked without drift. Environment charges final image: angled prisms catch dying light to deliver the “vaulting hush” that reweights stakes. No occupational detail demanded; canals stay impressionistic yet credible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silver-leaved trees, ruby-flaked bark, and brass lens equations are tactile, selective, and story-functional; the waterfall’s kaleidoscope both hides the ladder and mirrors the eventual shatter of the mirrored dome. Sensory hierarchy stays inside Elsin’s scholar perception—she traces, adjusts, reads—so setting details double as tools. Environment directly shapes tactics: orchard floor conceals the hatch; mural pigment under peel dictates descent, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: the doorknocker ring, dome cracks, and charcoal dust are handled, re-handled, and finally constrain the exit. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—incense clings to skin, bronze warms under palm—anchoring orientation within the first 100 words. Only the sanctuary’s spatial edges blur intentionally as the threshold fades, so the choreography stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Farm corner, damp glow, mushroom spacing, and pitted brass anchor immediacy; body-as-setting (palm bleed, thigh pulse) constrains final choice. Bolt object evolution (tarnished → warm → absent → diamond) charges closure. Sensory triage narrows to tactile heat and ozone scent under pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from corner → palm → pocket → desert edge without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sepia reading room is sketched with economy: “golden shadows,” “mahogany,” “floorboard groove” all filter through Elias’s scholar-bred attention and constrain his next move (tuning the board). Micro-setting (mirror, crank) doubles as tool and symbol without crowding. Spatial choreography stays clean as he kneels, strikes, writes; no impossible positions. The environment’s final glow equates to his internal shift, giving the 9+ gate for constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The greenhouse-as-moment constrains every move: glass panes weep, plants trace sigils, the knight cannot exit until he unsnaps. Micro-setting (armor seam, program paper) doubles as tool and terrain, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—silverleaf, ozone, old roses—each returned in the exhale. Spatial logic stays intact: trellis → stem → clasp → stage line-of-sight remains traceable.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Foster-file room is evoked through sour coffee, yellowed paper, and chair-creak—selective, POV-filtered details that guide Elias’s somber attention. Brass button becomes micro-setting: its worn edges constrain his nightly search and later his decision to mail it. Spatial choreography is crisp—fingers along spines, envelope slid across counter—no floating props. The attic dust pattern metaphor is taught early and returns to charge final image, meeting 9+ gate for object-as-setting; only minor shortfall is absence of sensory shift under heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The auric lagoon’s starlit water and ozone air constrain timing (“only when the sky bled violet”) and supply the map that steers her; the booth’s glass and static serve as micro-setting that alters tactics. Selective sensory focus—rusted key, dangling receiver—keeps imagery lean, though the lagoon never physically impedes or wounds her, muting its role as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism atrium, saxophone, and dewdrops are handled each beat—light refracts, keys unmake sound, drops burst—constraining tactics and charging the final image of a held breath about to break. Spatial choreography stays exact; sensory economy favors damp stone, crushed mint, negative sound.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating arbor’s ashen bark, dangling roots, and monuments of pebble, salt, and hair are tactile, lived-in, and filtered through Liora’s ritual priorities. Environment constrains the final choice: only the crown’s apex offers the leaf-language she must decode, forcing the climb that costs her humanity. Micro-setting (hollow cheek, palm-embedded star) charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective sensory triangulation—brass gears, charcoal earth, slow-speaking waterfall—grounds every beat. The greenhouse’s rusted ribs and glowing leaves, the cavern’s black pool, and the final sprouting cobblestones evolve with plot, never as postcard filler. Micro-setting (compass in pocket, gear against thigh) directly enables the final improvisation. No orientation drift; who-where-when is anchored within first 90 words and payoff is encoded in the closing seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Foundry as micro-setting constrains every move: the crucible’s “maw” dictates the coin’s fate, rain hissing on hot metal supplies the hiss-cadence that mirrors her exhalation. Sensory hierarchy is alchemist-precise: smell of scorched metal, tactile ash-slick, auditory rain-dirge. Spatial choreography clean—she kneels, presses coin to lip, feeds crucible, no ghosted positions. Environment evolves: storm breaks at exit, mirroring internal shift, but avoids overt symbolism by keeping the image meteorological, not epiphanic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gorge, the harp, and the crocodile tooth together form a micro-setting system that constrains every tactic: the warped string angles dictate which notes can be played, the stone acoustics determine whether laughter will fracture or heal, and the tooth’s warming signals permission to proceed. Spatial choreography is flawless—petals fall onto specific strings, distances carry sound. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (“wet earth and old secrets” noticed because she tracks souls by scent). The final image recharges the earlier “pale gold mist” by letting the same light land on her shoulders after it has been re-tuned by laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ultraviolet forest operates as both arena and antagonist—sap-blood bark, black-leaf canopy, bruise-ground glow—each detail filters through Liran’s damaged nerves, guiding his barefoot path to the shrine. Micro-setting (mask-strap) constrains the final choice: snapping it becomes the visible forfeiture that charges the closing image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tree → clearing → basin → tree-line retrieval. No credibility breaks; world-rules (UV light, root-pull, mirrored water) stay internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory triage—groaning ropes, salt-rust ink, wet-bristle twilight—serves the emotional hierarchy of a seeker attuned to invisible stresses. The market stays lightly sketched, but the body-as-setting (palm on lighthouse, lens against pulse) constrains her final decision, satisfying micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean: from suspended stalls to painter’s counter to rooftop edge, distances track. The environment’s swaying motion mirrors internal unbalance without overt symbolism, keeping atmosphere functional.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is micro-precise: dust thickness by airflow, buttered-popcorn ghost-smell, cracked plaster that breathes. The abandoned ticket office functions as both arena and clock-housing, constraining every move Elias makes. Sensory hierarchy obeys his technician’s gaze—geometric dust, oil that never dries—so environment guides choice. Only the vast gear-room overhead risks spatial overreach, yet its slow-sway pendulum immediately localizes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass orchard library functions as both environment and tool: its dissolving shelves force Elias’s last step onto cloud-sea. Frost patterns are not backdrop but cognition—each vein a decision path. The press, bottle, and frost form a micro-setting triad that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is exact: every shard falls across the same horizon where Elias vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The black-stone cathedral, irradiated-silk mirror covers, and charged-particle storm are not backdrop but tactical instruments: the storm powers the shard, the silk prevents splintered reflections, the altar’s emptiness forces Elias’s final stance. Micro-setting—the shard itself—constrains choice twice: it cuts his palm and later dissolves to dust, foreclosing resurrection of the past. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (poet notices color bleeding, architects notice lattice). Only the off-world ship remains a floating prop, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The resonance chamber’s brass walls literally lean in, constraining the final choice; the dented silver case and single warm gear act as micro-setting that charges the closing image. Ozone-copper scent and stolen sunlight threads create selective sensory hierarchy filtered through Elias’s repairman eye. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → lift → press → walls peel → gear hums. Environment mirrors internal shift from held breath to dawn-bleed without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The subterranean lagoon is not backdrop but active agent: its warm water, mineral stars, and reverse waterfall constrain bodily movement and supply the surreal escalation. Spatial choreography is immaculate—boots, lantern beam, water level, stone arch—all tracked without drift. The factory-above/cliff-below split creates a vertical world that mirrors the mind’s descent into unknowing. Micro-setting (compass in palm) charges the final image when it falls silent, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Storm, stone, and slide are tactile and selective: wind “howling through its jagged mouth,” slide edges “warm as if alive.” The blackthorn fragment becomes micro-setting, its grain dictating the carved hand that seals the loom. Spatial choreography is clean—palm to stone, slide to arch, hand to crevice—anchoring the surreal light-show in bodily logic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Amber pavilion, stained glass, and bare feet on melting snow are tactile and selective; scent of jasmine anchors beats. Micro-setting (window panes) literally constrains the final discovery—flowers pressed inside—so environment charges closure. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room drift. Some winter/season phrasing leans archetypal but is filtered through painterly POV.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian lagoon constrains the final choice—its thick, story-heavy water literally swallows the archive, charging the closure image. Zeppelin library provides altitude-as-resource, letting Elias choose aerial neutrality vs. ground risk; the skiff descent is a tactical use of setting. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—brass groans, ozone scent—never tourist catalog. Micro-objects (locket, shell spiral) evolve from prop to code to offering, mirroring theme. Gate met: lagoon reweights meaning at end.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Micro-setting rules: the seamless amber bottle itself functions as crucible and clock; its warming glass and sudden lightness physically constrain his grip and mark the turn. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound—salt, burnt sugar, cinnamon—each filtered through grief-sharpened attention. Spatial choreography is flawless: sand → docks → blacksmith’s hammer tracked in successive beats. Final image of the bottle rolling into phosphorescent tide charges the closure with irreplaceable specificity.

    The rooftop orchard is not backdrop: grafted pear trees constrain Elias’s ritual (rainwater basin beneath branches, burial site at oldest root). Micro-setting objects—wax shaving, rainwater tinted with orchid—are tactile and re-used; the shaving becomes translucent, veined like blood, charging the final burying. Skyscraper abyss below mirrors the conceptual drop into prophecy. Sensory economy favors salt-thick air, gnarled bark, petals skittering—each filters through Elias’s monkish attention.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The atrium’s iron ribs, frost-bitten glass, and ozone scent are filtered through Liora’s seed-minded attention; every detail is tactile and purposive. The ice floor literally cracks under her knees, guiding the moment she must push the seed. Micro-setting triumph: the acorn cap itself becomes the lived environment she cups, warms, and reopens. Starlight pooling like water around the stone is the final image that recharges the earlier stellar indifference—setting constrains and crowns the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bell, rope, stone spiral, and alpine wind are not backdrop but tools that constrain every micro-choice; the belfry itself functions as micro-setting whose drafts and damp literally warp pitch, forcing Elias’s on-the-fly re-binding. Sensory economy is tight—cold air curling, glue scent, bronze hum—never a catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is woven through synesthetic detail—amber/crimson glass panes, wax tears, thyme scent, tuning-fork bones—each micro-detail charging the final bloom. The skeletal hive ribs and fused box become micro-settings that literally constrain choice (knives fail, heat fails, only breath succeeds). Spatial choreography is clean: cross-legged lap → ghost hands press → box opens → comb lifted → oasis reborn. Weather shift to first-rain is causally tied to released covenant, not decorative. Gate met: environment charges final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald patina silo, urn shard that warms like live coals, and mirror showing a face “not his” are selective, pressure-filtered details that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is tight: spiral staircase, workbench at the top, capsule split “like overripe fruit.” The silo as loom is micro-setting that constrains the final action—winding the watch is only possible here. One hairline slip: “station that no longer existed” is told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt lagoon, wet salt, violet bruise-tone—these micro-details are filtered through the poet’s synesthetic bias and tethered to his fragment-collecting ritual. The feather, kite, and damp notebook function as mobile micro-settings that constrain action: only the soaked vane can be his quill, only the snapped spindle can tether his wrist. Spatial choreography stays clean across wade/retrieve/describe moves. Weather is causally active—rain’s lift leaves the decisive mirror-surface. For 9+, the environment would need to force a sharper either/or choice; here it supports rather than pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Ribcage” curve and warm copper in grooves tether body, tool, and stone; the orchard actively narrows Elira’s dwindling moves and charges Tomas’s mimicry at the end. Sensory economy favors touch and temperature—exactly what a dying gardener would trust. No visual glut; limestone, oak, wire stay recycled and handled. Final image of sapling leaf brushing stone is micro-setting at its most causally alive.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tower skin, ivy-swallowed sculptures, and rain-bronze smell are filtered through Elara’s scientific gaze; each sensory pick constrains her path (she touches, reads, smells her way forward). The spiral galaxy is rendered as micro-setting inside her ribs—setting becomes tool that charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from base to door to terminal. No environment-forcing; every detail either limits action or reconfigures meaning at closure.

Environment charges the final image when the sky’s color shift signals cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Gallery, chessboard, and bishop function as micro-setting that constrains choice: bishop carved into palm, board warped into wings—physical state changes tactical options. Whisper acoustics and dust patterns are not backdrop but tools Liora weaponizes. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, grit, and after-echo, staying inside her historian bias. 0.1 off because spatial distance to penumbra edge is only implied, not pinpointed.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but pressure system: spiralling shelves force spiralling memory, cracked atlas pages literally prop the relic, and the circular empty room awaits his future words. Micro-setting objects—mercury streaks, folded blank page, glyph-etched lectern—constrain every choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: titles distort only when he blinks; dust tastes “like shattered stars.” Final image of empty shelves ready to be inscribed charges the closing beat with anticipatory weight.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tapestry’s frayed edge functions as micro-setting that literally guides fingers and conscience; its evolving texture tracks emotional thaw. Platinum labyrinth’s metallic veins hum—sound-as-touch—making the abstract maze tactile. Spatial choreography is flawless: kneeling, palm-to-floor, then seated at hearth. Weather/thunder is filtered through bodily rhythm, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Recurring object—the Needle of Absolution—constrains every tactical move and is recharged at the end when its shards become the new writing surface. Sensory hierarchy follows POV bias: Liora notices condensation of “held breaths,” marrow thick with unspoken names. Micro-setting (the fissure in the third tower) is exploited for acoustic amplification, tying geography to climax. Spatial choreography is clean: sideways climb, claw-holds, echo trajectory track logically.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The acid-eaten workshop is not backdrop but active antagonist: each creak narrows time, the corroded copper scent clogs breath, the sea literally eats the floorboards under the final beat. Micro-setting of the pockmarked statue chest functions as surgical table and judgment seat; the third key’s slot is the decisive aperture that charges the ending. Environmental evolution is causal—every beam dissolving forces the final step. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: narrowed to touch (trembling fingers), smell (copper/regret), and imminent cold on the wrist.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bioluminescent moss pulsing like “slow, underwater heartbeat” turns the cave itself into a breathing organ that constrains Elias’s final choice. The rust-ochre cliffs and salt-metallic air are filtered through painter perception, never tourist list.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Ember nexus at twilight” is never wallpaper; the copper-veined bridges, steam-ghost vents, and cooling amber after-glow continuously constrain movement and supply the final color palette. The shell functions as micro-setting—its spiral whorls are tactile territory where the climax is negotiated. Spatial choreography is flawless: hand-over-hand moves track without drift. For 9+, the city would need to push back harder—e.g., a gear that actually blocks or burns them—but here it mostly observes, so the gate holds at 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cabin’s creaking timber, half-buried grave, and slant of dying-light constrain movement and timestamp the loop. Birch bark itself becomes micro-setting: its frayed edge, wet ink, and final ash state are tactile anchors that dictate possible actions (write, revise, burn). Wind is not backdrop but interrogator—“howled like a thing that knew him”—forcing stance crystallization.

    Micro-setting triumph: the broken tarot box and unraveling chair-cane function as tactile terrain that guides the redesign action. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—salt on the throat, ozone in the lungs—while the library-pressed-in pressure scales spatially with emotional compression. No spatial drift; distance from keeper’s chair to collapsing walls tracks cleanly across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    The wind-carved encampment is not wallpaper; it supplies the suspended dust that signals time-fracture and later drifts unsettled when time snaps back. The cracked drone, the dried-earth fissures, and the spiral etched into the ground all function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice (where to spill, when to step). Sensory hierarchy is POV-particular—hummingbird wing “iridescent” is noticed by an albino tracker whose vision is literally light-sensitive. No environment-forcing; every detail either guides the ink placement or mirrors the broken-center motif.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Frost-laced ledger, pneumatic tube, blue flare of consoles—select tactile details filter through archivist POV. Snow-hushed cathedral metaphor underpins stakes: silence = held breath before scream. Micro-setting of isolation chamber constrains the keystroke. Spatial track clear from alcove to spiral stairs; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass dome, cracked pane, and sandbag scrap function as micro-setting that directly constrain her choice to stitch the fissure. Sensory selection stays tight—taste of salt/rust on canvas, vibration through glass—filtered through her gardener-bounty-hunter hybrid gaze. Spatial tracking is clean: knelt soil → dome edge → pressed palm to fissure. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and dock are handled tactilely: spike warm from forge, stems blacken under cursed sound, water swallows stars. Each object constrains choice—spike as hook, divining rod, then grave marker—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys the fisher’s profession: he notices hertz in soil, scent of reeds, not visual panoramas. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible jumps between shore, garden, and dock.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The brass telescopes, dome glass, and echoing acoustics are not backdrop but forensic tools: every creak and clink is data for the devotedly observant heir. The rosewood nib becomes micro-setting—handled, warmed, dipped—its changing state tracking Lydia’s rising resolve. Final image of steam curling like comet trails re-weights the observatory itself as a place of terrestrial rather than celestial discovery. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The laboratory’s wax cylinders, rusted speakers, and mahogany desk are not backdrop; they supply the slot into which she feeds her debt and the speakers that answer back. The amber’s fracture literally changes her micro-tactic—pressing skin to resin—making the insect-in-resin a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s grief-narrowed attention: sound first, touch second, visual last. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the desk, crib, and slot remain trackable across the time-fold.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Grotto acoustics, mist viscosity, and chalk grit are returned to whenever Lior acts; environment literally guides his next mark. The flake’s glaze veins image the same branching that later appears in the mandala—an object-as-setting that charges closure. Lavender taste in the mist at the end reprises opening pigment, now re-scented as possibility, fulfilling the micro-setting gate. Spatial track never falters: knee, pocket, wall, square all remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mosaic tesserae function as micro-setting: their fractures literally guide Elias’s path and later warm under touch, constraining how he moves and where the commander kneels. Smoke, charred cedar, and the skeletal minaret are selective, pressure-filtered details, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → trace → stand-off → shared kneel, all within the single plaza patch. The final golden filling of cracks is an environment-state change that charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting—the tarot coin—functions as portable environment that constrains both characters’ choices and charges the final hand-off. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: burnt-caramel taste, indigo dusk-color, applause-petals all serve synesthetic world-rule. Only hairline slip: “shimmered like bruised silver” is a touch generic amid otherwise fresh descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ozone/burnt-sugar air, fiber-optic tangle, and the geode’s fractal layers are selective, POV-filtered details that braid into the light-painting motif; the studio-as-node is revealed through action, not exposition. The micro-setting of the geode against temple constrains the somatic sequence that unlocks the lattice; environment literally guides the climax. Only hairline slip: “walls breathed” risks cliché, but the follow-up “veins of light…made her teeth ache” re-anchors it in sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Coastal cave network is not backdrop but pressure engine: narrowing walls spike violet fear, lichen brightens under intent, tide pools literally carry the message away. Micro-setting (fossil) constrains every beat—heat, levitation, voice transmission. Sensory triangulation (salt exhale, ozone draft, wet stone) is filtered through Lior’s mapper priorities. Final rain’s “weight of a promise” recharges entire image system; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amber walls, fossilized resin, the black maw of the well—each detail is selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s tactile priorities. The canyon’s “weeping” pairs with internal regret; the palette stays tight, never drifting into brochure tourism. Objects—jar, needle, button—function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the wax seal must break, the silver thread must lower, the amber disk must be left. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from warehouse shelf to cliff edge to well lip; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zephyr Bluff’s wind, thawing earth, and mist function as active curtain: swallowing sound, erasing tracks, forcing close-quarters encounter. The cedar’s frost-bitten bark becomes tactile cover and later the altar where the pillbox is sacrificed. Weather shift—“scent of green things struggling upward”—mirrors her internal break toward action and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog-bound river functions as micro-setting: its swirling visibility literally toggles the decision rule. The yarn needle’s brass eye and the gutter’s tick supply tactile, audible anchors that charge the final transfer. Spatial choreography is flawless—wheels on planks, silence at midpoint, silhouette dissolving upstream. Weather is not backdrop but gatekeeper, constraining every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cracked-earth oasis, bleached hives, and sun-scorched shadows are filtered through the potter’s tactile gaze; every detail is lived-in (fingers tracing bowl rim, glass worn smooth). Spatial choreography is clean—kiln, kiln-mouth, bowl placement among hives—tracking without drift. The lantern-glass shard operates as micro-setting: its warmth and prismatic cast on sand constrain his decision to embed and abandon the bowl. Weather is pressure—relentless sun that refuses rain—guiding the timeline fractures he follows.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    Library-as-body: floating shelves, tidal motion, and atomically reflective brass constrain every beat—books rearrange, the dial’s shards redirect action, the stone circle’s hum paces time. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lior’s scholar-filter—mist-damp pages, click of claw on brass—rather than tourist catalog. Final image of doors opening is charged by the dial’s earlier constraint, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The damp walkway, petal-domes, and glass orbs are not postcard scenery—they constrain movement (boots sink, robes brush water) and supply the only permissible conduit for releasing secrets. The thrush-shadow cast by the orb is the exact image that reconfigures meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Micro-setting (twig on windowsill) also functions as a recursive object. One minor over-color phrase (“sky the color of old parchment”) is generic but does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The radio station itself behaves like a character—old current humming through locked doors, its bones shivering under her pulse—creating micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Astronomical charts smudge under sleeves, inked stars shifting in the ventilation blast, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices notch positions and static timbre, not décor. Could edge higher if subsonic apparatus had tactile specificity, but the charts satisfy the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vault, root-lattice chamber, and mutable table are sketched with sensory economy; copper-ink air and breathing stone filter through Elias’s explorer gaze. The compass serves as micro-setting that constrains the final beat—its warmed pulse confirms success and ongoing price. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the vertical descent and floor-tilt. One hairline slip: “starlit nexus” appears only at exit; earlier star reference would tighten loop.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quarry-as-wound, the lance-as-question, and the mist that thickens into struggling hands all constrain Elias’s tactile method and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys his blindness: cold seeping like guilt, metal humming in teeth. Spatial choreography is clean—steps down, crack between stones, ascent at dawn. One hairline slip: “town’s chimneys exhaling smoke like sighs” edges toward postcard, but the next line re-anchors through his scarf’s rough wool.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is more than backdrop: the weather station’s instruments, static-charged air, and shattered observation-glass physically constrain every move. The copper nail’s tuning-fork hum turns a prop into micro-setting that bends physics. Environmental dread scales up from goggles fogging to the sky ripping, mirroring Elias’s internal surge. Final image of wind-as-door would collapse without this tactile atmospheric scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mountain pullout anchors early; weathered wood, guardrail, slant of dusk are selective and steer attention to the shard. Micro-setting success: the glass flake itself functions as environment—its grid-of-light constrains the final path choice. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Meets 9+ gate: tool (flake) charges final image.

Spatial choreography stays clean across dome, desk, lens, and horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting dominance: the thorned seed, lake swirl, and frost blossoms are handled, split, or pocketed in real time, constraining every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy narrows to cold vs. rot vs. heartbeat, mirroring Eldrin’s narrowing moral spectrum. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneel, press, vines strike, figure rises—no floating bodies. The orchard’s whispered secrets are an environmental detail that could have charged the final image but evaporate; still, the key’s warmth against snow recharges the frozen confession motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cobalt hue, crushed-violet scent, and willow bark give an immediate olfactory anchor; the shifting hedge rewrites geography as lived obstacle, not backdrop. The maze-topiary clipping acts as micro-setting, its yew scent guiding turns and finally sprouting the silver leaf that charges the exit image. Environment directly constrains footfalls and scar-burn, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but actor: roots “pull,” bones feed blossoms, environment constrains the trade. Sensory triage matches urgency—damp sighs, charred card, soft petal—mirroring Liora’s narrowing attention. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → brush → pierce → curl against tree. The white flower at closure recharges every prior botanical image, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Trailer, quarry echo, and grille cloth act as micro-setting; cloth final placement in pocket charges the last image, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory selection is urgent—old coffee, damp cardboard, dust motes as crowd lighters—filtered through roadie-appraiser priorities. Spatial choreography clean: box, tape, foreman entry, truck exit. Weather unused but unnecessary. Detail economy high; no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic Arbor is not backdrop but tactical obstacle: metal tools tug, ironwood warms, leaves reverse gravity—each trait constrains Elias’s climb and charges the final bloom. Micro-setting inside the brass magnifier and the sap-glowing stylus likewise constrain translation choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys a scholar’s priorities—script before storm, etymology before canopy—so description never drifts into tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the two-day ascent; no impossible positions or weather clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal atrium is not backdrop but tool: its stairs-fountain-ink system constrains Elias’s craft and supplies the crucible ‘hand’. Selective, urgent sense filters (brass tick, brackish channel, iron wind) keep description woven through action. Spatial choreography is clean; distance from creel to ledger to crucible is tracked without drift. The prismatic ceiling and moon-fractured shadow mirror interior state without overt symbolism, charging the final spoon-reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crystal veins, silt, quartz grit, and bioluminescent pulse are filtered through the inspector’s procedural gaze; the shells-as-confessions turn the cave itself into a tactile crucible that constrains the final choice. The sky’s swirling light reprises the cave’s glow, charging the exit image. One notch below 9 only because spatial choreography inside the final chamber is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s sagging roof, ivy-choked tracks, and the cracked-bellows-as-micro-setting constrain every action: map-reading in jagged light, the decision to abandon the booth, the final squeeze of scarred leather. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—Elias notices water stains on timetables, not tourist graffiti. Spatial choreography is immaculate: boots crush ivy, turnstile is stepped over, bridge pilings cast accusatory shadows. Environment charges the final image: the dry trench is the literal bed of guilt, so the right turn is inseparable from the land.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing library, mist, and watch function as micro-setting: shelves “whisper,” mist “presses closer,” watch “burns against ribs,” each constraining her climb and final sprint. Sensory hierarchy obeys her urgency—sound (whispers), touch (warm brass), then visual collapse—so environment guides choice rather than decorating it. The impossible architecture is accepted because the opening line teaches the rule: “mist swallowed the last of the cobblestone path.” Final image—watch hands catching light—recharges the amber glow, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Velvet dome, violet scent, brass telescope, moonlit shards—details are filtered through Elara’s curator gaze and constrain her reach.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Skyborne grotto under aurora is rendered through motion—“walls woven from petrified mist,” wind stuttering against stone—so setting acts as active agent, not postcard. The emerald chip doubles as micro-setting; its fracture plane and spent pulse track state change. Sensory hierarchy skews kinesthetic/tactile, matching mortician attention to corporeal thresholds. Environment constrains the final gesture: the ledge’s curl literally shapes Liora’s reach and limits escape, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    The umbral grotto above clouds, the fig tree, and the scalloped silver fruit each constrain choice: only here can the hairpin seed a new cycle; only this tree bears the cost. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting’s bioluminescent moss and aerial suspension work as micro-setting that charges the final image under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse, shard, and wind chimes function as micro-setting: the chimes’ rising trill directly prompts Elias’s decision to step outside, and the mutable beam reconfigures meaning at the end. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—oil, wick, salt-foam—but broader maritime rules are assumed, not tested. Environment constrains choice: tide exposes the cloak; beam must be relit differently. No factual error, but occupational detail (lens polishing) is decorative, not choice-critical.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Magnetic grotto, floating rock, and starlit fissures are sensuously etched and directly enable the weightless trance; the pond as micro-setting charges the final image by “remembering” ripples. Spatial anchors are clear early; environment constrains the only possible action (stone-drop) and is inseparable from the speculative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arrowhead functions as micro-setting: its changing temperature and vibration against his sternum constrain every tactical choice.

The salt-eaten margins and groaning hull-voice of Leviathan give tactile specificity that could not be transplanted to any other ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct’s sapphire spine, salt-crack lines, and drip cadence are filtered through Elias’s mage-math perception; the bell’s bronze temperature and salt-taste ground every beat. Dawn light evolves from “bleary” to “gold,” mirroring the bay’s revival. Micro-setting qualifies: the bell’s fracture constrains the tuning attempt and charges the final image as a seam rather than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridgeway, steeple, and reservoir constrain every move: the exposed street sign triggers the photo trail; the steeple becomes the final altar. Micro-setting (satchel strap, copper chime, sapphire bottle) doubles as charged object and body-anchor. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices scent, color, and texture in the order a night warden would. Final image of golden Old Hollow is mirrored on the water, recharging every prior sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall anchor by word 30; silvered bark, fractured rainbows, and ozone-tasting air are selective, urgent details. The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its loss is the price of transit. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → strike flame → ground tilts → step through. Setting charges the final image: glass trees pulse like embers, mirroring the blue fire now in her veins.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    The arbor functions as micro-setting: its sway, height, and bioluminescent spores directly constrain her launch window and camouflage the landing. Tool-body-environment triad—buckle wrist-strap, branch curvature, dew that never falls—charges every motion. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices ozone shift before city lights, ignores visual skyline until clouds part. Final shimmer of spores on wind is a reweighted environmental echo of the choice just made.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating rock dojo is not scenery but leverage: its altitude above the valley literalizes “above history,” and its creak under the merge gives haptic feedback that the world is rewriting. Moss-slick edges and tatami wet-prints are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered. The storm is kept external, never allowed to become melodramatic mirror.

The bench, glove, and photograph function as micro-setting; the glove’s texture triggers the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Environment constrains the final choice: the atrium’s silence after the mist vanishes mirrors his new vocational silence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the story’s second character: rusted ladder, salt-slick concrete, warped junction box breathing blue. Sensory hierarchy follows a data-thief’s gaze—copper, fiber optic, silt, silence—never tourist clutter. The phase-seam corridor literally compresses space, turning geography into a tactical trap that forces Elias forward. Final image of the tide re-swallowing the shore reweights the whole subterranean map as a living eyelid.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory is not backdrop but antagonist: frost on the glass dictates her palm-press, server hum modulates her breath, domed ceiling refracts auroras into the ink she must read. Porcelain shard functions as micro-setting—its changing tactile state (sharp → warm → smooth) tracks her stance shift. Snow outside re-patterns in perfect flakes only after she yields, environmental mirror tied to closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-strict: she notices electronic whir, static breath, not constellation names.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)

The final image of cracked diamond in dust crystallizes setting as both grave and cradle.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Underground garden is evoked with fungal glow, root warmth, and thyme tangle rooting every action. Micro-setting objects—arrowhead, cordless phone—function as terrain that constrains choice and later reconfigure into the closure image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: crushed sage and “something older, something hungry” set tone without catalog excess. Spatial choreography holds as vines coil from soil to ankle to swallowing, anchoring the metamorphose beat.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sister-loss vs cosmic joke—tightens when the phone delivers his younger self’s taunt; this deepens rather than widens pressure. One meaningful escalation: arrowhead shifting to seed forces the final either/or. Cost is visible: human body forfeited, static voice assumed. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 600-word window; could wish for a second pressure notch to reach top band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is micro-setting-as-crucible: sky-bridge cables, oldest tree’s brass roots, and locust-shell-as-tool physically constrain her posture and sound transmission. Sensory hierarchy obeys wind-vs-strings urgency; scent of rain arrives only after rebirth, timed to emotional release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bridge to soil without drift. One detail over-ornate (“shattered stained glass” wings) nudges toward purple but fits accumulative texture; still, environment directly shapes final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

    The library’s tessellated walls and fractal carpet physically bend during the climax, constraining Elias’s final act. Sensory triage is POV-specific: he notices dust motes in “slanted light” because they echo scattered memory. The scarf’s pattern warps into dimensions that alter his footing—micro-setting as lived tool. One notch off 9 because the exterior cityscape remains a blank placeholder.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black sand, ozone air, and prism shards refracting sunrise are never backdrop: they constrain footing, expose timing, and literally supply the light-paint that re-stitches the dream. The watercolor palette evolves from artifice to talisman—its wells of shattered prism decide the final flare—so it meets the 9+ gate of charging the last image. Spatial choreography is flawless: tripod → palette balanced on field notes → paper warms under palm → footprint left to tide. Only the absence of island name or map keeps it from 9.2; the archipelago remains a mood rather than a place that could limit next choices.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shop-as-body, meteorite pick, and bruised-twilight ribbon constrain choices and resurface in the final image; starlight and ozone supply sensory hierarchy that mirrors interior shift. Spatial choreography is tight; “walls dissolved into starlight” is an allowed reality slip under experimental add-on because pattern is taught and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse ruin, black water, and shattered dome are tactile, filtering through Elias’s folklorist eye. The mushroom’s iridescence and the stone star-map constrain tactics—without them, detection impossible. Spatial choreography clean: knee-deep → ribs → pedestal → schooner proximity tracked. Final image of re-knit stars mirrors internal restoration, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library’s wax, sagging shelves, and single window constrain choreography—every move circles the reading desk under the pane’s geometry. The cracked-leather scent and playground-hush audio layer provide sensory hierarchy filtered through Elspeth’s archivist priorities. The shadow trapped in glass functions as micro-setting; its ripple when touched directly shapes the annotation tactic and charges the final image. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible body or prop positions during the shadow-lunge scene.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    The parapet stones, mist, and waterfall breath are filtered through Elias’s pruner-eye: he notices branch angles, not tourist vistas. The silver-veined seed and twilight-hued apple act as micro-settings that constrain the only possible cuts. Final image of the lone silver-leafed saplet recharges the earlier “seed not meant for soil,” locking setting to closure. Missing gate for 9+: environment does not actively block or enable the final cut—Elias could have stepped through anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism sanctuary is not backdrop; its fracturing light is the literal tool that lets the freed spirits manifest—environment directly enables the climactic surge. Micro-objects (needle, net threads) are handled in tactile beats and constrain the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors visual refraction, but salt, kelp, and lamp-flame keep the palette balanced. World rule consistency: spirits exit through light-crack, not arbitrary magic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Environment constraints: projector’s click, dripping ceiling, and pillar vibration literally shape Elara’s next move—she waits, palm to stone. Micro-setting—tear in parchment held aloft—functions as pivot object that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound-adjacent touch over visuals, reflecting her profession. Fresco ripple from frequency is specific, not ornamental; it enables the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drowned library is tactile—warped mahogany, bloated books, brass ghosts—each detail filtered through Liora’s salvage eye; the snow globe’s counter-clockwise snow and the sub’s porthole bioluminescence constrain her epistemic stance and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate though the ship’s larger layout remains sketchy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The courtyard-as-server-room metaphor recurs and finally *crashes*, reweighting the setting from ethereal to systemic. Mist, ozone, and the bolt-plate’s pulse act as micro-setting that guides the encoding hand. Spatial choreography stays clean: ledge → graffiti → rip → plate-slam. The inversion of mist *upward* at closure reconfigures the vertical geography, tethering atmosphere to consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The elevator shaft, frost-laced windows, and ice-bound gardens are filtered through Liora’s engineer-eye for angles and light; each detail is purposive, never tourist-catalog. The goggles act as micro-setting: their cracked lenses literally re-fract the world into the final “thousand fractured stars.” Spatial choreography is exact—floor numbers, domes, parapets track cleanly. Environment constrains the final stance: only at the peak can the light hit the ice to create the burn-image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sky gondola is micro-setting par excellence: altitude limits oxygen, sway dictates posture, telescope weight steadies aim. Dusty starlight scent and cold metal anchor body-in-environment. City lights below function as counter-image, gauging altitude and emotional remove. Tool, body, and air together constrain the final surrender, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The oak-library is tactile and constraining: sap scent, mildew, shelves carved into living wood that groans its final hours. Micro-setting—the coin’s worn spiral and the leather lock—functions as environment, guiding her finger-paths when sight is useless. Spatial choreography is clean: coin → lock → glass panes → collapsing beams, all tracked without drift. The final image of light “the color of a sky that had finally learned to stay” fuses setting and theme, charging the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Brass portholes, warped charts, and the dusty hopscotch board are tactile, not tourist gloss. The ship’s creak and starling shadows braid external threat into Liora’s body: she steadies against the wall, breath fogs glass. The hopscotch grid literally routes the ship, so micro-setting constrains the final choice. Sensory economy is tight—no checklist, just three senses, all filtered through map-apprentice bias.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library above clouds is not backdrop; its ice-encased shelves groan under her weight, forcing cautious footfalls that slow the ascent and heighten stakes. The water-mirror’s black stillness functions as micro-setting: its surface tension literally resists and then accepts her hand, determining when the clock-hands can be retrieved. Frostbitten iron frame constrains the size of portal, making the reach-in moment irreversible. “Veins of hauntingly bright silver” reappear at closure, charging the final image with the same light that first revealed the eclipse door.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating stone ribs, starlight fruit, and the brass bell supply tactile anchors that double as metaphors without stalling motion; the butterfly garden micro-setting hosts the pivotal bell-beat. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the curved shadows and warm brass at closure constrain the final gesture. The arches never physically impede or enable action, so environment hovers at mood rather than tactical constraint, capping entry to the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse itself functions as micro-setting: its pane-of-hush membrane constrains every choice—Elias must act inside a structure that literally thins time. Salt-spit waves, sickly amber glow, and the cold wall he presses his ear to are filtered through his attenuated senses; the beam that collapses inward is both spatial and temporal. Spatial choreography is pristine: head carried to clock maw, gears kiss forehead, beam folds. The final image recharges the initial “slow wound” metaphor, now healed into song, so environment and tool jointly crystallize meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cliffside labyrinth, frost-clock, and brass birds constrain every tactical choice; the orchard’s violet fruit is a tactile hazard that charges the final image. Micro-setting of the nut—carved, warmed, pressed—functions as tool and talisman, its evolving state tracked across beats. Spatial choreography is flawless: birds patrol routes, distances metered by frost line, descent crevice mapped. One hairline slip: “stone throat” leans metaphoric rather than sensory, barely keeping it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The braided ravine is not backdrop; its converging channels supply the final metaphor that reconfigures Elias’s grief. Selective sensory detail—foam like “forgotten sheet music,” stone “brittle as the last letter”—filters through an engineer-poet’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → pocket → wade → place → sit → girl appears upstream. The empty chrysalis functions as movable micro-setting whose final exposure to light and water charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystalline branches, quartz counter, and bottled moonlight are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered; the library’s “ink and ozone” scent anchors every beat. The micro-setting of the slate’s hairline fracture becomes the charged object that constrains the final meaning—without it, the repricing fails—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desert-fortress rain, coral veins, and briny condensation are filtered through Elias’s palate-biased perception; the tidal pool literally guides the climactic hand. Environment constrains the choice—only the pavilion’s ice can accept the distilled regret—charging the final image. Micro-setting (warm knife, amber vial) doubles as tactile crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grain elevator, clock tower, and spiral stairs are sketched with sensory economy—brass grooves, copper hands, scent of crushed grain—each filtering through Liora’s music-laden perception. The tower’s mechanism and the elevator’s control room function as micro-settings that physically constrain the final placement of the weight, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: Liora pockets→climbs→kneels→Elias descends; no impossible positions. One minor gap: the “loading dock” appears without prior map-anchor, but the choral scene quickly orients us through sound, so the stumble is momentary.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon’s “fractured ribs,” the mirror’s temperature change, and the ozone scent all constrain the final act of seeing; the mirror’s literal edge even cuts her palm off-page, making the micro-setting a tactile player. Moonlight evolves from silver scalpel to “liquid white membrane,” charging the closing image; spatial choreography stays clean in a single-location scene. 9-band gate met: environment and object together shape the lens-tilting tactic that reweights identity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s quartz teeth, floating pebbles, and bioluminescent mushroom ring are tactile, lived-in, and directly constrain her placement of the manuscript. The lantern’s “clandestinely luminous” flame and the moon-sickle refraction are selective sensory detail filtered through her perceptual urgency. Spatial choreography remains coherent as she kneels, presses, and crashes back. Environment charges the final image: the seed must be planted in that same mist-fed dark, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting: its warming ceramic and weeping glaze constrain Elias’s grip and mark spent effort. Alder grove and cracked oak scaffold every sonic experiment; spatial choreography is clean. Final image—salt beads on the insulator—recharges the motif. Weather and light evolve with the musical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Micro-setting triumph: the dented basalt stone and magnetic field-lines function as environment, constraining every tactical choice (pawn hover, tremor-readings). Twilight scale narrows perception to shimmering air-paths, mirroring internal knight-moves that never landed. Sensory economy—single worn dent, vibrating ground—outperforms landscape breadth. Stone handed upward in final beat re-weights the whole spatial lattice; remove it and the closing breath collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    The brass device, diary clasp, and slanted-roof workshop function as micro-setting: they constrain every tactical move—Elias can’t pick the lock mechanically, must risk sonic trial, must leave the familiar shed. Beeswax/ember/fireworks sensory triad is filtered through his frequency-obsessed perception, never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: single window, copper plate, alley origin, one-block walk to ruins—no floating props. The final stall re-uses “repair” motif, re-charging the earlier “silence repaired here” sign as social re-positioning.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is micro-setting done large: the swaying bridge itself becomes the charged object that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—Liora’s nose edits the world; salt, bark, rot arrive only when they carry information. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms. The village’s vertical geography is learned through action (vault, balcony, new bridge) and charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Inverted river, bioluminescent boulders, gravity clock, and spongy moss on the arch skin all constrain tactics (flight path, sampling, landing site). The sapling inside the cockpit functions as micro-setting that charges the last image. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot attention: air currents first, then rock crust, then sap viscosity. Spatial choreography keeps Veyra, glider, arch, and fracture in clean alignment; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Containers’ metallic hum, tuning-fork resonance, and wind-curved geometry constrain every movement and tool use; the anemometer shatters against this very geometry. Final image—leaning containers exhaling—charges the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (frayed patch, broken gauge) doubles as bodily extension.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: the groaning walls, thawing ground, and color-veined cracks directly constrain and then enable her final step. Micro-setting objects—crystal chime, amber sheet—are handled tactilely and vanish when their job is done. Sensory hierarchy obeys synesthetic bias: color is touch, sound is sight. The final image of “gateways” recharges the earlier “barriers,” satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thunder-Echo Range is evoked through sonic absence rather than vista; the frost-bitten earth, bone-embedded stone, and the gilded flute’s gleam anchor body-tool-environment triad. Micro-setting—the fissure—literally constrains the final choice: stepping across is physical assent. Weather is the quiet itself, a pressure that narrows perception to breath and reed note. Specificity stays selective; no geographic catalog yet place feels lived-in because Elias kneels, palms dirt, and tracks shadow shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Topaz dust, lead-type walls, ink-stained apron compress workshop into tactile crucible; every tool (press, halo fragment, constellation type) constrains or enables Elias’s choices. Environmental degradation—dust raining during climax—mirrors internal surrender without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: body, press, fragment positions track shot-to-shot.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aurora-lit ridgeway is more than backdrop: its glow thins truth, exhales wings, and literally splits to curtain the courier’s exit. The dragonfly-wing shards and living bridge function as micro-setting that constrains how passage is possible. Sensory hierarchy is biased to courier perception—pulse, burn, thrum—never tourist catalog. Geography stays coherent: pebbles skitter, abyss exhales, bridge roots anchor, all tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Quartz branches, frost patterns, and mist are not backdrop—they refract choice: the arbor’s crystalline ribs literally splinter the prism beam that ends the story. Micro-setting (car window frost) doubles as language Elias must parse; failure means possession. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and temperature, matching Elias’s vocation. Spatial choreography is clean: palm to glass, knees to earth, throw into heart of arbor—every object’s position tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-bamboo fusion is not backdrop but tool: the apple skeleton provides the branch from which the tapestry is hung, the bamboo’s whisper supplies the ambient hush that the amber drinks in. Spatial choreography is clean—bead half-buried in loam, loom under the branch, tapestry dissolving into distance. Weather (dawn wind) triggers the dissolution beat. Environment charges the final image: the loom spinner’s bones root in the same soil she threaded, sealing the micro-setting loop.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating rock arches, twin suns, and the mine shaft fissure are not backdrop but tools: the arches realign into bridges, the shaft’s blue glow accepts the silk stitches, forging the new resonance. Sensory economy is ruthless—only cracked-ice shimmer, crushed-fruit air, and forge-hiss enter; each recurs with shifted charge. No landscape catalog; every detail is touched or reacted to under pressure. Micro-setting (the anvil) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Repair-bay micro-setting is tactile and selective—rusted girders, ozone grease, collapsed lift—each detail filtered through Liora’s sensory map. The shard and seam function as portable setting-objects that constrain choice and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sea glass and stone ring function as micro-setting; they constrain every major choice (return/not return, add stone, light candle). Sensory selection stays urgent—salt, rust, dawn green—filtered through Elias’s keeper bias. Lighthouse exterior is sketched only as needed (mist thickness = isolation), no tourist catalog. Final image integrates body/tool/environment: warm stone + glowing glass = tower-as-heart. Meets 9-gate for constraining choice; slight reserve for off-page keepers who never embody space.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The emerald glass isn’t backdrop—it’s the active prism that folds darkness into weaponized dawn; its facets constrain every tactical choice she makes. Salt-worn stairs, ozone scent, the star-choked sky collapsed to dice—these are filtered through Liora’s storm-herald priorities, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her ascent, the palm on the curve, the beam’s inward refraction, the tall silhouette at the tideline. Micro-setting (the wick, the pane, the pane’s vibration) directly charges the final image of spent oil and indentured return.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock tea house, mist, and colored-glass lanterns are not backdrop but tools: the groaning beams echo the ribcage, the lanterns fracture light like the wing’s veins. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, constraining every染色 choice and dissolving at the end. Sensory selection skews visual, but the single auditory cue—“groaning softly”—is perfectly POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is flawless across the suspension-bridge exit.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Dominant stake—“learn why stories magnetize people”—is signaled early and tightens when the dye master realizes the heart aches at the blind poet. One meaningful deepening: the cobblestone illumination turns spectators toward each other, foreclosing his option to keep the power. Agency remains his; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visible: the wing dissolves, arms burn, silence now carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Moonlit tower, salt-fogged brass, weeping mortar—each detail is filtered through Elias’s repairer’s gaze and doubles as emotional barometer. The oaks function as micro-setting: their ring-by-ring absorption constrains the final choice (he can relinquish the shards to them). Spatial choreography is clean; the workbench, arrow-slit, north wall track logically. One tiny gap: we never see him actually carry the shards outside, so the trees’ claim feels lightly asserted rather than witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass fogged by root-breath, mica windows trapping half-remembered dreams: every sensory detail is filtered through Liora’s keeper gaze and directly constrains her method. Spatial choreography is flawless—trees lean, branches weave, distances track as she kneels and bleeds into soil. Micro-setting rule met: the greenhouse itself acts as crucible, its air thickening with returned dawn that forces communal choice. Setting never drifts into postcard; instead it tightens around her throat like a noose that only collective song can cut.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library, bakery steam, and ozone-scented staircase are filtered through Lena’s hyper-attentive guilt. The mirrored chamber functions as micro-setting that literally refracts her identity and forces choice. Brass plaque, ovens, annotated thesis all reappear to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tea-house copper kettle and overgrown palace courtyard function as micro-setting: their dereliction enables secret baking and concealment from guards. Wheat replacing fountain is environmental causality that alters civic movement. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—yeast scent, crust scored with unremembered patterns—filtering through Liora’s bias toward hidden life. One minor spatial elision: “city windowsills” blur geography, but bread distribution network remains legible under accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lantern slide functions as micro-setting: its glass warmth against Elias’s thigh signals the turn from ice to spring. Ice-shelf collapses and ozone scent are selective, pressure-driven details. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible moves. The frozen library dissolving into stardust recharges the bridge image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rotting pier and pirate market are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the slick planks force Lena’s crouch, the lanterns give her the light to flash the fob, the tide becomes executioner. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound—salt, tar, anise—never tourist catalog. The fob functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: tucking it back in pocket = acceptance of inherited silence. Weather/environment literally executes Veyne, charging the ending image.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Veyne realizes he’s outplayed. Cost is legible on-page: his slack face and the market’s held breath foreclose any future deals for Lena. Agency is decision, not violence; the harbor’s tide, not her knife, enforces the price. Persistent constraint (truce-of-hush law) shapes every tactic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lavender bluffs function as micro-setting: petals tremble “like static,” roots pulse with her heartbeat, constraining her final step into the wind. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—ozone, copper, iron—each taste a calibrated datum until the system flips and the same palate becomes the planet’s mouth. Spatial choreography is flawless: the compass ring, puddle reflection, and aurora threads track cleanly across the single scene. The environment literally bends into her at the end, charging the closure image under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment charges the final image: the amethyst vein pulses, the crystals hum, the cave “sings,” and the ladder receives pigment smudges that literalize irreversible change. Tool-as-setting functions—the lock’s teeth and the painting’s stone layers—constrain every tactical choice, culminating in the door-image. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound: mineral drip, wet-stone smell, prismatic ghosts filtered through an artist’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean; the lock is pressed, dropped, and left; pigment replaces it, becoming the new breadcrumb.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse domes, ink-smudged desk, rusted postal chute, and cathedral of letters are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the chute’s collapse demands bodily risk, the letter-curtain literally brushes Elias’s face, the pedestal forces the final script. Sensory selection is urgent—copper haze, damp-earth scent, dying-petal glow—filtered through a calligrapher’s eye for texture and edge. The Archive’s ceiling of unsent confessions reappears as the charged final image, re-weighted when Elias adds his own ungilded sheet. Micro-setting qualifies: the zinc plate evolves from compass to shield to spent key, its tactile states steering every threshold crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bluff’s wind-as-instrument, the iceberg’s light-veins, and the brass-silk spiral are rendered with sensory economy and POV-filtered attention. Micro-setting (the ice pressed to cheek) directly constrains the final sonic release. Spatial choreography is clean; no weather clichés. While environment could slightly more actively threaten (cold, height), it still charges the closure image enough to meet the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dome’s glass, the thorned petals, the box’s petrified grain—each constrains touch and therefore choice. Environment literally presses inward: magnetic tug warps his knee servos, forcing kneeling beats. Final image—the rose tucked behind metal—reweights “strangely organic” through tactile proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The courtyard’s cracked tiles, rust-blue mailbox, and jasmine air are filtered through Mira’s thrift-curator eye; the mailbox’s cold metal against dawn heat constrains her touch and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—sound (tick-tick, radio static) overrides visual clutter. Micro-setting rule met: the mailbox’s hinged mouth reconfigures meaning at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sunken lab is not backdrop; its creaking metal and dying lights physically enable the dice-trigger and force the dance-password. The body-as-tool (bare feet on cold alloy) constrains every pirouette; the hangman’s dice are tactile, weighted, re-used. Greenish glow narrows perception to shifting hues; whale song distant but audible. Spatial choreography clean: dice roll across workbench → console responds; water rises ankle→surface. Final image—salt dissolving on skin—recharges earlier “encrypt vulnerability” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt-crystal chamber functions as both setting and antagonist—its jagged walls narrowing movement and its ozone taste forcing shallow breaths. The brass hook, stone, and lantern are tactile extensions of the body that constrain kneeling, waiting, letting go. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a dockman notices iron rings, kelp rot, and the weight in his pocket before any sky or horizon. Final image re-uses the lanterns’ gleam to mirror the crystals’ “silent stars,” re-charging the opener.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The brook, reeds, moss, and lunar stones form a micro-setting that actively constrains her tactics: water accepts/rejects the wing, reeds sway to signal permission, moss becomes her final bed. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices cold searing skin, paper drinking light, earth pulsing—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean: she kneels, presses, lunges, lies down; distances remain legible. The final image (crane’s shadow overhead) is charged by the setting’s quiet blaze, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bricks, seal-warmth, meteor-sky, and wisteria question-marks are filtered through Elias’s tactile obsession; every descriptor later re-weights during the interrogation beat. The rooftop garden supplies the micro-setting that literally provides the meteor “text” he reads, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across rooftop/apartment transitions; only the basement stair anomaly is mentioned, not enacted, so minor reserve.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet garden breathes” instantiates a micro-setting that is body, tool, and stakes all at once; every description is filtered through Liora’s skeptic-turned-believer bias—she smells “damp parchment” not roses. Spatial choreography is immaculate: knelt→dug→sat back→plucked lily; patrol boots crunch exact path she cleared. Iron-and-sunglass lattice is not backdrop but active amplifier that changes choices. Final image of petals “unfolding in shapes that spelled her name” recharges setting as mnemonic weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Micro-setting dominates: the thorn, ink, and marble floor function as the real terrain. Aurora light and dripping stalactites are selectively filtered through the forger’s urgency—never touristic. The sanctuary’s physical properties (cold stone, oculus above) guide the kneeling choreography and mirror the slow bleed of ink. Environment constrains the final gesture: both men must kneel to write, crown tilting under softened light.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nexus’s silvered ribs, bioluminescent veins, and starlight fissures are not backdrop; they dictate tactics—threads pulse in sync with the shell, forcing Veyra’s song. Micro-setting (the shell’s jagged edge drawing blood) constrains her grip and timing. Spatial choreography is flawless: spiral descent, kneeling Kaelis at thread-hub, shell hurled back up the shaft. One hairline slip: exact distance of the drop is never calibrated, so the climb-out feels slightly weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glacier ice and candlelight constrain every beat—flames mirrored in melted glass, altar names legible only because ice is carved. The snow globe’s “teardrop of glass” functions as micro-setting: its curvature dictates what vision is possible, literally refracting the ghost. Spatial choreography is pristine: widow kneels, Lena crouches, palms meet globe, salt-diesel scent blooms. Final image of Lena’s hand on ice while glacier “sighs” makes environment an active participant in the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The parapet’s wet stone, crushed-mint scent, and moonlit silver road are filtered through Kael’s knot-tuned gaze; each detail later echoes in the nets’ swell, charging closure. The bamboo whisk doubles as micro-setting—its grooves literalize women’s unseen labor, constraining Kael’s ritual stirs. Firefly season is more than wallpaper; lantern pulses sync with whistle tempo, teaching the pattern that Liora must mimic. Spatial choreography is spotless: cup, pot, net, harbor all track.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is a kinetic actor: the stillpoint’s ozone thickness pushes against skin, the diamond’s crack reroutes light and fate. Micro-objects—sap, cracked goggles, fruit skin—constrain tactics (eating raw to survive, lenses smeared yet still sharp). Spatial choreography is flawless; distance collapses when the pit’s lead sheets force him to kneel, aligning body with buried valve. Final image of fruit humming heartbeat on dashboard re-anchors the transformed environment as living organism.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt portico is not backdrop; its temperature, pulse, and final ingestion constrain every tactical choice. Storm above clouds supplies ozone taste and lightning countdown, narrowing perception to the glass surface. Observatory’s altitude justifies the radio array and the city-shadows rising below. Micro-setting—the crack widening “like a scream”—directly forces the sealing action that triggers climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The loft, balcony, and dunes form a micro-settings triad that constrains every move: sand creeps through floorboards, planks groan under weight, wind carries brine that will be trapped. The music box’s salt-dulled brass and the clouded jar surfaces are tactile obstacles to restoration and capture. Spatial choreography is flawless—jar, box, girl’s hand, sagging balcony rails tracked without drift. Final image of dunes painted gold is charged by the box’s fragile note, making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drift-ice marina and brass resonator constrain every tactical choice; even her body becomes a micro-setting that is re-tuned. Black-glass sphere recurs with escalating specificity until it charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight—salt peeled from the air—without checklist drift.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Frozen lake, basalt cliff, and moon-aligned iron viaduct are not backdrop but instruments: the ice must bear his weight and the viaduct must obey lunar torque for the climax to occur. Sensory selection is POV-tuned—magnetic hum through boot soles, glass-breath dawn—never touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (viaduct strut under palm) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel’s 1890s tile, damp mortar, and humming water are not backdrop—they dictate Elias’s route, supply the hidden symbols, and physically constrain the climax when the bricks yield. Micro-setting objects (lantern, satchel strap, broken glass) re-appear with altered stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless: every palm-press, shattered swing, and ladder rung is trackable. The environment literally presses back, forcing the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The antique shop’s stained-glass light pooling over brass filigree, the rain’s warden-rhythm, the lavender scent—each detail is filtered through Elias’s sacramental attention and constrains his tactile work. Micro-setting (the broken music-box cavity) literally shapes the final mechanical marriage. No tourist catalog; every sense note is yoked to the pressure of repair. The shop’s “vibrant hush” is returned in the final paragraph, now re-weighted as earned silence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Rusted prayer” workshop and acid sea function as micro-setting: the groaning ribs and hissing surface directly constrain each launch. Kaleidoscope bolts to ceiling, then becomes the tactical lens that reframes doubt into blueprint—setting charges choice. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile brass & burn over visual clutter. Spatial choreography clean: chains snap, platform tilts, Pip skims sea then gains lift.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archive’s server-farm grid—Server Farm 26, Row 9, Unit 418—becomes a literal maze that must be navigated to reach the lost; spatial coordinates constrain every move. The singed patch functions as micro-setting: its warmth against her palm is the only tactile link to vacuum-frozen wreckage, charging the final press to the chest. Sensory selection narrows to ghost-light, static hum, pixel flicker—perfectly calibrated to data-grave detachment. Tiny credibility slip: hologram corridor appears without prior rule cue, but the image pays off closure so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    lighthouse orchard + ice floes + warped mirrors form a micro-setting that literally directs the climax (“angling them toward the cliff’s edge”). Salt-cracked earth, clicking branches, and frost-rimmed door create multi-sense specificity integrated into action. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Elias descends, exits, positions mirrors. Environment does not constrain a later tactical choice (the ice will break regardless), so misses the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure engine: shifting plates dictate footfall tempo, groans meter her heartbeat. Parasol tip doubles as micro-setting—its silver conducts cold, tests thickness, becomes the divining rod that literally re-routes her path. Sensory triage under crisis: narrowed to sound of ice cracking, smell of salt, lace in palm—no tourist catalog. Final image of windborne solace is charged by environment itself, fulfilling 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment acts as micro-setting and tool: the sagging silk banners, wine cup ghosted by lipstick, charcoal from brazier ashes—each is tactile, re-used, and constraints choice (he draws on the only writable surface the fire left). Autumn dusk and vine-whisper function as chorus, tightening isolation. Spatial choreography tight: crouch, brush, pour, sketch all track cleanly. Setting detail never stalls motion; instead, every sensory hit advances reflection or stakes. Meets 9+ gate: pavilion detritus directly charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dunes, pavilion silk, and parapet metal are not backdrop but instruments: the parapet’s vibration literally reseals the clearing, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—crushed mint, warm metal, bone mask—each detail filtered through Lysan’s tactile urgency. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or floating rooms. The micro-setting (the parapet curve beneath her palm) functions as the story’s surgical table, constraining every tactical motion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lavender sprig, rusted fence, and the map case function as micro-settings that literally constrain camera placement and metaphoric re-stitching. Sensory economy is superb: scent carries both soothing and metallic history; crushed petals stand in for time’s passage. Factory ruins evolve from oppressive to “standing a little straighter,” proving environmental causality. The dove-gray case’s leather texture returns as the final tactile promise—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Library is rendered through sensory triangulation: stained-gold floor, sagging chandelier, cold vibrating prism. Each detail couples to action—ladder groan, crystal kiss—so setting literally bends sound and choice. Shadowed dawn light mirrors suspended language growth; chandelier prism functions as micro-setting that charges final image. Meets 9+ gate: crystal constrains and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Fog, rust, and salt-soaked wood are not backdrop but tactical media: chalk glows on wet stone, driftwood grain dictates arrow direction, sculpture’s chest accepts the tape. Micro-setting (shellacked tin box) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy narrows to taste of static and metallic tang—POV-biased, never touristic. Final image of tide removing arrows recharges every prior marker with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lunar observatory above clouds is not backdrop; its trembling floor and silvered domes constrain the choice to stay or leap. Micro-setting of the spinning clock hand functions as tool and terrain—its brass blur is the pivot of the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Elias notices hairline cracks, ozone scent, the hum of gears—never tourist catalog. Final image of domes “cradling more than light” recharges setting with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The micro-setting—hospice common room thick with chamomile and paper—constrains Lena’s tactics: she must play softly, read clenched knuckles, and time her exit to the nurse’s arrival. Cloud-top “radiant haven” functions as a charged metaphorical frame rather than literal geography, but the final image of moon-lit falling vinyl reweights the sky-bound setting as a place of release, not escape, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating-isle observatory is evoked through brass gears, frost that never melts, and a sky “like embers in a dying forge,” each detail filtered through Elara’s instrumental gaze. The telescope, automaton, and key operate as micro-setting—every manipulation of them alters her tactical options—so environment directly constrains choice. Spatial choreography stays clean: bodies track around the workbench, lens, chest plate, second keyhole. Only the “library between worlds” tilts toward generic portal imagery; a single concrete detail (shelves of breathing doors?) would have lifted this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden is not backdrop—it actively withholds or grants access, forces the bargain, and supplies the black-silver water that becomes the star-map. Micro-setting (the tooth, the needle) constrains choice: she can’t enter the bargain without the tooth, and the needle’s charred history links the river corpse to the garden. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Liora notices medicinal scents (mint, iron) consistent with her bone-setter eye. Spatial choreography is clean—she slips through, crosses to the well, steps back through; brother waits “by the river,” anchoring the returned geography. No static museum tour; every detail is touched or inhaled.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto’s serpentine mist, quartz veins, and tidal breath constrain movement and supply the only “tools” (salt, friction, echo) that polish glass and memory. Environment doubles as body: the mist “curling around her ankles” externalizes grief and later retreats as peace. The sea-glass itself functions as micro-setting, its temperature and weight tracking emotional voltage. One hairline slip: “reflectively vibrant” is used twice with identical phrasing, a micro-loop that dulls specificity a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Environment-body-tool triad: server-rack grave, pendant burn, moss scent each constrain choice. Micro-setting (pendant at throat → Javier’s neck) drives the transfer beat. Sensory economy favors green bitterness and damp concrete; no filler visuals. Final image charges setting: pendant on new skin, moss in old rack—wound becomes vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The feral nexus is not backdrop; the whirlpool geography forces Elias to crouch, to lean, to let the water take him. The damp manuscript pages bleeding new ink is a micro-setting that directly enables the closure beat. Sensory selection narrows to cold, wet, spiral—mirroring his shrinking resistance. One tenth off 9.0 because the cameo figures’ spatial positions are briefly indistinct, though this serves the hallucinatory texture rather than confusing choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor is not backdrop but actor: soil pulse, stretching-silk tendrils, scent of ripe earth all feed the causal loop. Copper-winged automaton functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it perches on her shoulder, literalizing old tools under new vocation. Sensory selection stays POV-bound—Mira notices gear-oil and leaf-gold in proportion to her twin devotions. Spatial choreography clean; no floating vines or impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crater’s silence, wind that “died before it could howl,” and the frostbitten soil constrain her ritual—she kneels because the wind does not blow her fragments away. The apple husk functioning as reliquary is a micro-setting object that literally encloses the final image. Sensory selection favors touch and temperature over visual spectacle, matching the POV’s need for stillness. One minor slip: “skeletal trees” is a winter cliché amid otherwise crisp cold-metal imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The marble cavern’s reflective skin literally dictates the acoustics he needs and paces his obsession; the timer screw becomes a tactile souvenir that will live under the floorboards, constraining future hiding. Sensory selection is POV-driven (silver veins, frost breath, not tourist visuals). Professional locksmith detail is minimal but accurate and scene-relevant. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single continuous scene. Environment charges the final image: the cavern’s weeping ice mirrors the nearing loss of access.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bronze grotto functions as both environment and instrument: its plates shingle sound into silence, constrain her breath, and finally accept the dissolved weights. The lamp burner’s brass throat, the starlit cracks, and the spiraled grooves are tactile, selective, and charged. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every tilt of the lamp tracks. The grotto’s material memory supplies the final pressure; without it, the ending’s reconfiguration collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting: light fractures across the lion’s flank and literally determines where the widow places the final carving, charging the closure image. Cedar scent and worn ladder rungs are handled, not catalogued; they anchor body-in-space and mark time passing. Spatial choreography is flawless—ladder, kettle, window-sill track cleanly. Weather affects choice: the tapering rain parallels the tapering of grief’s urgency, letting the lion “stay” in sunlight.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The kinetic lagoon is no backdrop: its viscous memory-surface dimples to reveal younger selves, physically catches Lira differently each time, and delivers the final reconfiguration. Brass horses, rusted platform, and camera wheel act as micro-setting that constrains tactics—every scavenged object is handled, advanced, or surrendered in beat-level action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terminal’s “arched ribs of corroded steel” and “circuit-board floor plan” are not backdrop but obstacle: layout dictates path-finding, water pressure re-opens doors, scavenged carnival scaffolding becomes bridge supports. Sensory triage matches crisis—burnt-sugar scent, bruise-colored sky, algae-thick water—each detail either signals hazard or usable resource. Micro-setting (the sextant fragment) charges the final image when pocket warmth syncs with horizon turn. Spatial choreography is exact: collapsed kiosk to hydroponics bay to second-story exit track cleanly across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal forecourt is not backdrop; its cool yield under bare feet shapes the decision to kneel, and its crack physically mirrors/amplifies his facial lines, forcing irreversibility. Micro-setting of the orrery parts—brass arms, moonstone pendulum—are handled, arranged, and asym-misaligned on the fractured surface; their tactile re-assembly is the climax. Hidden sunrise and petrichor narrow sensory bandwidth to match his narrowed life—only the olfactory and visual bleed through, guiding the moment he cracks silence. 9+ gate met: forecourt’s fracture directly charges final image; environment enables the ultimate asymmetrical tick.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Canal, barge hull, algae-slick piling form a micro-setting that constrains steering and mooring choices. Mist, wake, and heron wing supply cadence shifts that mirror internal letting-go; no static postcard. Brass sundial operates as handled tool-as-setting, its bent gnomon charging the final “squint” image. Sensory economy favors tactile and visual filtered through Liora’s salvage-trained eye—no filler.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Golden dock, snow-load groan, and fulgurite glass function as micro-setting that literally supports the final splice; removing any one breaks the beat. Sensory economy is purposeful—frost, muted planks, the *shhh* of waves—filtered through Elias’s collector gaze. Spatial choreography holds: rope is uncoiled, spliced, re-coiled; no impossible positions. Weather (fog thickening) tightens the final moment by dissolving egress, directly charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shadowed autumn garden is not backdrop but micro-setting that constrains: damp earth hides the locket, willow fingers trace wounds, bench becomes archive. Sensory triage follows Elias’s obituary gaze—smell of salt on absent cloak, skeletal vines rattling like unwritten names. Spatial choreography is flawless: every object Elias touches (thread, soil, locket) stays pocketed and carried forward. Final image of wind moving through trees after ship has sailed recharges the garden’s “breath” as ongoing, living absence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Palace-as-cage micro-setting constrains every move: black-iron chains dictate vertical choreography, misting abyss supplies salt-stiff texture to robes. Egg, vial, needle, and glass-wing shards function as portable setting extensions that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory—grinding gears, steam wheeze, shell crack—mirroring Aldric’s haptic obsession. Final refraction of “dying light” reuses established photic vocabulary to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and fire-coat function as micro-setting that literally constrains action: the jagged grains cut the boy, the mirror-still water reflects the sky’s gold verdict, the coat’s hem becomes surgical field. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices heat-memory in sand before she notices the child. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel → thread → stand → bind → help to feet, all tracked. Final image reweights the lagoon from mirror to lullaby, a cadence shift that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective sensory economy dominates: rust-tinged water, green coins, chalk arrows, lavender with no source—each later re-echoed (fountains weep light) to charge the finale. Body-as-setting works; her palm, fingers, and breath tether reader spatially inside the continuous scene. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible moves. Micro-setting rule met: the stained glass box constrains her final choice and is tactile in every segment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nebula garden is evoked through kinetic, synesthetic detail—“petals of ionized gas,” “hum of frequencies” felt in bone—so setting is both atmosphere and tool. Spatial choreography is minimal (no distances or body positions shift), but the micro-setting of the gear pressed to temple serves as the pivot object that constrains the final choice. Consistency is flawless; no world rule contradicts. While the environment never actively impedes Veyra (no thorns, no gravity shear), its luminous “cradle-cage” metaphor charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse glass, wet soil, bruised-violet dusk, and chisel in hand form a micro-setting that constrains every decision. The cracked granite’s physical state directly enables the “hollow” carving tactic and charges the final image. Butterfly projections on glass evolve with scene beats; spatial choreography (kneeling, standing, walking to house) stays clean. Sensory selection—jasmine scent, calloused skin, raindrops as chisel—mirrors interior without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but hydraulic antagonist—its salt-spray veins glisten on the stones, its surge snapped the rake that now records sins. Micro-setting rule: the broken rake handle functions as movable set, its splinters constraining palm and tactic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: Elias presses the handle against the pendulum, a tactile fusion of relic and mechanism. Final image recharges the ridge’s hiss as the world exhales, environment mirroring internal balance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective, pressure-driven detail: lantern light on blood-colored thread, marigolds leaning like parishioners, silo door that “never quite latched.” The body-as-micro-setting (calloused fingers, soil warmth) constrains every untangling motion. Final image—stars too bright, petals praying—mirrors internal reconfiguration without overt symbolism. One hairline slip: “cobalt silo exhaled” risks physics vagueness, but the breath is Elias’s perception, not literal, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The spire’s black glass swallowing light, the ledger page warming under comet ink, and the kingfisher feather as micro-setting all constrain choice and charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (cold biting fingers, ink blooming veins) mirrors internal state without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel → brush snow → hairline crack → dot → bloom → starlings. Only the thinnest margin below 9 because the lake’s geography beyond “shore” remains lightly sketched—adequate but not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    The radio dial’s glow functions as micro-setting: it dims under speech, dictates the blackout beat, and charges the final blank-page image. Mist and damp paper constrain acoustics and risk detection. Spatial choreography is clean—door knock → dial dim → paper transfer. Environment mirrors internal flicker without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Gallery-as-setting is evoked through selective sensory detail—damp plaster, creaking rocker, draft scattering ashes—rather than tourist catalog. The vanishing-point conceit is taught early and constrains choice: Liora kneels “in the center” because perspective never resolves, so her art must dissolve rather than arrive. Micro-setting objects (mask, powder, rocker) evolve: shards bite deeper, powder re-settles in new patterns, rocker ceases—each state-change alters her next move. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and dust motes track across the single room without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Copper-stench sewer, rust-grate applause, brackish water at the feet—senses are filtered through Elias’s scavenger gaze and steer his choices (what can be salvaged, what hidden). The sunken ribs groaning overhead constrain movement and foreshadow collapse; the warped-iron bench literally supports his rebellion. Micro-setting (cog held above rising water) becomes the final altar, charging the last gleam with conceptual cost. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by line 15.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its “traveled stillness” and amber-stained shelves actively shape the tactic of listening rather than singing. Autumn’s leaf-fall is filtered through Elias’s musician ear—“each leaf a note falling silent”—so environment mirrors internal cadence. Spatial choreography is clean; five bodies circle one table, rosette centered. The rosette itself is the charged object that constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rusted greenhouse as micro-setting constrains every act: broken glass invites homeless inside, iron ribs force vine-routing, ruin supplies chipped bowls. Sensory hierarchy obeys chef’s palate—air “thick and warm as rising dough,” fruit scent “like nostalgia given form.” Bodies track cleanly: kneel, brush, slice, serve; no geography drift. Weather (storm-static air) mirrors internal charge yet never announces symbolism. Tool-becomes-setting: the pruning shears enable synaptic shaping and final seed-saving, charging closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Vertical-farm grid, copper-warm tower ribs, ozone wind, and lacquer-smooth edges supply tactile micro-setting that guides the planting choice. Drone choreography stays spatially coherent; the city’s vertical scale is sketched through dock-points and lattice wings rather than postcard skyline. Lightning tower doubles as body-proxy (cold rungs, warm ribs) and charges the final image—warm sunrise felt, not seen. Detail economy is tight; no exposition dump; environment is navigated, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Bay-as-micro-setting constrains the ritual: tide scatter dictates object choice, wet dock wood accepts the key’s imprint, briny air carries orris. Weathered dock, amber streetlights, and chipped teacup recur with shifting charge, culminating in the “hushed blaze” glow that mirrors interior reconfiguration. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-place-press-exit tracked without drift. Environment is not backdrop but collaborator—salt stiffness on ribbon, tide limits on placement—guiding the spiral geometry that precipitates insight.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Black-basalt Liora, foxglove stain, and six-arm mosaic woman are never touristic; each constrains the intruder’s next touch or thought. Pressure-suit mechanics (glove, lamp, helmet purge) are lived-in, determining when breathing becomes possible. Garden’s sagging arches and kelp-wrapped light evolve from drowning cage to birth canal, mirroring internal shift. Spatial choreography clean: ampoule drops from belt to mosaic palm in one trackable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The staircase-as-setting is rendered through tactile micro-detail—stone seams, gray haze that “peels back like fabric”—and the dice function as portable micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the die’s stutter-path maps the exact step she leaps to, making environment inseparable from agency. Gate satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse’s oxygen-starved pocket, moon-lit glass slats, and the fig leaf as living parchment literally constrain every stroke he makes; remove any of these and the script cannot exist. Smog taste, impossible rain, and the child’s rooftop voice evolve the city across beats, making atmosphere a causal agent that thins just enough to reveal the moon. Sensory hierarchy stays painter-vision: color particles (lapis, silver, saffron) trump sound, aligning with an artist who reads hue before language. The final “air smelled of rain” reweights the prior impossibility into earned environmental reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The waterfall’s spray-painted lichen, oven heat warping air, and honey-coloured comb return as micro-settings that physically constrain tactics: steam teaches dough, spray erodes stone, colour guides rescue. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Liora notices sound, damp, and light in curator’s order. Final image of emerald splinters glowing “like stars” inside the museum wood charges the closure with an environmental echo that cannot be swapped out.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse’s rusted ribs and violet storm-light constrain Elias’s movements—he must crouch into the gear-labyrinth, let cold fire wrap his ankles. Hunger stones shift from warning to doorway under his weight, reconfiguring the spatial stakes. Black sand, salt sting, and brass shavings are filtered through his repairer’s gaze, never touristic. Environment is inseparable from the final image: the tide’s return physically seals the path he took, embodying the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Funhouse is handled as body-scale tool: mirrors yield like tissue, spiral corridors trackable in single POV. Micro-setting objects—opera-clasp, film-strip—constrain tactics (clasp click = release mechanism). Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but justified by photographic curse. Spatial choreography stays clean through the lunge-through-mirror beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Driftwood-orchard is not backdrop but instrument: density of roots, shells, iron pot constrains every strike and rewrites the sky. Pear fruits “glowing from within” charge the final image when same energy re-emerges in Leeward’s chest. Micro-setting (mallet, branches, husk) doubles as geography; spatial choreography is flawless—every strike has a tactile surface. Environment literally shapes tactics and the closing chord.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Turtle-shell city is no postcard: stress-fracture grooves, exhaling shells, and salt-fused iron gate constrain every tactic Elyas tries. The crack-under-his-palm micro-setting doubles as tool and archive, charging the final image when it “speaks” back. Sensory hierarchy obeys cartographer bias—pressure, resonance, groove—rather than tourist checklist. Spatial choreography clean: watchers step forward, turtles groan, city trembles in causal sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-objects dominate: the B-illumination, the oilcloth, the crate lid, all handled under torch beam; choices hinge on their access. The station itself supplies secrecy then threat—ivy-covered tunnel slows Callahan’s approach, giving Elias seconds to file photos. Visual bias matches scholar’s lens-like attention; no tourist dump. Spatial choreography stable across lunge/retreat. Tonally the mildew and rust mirror decay of Church narrative. The ivy’s swallowing “into the dark” charges final image, anchoring 9+ gate for environment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pavilion’s drowned marble and algae-slick chandeliers are filtered through Elias’s surveyor gaze; every sensory note guides his trowel or pen. The inkwell’s brass warmth against his hip micro-functions as setting-as-tool, constraining the final trade. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment directly supplies the note crack that triggers the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment acts as co-antagonist: the pressure lock, rising seawater, and rusted wheel physically constrain every move and meter breath. The brass lamp’s slant and the stamp’s faint impressions are tools whose shifting angles literally reveal hidden knowledge, charging the final image when Elias re-imprints the stamp into the ledger. Spatial choreography is immaculate—distance from worktable to east wing traced by map, water level tracked beat by beat. Setting never decorates; it tightens options until silence itself becomes a navigable corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Basilica and tea garden evolve from static monuments to agents: glass thins to invite entry, cranes transmute from paper to light; these micro-settings physically constrain every tactical move and charge the final ascension image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory steel ribs, storm lattice on screen, and geode facets are returned to at every beat; each constrains action—she can’t flee the dome, can’t ignore the crystal’s warmth. Micro-setting (body) tracks: palm on cold glass, pulse in throat, exhaled breath in blackout—environmental stress narrows perception believably. Spatial choreography is clean: console → screen → finger hover → dark exit, no impossible positions. Final image charges theme: dome’s dying lights mirror the “unmade past” she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Observatory stones, drone wings, and ceiling oculus all constrain movement and camera angle; the foundry chip’s worn edges charge the final image. Dusk light is filtered through Lena’s technician eye—she times magnification to solstice angle—so setting guides choice. Spatial choreography is clean: drone descends, claw extends, slot opens, bodies shift. No extra geographical clutter; every stone and star is used.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt tiles, brass cuff, driftwood hollow—each object is tactile, weighted, and conscripted into choice; terrace color mirrors bruise-memory. Micro-setting triumph: the watch hand becomes a portable shore, the hollow becomes a mailbox; environment is handled, not observed. Salt-free paper inside wet wood is a micro-credibility stretch but pays off as conceptual re-pricing. Sensory hierarchy obeys a professional fabricator’s forensic eye—every grain counted, every edge worn.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The parapet’s slick stones and windblown mist constrain footing and dialogue timing; the chasm’s void mirrors the unbridgeable moral gap. The drawer-pull’s micro-setting—moonlit tarnish on stone—becomes the decision pivot. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sight under storm urgency. Environment actively shapes the handshake and the boy’s first free step.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coastal micro-setting (skeletal buoys, sagging wires) stays tactile and POV-filtered; the leaning utility pole recurs until it gilds the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Salt-kelp-jasmine sensory triad mirrors emotional thaw. Spatial choreography clean: launch → seven poles → bar → post office, all tracked on foot. No museum tour; each detail either blocks escape or lures homeward.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent lake is not backdrop; its warmth and reactive light actively force Liam’s裸露 hand test, constraining tactics. “Baseball in damp tunnel air” and “city stink of rain on pavement” supply tactile, olfactory specificity filtered through a felon’s sensory priorities. Spatial choreography is airtight—tunnel fissure squeeze, kneel, throw, dry stone emergence—no impossible body moves. Environment charges the final image: the untouched ball in grass implies time’s labyrinth still rolls outside his reach.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orchard-moon, oldest tree, and spice-clouded air constrain every conjuring attempt; soil “heartbeat” doubles as body/setting hybrid. Micro-setting (vanilla pod, nutmeg grit) serves as tactile tools that scar or glow—charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating white-room moments. One hairline slip: “crushed saffron” breath is less grounded than other sensory hits.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cloud-top glade, spongy moss, starless ink, and the porcelain saucer form a micro-setting that literally absorbs time; every descriptive beat is filtered through Liora’s cartomancer gaze and finally constrains her choice to let go. Selective sensory hierarchy (smell of regret, laughter at ankles) tightens the uncanny without clutter. One clause drift—“suspended above the clouds like a forgotten breath”—slightly overwrites, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting—the photograph’s shimmer of dried tears—functions as portal anchor and literally guides the stitching hand; it constrains every attempt and ignites at climax. Spatial choreography is clean: console, observation deck, gravity flickers track bodily. “Grass was green” final image recharges recurrent absence-of-color motif. Proper-noun economy: only *Eulogy*, Kwan Yin, Lien named—sufficient. Environment enables and forecloses tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black-sand beach, mirror shard, pumice raft are tactile tools that constrain movement and charge the final image; volcano exhales and receding tide act as live clock. Sensory hierarchy favors heat, smell, grit—never tourist checklist. Spatial choreography is clean: cave mouth → cliff → lava tide-line → raft launch. Details evolve causally (footsteps write fresh prophecy in wet dust). One-step deduction for occasional soft focus (“celestial bodies dragged their heels” risks generality).

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silvered walls, trapped-light orbs, half-painted sundial—selective sensory triad that doubles as tactical map. The sundial’s coded angles physically constrain Kael’s timing, qualifying for 9+ gate, though environmental pressure could bite even tighter into his skin in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting triumph: collapsed-star dust grains (warm, pulse-heavy) function as both tool and anchor—she grips them, they bite, burn, thread aurora through bone, and settle inside her, literally re-weighting her bones. The tidal bluff under aurora is not postcard scenery; its vanishing friction enables the ritual and threatens to erase her. Spatial choreography is flawless: water rises with intention, mirror forms, shards scatter. Final image of her footprints as “only friction left” recharges both dust and bluff.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory glass, rusted workbench, and cracked dome are handled, not wallpaper; the leaking pane literally re-inks the poem. Micro-setting (body as atlas) constrains the final self-definition. Sensory hierarchy narrows to storm-touch and ozone under pressure. Spatial choreography holds across spiral descent. One minor weather cliché (“sky turned ocean”) does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass atrium refracts light onto the half-painted dial’s wet pigment, constraining sword angles and sight-lines; the brook’s bend physically echoes the city’s first moral compass, guiding Elias’s final thrust to the gnomon’s hidden notch. Brass-geared arm and tin needle card act as micro-settings that limit grip and parry options. Haptic specificity—“crushed mint,” “sparks on brass”—is selective under crisis-narrowed attention. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; bodies circle the dial without impossible positions. Weather/light evolve with afternoon angle, directly enabling the code-casting shadow that unlocks the compartment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting objects—tin, violet, lamp—constrain choice and charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Library’s rusted shelves and broken bars are filtered through Elias’s scavenger eye, guiding access and risking capture. Spatial choreography is clean: books are stacked, bodies crouch, violet passes hand-to-hand. Weather (wind through bars) is linked to stakes but not over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arbor’s “gnarled branches above the clouds,” the salt-yellowed ivories, and the ozone-and-paper annex form a tactile tri-level set that gates every move: climb, play, splice, enter. Spatial tracking stays clean—projector beam, pocket compasses, swinging pendulum—all converge on the threshold without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nightshade ridge as micro-setting: the fissures she fingers, the salt-scent updraft, the mud between toes—all constrain the seed planting and later absorb her pulse. The blooming nightshade and twilight-colored seed are tactile tools that charge the final image (violet-stained teeth). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a reality checker notices resonance, texture, taste of “first question ever asked.” Weather is not backdrop but causal agent—monsoon breath triggers the dreamers’ wake. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and is inseparable from the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the bonsai pot, compass, and Elias’s calloused palms form the immediate tactile environment that literally constrains the final action—roots must encircle brass. Saltgrass breeze and drying sand modulate emotional temperature, steering the hum’s pitch. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: a fisherman notices tide-chart ink before sky color. The lace-map etched on the compass back is the single detail that earns 9+ gate—its grooves dictate the diffuse technique that lets apology seep instead of snap.

Its light evolves from gold to molten red to star-pricked black, mirroring the chemist’s unraveling and Liora’s absorption. The body (Liora’s wrist), tool (silver cuffs), and object (petal) all constrain choices: the petal must be touched, the cuffs read charge, the grotto contains the transformation. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure—bergamot sharpness, static buildup, crumbling texture—never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    The seaside library courtyard is vividly anchored—salt breeze, lantern light, oleander—and filters through Elias’s professional gaze (“spotting undervalued goods”). The setting supplies key resources: the donation box, the desk, the side door—all used tactically. However, while atmosphere charges mood, it doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond providing location; the locket and envelope drive action more than the environment itself, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crystalline orchard and Shimmer Crater aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the orchard’s refracted stories necessitate tangible kinship (the arbor), while the crater’s dissolving languages pressure Reed to act before meaning vanishes. Obsidian’s “trapped starlight” and violet paint’s warmth charge the final image—kinship made visible through touch. Spatial choreography (pairs descending, Reed alone at the lip) tracks cleanly, with setting details filtering through Reed’s sculptor POV (e.g., noticing reed-like scars on Syl).

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rooftop canal system isn’t backdrop but crucible: crumbling parapets force Elspeth’s vulnerability, black waters birth echoes and defy gravity (ink pooling upward), and towers-as-bones literalize the giant metaphor that constrains every choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—bioluminescent veins, silver thread’s hum—while avoiding tourist cataloging; details emerge through goal-directed action (dipping brush, plunging hand). Final image charges setting: clocktower chime “stretching thin” makes time tactile, proving environment shapes tactics (jar-throw alters canal physics) and closure (moths spiral from air, not sketches). No static repetition; water evolves from ink-like to hissing to rewinding.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    The cavern orchard functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every choice: its silence pressures the conjurer’s quest, its mineral drips nourished the lost life, and its bioluminescent lichen interacts with the glass eyes to produce the pivotal prism.

Spatial choreography (crawl space → vent → reading room) remains coherent, grounding every beat in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mossy trellis, wet soil, and linden’s roots actively constrain and charge choices—the path-splitting roots force reckoning, the trellis becomes a collaborative lattice only after Liora surrenders. Rain isn’t backdrop but agent: it blurs boundaries, enables metamorphosis, and culminates in Liora’s baptismal stance. Every sensory detail (waxy-to-pliable leaves, electric hum in bones) filters through Liora’s botanist POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting evolves causally—from glistening tapestry to wild, interwoven growth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    Liora functions as a living micro-setting: salt-cracked mud, warped chapel doors, and bioluminescent cavern veins aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Elias’s path. The tidal island pressures his choices—no rigs, no people, only rain and ruins—and supplies the very object (brooch) and mechanism (groove in altar) that drive the climax. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: straight rain signals the island’s satisfaction, making environment inseparable from emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    The musical crystal cave isn’t backdrop—it actively pulses, refracts sound into music, and breathes underfoot, directly enabling the entity’s manifestation and Liora’s epiphany. The pearl’s swirling colors and black quartz cradle charge the final image through tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned observatory functions as micro-setting: its cracked dome, warped floor, and broken teeth directly enable and constrain action (wind howling through rafters amplifies sound; cliff edge becomes writing surface). The painted shell and half-finished cello are tactile extensions of setting that charge the final image—shell’s paint flakes like embers during climax, cello’s hollow belly hums with unplayed storms. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s crisis: focus narrows to shell, strings, dissolving ink. Final line (“observatory no longer felt abandoned”) reweights the entire space through earned emotional resonance, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lumina isn’t backdrop but active constraint: walkways sway, waterways drain, rafts unmoor—all shape tactics (redirecting currents, painting on plywood). The foundation chip and spray can function as micro-settings that charge closure—pressing the stone into wet paint literalizes stakes. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“acrid tang of frying dough,” “flickering neon”), filtered through Elira’s conflicted POV. The carnival’s lights reflecting “like scattered promises” ties environment to theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lunar summit isn’t backdrop but active constraint: low gravity affects movement (“boots crunched”), vacuum shapes breath (“fogged the inside of his helmet”), and dawn’s light dictates the drones’ arrival. The camera, sand grain, and canister function as micro-settings that charge the ending—especially the ghostly shadow in the final photo.

Every detail serves pressure or perception, filtered through a blind artisan’s tactile worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake aren’t backdrop but active crucible: the dock creaks under Lena’s weight, the black ice thins at the center, and the condensation she manipulates becomes a delta pointing north-by-northwest. These micro-settings constrain choice—the lake’s unnatural stillness demands investigation—and charge the final image as water “unfolds” beneath her palm. Sensory detail (wet stone scent, salt-stiff coat lining) filters through Lena’s atlas-editor precision without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobblestones, archway, well, and forge aren’t backdrop—they’re active agents. The arch groans and decides; the well answers with felt resonance; cobblestones warm with memory.

Spatial choreography remains coherent despite subterranean shifts, anchored by lantern light and root paths.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    The golden arcade functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its neon ghosts and humming cabinets frame Lena’s analog rituals as resistance to digital erasure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she notices grit of chalk, fogged breath, crinkle of wrapper—not as backdrop but as texture of her craft. The rusted mailbox and rice paper bleed ink because the environment demands low-tech trust. Final image of sun-glare on gold trim reweights the setting as both sanctuary and threshold, charging closure with thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s a resonant chamber where tools (telescope, loom, candle) constrain and enable action.

Final image of poppies erupting from rifle barrels is inseparable from this setting’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.6)
    The opal library isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible. Moonstone shelves, glass-orchids, and starlight books aren’t decorative; they constrain Liora’s role and react causally to the chime’s song (orchids recoil, books bleed). The setting charges the climax: sunlight only enters after destruction, transforming the space from tomb to ruin. Every detail serves pressure or closure—the bamboo chime’s materiality dictates its repair and fragility. The micro-setting (the chime itself) directly enables and disables agency.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.4)
    The archive functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its scent, shelves, and scrolls are tactile anchors that shape Elara’s urgency and method.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ancient terrace isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint and witness: its cracked mosaic frames the standoff, its stones “hum” with names, and its lavender-gunpowder scent embodies the story’s tension. The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting, its notches and grain directly shaping choices (Veyra’s touch, Kael’s hesitation). Midsummer sun and celestial dance aren’t ornamental—they time the ritual and gild the ambiguity of surrender/beginning. Final image ties setting to theme: rain will wash the terrace clean, but only after the human act of signing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The salt flat isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible: its cracks guide action, its crust receives the egg, its indifference frames moral ambiguity. Sensory detail is selective (brittle crust, scent of old rain, thunder’s roll) and filtered through Elias’s guilt-haunted perception.

    The alchemical orchard isn’t backdrop but crucible: glass panes weeping condensation, roots tracing sigils, and petals pulsing unnamed light directly pressure the knight’s choice to speak. The setting evolves causally—clearing panes reveal the stage only after unsnapping—and the greenhouse’s temporal distortion (“endless night”) tightens stakes. Every sensory detail (crushed silverleaf, ozone-rose scent) filters through the knight’s traumatized perception. Final image recharges the orchard as threshold, not refuge.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    The foster care file room functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: dust patterns guide discovery, manila folders embody bureaucratic erasure, the chipped mug signals institutional decay. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elias notices coffee tang, paper yellowing, chair creaks—because they mirror his emotional landscape. The brass button’s physical state (bent shank, tarnish) evolves from object to relic to catalyst, directly charging the final envelope. Environment doesn’t just reflect—it enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    The auric lagoon isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its starlight-trapping water enables the map (“puddles at dusk… revealing the booth’s location”), constrains timing (“only when the sky bled violet”), and charges the final image (ripples where the booth stood). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Lena notices ozone smell, liquid memory ripples, fogged glass—not tourist cataloging. The key and booth function as environmental extensions, their physical states (rusted, dangling receiver) mirroring thematic decay and resilience. Final image (“sidewalk gold” at sunset) contrasts the lagoon’s truth with daylight lies, deepening the setting’s moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prism atrium functions as micro-setting: its rainbows reform the prophecy, forcing the saxophonist to “carve hollows in the air.” Dewdrops, mist, and velvet hush aren’t backdrop but active constraints—each sensory detail (crushed mint, slick stone) pressures his tactics. The final image of dewdrops breaking in light directly charges closure, embodying the theme of fragile containment. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains precise even in lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ashen arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. Its floating roots, whispering leaves, and silver-veined bark directly shape Liora’s choices (climbing higher, building monuments, interpreting runes). The mossy, parchment-sky atmosphere charges every image, especially the final grove that replaces the arbor. Setting functions as micro-setting (body/tool) when Liora’s palm becomes the moonstone’s home, altering her very physiology by story’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the subterranean waterfall, greenhouse leaves, and bone-yard workshop all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“earth still smelled of charcoal and half-burned letters,” “leaves glowing faintly like embers”).

Spatial choreography remains coherent despite vertical shifts (workshop → greenhouse → cavern → surface).

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    The rain-washed foundry isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: slick ash grounds Liora’s kneeling, corroded roof amplifies storm dirge, crucible’s scorched lip becomes altar. Crucially, the setting charges the closure: molten coin seals crucible seams with golden light, and the unbroken vial glows with “luminous regret.” Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (touch dominates: ash, coin, crucible) then calms (warmth, fogged breath). Every detail filters through alchemist POV—rust as weeping, vials as fallen stars—never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.4)
    Echo Gorge functions as active micro-setting: its leaning cliffs, damp stone, and warped acoustics pressure Liora’s choices and charge the closure. The crocodile’s tooth—a recurring object—constrains tactics (used as talisman, memory anchor) and reweights meaning at the end, glinting with sun as laughter heals stone. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wet earth, spectral whispers, aching notes), never decorative. The gorge evolves causally—from conspiratorial enclosure to healed openness—mirroring thematic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.4)
    Paper-Lantern Cove functions as both setting and crucible—the docks, tides, and ruins directly shape the alchemist’s actions and the bottle’s power. Sensory details (burnt sugar, phosphorescent tide, cinnamon) evolve from elegiac to vibrant, mirroring the thematic shift without overt symbolism. The amber bottle—a micro-setting—constrains choice (he must hold the vision) and charges the final image (rolling into the tide, now unnecessary). Every atmospheric cue serves pressure, memory, or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.6)
    The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and charge. Pear trees “grafted from saplings smuggled centuries ago” supply the burial site; their fruit carries “unspoken vows”; the wind blends subway hum with blossoms, embodying liminality. This micro-setting directly enables the ritual (rainwater basin beneath trees) and charges the ending: “bury it beneath the oldest tree, where the roots could decide.” Every sensory detail (salt-thick air, crushed orchid petals, glass-and-steel abyss) filters through Elias’s oath-scribe priorities, never tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound atrium functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: frost receives the seed, glass reflects breath-fractals, iron ribs groan under weight, and starlight bends around the planted seed. Sensory detail (ozone, old growth, rusted hinge sounds) is filtered through Liora’s urgency and ancestral knowledge. The environment evolves causally—ice shatters, melts, drips—and directly shapes the climax: roots crack the floor *because* the seed is pressed into permafrost. Final image (leaves unfolding) charges the entire atmosphere with earned renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    The windblown sanctuary isn’t backdrop but active constraint: altitude enables early storm detection yet isolates Elias; stone stairs worn smooth by predecessors embed history into present action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt lagoon isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: the feather is found only at the water’s edge, ink bleeds because the page is damp, the fisherman’s boat drifts past as moral counterpoint. Sensory detail is selective (wet salt, crushed reeds, violet bruise-light) and filtered through the poet’s bias toward liminal states. The setting evolves causally: rain lifts → air thickens → shallows deepen → sun spills gold. Final image charges closure: water “shivers” with recognition, yet remains unrecorded—environment directly shapes thematic refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    The temple orchard functions as micro-setting: stone pillars “breathe” via root pressure, directly enabling Elira’s copper-wrapping method. Specificity is purposeful—oxidized copper feeding trees, hollow chambers for fungi—not decorative. The western quadrant’s “ribcage” curvature constrains Elira’s choice to save the sapling, and the final image (leaves brushing stone “like a pulse”) charges closure with tactile proof of symbiosis. Spatial choreography remains coherent: kneeling, crouching, and leaning against pillars track cleanly across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
