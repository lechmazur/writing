  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail (fogged spectacles, moth-eaten fern, snapped bamboo stake, silt-clogged drains) filtered through Elara's scientific vocabulary. Spatial choreography is clean, and the chrysalis lodged in the drainage pipe constrains her monitoring routine. The final symposium setting is generic—no environmental feature shapes the talk or the botanist's approach—keeping Q3 from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon setting is vivid and specific—"bowl of indigo," "moss-slick rocks," frost as prisms—and the frost patterns directly enable the retracing action, constraining Lirael's method. The crevice and chamber provide spatial progression that shapes the discovery sequence. The glass shard as micro-setting object charges the final revelation, and the canyon's "quiet intervals" echo thematically at closure, though the ending shifts to an imagined studio rather than deepening the present canyon pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and specific: ice-thick panes, breath visible in cold air, plants with leaves "curled like musical notes." The tuning fork case functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged in the final image as "captured starlight." The conservatory's acoustic properties (vibrations traveling through glass, setting leaves into motion) constrain and enable the climactic breakthrough. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout; the conservatory setting directly participates in closure by transmitting the silent music.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater library is specific and charged: kelp forests, silt-buried dome, floating books with bioluminescent ink. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and interior moves, and the lens housing at the dome's apex anchors the climax. The library supplies both resource (salvaged parts) and pressure (fading magic sustains Marisol), elevating it beyond postcard. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"air tasted of brine and old paper"—and the final image of two figures with lantern and quill recharges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor is vividly anchored early ("red tiles glowing like embers," dust on the bell, tiles scraping), and its transformation from gathering place to hub again charges the closure. Sensory selection is purposeful: wet clay, amplified quiet, carved initials, and the polished bell all evolve with the community's shift. The arbor's physical presence constrains the final choice—Mira hangs the bell from a beam with a replaced clapper, a micro-setting detail that charges the ending image. Orientation is immediate and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The viaduct's moss-slick path and glowing flowers establish atmosphere early. The clearing, tree, and pool function as setting stations for revelation rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the walk and kneeling. The "foggy lucidity" tone is maintained but the woods and clearing do not pressure Lira's decisions—she follows embers without friction from terrain or environment.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: vines that pulse, ivy that hums, paths with hyperbolic geometry, and the scent of ozone and old paper during the climax. The garden's geometry changes under Elara's will (paths stretching, bridge arching), which supports her experiment, but these transformations don't constrain a tactical choice—they illustrate her success without friction. The fragment and photographs function more as thematic objects than spatial constraints that alter her moves. Strong atmospheric control and selective detail, but the environment doesn't pressure a decision at the closure beat, keeping this in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    The carnival setting supplies vivid anchors (dust, cotton candy smell, rusted iron, piano bench) and the arrow's fletching provides tactile recurring detail. The vault's "door forged from iron and ivy" and the seeds in glass vials offer specificity. However, spatial choreography weakens: the bench is "upstairs" from chains on the floor, but Lirael's movement between levels and the scavengers' simultaneous approach create unclear geometry. The final outdoor transformation (dry soil trembling) lands as a charged image that shifts scale.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, aurora glow, and ashen forge are vivid and purposefully recurse across beats. The forge anchors two distinct actions (feeling residual warmth, then mixing absences in the crucible), and the dead peach tree root serves as a plot-critical ingredient. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting constraints do not visibly narrow a choice at closure—Lira moves freely among all needed resources without tradeoff—which keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    The emerald station is vivid in its opening image (arched windows, amber streaks, velvet curtain), and the lily + starlight interaction constrains the grate-opening tactic. The ending image (photograph as beacon) charges the station's space with new meaning. However, much description is painterly without pressing choice; the guard's presence is convenience rather than obstacle. The micro-setting (jar, lily) does constrain one beat and return at closure, lifting the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned control room supplies vivid sensory anchors (dripping ice, frost-caked panels, shattered windows) and the thaw provides a temporal frame. The bookmark and schematics are handled on the page, and the puddles of melting ice reflect the thaw motif. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics; Kael's actions (prying a bolt, discovering the compartment) could occur in any decayed structure. The setting serves atmosphere more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rusted library and child's cast provide concrete anchors, and the aisles labeled *ACTION*, *ROMANCE*, *TRAGEDY* offer a purposeful frame. However, spatial choreography during the confrontation is vague—where Lila stands, how close the enforcer is, and how she exits remain unclear. The café setting in the final scene does no work; it's interchangeable postcard space.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort anchors vividly ("stone teeth gnawing at the wind"), and micro-setting details—crumbling archway, pebbles skittering—are woven through action. The gold-flake booklet functions as a tactile object that Mara handles across beats, and its shedding flakes visually mark progression. The setting does not constrain a choice at closure (she completes the task unimpeded), capping the score below 9-band eligibility despite strong atmospheric specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.7)
    The frozen courtyard is established with vivid particulars (fountains frozen mid-splash, benches coated in rime) and the twilight setting anchors mood. The ice-crystal violin functions as both artifact and spatial anchor. However, the courtyard does not constrain Unit-17's choices—it provides a stage rather than pressure. The holographic projections (diplomat's speech, snowball fight, lover's quarrel) are atmospheric catalog rather than obstacles that shape tactics or alter the robot's path to understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    The forecourt setting is vivid (slick stones, crystals that hum post-rain, archway shadows) and the projector lens functions as a recurring object that enables discovery. The crystals' vibration subtly guides the midnight encounter and charges the final dawn image. However, the environment does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elias could decode tickets anywhere—so the setting enriches atmosphere without forcing tactical trade-offs that alter the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The maze functions well as both setting and constraint: its algorithm-driven shifts force Elara's vine-blocking tactic, and the vine/sensor interaction demonstrates how environment shapes choices. The marbles' physical properties (cracks, polish) recur with specificity. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's pragmatic lens. However, the maze's "whispers" and "rhythms" remain abstract; what precisely does she hear or feel that others miss?

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    The xenobiology station is anchored early with selective sensory detail (ammonia clouds, lavender glow, grated floor, hum of machinery). The magnetic nexus and its holographic display are described vividly and constrain Veyra's physical actions during the recalibration crisis. However, the environment does not charge the final image—Veyra's second reach for the lever occurs in the same setting without spatial evolution. The "icy warmth" motif recurs but remains metaphorical rather than a lived constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house supplies vivid, integrated detail: water ankle-deep, instruments half-submerged, floating sheet music, and swaying lanterns create a tactile environment. Spatial choreography is clear (pit as sunken island, broken pipe overhead, timpani behind her) and the setting pressures Clara's movements (water tugs the cello bow away, she wades through sloshing boots). The setting contributes to the closure image (timpani thrumming in approval, program floating beside her) and the water itself becomes the mechanism for revealing the code. The environment constrains choice and charges the final moment, meeting the 9+ gate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain station is concrete (rattling windows, narrow halls, observation deck with aurora above) and the botanical illustration—handled, smudged, rolled—functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat when the herbalist names where it grows. Sensory detail (metallic tang, damp earth and pine, frost mustache) is selective and POV-filtered. The setting pressure is moderate: the station's literal instability (seismic data, structural fatigue) parallels Lirael's internal fracture, but the mountain itself does not directly constrain a mid-story choice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tunnel's slick walls, crumbling concrete cap, and descending shaft guide spatial choreography cleanly. The valve wheel—beaded, rusted, icy—becomes a micro-setting element that constrains Elias's choices across beats (turn it to open the intake, fit it to the control panel). However, the underground chamber's "colossal machinery" and "blue light" remain generic; the 1920s mill-worker hologram supplies exposition rather than emerging from embodied environmental cues. The valve charges the final image by becoming a "silent sentinel," meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the library's "moss-choked stone," bioluminescent fungi, and black water pool all constrain and guide the keeper's descent. The obsidian refuge functions as both destination and metaphor, charged at closure when it vanishes and the keeper recognizes the transformation. Spatial choreography is clean through the tunnel, fissure, staircase, and cavern. The environment actively shapes choices (following the swan's folds) and the final image (the wall of stone replacing the river's edge).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with sensory specifics (moss-cloaked boulders, gnarled oak roots, dry leaves), and the eclipse provides a time constraint that modulates light and tone. The cello leans against the tree and is played, integrating setting with character action. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—the curl's glow and Mara's acceptance would proceed identically in any twilight setting. The ridge functions as atmosphere rather than a pressure tool that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The silo's steel ribs, fireplace debris, and tapestry create a vivid, selective sensory anchor. The setting constrains Elias's investigation spatially (fireplace, worktable, walls) and the tapestry's embroidered symbols charge the final image when the dragons "unfurl." Micro-setting (tapestry, brass poker, railroad spikes) functions well. The bronze quiet modulates subtly but does not sharply alter under peak pressure, keeping this shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse tower, storm, tunnel, and safehouse are rendered with concrete detail and constrain Elara's movements. The microdot specs and typewriter anchor the father's legacy. The storm provides atmosphere and the rocky island isolation supports her clandestine work. The safehouse entrance behind a loose brick and the chamber with filing cabinets feel specific and purposeful. The final flare she hurls into the night charges the closure image, making the setting essential rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    Velvet walls, labyrinthine floors, and the loop pedal harness offer vivid sensory detail filtered through the priest's focus. The indigo paint "reveals constellations of hidden circuits" and charges the console twice, participating in escalation and closure. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, "dimensional anchor" and "void" stay generic; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows the priest's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, floating obsidian desk, and nautilus segment are vividly rendered and anchor the setting early. However, the environment remains static postcard: no spatial constraint shapes a choice, no tool unavailability forces a tradeoff. The nautilus glows and hums in response to mood but does not alter her tactics or the final beat's outcome, missing the constraint-or-charge gate for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glowing viaduct is vivid and purposeful, framing the journey and charging the opening and closing images. Rain-slicked stones and spectral archways anchor the initial scene, and the viaduct's dimming glow mirrors the resolution. However, during the timeline montage—childhood alley, various alternate lives—spatial choreography dissolves into abstraction; we lose concrete setting anchors for the middle third. The body and the tablet (as micro-setting object) do minimal work constraining choices; Mara floats through scenes rather than navigating spatial obstacles that force tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drum maker's cavern is rendered with strong sensory anchoring: hides stretched taut, hollowed logs, frost at the entrance. Spatial choreography remains clear across visits, and the setting pressures Lila's choices by providing both the tools (copper wire, drums) and the mirrored hush that enables her breakthrough. The phonograph and drums constrain her method and charge the ending, satisfying the micro-setting test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard is anchored with selective detail (stone wall, ivy-choked trellis, fountain) and recurs at closure, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The storm recorder's dials and sensors are described but don't meaningfully limit Elias's choices—he climbs, descends, and walks freely. The rogue zone's "patch of darkness where streetlights flickered" is vivid but generic; the makeshift clinic interior is sketched without tactile grounding. Spatial choreography is clear, but environment doesn't pressure decisions at pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly anchored with sensory specificity ("baked by centuries of sun," "walls glowed like ancient skin"), and the rope's frayed texture recurs across beats. The grotto's transforming walls—clay peeling to reveal constellations—charge the final image by externalizing Kael's internal pattern, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate's requirement that setting constrain or charge closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse, shipwrecks, and bonfire anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. The bowl's copper surface and the violin's positioning over it create micro-setting that constrains Lira's technique and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (greenhouse interior, bonfire outside, crowd movement). The post-burn atmosphere filters through Lira's acoustic perception, shaping what she notices. The greenhouse's acoustics—glass amplification, condensation drip—directly enable the music's transformation and thus constrain her method.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber grotto is rendered with vivid sensory detail (translucent walls, suspended crystals, moss-covered floor, static electricity) and the blotter petal receives specific attention. The setting provides atmospheric texture but does not constrain Elias's choices or alter tactics—he moves through it with complete mastery and grace. The "static electricity" mechanic is described but never shown shaping a decision or complicating his work. Spatial choreography is clear, and the micro-setting (workbench, vials) is present, but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    The library's "breezy, paper-scented calm" and domed windows supply vivid sensory grounding, and the fan that delivers the envelope integrates setting into plot. The harbor and docks anchor Clara's professional world with selective maritime detail (ship manifests, cargo delays). However, the third-floor boardinghouse and pier serve as brief waypoints without constraining choices or altering tactics. The locket photo and origami boats recur but function as symbolic tokens rather than physical constraints that shape the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear across all locations.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (prismatic glass, fractured rainbows, constellations under peculiar light). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (eastern edge, clearing amphitheater). The arbor charges the final image by appearing in Veyra's mural and framing the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressuring Kael's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop canal system is vivid and specific: moss-crusted stones, the water's backward ripples, the fissure of shimmering light. The canal's "interrupted cadence" and the giant's snores create sensory hierarchy that reflects Lila's professional focus. The pendant's physical presence (cool metal, flaring hot, edges digging into palm) functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it "cooled against her skin, its work done." Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and specific: dripping stalactites feeding soil, starlight fruit, mosaic stepping stone with fractal cracks. Setting actively shapes the ritual—Elara uses the stone's fissures and the orchard's luminescent sap. The mosaic's rearrangement into constellations charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling by stone, tracing cracks, pouring sap). The micro-setting (mosaic stone, glass eyes, sap) functions as the primary constraint and closure anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.7)
    Setting details are vivid and atmospheric: stained-glass windows, dust-capped books, pipe chases slick with condensation, the sub-basement's mildew and oil. Spatial choreography is clear through Mara's crawl-space navigation. The decoder's location in the basement matters for discovery, but the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains backdrop. The "sapphire hush" tone is poetic but static, not modulating with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mossy trellis and rain-soaked nursery are rendered with vivid, selective detail ("damp fibers clinging to her skin like a second skin," "air thick with the scent of wet soil and chlorophyll"). The storm season frames urgency and the greenhouse environment constrains Eleanor's observation of the hellebore. The vines that appear overnight provide a concrete ending image tied to the setting. However, the trellis itself remains largely atmospheric; its physical properties don't meaningfully constrain a choice at closure, keeping this just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal island's salt-bleached cliffs, skeletal fishing village, and black rain-pooled mirror create vivid atmosphere, and the brooch's amber glow charges the discovery beat. The studio lighthouse with sea-breath and cracked stone anchors Marin's workspace and final painting act, making setting integral to her artistic process and closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the rain trail and return journey.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal cave is vivid and consistent: quartz/obsidian walls, prismatic light, chimes, underground springs. The cave constrains Elara's choice by "magnifying everyday magic" and the crystals shatter during the climax, altering the space. The pearl's warmth and symbols are specific. Setting actively shapes the final image (the cave's changed song), meeting the 9+ test's constraint requirement, but the specificity doesn't deepen further under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ivory harbor, rain-washed cobblestones, and sagging lighthouse cottage are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail (salt-sting, seagull's cry at noon, tidal pooling) is selective and filtered through the archivist's observational lens. The valve constrains her method—she must place it, wait, return—so the object functions as a micro-setting element that shapes her approach, meeting the 9+ gate's first threshold but not charging the final image with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The starlit vault, condensation-slick walls, fractured stone mosaic, and stained-glass chamber are vivid and purpose-driven, constraining Elias's route choices (hidden wall, narrow staircase). Sensory detail (cold air fogging breath, gravel crunch, sweet mist) is filtered through his dual analytical/artistic lens. The phantom ticket punch as micro-setting object enables the wall mechanism, participating directly in the escalation and closure setup, which satisfies the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower, cliff, and sea provide consistent spatial grounding; the tile functions as a recurring object that anchors reflection and the transcription beat. Whale songs supply atmospheric pressure and rhythmically modulate across the piece. The setting constrains Clara's isolation and frames the encounter with the tile, charging the closure image when she looks out at the breaching whales. Sensory detail (breath fogging glass, boots clacking, moss, candlelight memory) is selective and filtered through Clara's focus, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with shifting hues, inverted gravity, and mirrors showing fractured lives; these details are filtered through Kael's dimensionally aware senses and constrain movement during the storm. The solar storm functions as both atmosphere and plot device, its electromagnetic pulses warping the space. The amulet fragment embedded in/floating free from the wall charges the final shattering moment. Spatial choreography occasionally blurs—"the walls bled crimson" and "the escondite's geometry inverted" read more decorative than navigable—but the micro-setting (fragment, mirrors, void) does enable the escape choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    Funeral home prep room is anchored early (lilies, mahogany casket, fluorescent lights) and the casket is used as physical cover and reveal-prop. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she could negotiate anywhere. The prep room functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bonsai labyrinth is described with vivid sensory detail (moss-cushioned bench, mineral-rich soil, shimmering leaves), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The fluorescent lamp appears in multiple beats and its hum is central, qualifying as a micro-setting object. However, the labyrinth's spatial choreography is vague—no sense of how far she moves or what adjacencies matter—and the environment never pressures a choice or alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and specific—"steel mountains," "flaking paint," diesel and decay—and the tidal rhythm provides temporal structure. The setting pressures Kael's movements during the storm, forcing him upward to discover the skeleton. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in key beats: "a narrow alley" and "nest of fishing nets" appear without prior anchoring, and the skeleton's location feels conveniently placed rather than earned by the established geography.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory is vividly sketched ("fossilized question," cracked dome, rusted telescopes) and the cliff setting provides atmosphere, but the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Lira could perform the same experiment anywhere with the cello and shell. The control panel's frozen dials and the attic discovery are mentioned but remain static props; spatial choreography is loose (she "positions" the shell, "descends the cliff") without tactile engagement. The "glowing note...scrawled in dust" at the end is a striking image but arrives as a reward rather than an environmental pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    The carnival's layered sensory detail (fried dough, diesel, striped tents, neon) grounds the opening vividly. The Alley of Whispers and the drowning-clown mural provide purposeful micro-setting that Lira touches and decodes, shaping her plan. The stone chip—polished, mounted, handled—recurs with tactile specificity and charges the final confrontation image, qualifying as object-as-setting. Spatial choreography (raft walkways, gilded barge arrival) remains clear. However, the carnival's floating mechanics and vendor zones are told more than shown constraining choices; the setting enriches atmosphere but does not force a physical trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    The moonlit summit, crater edges, and Earth's crescent are rendered with purposeful detail, and the airless cold and dust are integrated into action (kneeling, adjusting visor, planting vial). The hourglass grain functions as micro-setting object that charges the final image, lifting the category. However, the summit itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows Lira's options or complicates her planting of the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mist-coated rail depot, anchor lift, and water basin are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (prismatic hues, condensation drip, iridescent drones). The water basin constrains Lira's diagnostic method and charges the repair sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear (workbench, doorway, skylight, tracks). The mist and depot atmosphere modulate appropriately with the story's calm tone, and the basin's light refraction becomes a micro-setting that enables the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen lake, rusted outpost, and glacial plateau are rendered with vivid, particular detail—"pitted ice as if something had clawed its way out" anchors the uncanny effectively. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the trek. The condensation patterns recur purposefully and charge the final image when Clara traces new patterns years later, creating a meaningful reprise that constrains her ongoing work and reflects her altered understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archway, cobblestones, clock tower, fountain, and bell tower are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ivy clawing stone, weeds choking the fountain, the bell's harsh tone). The tuning fork functions as micro-setting: Kael presses it to the ground, adjusts its angle, and the physical act of striking it shapes the rhythm that drives the restoration. The final image of the archway framing the living square charges the closure, and the seven-day structure provides a clear timeline that tracks change across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    The underwater temple supplies vivid, purposeful detail: algae-slick stone, bioluminescent dome, jagged fissure, shifting liquid symbols on the pedestal. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the descent and chamber entry. The vial's warmth and scent constrain Mara's tactical choice to uncork it at the pedestal, charging the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (pressure on ribs, salt-sting). The setting does meaningful work but stops short of the 7+ threshold because the final image (dawn piercing clouds) is generic and the pedestal mechanism feels convenient rather than seeded.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef, the lattice's ironwork, and the copperlight repose provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elias's perspective. The labyrinth's shifting stones and confessional lattices create a micro-setting that charges the ending image. However, spatial choreography blurs when Elias "hovers" and the walls dissolve; the reef's jagged maw is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frost on glass, crystalline fruits humming with magic, runes etched on walls) and the setting constrains the ghost's imprisonment for centuries. The "winter-cracked fields" outside and the shift to dawn at closure charge the final image with environmental transformation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the micro-setting (bead, fruit, workbench) supports the story's lone choice moment when Elara places bead against fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The red canyon walls, tide pools, and labyrinth corridors anchor setting early and vividly. The pedestal chamber and spiral/crescent/flame junction provide spatial grounding. The storybook plates constrain Lira's method (she consults one, places hers beside the twin), which lifts the score. However, the environment does not pressure her choices—she moves through corridors without spatial obstacles or resource limits altering her approach—so the setting remains largely backdrop rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered—roots coiling like ropes, sun piercing the domed ceiling—and the circular chamber's pedestal constrains Lirael's action (the sundial base fits perfectly). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. However, the orchard does not evolve causally after the glow; the villagers appear at the edge without prior spatial set-up, and the setting does not charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    The golden arcade is vividly rendered (honeyed streaks, brass rails, solar-gel fountain) and the chalk drawings provide tangible texture. The fountain's hidden compartment constrains one choice (she must kneel, analyze light frequency, dip her hand), satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography grows vague in the final sequence—vendors and customers are mentioned as the arcade "awoke," but their proximity and Lira's exact position relative to the fountain and balcony are unclear, weakening the micro-setting's pressure on her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn winds, frosted windows, and eternal candle are vivid and purpose-driven; the candle constrains Zara's demonstration and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography (sconce placement, telescope, embroidery hoop) is clear and anchored. However, the observatory's larger layout and the "council" remain abstract; we do not see how the space limits or enables evasion, access, or discovery beyond atmospheric detail. The flame and silk together function as micro-setting that charges the closure image, lifting the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (roots like "ancient fingers," peat-rich earth, moon casting "silvery sheen"). The gargoyle shard constrains the ritual beat—it must be placed, it glows, its edges smooth by dawn—charging the final image with tactile specificity. Spatial choreography (clearing, kneeling, water, leaves) remains clear. The setting pressures Lirael's choices by providing the medium (condensation on leaves) and the resource (moonlight) that enable the evocation, lifting this above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment anchor setting and micro-object throughout. The coral's grooves guide Lira's perceptual frame (mirroring cast scribbles), and the atrium's twilight and moss-stained bench provide spatial coherence. The coral reappears at closure, placed on the negotiating table to constrain rhetoric ("This grew from ruin. So can we."), satisfying the 9+ quick test for object-as-setting constraining choice. However, the broader atrium space remains largely atmospheric postcard (mist curling, twilight) without altering tactics beyond mood, and the child's cast—though thematically charged—floats as decor ("hung in the atrium's rafters") rather than a spatial pressure point in the final beat.

    The ruined orchard district with its "moss-choked paths," "skeletal peach grove," and pervasive fog creates atmospheric pressure that Lira's light-paintings actively combat. The crumbling greenhouse studio and hollow-tree message drops provide specific, functional detail. Sensory work is strong ("peaches tasted like sunshine," fog as "second skin") and filtered through Lira's artist perspective. The fog thinning at the climax effectively mirrors the thematic shift. Spatial choreography across the evening's gathering remains clear, though some descriptions ("fold of a daydream") tilt abstract without grounding the metaphor in physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vivid and specific: fractal wind chimes, concave dish, nodes that make petals tremble. The nickel's rough surface bending sound into harmonics is purposeful detail. The garden constrains Marisol's approach (positioning the dish, aligning frequencies) and charges the final image of her walking away with the hum "lingering in her bones." Minor: the mural's spatial relation to the lab and Dr. Lysander's sudden appearance lack clear choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse is vividly textured (humid air, venus flytraps, moths, Mabel the tarantula) and the orchid section provides a spatial goal for the pheromone test. However, the environment remains largely backdrop—insects swarm on cue but don't constrain tactics or impose resource limits. The final garden plot is described rather than experienced, and spatial choreography in the hidden circular room is generic. The setting decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gargantuan shell, bioluminescent tides, moss-lined cavern, and indigo sea establish a vivid, coherent setting early. The shell's migration functions as backdrop pressure rather than constraint on choice. The tree's physical presence charges the final image (leaves singing in wind), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object constrains choice or charges closure. Sensory detail is filtered through POV (reef-shadow joy, off-key wind) without catalog tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The opal library, glass-orchids, and bamboo chime are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Lirael's caretaker lens (humidity, frequencies, runes). The cracked tube constrains her repair attempt and charges the closure when its fissure becomes "a conduit for a sound no one had heard in centuries." Sensory detail is selective and serves atmosphere without slowing momentum. Micro-setting qualifies: the tube itself functions as a constrained object-as-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; the library's verticality and cloud-edge location ground the action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is vivid and specific: mothball scent, sagging shelves, brittle parchment, the glass ink well with runes. The setting supplies resources (the restricted manuscript, hydronyms, tax records) that enable Elara's research path. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the archive does not constrain a choice or complicate tactics; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The glass ink well recurs but operates as symbolic marker rather than a tool that alters options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amphitheater's breathing and volcanic setting are vividly rendered and return at closure ("breath a steady rhythm beneath her feet"), charging the final image. Micro-setting (the adhesive, the chain's weight) appears in multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Lira's decryption proceeds smoothly without spatial or material friction. The surveyor's chain is handled across beats but does not alter tactics or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The attic is vivid and functional: leather harness, skylight, dust motes, shelves of maps and ledgers. The skylight constrains Elias's method (mapping dust patterns) and charges multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wood polish, sunflower seed reward, cassette hum). The setting enables the decoding work and shapes the final departure, meeting the 9+ test of constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drifting prism terrace and cornfield maze are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (kaleidoscopic shadows, groaning wood, hum through floorboards). The prisms shift to reveal a path, directly enabling Lira's descent—setting constrains and guides choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from terrace to spiral staircase to clearing. Grain analysis and the logbook anchor micro-setting, charging the final image when she writes her own codes at the field's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater dome, bioluminescent flora, and pressure of the sea create vivid spatial grounding. The burnt feather returns as a tactile anchor in the climactic beat, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens (light patterns, shifting constellations). The decayed city corridors provide atmospheric context but don't constrain Mara's choices in this single-dome scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    The iridescent geode is vividly rendered with bioluminescent glow, moss-carpeted alcove, and liquid-light pool; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The crater glass and seeds function as recurring objects that guide Lira's investigation. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Lira moves freely without spatial friction. The final pool provides spectacle but does not charge the closure with physical or spatial consequence, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tidal arcade setting is vivid and specific: neon signs, salt through cobblestones, fountain lights, mechanized clown. Sensory detail is well-distributed and filtered through Lira's analytical gaze. The fountain functions as a spatial anchor and the target of her musical guidance, contributing to the closure image when the crowd drifts toward it. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—it serves as backdrop rather than pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The twilight garden is vividly rendered with luminescent mist, pulsing moss, and star-spangled canopy. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though it remains largely decorative. The moss and stylus constrain one action each (kneeling, writing), but the environment does not materially shape tactics or force a choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"horizon bled gold and violet," "cold biting her ankles," "mist thinned"—and filtered through Elara's craft-trained attention. The prism, water, and mist constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography (edge of bay → shallow water → pond center) remains clear. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop for reflection rather than as a force that alters tactics or forecloses options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit ridge path, frost-laced gravel, and forest backdrop are anchored early and remain consistent. The porcelain box and hourglass constrain the sequence (he carries them up, opens them at the summit, closes them before descending) and the moonlight "catches the grains, turning them to liquid silver," charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional lens (reading "the land's breath"). The ridge functions as threshold and the hourglass as micro-setting object that shapes the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto is vividly anchored with concrete sensory detail (bioluminescent algae, moss-covered ledge, tide-polished walls) and the setting's "serene upheaval" atmosphere is maintained throughout. The gauge and threads are handled on the page, and the algae's brightening responds to Elara's pattern work, creating a sense of environmental pressure. The grotto's physics are described as "malleable" and the walls briefly vanish to show parallel skies, which charges the final image. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded, and the environment's resistance is told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet earth, iron, moss, soot-stained glass) and the setting constrains choice: the fireplace holds the diaries, the ivy parts to reveal the alcove. The passage's physical state—walls humming, stones grinding—applies pressure and the micro-setting (fireplace, locket, film negative) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the climate-shifted world is anchored early without excess exposition. The body and recurring objects (locket, negative) function as micro-setting that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism parapet and terrace anchors are vivid and consistent (wet stone, jasmine, condensation, wrought-iron stand). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lirael's focus: the locket's chain "coiled like a question," bioluminescent forest in the cracked mirror. The mirrors themselves function as micro-setting, constraining her persuasion method and supplying the final "unchanged" state that ironically underscores her belief. The parapet's color refraction appears twice, framing and charging the sequence, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient terrace is vividly established with volcanic stone, weathered statues, and celestial tracking. The setting constrains the negotiation spatially (delegates retreat to "shaded corners") and the statues' "silent vigil" charges the final image as Elara descends. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the terrace functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on her tactical choices during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The salt flat constrains and charges action throughout: salt crunches under knees, grains scatter like confetti, the depression holds the egg, and the storm's rain dissolves or buries it by dawn. The map drawn by cracks functions as both artifact and spatial guide, its shifting fissures mirroring the sky. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the philanthropist's priorities (iridescent shell, "ghostly blue," salt's texture). The recurring storm pressure modulates from distant rumble to midnight hammer, shaping the ritual's urgency and the egg's fate. Micro-setting (the body kneeling, the vial, the egg rolling) charges the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (frost-kissed glass, prismatic shadows, snow crunching). The setting charges the atmosphere and the prism walls refract her movements, adding visual texture. However, the environment does not constrain Lirael's choices or impose a cost; she encounters no physical resistance, no locked mechanism requiring adaptation, no environmental hazard. The sanctuary functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radar dome's "skeletal ribs piercing the dusk" and "curved floor" are vivid and specific. The dome's isolation and fractured light actively support Elias's thesis: "Because here, in the hush after an argument, people are raw." The story stick's glow and the projections onto the curved wall integrate setting into action. Spatial choreography (cross-legged audience, Elias kneeling, stepping into light) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with moss, mist, peach-and-lavender clouds. Sensory detail (spider silk texture, moth wing shimmer) is purposeful and filtered through Lirael's focus. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—she kneels, weaves, and departs without spatial friction. The lattice dissolves off-page by morning, mentioned but not shown to pressure the ending. Strong descriptive specificity, but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and glacial stone are vividly anchored early and create coherent atmosphere. The ceremonial rope and punched card function as micro-setting elements that constrain Kael's task (braid alignment, precision weaving). Sensory detail—snowmelt, iron, fogged breath—is selective and purposeful. The mosaic of names etched in stone charges the final image by tying the rope's light to forgotten voices, lifting the setting beyond backdrop into thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vine-draped bunker is vividly rendered (vines clawing through concrete, emerald glow in candlelight) and returns in the final image as ruins overgrown. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The wafer seal is handled twice (heating, pocketing) but does not restrict options. Micro-setting and recurring object signal is present but neither charges the closure beat with unavoidable pressure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but spatial choreography inside the bunker is underdeveloped (table, candle, no movement blocking).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace supplies vivid sensory anchors: "dust-caked stone," "sandstone arches," "bioluminescent light," "desert wind carried jasmine." Spatial choreography tracks clearly across corridor → panel → chamber → pedestal. The tile functions as micro-setting object and constrains one choice (placement in the groove opens the wall), meeting the 9+ gate marginally. Scope and economy are sound; no occupational over-detail.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sanctuary is vividly established ("walls lined with velvet," "echoes drowned in silence"), and the broken pin is handled across multiple beats, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains stable, and the pedestal anchors the ritual. However, the sanctuary's constraint—its silence—does not meaningfully pressure a choice or tactic; it functions as atmosphere rather than a material limit. The vial of cellular memory extract and the pin's transformation provide micro-setting specificity that elevates the score into the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ruined orchard district, frost-shimmer, and glass mountains supply vivid, purpose-driven atmosphere. The mirrors constrain Elias's craft choices and the fog thickens to mark escalation. The glass-mountain path charges the stranger's departure and recurs in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (cold air, sharp breath), and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid and signals early, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraining Lira's choices. The quartz eye, copper wire, and liquid starlight are handled concretely in the repair beat, which charges the moment. However, the spatial choreography of the climb and the cathedral's dimensions remain vague, and the orchard's transformation at the end does not alter her tactics or impose a fresh obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The astral orchard is vivid and purposeful: trees with starlight fruit, blue-glowing soil, liquid-light waterfall. The grotto functions as micro-setting, dissolving into the infinite library during the vision, then anchoring her return with the reweighted cameo map. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The pistachio tree with carved names supplies the closure focal point, and the orchard's "exhale" charges the final image. Sensory variety (mist, glow, hum, whisper) is selective and tied to POV urgency. The environment constrains choice by offering the map and the tree as necessary waypoints.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered (sentient shelves, spiders in hollow spines, velvet-bound books), and sensory details filter through Elara's arcane expertise (Old Thalassic counter-charm, grooves forming patterns). The blue orchid and diary function as micro-setting anchors that charge two beats. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the "cavernous chamber" finale, and the mountain's interior lacks the persistent physical constraint that would push this into the 7+ band. Time folding is mentioned but never exploits tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned carnival ship, fog, and garden room are vividly rendered with selective detail (rusted Ferris wheel, salt-caked calliope, name-flowers). The emerald card returns with tactile presence (teeth marks, glowing), and the twins' hybrid bodies are concretely imagined. However, the garden itself—the climactic setting—emerges through summary ("vines wove into a canopy") rather than lived navigation, and spatial choreography in the circular room is generic. The meadow at closure is asserted ("stretched endlessly") without a detail that constrains the final choice or charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly anchored with gears, pendulums, brass-bound door, and etched symbols. The corridor of torches and the circular chamber with scrolls extend the setting coherently. However, the environment remains largely descriptive; while gears "slow" and "jam," these details color the scene without constraining Elara's choices or altering her tactics. The ceremonial rope and wax seal are tools she uses, but spatial features don't pressure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The harmonic caves constrain the mapkeeper's search and the ice spiral enables the conjuration, shaping the key turn. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "voices shattering the caves' ancient hymns," "crack patterns...spiderwebbed like frozen lightning." The echo chamber stone as micro-setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass pavilion is vividly anchored—shattered panes as "skeletal wind chimes," the mosaic floor, the humming walls—and the prism shard constrains Elara's choices across multiple beats (handling jagged edges, aligning angles). The storm's wind and moonlight enable the climactic refraction, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear, though the pavilion's interior scale and the mechanics of "a hollow in the mosaic" could be more precise at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory and forecourt are vividly anchored (frosted glass, gelatinous sheen, marble worn smooth, crystal vibrations), and sensory detail is filtered through Lirael's archivist lens. The crystal's hum constrains her pause and shapes the participatory turn; the evaporating puddles charge the closure image with temporal pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (staircase descent, kneeling at monuments, edge pause), and the stormlit setting above clouds supplies both access and atmosphere that guide choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fortress courtyard (archways, fountains of liquid light, fire-lilies) is vivid and purposeful. The kerosene knot's warmth and the mosaic's spiral guide Lira's movement, and the domed chamber's closed petals create spatial pressure. The starless sky returns charged at the end. Micro-setting (the knot in her hand, the cool stone beneath her knees) constrains her kneeling choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and elevating the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moonlight fracturing on water, salt and moss scent, algae's slow dance) and the jade cicada on the rock serves as a micro-setting anchor that Elara manipulates. The tidal pool constrains her method (tangential observation) and the cicada's repositioning becomes a choice-vehicle. The stars and tide modulate with emotional beats, and spatial choreography (across the pool, walking back) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bunker's metallic silence versus the trellis's "gilded hush" provides sensory contrast that reflects Lila's internal state. The xenial trellis functions as setting-as-constraint: its hour-long accessibility under inverted gravity shapes her tactical window and the doll's loss. Spatial choreography remains clear (bunker floor → hatch → trellis vines → fall back). The sprout pushing through the bunker floor crack charges the final image by importing the trellis logic into the sealed space, making the micro-setting (crack, shoot) essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and layered (onyx gondola, glass-still canal, kaleidoscopic spires refracting moonlight into fractals). The storm glass vial functions as a micro-setting object that shapes Elara's observation method and charges the final image when its liquid stills. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The prism terrace's drifting districts and canal network anchor the world convincingly, though occupational detail (gondola operation mechanics) remains light and the terrace's "perpetual motion" constraint doesn't visibly narrow a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard's bioluminescent trees and kaleidoscopic waterfall establish vivid texture early, and the hollow tree convergence constrains Lira's path. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop after the initial anchor; no environmental detail constrains the guardian confrontation or charges the final throne image, capping the score below 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ashen sanctuary, starlight, doorknocker embedded in the wall, and threshold hum are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail—burnt wood scent, cold iron, thickening air—modulates with the knock and Kael's crossing. The setting constrains the initial separation and enables the ritual; the threshold's "shudder" when Kael steps through charges the reunion moment, meeting the 9+ quick test's requirement that environment constrain or charge a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bioluminescent dome, glowing mycelium, and crystalline spores create vivid sensory specificity. The porthole bolt is handled twice (touch, turn) and its vibration charges the final act. Spatial choreography remains clear across the chamber transition. However, occupational detail—what "conceptual pressure" monitoring entails, how mushrooms "absorb" concepts—stays abstract and never constrains a tactical choice, limiting the setting's mechanical grip on stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("dust-mottled shelves," "golden shadows"). The gramophone and desk's false compartment constrain Lirael's search and enable the discovery beat. Spatial choreography (corner ghost, desk groove, horn emission) tracks clearly. The recurring golden-shadow motif charges the final image when the room shifts from "tomb" to "cradle," meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered (moon-petals, arcane machinery, luminescent vines) and the orbs chamber supplies a concrete discovery. The program and marionette constrain Cedric's moves at the stage. However, spatial choreography weakens after the staircase descent—the chamber, field, and ruins sequence compresses geography without clear transitions, and the final wheat field's relationship to the greenhouse is unclear. The rusted bench, stage, and strings anchor key beats, meeting the micro-setting test for the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The file room is vividly anchored (mildew, bowing shelves, creaking wood) and filtered through Elias's archivist expertise. Dust patterns function as micro-setting: the disturbed circle constrains his inference and charges his imaginative reconstruction. The button's brass surface and regimental crest supply tactile, visual specificity. Sensory selection reflects his professional lens (ink bleed, corner curl, dust settlement). The environment enables his detective work and the final image of opening a fresh folder uses the room's materials, meeting the Q3 9+ gate's constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    The auric lagoon's "molten gold" and bioluminescent tunnel algae provide vivid sensory anchors, and the mangrove root and submerged tunnel constrain Mara's approach. Spatial choreography (wading, diving, surfacing inside the station) remains clear. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the lagoon's gold doesn't pressure a key choice or charge the final image beyond atmosphere. The phone booth key's hidden slot and the terminal feel generic spy-thriller furniture rather than world-specific detail. Micro-setting potential (the mud, the humid air) is mentioned but not leveraged to narrow options or deepen the character's tactical bind.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.7)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, and moss-carpeted floor are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frost-etched glass, rhythmic dripping, dewdrops like tiny mirrors). The setting is filtered through Elias's professional attention (natural metronome, negative space as conduit) and charges the final image when "the prism atrium's faded glow" and "dewdrops like scattered diamonds" bracket the narrative. The mist and atrium constrain Elias's encounter with the figure, grounding the supernatural confrontation in concrete space. Minor slip: "quietly vivid glow" and "eerie nostalgia" veer toward decorative phrasing, but the environment actively participates in the climax and closure, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and specific—branches through clouds, mossy floor, light filtered to green haze—and the edge where "branches thinned into mist" provides spatial constraint for the monument-building beat. The worktable and seed sacks anchor early moves, and the arbor "trembles" in response to Elinor's action, charging the atmosphere. The micro-setting (moonstone speck on bark, twig for building) shapes one key turn, meeting the band requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subterranean waterfall, greenhouse debris, and moss-slick cave supply vivid sensory grounding. The compass's barnacled edges and the oak's uprooted hatch anchor discovery beats with tactile detail. The workshop return and clockwork-flower plan feel less spatially embodied; the final image of winding a cuckoo clock doesn't leverage the environment to constrain or charge the choice as strongly as the waterfall plunge did earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The foundry is vividly anchored—corrugated roof, molten-metal pit, iron and wet earth—and the coin's heat and glow constrain Kael's final choice to drop it, directly charging the vortex and closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (edge of pit, approaching, dropping). Sensory selection reflects urgency (rain pauses "as if the world itself were listening"). The recurring object (coin) and micro-setting (pit) both shape the climactic act, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/tool constrain choice and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with "stone ribs," humming pebbles, and pooled shadows. The crocodile's tooth is clutched and later pulses, but the environment itself does not constrain Lira's choices—she moves through the gorge without physical or social friction. The harp and mist are atmospheric but ornamental; removing the gorge's specific details would not alter the encounter's structure or Lira's final state.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    The UV forest is vividly rendered with bioluminescent veins, spores, and hum; sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The pewter strap is handled across multiple beats, its edges biting and its engraving traced, and it anchors the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, pressing forehead to tree, spinning to face the woman) is clear. The forest's light constrains perception and triggers memory, meeting the 9+ gate criteria, but the woman's shadow and static-voice lack concrete anchoring, slightly lowering specificity at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The market's silk stalls, iron lattices, and floating lanterns create vivid atmospheric texture. Sensory detail is plentiful but leans heavily visual; the mural's shifting crack offers one moment where setting constrains action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and descent. The recurring lighthouse motif charges the final paragraph, though it does not alter a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    The abandoned circus ticket office supplies vivid, purposeful detail (cracked plaster, peeling laminate, yellowed papers) and the hidden compartment constrains Elias's route of discovery. Dust accumulation patterns and cracks guide tactile investigation, and the mainspring barrel is placed on surfaces to measure vibrations. Spatial choreography (kneeling, climbing counter, reaching ceiling) remains clear. The setting directly enables the middle beat and shapes the final image, meeting the micro-setting allowance and crossing into the 6+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass orchard library, suspended shelves, swirling clouds, and morning frost are vividly rendered and purposeful: the frost's spiral becomes a rupture point that Elara reads and replicates. The press and bottled whisper function as micro-setting tools that constrain her method. Sensory detail (ink, ozone, fractured rainbows) is selective and filtered through Elara's priorities. The environment charges the final image—glass shuddering, light pouring through cracks—though the orchard itself does not alter a pivotal choice, only supplies the trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.8)
    The baroque asteroid, cobalt haze, obsidian atrium, and bioluminescent fungi supply vivid texture, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague (Kael kneels, then somehow drapes an entire atrium, then huddles in a corner). The fungi's growth in the atrium soil is a late convenience that does not constrain earlier choices. The micro-setting (the shard in his hand) recurs but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered (copper walls, pulsed runes, syrup of sound) and constrains the repair: Elias uses its amplifying properties to guide his work. The chamber's hum modulates with action, supporting pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (box on dais, widow at glass wall). The toolkit's exotic contents (obsidian needles, spun starlight, liquid silence) charge the tinkersong atmosphere and the starlight thread becomes a tactile agent in the climax, weaving through cracks to restore the box.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered—"black and still, reflecting the jagged ceiling like a mirror," "soft silt"—and the setting constrains movement (narrow fissure, sloping tunnel). The compass's pull provides spatial choreography. The lagoon's untouched petrichor directly charges the closure by offering "something ancient, almost sentient" that Lira collects and labels, making environment integral to the final image. Minor: the workshop at the end is efficient but receives less sensory grounding than the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The storm-tossed archway anchors location and provides atmospheric pressure throughout. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("damp moss," "turbine-hum reverie"), and the archway's transformation into portal charges the middle. However, the coral-and-timber village on the other side remains generic postcard description without spatial choreography or choice-constraining detail. The archway returns at closure but does not materially constrain Lira's final understanding; she's back under it, unchanged by the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral window, and autumn leaves are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the window's etchings don't constrain Mara's choices in any beat—she traces them freely without resistance or spatial consequence. The "violet glow" appears late and resolves conveniently without prior setup that it would matter.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are vividly described, but setting operates as backdrop rather than constraint. The tunnels, fungi-lit chamber, and trapdoor appear only when plot requires them, with no prior spatial grounding or tool/environment interaction that narrows Mara's choices. The final beat—emerging at dawn, lagoon calm—resets atmosphere without spatial consequence, missing the opportunity to charge the closure image through changed or constrained space.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is vividly rendered with selective detail (salt-laden air, crumbling piers, phosphorus-rich ore backstory). The amber bottle recurs and charges the final image as a "lens" for collective memory. However, the environment does not constrain Elias's choices in a high-pressure moment—he scavenges freely without spatial obstacles or resource limits that alter his tactics. The setting provides atmosphere but does not function as a crucible that forces a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop orchard is vividly anchored (roses blooming in human breath, gnarled apple tree, sap-sticky children) and the garden's breathing pulse charges the atmosphere. The wax shaving's grooves are handled twice (tracing, then placing in the cradle), providing tactile specificity that shapes Voss's investigative action. The foghorn's absence and the city's flickering lights supply a coherent spatial frame. The garden does not constrain a pivotal choice, preventing entry to the 9-band, but the setting is purposefully detailed and integral to tone.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound atrium, starlight dome, and ice are vividly rendered and the acorn cap's spirals return with charged meaning at the climax. Spatial choreography (egg at center, seeds scattered, creature rearing) remains coherent. The setting does not constrain a choice—Lirael's actions proceed unimpeded by environment—but the melting ice and diamond dust charge the final image. Sensory detail (frost, breath fog, glaciers grinding) is selective and POV-filtered, supporting tone without catalog padding.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary's vertical position and microclimate dynamics are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective ("bronze clapper," "slick with years of neglect," clouds "churned in fractal patterns") and filtered through Lira's professional attention. The bell mechanism and rope textures constrain her choices materially—switching from primary to secondary rope alters resonance and tactics. The final image of leaning against the rope anchors closure physically, charging the object with earned familiarity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shooting star station, plateau, and yellow lantern glass are vivid and consistently rendered across the piece. The lantern appears in three beats (control room, walk, crater) and its glow mingles with the star's radiance at the pivotal moment, lending some constraint to the scene's spatial logic. However, the environment does not force a choice or alter tactics—Zara's path is unobstructed, and the setting functions more as backdrop than crucible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist catalogs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    The scorched wasteland and beekeeping oasis are vividly anchored with strong sensory detail ("dried to brittle yellow," "wind carried the shards"). The stained glass box is described across multiple beats and its glow pressures Elias's final choice. However, the setting never constrains a tactic—Elias sits, gazes, and speaks without the environment limiting or complicating his path, preventing 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald silo is vividly rendered with moss, rust, metallic tang, and cobwebs, anchoring the reader early. The hatch, copper coil, and mercury vial provide tactile micro-setting that constrains Elias's investigation. The urn fragment's proximity to the coil triggers the mercury's response, demonstrating environment-as-agent. The silo's "shadows shifted" and "air grew cooler" charge the final beats, and the recurring "emerald silo" in the closing line reinforces spatial specificity. One missed opportunity: the garage-sale method is declared but never enacted on the page, leaving occupational detail (cataloging relics) untested.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lagoon is vivid and modulates—post-rain silver veins, cobalt warming to gold-flecked, sunset amber and violet. Sensory detail (moss-stained rock, cool water, rustle of reeds) is selective and POV-filtered. The gathered storm debris (kelp, shell, reeds) serves the weaving action and charges the final image. Setting constrains choice minimally but supplies resources that shape the central activity, pushing the score into the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly anchored through sensory detail (dappled gold, warm pulsing stone, copper's reddish gleam). The oak and copper wire constrain Lira's method across multiple beats, and the pillars' rumble introduces spatial pressure. Spatial choreography is clean. The copper-oak web charges the final image when the orchard "holds" her last breath, satisfying the 9+ gate mechanically, but the metaphoric leap ("soft as copper on oak") shifts into ornament rather than tactical constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rainwashed tower, spring drizzle, sculptures, and bronze quiet establish strong atmosphere. The amber in the sculpture's hands triggers the resonance field, a micro-setting interaction that constrains the climactic beat. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the footprints vanishing into amber dust and Kael's sudden appearance lack tight positional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming jetty is vividly realized—saltwater/freshwater collision, damp sand, shell fragments, flowers in violet and gold—and the setting pressures the coachman's choice of this "narrow strip of land where life struggled to take root." Sensory details (salt and decay, gull cries, tern's wing brushing his shoulder) are filtered through his attentiveness to soil and rhythm. The final image of flowers "flickering like tiny flames" charges the closure, though the storm remains atmospheric rather than altering tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; the jetty functions as both literal ground and thematic fulcrum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scrapyard setting is vivid and specific: "rusted harvester," "corrugated iron," "dismantled piano" table. The autumn leaf in wax charges the final image and becomes a community symbol. Spatial choreography remains clear across the shack and settlement center. The cracked wasteland and resource-war backdrop constrain tactics (scavenging, preservation) and pressure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The deck's time-dilation effect is vividly rendered and constrains perception throughout (frosted glass, warping constellations, vibrating compass). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (meteorite ink, syrup-slow nebula). The compass rose functions as micro-setting, appearing in three beats and charging the final choice with its warmth. Spatial choreography is clear through the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The spire's crystalline walls, bioluminescent fungi, and obsidian chessboard create vivid anchors; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's professional lens (slick surface, ozone scent, moss carpet). The pocket sundial and chess pieces serve as micro-setting but do not constrain a single choice or tactic during the climb or swap. Spatial choreography is clear across the ledge, window, and chamber without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering gallery's acoustics amplify her steps and the domed ceiling holds secrets, establishing atmosphere early. The chessboard on its pedestal and the gallery's shifting exhibits during the interregnum provide vivid detail. However, the environment remains primarily descriptive; it does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The "cold air" and "luminous absence" serve mood more than mechanics, keeping the setting functional but not essential to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting are vivid in opening description but function as backdrop; the stone and feather are handled, yet spatial choreography in the cavern (rocks freeze midair, shatter embedding in skin) remains gestural rather than grounded. The cedar box and attic supply texture but do not constrain a middle choice. Micro-setting (body, feather) charges the climax modestly, lifting the score slightly, but the environment does not alter tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    The platinum labyrinth, time-frozen tableau, and frayed tapestry are vivid and specific. The labyrinth's walls "absorbing faint light" and threads that "pulsed like living veins" are filtered through Alaric's chess-tutor perspective (strategic, pattern-seeking). The pedestal at center and its carved threads constrain the final choice—Alaric must place his palm to trigger the resolution—qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography (kneeling, following platinum lines, approaching pedestal) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bone towers, canyon, and pale spire are vividly described and spatially coherent. The cavern studio, waterfall, and mist all contribute atmospheric density. However, the environment remains postcard-level: we never see Kael navigate the tower's surface constraints, leverage the echoes as a tactical resource, or face a spatial obstacle that alters his plan. The nightshade ink is named but not handled in a way that shows its texture, viscosity, or application difficulty. Sensory hierarchy is thin—mostly visual and auditory—and the "damp stone and iron" smell is generic rather than character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    The acid-sea workshop supplies vivid sensory anchors (neon-green acid, copper hull, fumes, whirring gears) and the workshop's floating vulnerability is signaled throughout. The charm's grooves align with pockmarks—a tactile micro-setting move that drives the central action. A gear pops loose during the climax, adding environmental feedback to the protagonist's pressure. The piece stays within this single setting throughout, using acid and gears as both atmosphere and constraint, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave network constrains movement (narrow tunnel, forked path) and the cavern's fissure-lit pool charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (brine, limestone, pebbles crunching). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The painted shell functions as a micro-setting element that anchors both the opening and closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lighthouse, salt-streaked and dawn-lit, anchors the scene vividly. The vial cork on the windowsill and Thalos's rooftop garden supply tactile, scent-driven micro-settings that constrain Elara's ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (damp stone, oil, lavender, jasmine), and the garden's night-blooming jasmine directly shapes Thalos's lesson. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The lighthouse itself does not constrain a choice as directly as the garden does, keeping this shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    The signal station is vividly established with sensory specificity ("rusted antennae clawing," "smell of burning insulation"), and the coastal setting supplies thematic resonance. The censer foot functions as micro-setting, its weight and spin constraining Mara's actions across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the station itself does not materially alter Mara's choices—she could build her antenna anywhere; the setting enriches atmosphere but does not charge the final image with environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ravine orchard and storm are vivid and purposefully atmospheric, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—Mara reaches the oak without the storm altering her tactics or choices. The glass eye's physical properties (scratched, milky surface) are described multiple times but never constrain a beat. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The hut anchors the final scene, but no environmental feature charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    The opal dock, bruise-purple sky, and nautical twilight anchor atmosphere early and recur (dock's mist parts, hatch beneath the dock, dawn glow). Sensory detail is vivid ("salt and mist that clung like cobwebs," "brine and old iron") and filtered through Elias's eccentric perception. However, the environment doesn't constrain a key choice—the hatch opens without struggle, the trunk's padlock "clicks" conveniently—so setting remains more postcard than pressure. The lighthouse as Elias's workspace is mentioned but never used as a resource or obstacle, missing the micro-setting integration that would lift this toward the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern environment—bioluminescent fungi, obsidian pedestal, dripping stalactites—grounds the discovery sequence and the chip's placement charges the final resonance. Micro-setting works: the creek's rise brackets the journey, and the ants' path constrains Lila's route. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("emerald shards," "wet stone"), filtered through Lila's antique-dealer eye. The body and recurring spiral motif participate in closure, lifting the score into mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember grotto's glowing walls and pooled starlight are vividly rendered and constrain the queen's movement (she kneels, dips her fingers). The cobalt grotto and mist-covered ridge anchor early. However, the fireflies and the grotto's shifting light serve atmospheric decoration more than tactical constraint at closure; the queen's climb down is not shaped by environmental obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ember nexus is vivid—"glowing cracks in the cobblestones weaving gold through the air," "shards of cooled lava"—and the fading embers supply urgency ("the city above grew colder"). The shell and sun engine constrain the climactic choice: Elara places the shell atop the core, and its alignment with gears becomes the pivot. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, doorframe, nexus floor). However, the pocket-sun engine's mechanics remain vague; "prismatic lens," "sun engine's core," and "gears" are named but their function and failure modes are not grounded enough to make the final success feel materially earned rather than thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mountain cabin, snow, weathered logs, pine resin, and ice-slick crevice are vivid and filtered through Elias's jaded lens. The birch bark scroll and the pedestal inside the fissure function as micro-settings that guide the sequence. The ledge and the blank scroll at the end charge the final image, pushing this toward the 7+ band. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory selection reflects urgency during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    The water-clock shop is vivid and specific (glass vats, algae-clogged gears, fog seeping through cracked windows). Fog and dripping water recur to frame the atmosphere. The screw and mainspring comparison constrains Lira's interpretive method, charging the final image with physical metaphor. Occupation detail (aromatherapist who repairs clocks) is present but the repair mechanics remain ornamental; the algae cleaning and gear assembly do not alter tactics or choices. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's lost smell, tilting toward touch and sight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating platform, obsidian cups, crow quill, and mist-choked forest anchor the scene vividly and filter through Kael's professional attention (rune scholar arranging a ritual). The platform shudders under the rune's activation, and the forest "roars to life" in response, demonstrating setting as active constraint. Spatial choreography (kneeling, standing, descending steps) is clear throughout. The quill and ink constrain and enable the climactic act, and the final path through the trees charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is anchored early with sensory detail ("dust smelled of regret," "yellowed scores") and the piano's soundboard becomes a micro-setting that channels the climactic action. The orchard and chainsaws frame temporal pressure. The perfume bottle's copper wings and the piano's wood constrain the magical logic, charging the final image when the bottle empties and the chainsaws roar.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The library setting offers vivid sensory detail (aged paper, candlelight, shifting shelves) but remains a backdrop rather than a constraint. The dictionary is handled twice (pressed against mural, later open on pedestal) but does not limit tactical choices. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single location, and the "resounding hush" recurs, but no environmental element forces a decision or charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The horizon measurement station, hydraulic mechanisms, and fjord setting constrain Lorn's choices and charge the final image effectively. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: salt-streaked walls, steam hiss, moon-mirrored water. The mantle clock key's tactile presence (cold palm, razor edges, constellation carvings) functions as micro-setting that recurs with evolving pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear from observatory deck to the revealed seabed clock, with the setting's isolated cliff-side position reinforcing the discovery's solitary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed library, mica-pane lantern, and subway-tile corridor create vivid atmosphere and the lantern's warping light subtly mirrors the story's theme of bent perception. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (stacks, movable shelf, staircase, corridor, car) though the subway car's physical impossibility (sitting on tracks inside a library basement) is never anchored as magical realism or explained, creating a brief credibility gap. The lantern constrains Clara's movement through darkness and charges multiple beats (tracing rim, beam drifting, flame dancing, steady at return), pushing this into the 7+ range despite the setting's occasional vagueness about rules.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.1)
    The subway utility tunnel supplies vivid sensory anchors—rusted pipes, flickering bulbs, damp earth, old copper—and the glass disc returns with physical detail. Spatial choreography remains coherent across phone-booth moves. However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image; it functions as atmospheric backdrop without altering tactics, preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt, jasmine, violets and gold, nightshade roots twisting through planks). The flowers closing "as if in prayer" charges the final image. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—Elara could perform her archival work anywhere; the jetty's blooming state doesn't alter her tactics or choices. The micro-setting (driftwood post, walnut ink jar) is present but doesn't pressure her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.1)
    The disused station, ivy, and graffiti are vivid and atmosphere-rich, but setting details do not constrain choices or alter tactics. The chamber, tracks, and signal lever are named yet remain inert props; Elias and Lira move through the space without the environment pressing back. The ivy "shivering" and the station "breathing" at the climax are sensory flourishes that do not shape the outcome, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultrasonic forest supplies vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail filtered through Elias's blindness: ring vibrations, tooth-aching leaf frequencies, cold electric water. The upside-down river and bioluminescent moss create a coherent surreal logic. The platinum case and map constrain his final approach, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (Whispering Glade → Thicket → Silver Vein → stillpoint) tracks cleanly, and the forest's frequencies modulate with narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly is vivid and purposeful: stones hang midair, leaves spiral, and gravity flickers during the climactic exchange, grounding abstract stakes in sensory pressure. The pen's nib is handled twice (cold, then warm) and its temperature shift charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear (crater's edge, uphill walk). The micro-setting (anomaly + pen) constrains Elias's choice to unbend the timeline and charges his departure, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The luminous harbor by moonlight is vivid and atmospherically coherent, with selective sensory anchors (waves whispering, creak of ropes, mist). Spatial choreography is clean across Kael's positioning, Lira's approach, and the crowd's gathering. The camera functions as a micro-setting object but does not constrain a key choice—it frames his gestures without imposing cost or altering tactics. The setting supports tone but does not pressure the protagonist's decisions at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archive's chambers are named (astronomical maps, forgotten languages, self-portraits) but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The obsidian ink vial and tapestry fragment appear but do not limit tactics or charge the ending image beyond thematic echo. Spatial choreography is clear within rooms. The micro-setting (ink, canvas) could constrain but does not—Mara's brushwork succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "sound wave garden" remains largely decorative; plants hum and sway but do not constrain choice or supply resources. The lagoon's color-coded memories (cerulean, violet, gold) read as symbolic checklist rather than lived environment. Spatial choreography is unclear: Eli climbs a tree, then suddenly stands at the lagoon's edge with no transition. The body and the hollow log/gourd briefly function as micro-setting during drumming, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the geomagnetic storm charges the metal walls, the zodiac coin and key are handled across multiple beats, and the labyrinth's shifting layout creates genuine spatial pressure. The storm's static hum, ozone taste, and flickering lights anchor sensory detail in POV priorities. The key interaction with the Libra symbol and the hidden chamber constrain Elias's route and charge the closure image, elevating the setting from postcard to tactical constraint. Minor slip: the "towering maze of shipping containers" description leans slightly toward catalog in the opening, but later beats integrate environment into action cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cobalt dock after rain is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (slick planks, bruised sky, water reflections). The shutters and dental mirror supply tactile specificity, and the setting's mood coheres throughout. However, the environment does not constrain Lira's choices or alter her tactics; she opens shutters and angles the mirror without friction or spatial limitation. The dock functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, keeping the score in mid-band despite strong descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic grotto with iron filings "that shimmered like starlight" is vividly rendered and returns across multiple beats, its magnetic field tugging at Lila's zipper and making the chessboard pieces tremble. The cobalt library's "mist-swirled aisles" and stained-glass facade supply atmospheric texture, and the window displays across town add spatial scope. The grotto constrains the final choice by amplifying Clara's supernatural hearing and creating a charged space for the extended chess match, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sublittoral fringe is anchored early with kelp forests and bioluminescent fish, and Lira's childhood diving history gives it lived-in texture. The scrimshaw's tactile details (cold, smooth, warming in her hand) and the whale's physical presence create sensory specificity. However, the underwater swim lacks spatial grounding—no oxygen concern, no distance markers—and the island's crumbling is summarized rather than observed in concrete detail. The fringe constrains her initial position but does not shape the climactic choice or ending image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The farmhouse, turbines, and dried bouquet are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory economy (petals crumbling like ash, turbine hum, oil-rubbed wood). The turbines function as atmospheric constant but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics within the scene. The bouquet and spoon—micro-setting objects—charge the final image when placed together, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Spatial choreography is clear; Lirael's movements at table and window track cleanly. Wood grain as "memory" and the turbines as "giants stealing the wind's voice" are poetic but do not pressure the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are vividly rendered with distinctive sensory detail ("lantern-moth hush," "ice crystals hung… like suspended breath"). The setting supplies the stage for Lirael's journey and the colonnade's "humming" recurs across beats, gaining symbolic weight. However, the environment does not constrain her choices or provide tactile resistance; she moves through it freely, and the ice parts without friction. Spatial choreography is coherent but the world operates as a responsive canvas rather than a physical constraint that shapes tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Courtyard setting supplies glass orbs, kiln, clay pots—vivid anchor. Plants shudder and sway under the reed tongue's keys, constraining the plant-arrangement method and charging the climax (tourists gather, sky painted). However, spatial choreography drifts: Elias arranges plants "that night," then Marla sees it (when?), then "the sun set"—temporal/spatial continuity blurs. The moth's iridescent wings and cobalt dust are specific, but the courtyard itself doesn't constrain Elias's final painting choice; he could execute the phoenix anywhere. Micro-setting (body/tool) test: the reed tongue's warmth and keys guide action, lifting the score slightly, but the courtyard qua location remains postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lab and cave settings provide vivid sensory anchors ("brass dials," "damp earth," "carbide lamp"). The miner's lens functions as a micro-setting element that constrains Lira's approach and charges the final image when its scratches are revealed as grooves. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the lab-to-cave transition. However, the mountain's "instrument" status emerges late without prior seeding, and the golden shadows recur as atmosphere without pressuring a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory is vividly rendered—rusted telescopes, yellowed charts, glass dome with constellation etchings—and the stencil's alignment with the dome creates a purposeful spatial constraint. The lanterns, vellum, and origami are handled across beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental feature narrows a choice or supplies a tactical resource that alters outcome. The micro-objects (stencil, lanterns) charge the final image but do not constrain agency in a way that would push the score above 6.5.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as both atmospheric anchor and conceptual lens ("prism splitting the past"), constraining Elara's practice to this specific space. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara in doorway, then center, then cross-legged), and the measuring tape and cards supply tactile micro-setting. The skylight's rain charges the final image ("the loft's rain would keep falling"), linking environment to closure stance. However, occupational detail (cartomancy mechanics, blockchain reference) remains generic rather than constraining tactical choices with plausible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The bronze prism pagoda is vividly rendered (carvings, shimmer, glow) and anchors the scene spatially. Sensory detail is selective—dust motes, twilight slant, metallic taste of Kael's fear—and reflects Lirael's priorities. The pagoda's warmth under her palm offers a tactile micro-constraint, but the environment does not visibly alter her options or tactics; she kneels, traces, places her hand, then walks. The "atoms of nostalgia" phrase recurs but remains metaphorical rather than a concrete spatial element that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming library offers vivid details (petrified petals, glass dome, spider silk robes) but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The river stone's gold veins pulse and rearrange, yet this property doesn't limit or enable a tactical choice—it's observed, not used. Spatial choreography remains clear; the 1987 footage superimposition is anchored. The pedestal-to-console shift provides a concrete anchor for the solution but doesn't pressure Lirael's access or method.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.9)
    The misty workshop, terrarium, and tools are vivid and purposeful. The chameleon's tail tip functions as micro-setting, constraining Lira's reconstructive work and charging the final image with its shifting colors. Sensory detail (mist, starlight, hinges creaking) is selective and filtered through Lira's reflective state. The workshop provides the literal and symbolic space for her transformation, meeting the constraint test for the 7-band threshold, though the setting does not dynamically alter tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tower, frosted hourglass, and tunnel mosaic are vivid and purposefully strange. Sensory detail is selective (damp stone, frosted crackle, fogging breath) and the coffee rings function as portals, a micro-setting choice that drives the middle sequence. However, spatial choreography grows vague in the tunnel—her body's interaction with the rings and chamber lacks tactile grounding, and the final return to the tower skips over how she exits the collapsed tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with concrete detail (dust, decayed film stock, scarred wooden table, single flickering bulb, rattling window) that grounds the reader spatially. The booth functions as a container for Elise's grief and provides the film canister as a key object. However, setting does not constrain Mara's choices: she enters, reads the film, experiences the vision, and departs without environmental friction. The lilac scent at closure is atmospheric but does not alter tactics or impose a material consequence. Spatial choreography is clean (booth, table, stairs, lobby) and the vintage theater milieu is consistent, yet the setting remains backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered and anchors the scene early; the sextant's brass and mother-of-pearl inlays add texture. The hidden chamber with labeled jars ("The Singer's First Note") offers specific detail that constrains Kael's final choice of which jar to open. However, spatial choreography inside the chamber is vague—shelves, dust, dissolving walls—without coherent scale or movement logic that would further pressure the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune is vivid and sensory ("burnt honey and static," bioluminescent sand that pulses), and the archive's color-coded towers (crimson rage, azure longing) create a legible emotional geography. The chess clock's midnight-frozen hands and the woman's coat of woven light charge key beats. The dune's dimming when Kael picks up the clock demonstrates environment-as-response, and the final eruption of light ties setting to closure. Spatial choreography inside the archive remains clear across moves.

    The Mechanical Rainforest supplies vivid, specific anchors: ironwoods' minor keys, copperwillows' trills, brassbark bass notes. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's philosopher lens. The gear fits the pedestal socket, a micro-setting constraint that triggers the transformation. The final moss-ground and bioluminescent veins charge the closure image, pushing toward higher bands, but spatial choreography during the transformation remains vague—roots unspooling, trees rotating—without legible blocking.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ridgeway as shapeshifting terrain (meadow of thorns to bridge of roots, cliff to slope) directly constrains traversal and charges multiple beats. The ticket punch with its star stamp is handled across several moments (stamping tickets, glowing faintly, placed on the stone) and its physical presence shapes the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt and iron, honey and regret, gravel crunch) and filtered through the guides' professional focus. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the magical geography, and the twilight setting modulates from bruised to deepening, supporting tone.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt fortress, greenhouse, music room, and spiral staircase are anchored early and provide concrete spatial grounding. The piano bench bolt constrains Elric's routine and its wobble triggers the crisis, demonstrating purposeful integration. The "faint yellow stain" on the staircase step functions as micro-setting that charges the realization beat, though the conceptual leap it enables (stain → map → unspoken pacts) is more metaphorical than physical. Sensory details ("walls glimmered like frozen mercury," "cloth so soft it seemed woven from moonlight") are vivid but occasionally veer toward decorative lyricism without filtering through Elric's professional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient temple library is described with vivid phrases ("air hummed with forgotten prayers," "leather that had outlasted empires") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The mosaic trapdoor and hidden chamber appear when needed without prior spatial setup. The setting does not pressure Veyra's choices—she knows the temple's secrets and slips through walls with ease. The ink pellet is the lone object that charges the final image, lifting the score slightly above pure decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sea-level station, atlas page, and bioluminescent plankton provide vivid anchors. The storm and observation deck are used to stage the revelation beat, but the reef itself—central to the ending—remains abstract ("corals pulsing with life," "glowing like embers") without spatial constraints or sensory specificity that alters tactics. The atlas page constrains one choice (cross-referencing coordinates) but does not charge the final image, capping the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spaceport repair bay is vividly anchored—rusted cranes, half-buried drones, liquid-gold light, ancient stones—and the stones function as micro-setting by humming and glowing to constrain Lira's ritual timing. The opera glasses also act as a recurring tool that transforms the stones' symbols. Spatial choreography is clean (hull edge → eastern wall → stone circle), and the setting's decay mirrors the rebellion's stall. The environment directly charges the closure when "wind ripped through the bay" and shadows cast, lifting this above postcard description into tactical use.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The volcanic hot springs anchor space and mood; sulfurous mist, moss-slick rocks, and volcanic soil provide tactile grounding. The setting enables the vault discovery (buried beneath the springs) and charges the final image (embryo glowing in bubbling water). However, the environment does not constrain Nana's choices in a way that alters her tactics—she digs unimpeded, and the reconstruction crews are conveniently absent. The micro-setting (her hands, the shovel, the amber sphere) is present but does not force trade-offs, keeping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arboretum setting supplies concrete sensory detail (wind-twisted pines, weathered stone bench, ocean roaring below) and the cliff/sea anchor the final image. The stone bench constrains Lila's kneeling posture and provides the somatic anchor that drives the scene's central action. Lavender in pocket recurs with tactile specificity. However, the lighthouse-keeper backstory adds atmospheric flavor without constraining choice; Mrs. Voss's journal ships are told, not pressuring present tactics. Setting charges the ending image but could deepen pressure in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The forgotten library and lighthouse are evocatively sketched—"dust-choked silence," "salt-rotted wood," "luminescent ache of lamplight"—but remain largely atmospheric. Spatial choreography is vague: tarot cards spill, threads are collected from rafters and seams, yet no detail constrains a choice. The spiral staircase and gaping lens-hole arrive late without altering tactics. Micro-setting (tarot box, threads) charges the final image but does not force a decision, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    The wind-carved encampment, desert, and sand are rendered with selective sensory detail (wind seizing ink, ozone scent, stars overhead), and the setting provides atmospheric coherence. Spatial choreography is clear across the sequence. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image—Lira's path to the tower is straightforward, and the door opens without environmental friction. The setting remains vivid backdrop rather than pressure agent.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    The echoing library under snow is vividly rendered with cryo-chambers, frosted glass, and liquid nitrogen, establishing atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the library's scale and Lirael's movements within it remain somewhat generic. The setting pressures Lirael's choice by housing the frozen truths and Kael, but doesn't constrain her tactics—she accesses the chamber without obstacle. The cryo-chamber itself (a tool/object) enables the key turn, which lifts the score, but the broader library environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and ballast scrap anchor the scene with vivid, purpose-driven detail. Sensory hierarchy (amber glow, artificial breeze, thorns) reflects Lira's focus. The dome functions as both constraint and enabler, charging the final image when she presses the glass. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with crystal trees, moss converting footsteps to auras, and the rail spike as frequency conductor. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the stakes. The rail spike constrains Kael's method (strike to emit tone) and the moss forms the zigzag path in the climax, charging the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The observatory is vividly established (dome humming, gears grinding, glass and steel sanctuary above clouds) and returns meaningfully at closure when the dome opens to reveal pink sky. The rosewood desk and nib anchor micro-setting throughout. The 1987 memo's coffee stain is a nice specific detail, though the library and its "decades of records" remain generic. The observatory's isolation constrains Clara's choice by removing social friction during the decision, and the telescope gesture ("see beyond the horizon") charges the exposure moment, pushing this toward the 9+ gate but not fully crossing due to the generic treatment of the library space during the pivotal research sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The lab's "ozone and regret" and amber's "honeyed glow" offer texture, but spatial choreography is vague—where does the scanner sit, how does Lira position herself relative to the amber and machines? The digital corridor and nursery lack anchoring detail; "flickering light" and "antiseptic and old paper" are stock sensory notes. The amber constrains one mid-story choice (entering the firmware) but does not charge the final image with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's acoustics, mist, and tile mosaic anchor space and constrain Mara's actions (she presses the flake into a depression, the mandala rearranges). Sensory details—"damp moss," "lilac-hued glow," "low, resonant hum"—filter through Mara's perception. The tile flake as micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor slips: spatial choreography between wall, sand, and Mara's position could be tighter; "whispering gallery tile flake" remains somewhat generic in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shattered sky, ash-tasting air, and ruined minaret anchor locale and tone effectively. The tessera and stepping stone function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category. Sensory detail is vivid ("stars burned like fractured glass," "air tasted of ash and ozone") and filtered through Elias's retrocognitive perception. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single-scene frame.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard-within-hedge-maze is vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (apples taste of twilight, gravel hums minor key), and the hedge maze shifts to mirror the coin's design—a clear instance of setting altering in response to action. The spatial choreography at closure (walls dissolve, clearing revealed) directly stages the resolution. Elevation to 7+ is blocked because the environment supplies no constraint or resource scarcity that Elias must work around; it's reactive décor rather than a pressure that shapes his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The studio is anchored with sensory details (ozone, acrylic, neon-blue light, concrete floors) and the geode functions as a micro-setting object that Elias handles across multiple beats. The light-painting rig and hologram add texture, but spatial choreography during the week-long montage becomes vague—no sense of how his body or the studio changes under sustained work. The geode's facets reflecting hues charges the alignment moment, qualifying for purposeful reuse, though the studio itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coastal cave is anchored early with sensory detail (damp sand, salt-laden air, brine and decay) and the subterranean chamber constrains Lira's movements. The tools (heat-mapper, bioluminescent algae, journal) are handled across multiple beats and shape her method. However, the cave itself does not pressure a choice or complicate her access; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than obstacle. The micro-setting (body, tools, fossil) does more work than the macro-geography. The fossil's physical properties (grooves, glowing veins) charge the final moments when it crumbles, partially meeting the 9+ gate, but the cave network itself remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, and canyon are vividly sketched with selective sensory detail (dust, groaning beams, sawdust carpet). The jar and buttons constrain Mara's method—she must sort to unscramble—and the warehouse's labyrinth frames the search. However, spatial choreography is light (she moves from center to far corner without complication), and the setting does not pressure a choice at closure. The final window view charges the ending image moderately but does not alter tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bluff's mist and isolation are vividly established and support thematic tone. The pillbox appears in multiple beats and the transcription uses quill and soil, satisfying micro-setting criteria. Spatial choreography (railing, path, fog below) remains clear. Yet the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mara could perform this ritual anywhere isolated—preventing entry to the 9-band per the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    Fog, river, and ferry are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (fog "like a second skin," hull "slicing through fog like a knife through linen"). The setting provides atmospheric texture but does not constrain a single on-page choice or charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (carriage, dock, boat, tiller positions track coherently). Micro-setting qualification is not met; the yarn needle and boat vibrations remain descriptive rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scorched wasteland, skeletal hives, and stagnant well create vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Mara's zen-potter lens. The sunflowers at the oasis edge are specific and charged, anchoring the thematic and causal pivot. Spatial choreography is clean (well, sunflowers, edges of sand), and the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables action. Minor slip: "chimney smoke flattens against the horizon" as a dusk marker is evocative but slightly ornamental—no chimney is dramatized or integrated into the oasis's spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harbor setting is vivid and sensory: salt and diesel, moonlight casting silver paths, the wrought-iron fire escape. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the dock and bait shop scenes. The bitting gauge functions as a recurring small object, but it does not constrain a choice—it serves as symbolic talisman rather than tactical pressure. The opened window at the end charges the final image with light, lifting the score slightly, but the environment itself (harbor, dock, shop interior) does not alter Elias's or Mara's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal library is vividly specific (coral walls from extinct oceans, floors that shift like tides, shelves swaying with the moon's breath) and the brass sundial functions as a recurring anchor. The sundial constrains Lirael's recognition at the climax ("placed her palm flat") and the library's transformation supplies new tools that alter her final choice to document. The micro-setting charges the closure image when the shelves and chambers respond to her stance, lifting the score into the 7-band despite some ornamental description early on.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and glass orbs are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (marble curves, mosaic quiet, water rippling like liquid light). The orbs constrain Lila's choice to write and release her secret, and the pond's clearing "after the cloud bursts" charges the thematic frame. Spatial choreography (temple interior, pedestal, pond edge at dusk) tracks cleanly across moves. The body and tools (pen, paper, orb) function as micro-setting that enables the pivotal act, lifting the score above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    The university radio station is anchored early with the transmitter, basement equipment, and quad as spatial markers. The vintage oscilloscopes and cables supply texture, and the subsonic transmission uses the station's infrastructure. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Lila's access to equipment is never in doubt, and the physical environment does not narrow her options or charge the final image. The campus "restlessness" and quad arguments are told rather than shown, limiting their pressure on Lila's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cathedral's "shadowed nexus under starlight" and stained-glass blues/golds offer vivid anchor detail. The corridor's spatial warping ("walls bending like rubber") provides one moment where environment complicates movement. The compass point's stabbing stills the corridor, a micro-constraint, but the ending's dissolution of walls feels ornamental rather than a choice-shaping pressure. Spatial choreography remains mostly coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quarry is vividly anchored (mist, granite, jagged pit, damp stone scent) and spatial choreography stays clear throughout. The lantern, charcoal, and ribbon fragment are handled across beats, and the pit's "abyssal mouth" recurs to charge the final image. The setting pressures mood and constrains discovery (unstable site, faint indentation), meeting the 9+ gate, but does not force a tactical pivot that alters Clara's or Voss's next move.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The weather station setting is vivid and purposeful—brass dials, frosted glass, spongey gray sky—and the copper nail functions as a recurring object. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain Clara's choices; she moves from archive to tower to roof without friction. The micro-setting (nail, journals) charges the final image but doesn't alter tactics or force tradeoffs, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    The pullout's "pine resin and old engine oil" anchors early sensory detail, and the flake's shifting pixels provide a tactile focal point. However, spatial choreography is vague (van interior, guardrail proximity unclear), and the mountains function as backdrop rather than constraint. The transported location at the end ("thicker air," "softer light," "ground like memory") remains abstract and does not shape the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The circus train anchor is vivid and specific (ivy, rusting carriages, crumbling trapeze poster), and the dusky-to-night transition provides atmospheric progression. However, the train functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elias's choices are not shaped by the environment's affordances or limits. The foreign bills are handled across beats but do not constrain action; they serve as symbols deployed at will. Spatial choreography inside the train and at the startup offices is vague (no sense of Marcus's desk location, break room proximity, or Elias's vantage when "watching from a distance"). The final image ("sounds of the abandoned train settling") is mood, not a charged environmental detail that alters the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The observatory setting provides vivid sensory anchors (frosted glass, brass sextant, midnight chime) and the hologram's mosaic floor is tactile. However, the temple itself—the story's pivotal location—exists only as holographic projection, never pressuring Lirael's movement or access. The prism and variable stars function as symbolic objects but do not constrain a tactical choice on the page. Spatial choreography inside the hologram (boots sinking, palm to wall) reads cleanly, lifting the score above minimal, but the environment does not force a trade-off or block a path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    The vortex and orchard are vividly rendered with "trees twisted like dancers," "scent of decaying fruit and ozone," and muddy shore. Spatial choreography is clean: shore → vortex pull → spiraling → depths → eruption. Yet the environment remains scenic backdrop; neither the trees' clawing branches nor the churning water constrain Mira's movement or force a route choice. The flesh-eating seed moves through space (spirals away, erupts from lake) but its interaction with the vortex's physics is unexplained, missing an opportunity to ground the magic in tactile cause-effect. No object or spatial feature shapes the peak choice or charges the final still image beyond atmospheric mood.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt glade is vivid (heather, fireflies, ozone and elderberries) and the Glass Labyrinth's shimmering walls supply atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the glade-to-labyrinth transition ("hedges parting") blurs briefly. The maze topiary clipping is handled across beats but does not constrain a tactical choice—it activates visions and eventually merges into Lirael's skin without forcing a navigation decision or trade-off within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, roots coiling through bones, and pulsing black fruit. The setting shapes the ritual beat (skeleton in meditative pose, needle piercing bone) and charges the final image (tree shuddering, golden light). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. Micro-setting (the skeleton's ribcage, the single tree) constrains the sewing action and anchors the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.7)
    The quarry trailer is anchored early with mildew, concert posters, and desk lamp flicker. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (dust, mud on Gus's boots, rain). The cloth's texture returns at closure ("tucked into his jacket, its texture a balm"), charging the final image. However, the trailer itself does not constrain Lenny's choices; spatial choreography during the Gus scene is clear but the setting functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (the cloth as object-setting) meets the 9+ gate test by constraining memory and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly anchored through lodestone leaves, iron roots, and ionized storms. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (glassy pathways, lodestone trunk hollow). The seed's placement in the trunk hollow constrains the ritual action, and the arbor's hum and root-shift charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal atrium and bamboo creel establish a vivid micro-setting with sensory detail (brackish pools, glass dome, kelp). However, spatial choreography is vague—the woman's dive into a bamboo creel and emergence lack physical coherence. The creel constrains the woman's transformation choice, meeting the 9+ gate, but the atrium itself remains postcard description without altering tactics. Sensory selection is consistent but ornamental in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Crystal caves are vividly rendered with quartz veins, obsidian shards, and stalactites, and the spiral chamber provides spatial focus. However, the environment never constrains choice—Elias walks freely, and the pearl's placement requires no physical puzzle or cost. The respirator is mentioned once and forgotten, and the "radioactive field" in a flashback contradicts the sterile bunker premise without explanation. Micro-setting credit: the seashell and pearl function as tactile objects, though their mechanics remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered—ivy, rust, urinal graffiti, drainpipe—and grounds Mara's search in a liminal space. The accordion bellows return twice (crouching, playing by the tributary, final packing) and the station's physicality (shattered window, platform, tributary) shapes her path. The ivy "leaning closer" at the end charges the final image with mild constraint. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's chronicler lens, supporting the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glowing library with pulsing walls and mist is vividly rendered and the confidence man's watch recurs across beats, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with cost. Sensory detail (amber light, dampened shawl, humming watch) is filtered through Lira's perception and the spatial choreography remains coherent. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure tactics or alter the outcome, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, and ice-crystal violin are vivid and purposeful; the violin's melting under her touch and the plants creeping up the pedestal constrain her final choice. Spatial choreography (teacup, pedestal, window) remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (coffee cup, ice shards in her palms) charges the ending when she lets the violin shatter, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-constrains-choice, but the midsummer sun and velvet curtains repeat without evolving, capping the score in the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's sensory palette—bioluminescent moss, obsidian runes, liquid starlight—is vivid and filtered through Lirael's professional attention. The pool's surface cracking creates spatial consequence that briefly constrains her, and the aurora's "kiss of light" charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting feels purposefully textured rather than postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with specific, atmospheric detail: "vineyard hush," clouds pooling "like liquid silver," mossy nook in the elderwood tree. The tree itself constrains Lirael's action (she climbs to think, descends to receive the hairpin, climbs again for the final realization) and the grotto's edge supplies the scallop shell clue. Spatial choreography is clean. The tree perch charges the final image when Lirael closes her eyes wrapped in the hush, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse interior (damp wood, oil, tower archway) grounds the scene consistently. The cloak's physical weight and sensory filter ("colors dulled, sounds muffled") constrain Elias's perception and charge his experience. Wind chimes function as micro-setting objects that alter the final choice (unhooking changes the harmonic outcome). The dawn breakwater walk at closure reuses the lighthouse frame effectively. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    The grotto's bioluminescent moss and fractal ripples offer vivid texture, but spatial choreography remains vague—how high does the platform float, how does Elara move between platform and grotto edge, where does Lira sit in relation to Elara? The obsidian stone constrains the method but doesn't alter a tactical choice. Sensory detail stays visual; no embodied heat, cold, wind, or bodily consequence of the magnetic hum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly rendered and recur across beats. However, they function primarily as atmospheric anchors rather than tactical constraints—Kael's ascent, vigil, and descent are not shaped by environmental obstacles or resources. The arrowhead is handled twice (held, warmed) but does not alter a choice; it confirms rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.7)
    The icebound spire, crystalline shelves, and moss-covered sanctuary are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (breath fogging, soft earth, glowing flowers). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from hollow core to lower chambers lacks explicit anchoring. The garden folly keystone functions as a micro-setting element that enables the transformation, and the sketch physically charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that setting or object constrain choice or charge closure. Minor issue: the exotic plants withering and being replaced by familiar blooms happens off Kael's agency; he holds the sketch but does not make a choice that costs him something tangible in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and layered (salt-bitten wind, groaning planks, brine and decay inside the ship). The sunken library as micro-setting constrains Elias's approach and charges the final image; the pristine shelves and etched desk phrase anchor the thematic turn. Spatial choreography is clear across the dock, the water, and the ship's interior. The sky lanterns frame the timeframe and provide atmospheric contrast but do not directly alter tactics, keeping the setting contribution solidly mid-high rather than indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ambered observatory deck is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline bubble, amber walls, ancient sensors), and the coins function as micro-setting objects that Kael manipulates at key beats. The deck's hum deepening and sensors flaring during the distillation protocol ties environment to action. However, the setting's constraints on choice are minimal—Kael's movements are gestural (tracing grooves, placing coins) rather than tactically shaped by spatial or material limits. The final image charges through light and vibration, but the observatory itself does not foreclose or enable a decisive option.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory's dust, rust, amber dusk, broken celestial clock, and mahogany cabinet anchor the scene with vivid specificity. The prism's refracted light constrains the ritual action and charges the climax when "the light flared" and monsters solidify. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting qualifies as micro-setting that shapes the method and final image, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, but the closure image—descending stairs under indifferent stars—feels atmospheric rather than constraint-driven, capping the score near the 7-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sapphire viaduct is vividly rendered ("bridge of frozen light," glass meeting stone arch) and its acoustic properties (hum, resonant tone) constrain Elias's method. The bell's copper oxidation and cracked state are concrete. Spatial choreography is clear throughout scaffold-rigging and positioning. The viaduct's architecture channels the ocean's pulse, directly enabling the solution, which elevates setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway, receding waterline, and submerged churchyard create strong atmospheric grounding and the resurfacing town functions as both literal setting and thematic pressure. The sapphire label half-buried in moss is tactile and purposeful. Spatial choreography (ridgeway to churchyard, kneeling at tombstone) remains clear throughout. The midnight/twilight timeframe and the silent wind chime anchor the opening effectively, and the reservoir's presence constrains Mara's emotional landscape and final choice to preserve rather than expunge.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.7)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (fractured light, moss-covered stones, iridescent feathers). However, the environment remains atmospheric rather than constraining—Elara's movements and choices are not shaped by spatial limits, tool access, or environmental pressure. The crystal sits on the workbench throughout without altering tactics through its properties. The orchard functions as backdrop rather than crucible, missing the gate for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly rendered with bioluminescent veins, mossy nodes, and holographic fractals. Kael's hands trace bark and buckle grooves, grounding action in tactile detail. The buckle's teeth fitting "into grooves only he could see" and the forest "speaking in light, in pressure, in the faint tremor of leaves" constrain his method and charge the final image. Clouds below and spatial choreography (moving deeper into the arbor) remain clear across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock dojo, vortex sky, and brain in a jar offer vivid anchors. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the fight: where exactly are Kael and the clone positioned relative to each other and the jar? The "invisible paths" Kael descends on at the end contradict the established peril of the chasm below without teaching a new rule. The brain's blue light "intensifying" does minor atmospheric work but doesn't constrain a choice until the very end, when it suddenly becomes a merge-point without prior mechanical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly anchored (slick walls, grooves of forgotten laughter, flickering bulb) and recurs as the medium through which echoes stir and respond. The pull cord handle's frayed state and the machine's vibrations supply tactile micro-setting that constrains Marlowe's grip and endurance. However, the tunnel functions largely as backdrop; spatial choreography is minimal, and the environment does not complicate or enable a key choice—Marlowe's method succeeds without the setting imposing obstacle or resource scarcity that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen garden, rime-coated statues, topiary hedgehog, and fountain supply vivid, purposeful anchors. Mist thickens to "swallow sound" and the garden "felt less like a place and more like a thought," supporting the liminal tone and Mara's interiorizing technique. The moss path pulses "like a heartbeat" and directly enables the climactic step onto it, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara behind hedgehog, cultist at fountain, moss path to hidden door). The library atrium's "shelves stretching into infinity" and "old paper and ozone" smell provide concrete sensory closure, though the shift from garden to library happens via mist-swallow without intermediate spatial cues.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember nexus, obsidian plateau, and ash-strewn courtyard anchor space vividly and the nexus's pulsing, shuddering, and roaring supply escalating environmental pressure that charges Kael's work. The crozier's physical transformation (silver melting, ivory humming, final fusion glow) acts as micro-setting that directly enables the closure. Sensory detail (smog-choked sky, ember winds, keening sound) reflects urgency and the "frozen in twilight's embrace" final image ties environment to thematic closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gorge, tower spire, and lunar perigee create vivid spatial staging. The Hollywood fragment's azure glow and holographic projection offer concrete sensory work. However, spatial choreography drifts: Kael kneels at a floor fissure, climbs to an observation deck, then the fragment is "on a pedestal of crumbling concrete" without clear transition. The fragment's heat and the river of light charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting gate, but the tower's interior geography remains vague across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The spectral grotto's bioluminescent veins and liquid starlight are vivid and purposeful, mirroring the fractured chronology and guiding Kael's radio tuning. Spatial choreography remains clear (deck, railing, grotto walls, shifting dock layers). The hourglass and radio function as micro-setting that constrains choice at the climax, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the final image—Kael walking deeper into the grotto—does not charge the setting with additional cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gallery's shifting floor and shattering mirrors create vivid atmosphere in the first half. Spatial choreography falters when Clara moves from "vast, empty space" back to the gallery without clear transition or bodily anchors. The sinew thread functions as a tool constraining her action (weaving between mirrors), meeting the micro-setting test and lifting the score above mid-band. Sensory detail is visual-dominant; no scent, texture, or sound pressure emerges during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The benthic city, reinforced glass dome, cold water, and pressure are vividly anchored and filtered through Lirael's professional gaze. The chain link is handled twice (pocket → held up at lesson) and its rough edges constrain her tactile experience. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice at closure; the final beat floats in "cold, dark water" without the environment altering her options or charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss scent, violet light, cobwebs) and the hearing aid functions as a recurring small object. The atrium's galleries and fountain provide spatial anchors, though choreography during the ghost encounter remains vague. The photograph and hearing aids constrain Lila's method, meeting the micro-setting standard. Environment subtly mirrors the premise (forgotten promises, spectral atmosphere) but does not force a tactical choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded research facility supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: moss-slicked concrete, dried seaweed maps, shattered glass cases all anchor the decayed undersea setting. Sensory work is strong and balanced—rust/salt taste, low hum through floor, water seeping through cracks—and the tidal clock creates spatial pressure that constrains Lira's choices. The gold fleck's glow and the terminal sparking charge the final image. Minor slip: "crashing hush" as a phrase appears twice without clear escalation, and the spiral staircase/corridor/chamber progression could use tighter spatial choreography to track her descent and ascent distances.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    The opal observatory, frost-laced windows, and snow establish atmospheric specificity, and the control panel with spilled ink serves as a micro-setting that Elias manipulates. Sensory detail is vivid ("gears grinding like old bones," "porcelain shard clinking like a metronome") but leans decorative; the environment does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics. The ink patterns and the shard are handled on the page, yet their use reads symbolic rather than consequential—removing the observatory's materiality would not break the logic of Elias's internal arc. Spatial choreography is clear; no cap from orientation debt applies because the waiver threshold was not met in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers and canyon echoes constrain her positioning ("narrow ledge," "slick bone") and the diamond's heat forces the throw, meeting the 9+ gate's environment-constrains-choice test. Sensory hierarchy is strong: copper skin, pulsing gem, vibrating runes. Spatial choreography is clean through the climb and ledge scene. However, "Age of Whispers" and "twin moons" add flavor without altering tactics, and the canyon's "throat of endless echoes" metaphor is vivid but not causally tested until the maelstrom.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underground garden is vivid and particular—moss-caked roots, rusted cordless phone on mushroom stool, pool reflection warping—and the space pressures Elara's choice by enveloping her in the herbalist's domain. The arrowhead and phone function as micro-setting tools that constrain action. However, spatial choreography loosens during the metamorphosis: "kneeling in soil, hands clawed, back arched like a bow" lacks anchoring vectors, and the herbalist's simultaneous presence/absence at dawn is unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The enchanted orchard with glowing peaches, humming grass, and the sky-bridge provides vivid sensory anchors filtered through a lyric lens. The locust shell's iridescent wings and hollow chambers constrain Lira's method (she uses it to vibrate against the crack, then blows into it), charging the final sequences. Minor spatial drift: the eastern wall is mentioned once without later payoff, and the geyser's eruption from "the orchard's heart" lacks prior grounding. The setting actively shapes the climax through the statues' cores and the trapped starlight, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not indispensably—remove the orchard's magic and the plot still runs on Lira's music.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt arcade is vivid and recurs as emotional anchor; the border's "jagged line of shattered glass and barbed wire" grounds the setting early. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (ditch, border checkpoint, arcade, shack), though the exact geography of arcade-to-border remains vague. The arcade's machines reviving under the storm charges the final act and the cobalt glow constrains Elias's solace, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. No occupation-level detail is required here, and the setting modulates with the storm's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned circus train and courtyard are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (rusted carriages, wildflowers through cobblestones, fountain patterns). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image—Elio moves freely, and the courtyard's transformation is passive backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered with Edison bulbs, leather-bound volumes, and the interplay of equations and sonnets on shared shelves. However, the environment functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Eleanor's choices or alter her tactics. The scarf (lavender, ink, aged parchment texture) is handled in multiple beats and the candlelit midnight setting charges the final sequence, but the spatial choreography in the mirror-corridor dissolves into abstraction without grounding the reader in lived physical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.9)
    The archipelago setting is vivid and tonally coherent (stones whisper, tides carry echoes), and the lighthouse recurs as a spatial anchor. The palette and camera function as micro-setting objects handled across beats. The climactic moment depends on light behaving oddly in rock crevices, charging the final turn. However, spatial choreography of Elara's movements on the rocks and lighthouse sill remains vague during peak pressure. The setting's sensory palette leans heavily visual; other senses are underused.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    Spatial choreography is vague: "shadowed nexus," "cobbled alley," and "vast expanse of starlight and shadow" function as mood backdrops without constraining movement or choice. The locket and lock of hair are described but do not supply a resource or obstacle that alters Elias's tactics. Sensory detail ("damp moss," "low hum") decorates rather than pressures. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0; the lack of micro-setting that charges the final image further limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwreck ring are vividly anchored with salt-crusted glass, rusted iron, and kelp-tangled masts. The sextant and fairy ring constrain Elias's method, and the *Luminara*'s bow provides a spatial line he follows. However, much description serves atmosphere rather than altering tactics: the wrecks "guard the door" metaphorically but don't block or enable a specific on-page choice at closure. The setting charges the final image moderately but doesn't constrain the ending decision.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    The forgotten library, ivy, light-and-shadow interplay, and tea leaves establish a vivid atmospheric frame anchored early. The afternoon shadow caught in glass is described but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it functions as symbolic decor. Spatial choreography is coherent (shelf, floor, tea, door), and sensory detail (damp parchment, creak of swing) filters through Lirael's perspective. However, the setting does not pressure the choice at closure; the visitor's resolve could occur in any contemplative space.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The waterfall and parapet anchor the scene vividly; mossy stones and algae ground movement. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—no environmental constraint alters Elara's tactics or complicates her ritual. The pool and stones are handled, but they enable rather than resist. Sensory detail is present (frothy white, sweet sap) yet does not press against choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight is vivid and purposeful; starlight refracts into colors, prisms dance across surfaces, and the setting charges the final image ("stars watched over her"). The tapestry needle is handled across two beats (attic discovery, unraveling work) and the net's physical unraveling structures the climax. Spatial choreography is clear. The sanctuary "accumulates" and releases the hush, constraining Mara's task and shaping the ending's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vault, henge, rain, and frescoes are vivid and purposeful; the sextant alignment with the vault window and the holy water on stone both constrain tactics and charge the middle beat. Spatial choreography is clean (mile east, staircase descent, altar center). The rain-scoured frescoes recur intact below, a strong callback that reweights the opening image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's perceptive bias (parchment creak, moss, stone hum). The micro-setting (stone as interface, crack as threshold) qualifies and reaches the 9-band gate; no occupation-level depth is required here.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken ship library is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (salt-crusted spine, warped shelves, lantern light, pressure-warped environment). The snow globe and tape recorder constrain choices—Elara cross-references frequencies, isolates patterns—and the setting pressures her work through its archival nature and deep-ocean isolation. The final beat mentions "corridors pulsing with ghost of Earhart's voice," which charges atmosphere but doesn't alter a concrete choice. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting's specificity (1937 aviation manual, reel-to-reel recorder, tuning fork in galley) filters through Elara's physicist lens. Meets the 9+ gate test: the library and snow globe both constrain investigation and charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The misty courtyard, cobblestones, and storm details are vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling by the edge, charcoal against stone, plate beside him). However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elias's outcome. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice (rests beside him, slips and is picked up) but functions as a symbolic anchor rather than a tactical element that shapes a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, frosted glass, and pale gold light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. The goggles function as micro-setting, revealing hidden ice-vein patterns that constrain Mara's perception and enable her insight. Sensory detail is purposeful: dust sparkling like starlight, breath fogging glass, wind through frozen pines. The tenth floor as "cavern of ice and memory" charges the final image, making the environment integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The brass telescope, wicker gondola, and lantern-lit void are vividly rendered and filter through Lila's meteorological expertise. The telescope's cold brass and the gondola's sway anchor high-pressure moments, and the vanishing tower below charges the emptiness with presence. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and the setting pressures the emotional arc (adrift, untethered) without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly particular: "damp bark," "fractally precise patterns in the grain," "oak panel embedded in the trunk." Setting constrains choice when the hidden panel and safe require the coin's indentations to unlock, and the wrecking ball's first blow forces her exit. Spatial choreography stays coherent (worktable, panel, exterior). The coin functions as micro-setting object that gates access and charges the final image in her pocket. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: calm exploration gives way to dust and chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The airship's copper hull, rickety floors, and cargo hold anchor space early, and the starling murmurations create vivid atmosphere. However, the ship remains largely scenic—Lira kneels on "cold metal," but the floor plan, hatch access, and physical constraints never pressure her choices. The hopscotch board is described ("numbers worn thin by time") yet its tactile handling and spatial relationship to the crates and Lira's body remain vague. The portal void "coalesced into a shimmering tunnel" with constellation walls, but no sensory specificity (temperature, sound, resistance) grounds the crossing or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "ice-bound shelves catching the faint blush of dawn," "mirrors rimed with frost, their surfaces cracked like shattered ice." Sensory selection narrows appropriately during the search (focus on glass texture, the mournful note). The vial of liquid light functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains the mirror revelation and charges the moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the Hall of Mirrors sequence, and the cold recurs as both atmosphere and physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and pearl-fruited trees are vivid in aggregate but remain postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The butterfly garden watering bell is mentioned three times but never handled on the page in a way that shapes action—it's suspended from the arch in the climax without prior setup showing how or why. Spatial choreography during the gathering is vague ("settlers stood beneath," "worked for hours") with no micro-setting detail that pressures the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lighthouse setting (skeletal tower, rusted railing, crumbling cliff, fog, salt and decay) is vivid and coherent throughout. The "pane of hush" functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's final action: she must press the puppet to the glass, then sing through it to amplify the lullaby. The fractal patterns guide her method. The setting charges the final image (lighthouse shudders, fog swirls) but does not fully constrain an earlier choice with felt cost, capping high-band entry below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinth's frost-tipped gravel, dead vines, and crumbling fountain are vivid and purposeful. The mechanical birds supply immediate constraint (their circling forces Kael to freeze, altering his timing). The nut's ridged shell and the door's rusted hinges are tactile and specific. Micro-setting (the narrow tunnel, the fountain basin choked with ivy) charges the final sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the maze navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered with foam patterns, current collision, and fractal repetition that filters through Elara's chemist lens. Sensory detail (froth, roar fading to hum, test tube dip) is concrete and selective. The studio returns at the end but remains abstract—no tactile anchors. The chrysalis constrains Elara's attention and primes the final gesture (releasing it), meeting the 9+ gate test. Spatial choreography at the ravine is clean; the studio scene is less grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glass orchard library, cloud sea, and translucent panes are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail ("mist," "prismatic shards," "hummed") is present but does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The floating note at the end is a purposeful reprise that charges the final image, lifting the score. Spatial choreography is clean (stall, aisles, outside), and the golden residue in her palm anchors the closing beat. The body (her hand) becomes micro-setting at closure, satisfying the 9+ test partially—but the environment does not force a trade-off earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The pavilion's coral spires, arctic air, brackish pool, and tidal formations create a vivid, selective sensory frame anchored early. The desert fortress after rain—wet stone scent, silver moon—grounds the exterior. The pool constrains Nessar's choice to kneel and immerse, and the pavilion's cold numbs his fingers, tying environment to action. Spatial choreography is coherent. The 9+ test is narrowly missed: while the pool is handled, it does not quite charge the *final* image (the kitchen cooking does), preventing top-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The astronomical clock tower is described with vivid detail (iron gears, Latin/Norse/Sanskrit bells, astronomical dials), and the grain elevator's groans provide atmospheric texture. However, these elements remain scenic rather than constraining: no gear jams her work, no villager blocks her descent, no spatial problem forces a tactical shift. The cuckoo clock weight is handled across multiple beats and returns charged at the ending, which partially satisfies the micro-setting allowance. The tower's sensory palette (starlight, candle flame, stone steps) supports tone but does not pressure Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The moonlit canyon and broken mirror provide vivid anchors: "silver light pooling in the cracks," "shards glinting like shattered constellations," "walls etched with symbols that shifted under moonlight." Sensory selection is filtered through Kael's engineer's eye (laser etcher, neuro-interface, liquid crystal). The mirror's evolving state—cracked, glowing, then "iridescent seams"—tracks coherently across beats and charges the final image when it "rippled like water." However, the canyon itself remains largely backdrop; no environmental constraint (wind, rock, temperature) materially alters Kael's tactics or the repair outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly sketched with moss-slick stone, mist, and clandestinely luminous walls. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (left tunnel, chamber, alcove), though the transition from "ceiling" back to "daylight" compresses without tracking her return path. The manuscript and key appear as props but do not constrain a choice—Lira lifts, traces, and takes them without friction. The setting provides atmosphere but does not force a tactical trade-off or charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The siskin alder grove is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—moss-cloaked stump, needle-thin leaves, the hedgehog as a recurring anchor. Spatial choreography is clear; Elara's physical actions (kneeling, pressing, strumming) are grounded in tactile particulars. The porcelain insulator and stump constrain her method and charge the final image when fragments scatter "like starlight." The grove's transformation (alders leaning, moss thickening) subtly mirrors the emerging music, and the setting directly enables the climax by supplying both instrument and resonator.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and functional: compass needles spiral, the plateau is cratered, the monolith is moss-crusted, and the nexus hums and shudders at key beats. The stone's physical properties (crescent dent, amber glow, keyhole transformation) constrain Alaric's actions and charge the final image. Twilight's violet bleed and the holographic star-map provide atmospheric specificity. The environment actively participates in escalation (the roar, the glow, the vibration), meeting the micro-setting test for choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop setting is vivid and specific (cobwebs, rusted tools, oscilloscope, soldering flux), anchoring the character's world. The diary clasp constrains her approach, and the oscilloscope enables the frequency solution, so tools matter to tactics. However, the setting does not evolve or tighten choice during the peak beat; it supplies atmosphere and resources but does not charge the final image with spatial or environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The treetop village is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (vines, lanterns, creaking walkways, mist-shrouded valley). Lira's olfactory sensitivity filters the setting through character priorities (metallic tang when the seed needs water, sweet note for sunlight). The corpse flower's scent charges the final image, grounding the village's transformation in a concrete, recurring sensory detail. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout, and the setting subtly constrains Lira's methods (treetop isolation, elders' skepticism).

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vivid sensory detail throughout: vine-woven glider, midair water spheres, bioluminescent lattice, gravel that "defies the looming inversion." The floating arches and inversion phenomenon constrain Lira's flight timing and tactics. The arrow tip's warmth and the pedestal socket provide micro-setting pressure at the closure beat, directly shaping the discovery moment. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment actively charges the final image of vines settling with gold leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container yard is vividly rendered with corrugated sides, faded logos, salt-stained gravel, and sodium lights. Spatial choreography is clear through Anya's methodical movement, and the environment directly constrains her choices—wind slams her, she climbs rusted ridges. The "low, electrical buzz" and temperature drop between containers supply atmospheric pressure that charges the closure image of the port as a living machine.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered—"sculpted hush," "stalactites dripped like wax"—and sensory details (frost, resinous scent, aurora light) are purposefully layered. The amber sheet and bell are handled on the page, and the aurora's colors guide Lira's singing, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains clear when Veyra enters. However, the cavern's transformation (walls melting, arches forming) doesn't constrain Lira's final choice or alter her tactics; it's spectacle rather than pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thunder-Echo Range is vividly rendered with "stone spires clawed at bruised sky," "petrified pine and ozone," obsidian staircase, and chamber "where time pooled like liquid." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (sound in canyon, glow in descent, silence in chamber). The driftwood markers recur at open and close, reweighting directional choice into surrender. Spatial choreography is clear. The setting guides choice (fissure opens, staircase descends) and charges the final image (twilight, rearranged markers), meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    The workshop—burnt sapphire, iron filings, pulsing halo fragment—is vividly rendered and anchors the opening effectively. The fragment constrains Elias's approach (he must "disorient" it) and the letterpress becomes a tool in the climax, elevating setting beyond decoration. However, the stars "bleeding into the horizon" and "hour between vanishing constellations" are poetic but functionally vague, and spatial choreography during the climax (knocking over jars, press stamping walls) lacks clear blocking.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway provides vivid sensory detail (jade/violet colors, frost-slick stones, warping lantern light) and the setting constrains movement—Kail must climb a treacherous path. The seed's placement "where the aurora touches the stone" makes environment essential to the climactic action. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The pendant as micro-setting (vibrating in his palm, clicking in the satchel) repeatedly charges key moments and the final image where it lies stilled at the sapling's base.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost patterns, and car window anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail filtered through Mara's mystic lens. Spatial choreography is clear (arbor edge, car nearby, Mara moving between). The arbor's crystalline branches and amber pulse constrain Mara's method and charge the atmosphere. However, the setting does not meaningfully alter her final choice; she could reach the same realization in any reflective structure. The micro-setting (prism, frost) participates in beats but does not force the closure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard, bamboo, loom, and creek anchor the action with purposeful detail. The puzzle's "jagged, irregular edges" and the crow stealing a piece add tactile specificity that constrains Mara's efforts. The final image—loom creaking, bamboo whispering—charges the closure by folding environment into the sacrifice's aftermath. However, spatial choreography slips when the rummage-sale box "washed up" in the creek without prior mention of water flow or flooding, and the orchard's scale (single clearing vs. expanse) remains vague across the multi-week span.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Floating arches, crystalline deposits, and the cavern of shards provide vivid anchors and a coherent fantasy world. The silk's azure glow recurs across beats and charges the final image. However, spatial choreography in the tunnels (three passages, center choice, wall dissolution) lacks concrete sensory grounding—distances, temperature shifts, and the mechanics of "walls dissolved" remain vague. The orchard's withering and the arches' trembling are described but do not constrain Jorin's tactics in the mine.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered with skeletal gantries, rust, emergency lights, and dust motes catching visor projections. Sensory details are selective and support atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—no tool, spatial constraint, or environmental feature meaningfully shapes Kael's choices or charges the final image. The parallel bay's gleaming alloy is noted but not used. The shard's physical properties (sharp edges, warming surface) anchor touch but do not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The haunted lantern room is vivid—salt-streaked walls, rattling windows, iron and brine taste—and the eastern window's sliver of sunlight constrains the stone-stacking ritual spatially. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's mariner priorities: rust patterns, wind whispers, the hum of the rising tide. The lighthouse as body-and-tool micro-setting charges the closure image when the kerosene lantern's "feeble glow" contrasts with the conceptual beacon of shared gestures. Minor slip: "ghostly moan of the wind" is a stock metaphor that slightly dilutes the otherwise particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass panels, and cliff anchor space effectively; the lantern's "total internal reflection" property constrains her method and the balcony staging grounds the final beat. Sensory detail is selective (wind tugging cloak, waves crashing, flame hissing) and filtered through urgency. The glass wick's light directly shapes the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion, but overwriting in the opening third ("glass panels glowing faintly under a sky thick with stars," "its flame flickering like a captured comet") and a few vague gestures ("the shadows seemed to agree, pulsing") hold the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating tea house, obsidian stones, valley mist, and sun trails create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. Light tracking constrains Lin's movement and charges the climax when the wing casts "sun trails" across the chamber. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "wet ink," "labyrinth of cool blues," morning versus afternoon mood shifts. The recurring blue morpho wing functions as both object and environmental modifier, shaping Lin's path and the travelers' shared moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight, tree roots, and sextant are vividly described and the setting is textured with selective sensory detail (damp stone, rusted brass, glowing bark). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters outcome; Elias walks through shimmering walls and follows roots without friction. The setting operates as atmosphere rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific details (silver runes, mica windows, fruit that glows), and the mica window returns with functional variation (rippling, pulsing, glowing). The micro-setting constrains Lira's work spatially and the windows serve as conduits, satisfying the constraint test. However, much description feels static—plums of molten gold, pears dripping twilight—offering visual catalog without altering tactics. The endless night and mirror-world twin provide atmosphere but don't shape the middle beats beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    The hidden library is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (oak, dust, candlelight, mirrors) and the architecture (bookcase door, circular table, Third Shelf hollow) constrains Eleanor's movement. The mirrors offer a micro-setting that charges the emotional beat. However, spatial choreography in the mirror chamber and the final return to the main library could be tighter; we lose a clear sense of distance and how members continue their work around her. The Third Shelf's mechanics (key insertion, hollow reveal) do materially enable the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tea house and courtyard supply atmospheric texture (moss-speckled floors, ivy, dark soil) and the planting action is concrete. However, spatial choreography drifts—where exactly the tea house sits relative to the courtyard, how the woman appears—and the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint. The seed and soil enable the gardening choice but don't limit it; Elias could plant anywhere. The palace foundations and "forgotten secrets" hum remains ornamental. Micro-setting allowance met (tea house interior), but no environment detail charges the final image or narrows options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library, frosted panes, ice prism, and lantern are vivid and purposeful. The prism constrains her method (splitting light into frequencies), satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography is vague—desk, lantern, prism positions aren't tracked across moves. The setting pressures Elara (fading magic, wind rattling panes) but doesn't supply a resource that alters the final outcome; the dawn's warmth arrives coincidentally.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pirate market is vivid and purposeful: barnacled pilings, tattered silk stalls, brine-and-opium stench, masks of lace or paint. The Clocktower Stall's frozen hands at 2:17 and the corroded tower structure guide Lira's route and constrain her search. The watch fob's anchor engraving and chain snag on a nail are micro-setting moves that charge the object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (pier → market → stall → tower stairs → bell chamber), though the buyer "detaching from the wall" in the bell chamber is a touch convenient. The closing beach image dissolves the market into tide, reinforcing impermanence and grounding the thematic unease.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender bluff and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (metallic ozone, soot, ocean spray, copper). The compass ring heats and hums, constraining Kael's interpretation at the climax. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image when the aurora dims and the bluff falls silent, marking the election's conclusion and anchoring the thematic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with prismatic refraction, damp moss, jagged walls, and auroral weight. Spatial choreography is clean: lantern, flat rock, crystal spire positions track across the scene. The cave constrains the ritual (isolation, echoing silence) and the crystals participate in the painting method, so environment shapes the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("charcoal-fingered," "knees sinking"). The cave's dissolution at the end ("fading into insignificance") slightly undercuts its essentiality but does not break the setup-development-payoff chain.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse city is vividly anchored early (glass domes, toxic amber sky, Venus flytrap fens, moss-slick floors) with sensory detail that reflects urgency and serves the quest. Spatial choreography is clear: vertical sectors, spirals, lower levels where air thickens and light dims. The vault disguised as a storage closet and the glass orbs provide tactile micro-setting. The carnivorous plants and nectar bribe constrain Elara's approach, and the quill's physical response (wilting, unfurling) charges the closure image by linking bodily sensation to truth-detection. The toxic sky and dried oasis frame the broader world without overwhelming the single-scene scope.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bluff is vividly rendered with "mossy steps," "obsidian pedestal," and "prismatic shadows." Sensory detail is dense but becomes decorative rather than constraining choice. The iceberg fragment's cold "seep[s] into her skin," yet this does not alter her next action. The sculpture's mechanics are described extensively but do not narrow options or create friction. The setting charges the final image modestly but does not drive a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass dome, solar panels, and desert roses establish vivid spatial grounding and recur with purpose. The dome's electromagnetic field and the roses' engineered spirals constrain the burn and charge the final bloom image, satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail—ozone, pressed lavender, bioluminescent threads—is selective and POV-filtered through android perception. The magnetic storm outside modulates the dome's light and pressure, and the recurring "glass-domed enclosure containing chaos" image anchors the thematic frame without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    The courtyard's cobblestones, dawn light, and tarnished mailbox are vivid and anchored early. The mailbox constrains Clara's routine and charges the closure image when it finally opens. However, the week-long investigation loses spatial grounding—conversations occur in generic "courtyard" space without evolving detail. Sensory selection is mostly visual; the "damp earth and old paper" scent appears once and never returns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken laboratory, kelp, rust, and dripping water establish atmosphere efficiently. The holographic projector and hidden chamber constrain Kael's path in the middle beat. However, spatial choreography during the drone chase is vague—no clear distances, cover, or physical obstacles that shape his dance tactics. The dice glow and warm but never materially limit or enable a choice; they remain symbolic rather than functional tools.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.7)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with jagged luminous clusters and cool smooth surfaces, and the hidden tunnel adds spatial pressure. The whale carcass on the cliffs and the cliffside wildflowers anchor the world concretely. However, the chamber functions primarily as backdrop; Elias's discovery of the panel is guided by coffee grounds rather than spatial constraint, and the setting does not force a tactical choice that alters outcome. The body and immediate environment charge atmosphere but do not constrain the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly described (moss, fireflies, water ripples) and anchor the single scene early. However, the environment remains decorative—no spatial constraint or resource alters tactics. The origami wing's physical state (absorbing water, crumbling) could qualify as micro-setting, but it dissolves by fiat rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image with cost. Sensory detail (wet earth, distant stars) is selective but does not guide decision.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop garden is anchored with vivid, POV-filtered detail (wisteria, cracked pavers, string lights) and the meteor shower timestamps the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias and the woman could enact the climax in any library space. The dome's glass panels and glowing seal charge the visual field but remain postcard elements rather than pressure levers, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden is sensuously realized—petals as mourning veils, thorns drawing blood, shadows pooling like ink—and the twilight-to-dawn frame constrains the ritual window. The seashell circle and skeletal rose stems function as micro-setting tools that shape Lirael's sequence of actions. Spatial choreography remains coherent (kneeling, dirt, circle arrangement), and the garden's transformation (color shed to ash) charges the final image, though the shift from velvet abundance to ash feels more symbolic than causally linked to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, stalactites, aurora, and moss-veined floor are vivid and selective. The thorn and parchment function as micro-setting elements that constrain her ritual action—pricking her thumb, sealing with blood. The aurora's shifting hues modulate with her work, and the hidden alcove serves as the closure destination. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting charges the final departure image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    The serpentine nexus is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (stone coiling, wind carrying whispers, fissure like a scar). The seashell half pressed against the wall guides the ascent and constrains Kael's path, charging the final image when pressed to his heart. Spatial choreography during the climb is clear. The micro-setting (shell, stones, ledge) shapes one key choice and returns at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    Glacier shrine, ice, candles, and snow globe anchor setting adequately. The melted snow globe is handled twice (palm examination, altar placement) and its warped glass recurs across dream vignettes, approaching the purposeful reprise threshold. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Kael's access to dreams is frictionless, and the shrine functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting allowance partially met by the globe's charged descriptions, but it does not alter outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The whispering parapet, rain-slicked stone, mist, and harbor lights create a vivid sensory backdrop filtered through Kael's contemplative POV. The bamboo tea whisk functions as both tool and talisman, its tines catching moonlight and vibrating with the music, which constrains his decoding gesture in the climax. The fireflies, moon paths, and physical environment all guide Kael's movements and frame his discovery. Micro-setting (the whisk, the stone's grooves) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object or environment constrain a choice or shape closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard's radioactive dust storms, glowing apples, and tree-lean toward center create vivid, purpose-driven setting. The clearing's ground markings and fissure chamber constrain the climactic choice by dictating where the diamond must be placed, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's investigative lens (loam, grit, humming air). Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves from cottage to clearing to chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt glass portico and storm-lit altitude anchor the piece vividly and constrain Kael's isolation motive. The portico functions as both window and threshold, and the activation of mirrors/lenses uses the setting's architecture to charge the climax. However, the hourglass and radio rig remain postcard details without tactile interaction that alters a tactic; Kael places a palm on glass but does not navigate or negotiate spatial pressure in a way that changes his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral loft—sand through warped boards, rusted cot, chipped sink—anchors early and recurs at closure. The music box's "rusted keyhole" and the jars arranged in a semicircle create micro-setting that shapes action (he pours sound into the keyhole, conducts "an orchestra of ghosts"). The loft's "lonesome splendor" modulates with dawn's progression. The village choreography is less precise, but the loft itself constrains and charges the final return, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are anchored early with vivid sensory detail (frosted planks, tangerine sunset, ice creaking). The resonator functions as a tool that shapes tactics, and the ice underfoot provides spatial grounding. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop; the ice and marina don't constrain Elias's choices or force adaptation in the confrontation—the ghost could have appeared anywhere and the outcome would be identical.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, moss, iron filings, and the viaduct surface create vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The filings' behavior (trembling, coiling, locking into grids) constrains Kael's adjustments and charges multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clear (perimeter pacing, kneeling between pillars, lake's edge). The frozen lake returns in the final paragraph with thawed water, reweighting the viaduct's hum as a lasting legacy. Setting details are filtered through Kael's professional focus (magnetic nodes, fractal refractions) without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The subway tunnel is grounded with concrete sensory detail (mildew, old metal, slick walls, stagnant water) and the lantern's light creates atmosphere throughout. The hidden compartment provides a spatial goal that constrains Mara's movement. However, the tunnel does not meaningfully alter tactics or charge the final image—Mara's resolve could form in any location. The lantern (object-as-setting) recurs but its physical properties (brass, flame pulse) do not constrain a choice at closure. Train rumble in the final beat is atmospheric but does not shift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair shop is rendered with vivid, selective detail: oil, aged wood, graphite dust, tiny tools, exposed gears. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chaplain's attention (he notices precision and care). The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting, constraining his judgment and charging the final image when he tucks it under his arm in the rain. Storm imagery bookends the piece purposefully. The shop itself does not constrain a middle choice but does enable the thematic pivot, meeting the 7.0+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The acid sea, floating workshop, and sulfurous wind are vivid and consistent; the gears-and-cogs setting anchors early and the *Skein*'s braces/sails function as tools that Lira adjusts under pressure. The kaleidoscope's projections onto mist and the bell tower rising from the sea charge the final image with sensory particularity. Micro-deduction: spatial choreography at the climax (dive trajectory, tower distance) remains abstract, but the overall setting constrains and enables Lira's choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archive setting is established with concrete details (servers humming, cold light, holographic interface, red drone lights) and the patch functions as a recurring tactile anchor. However, the environment doesn't constrain Lira's choices—she accesses restricted files, cracks encryption, and uploads data without meaningful friction from the space itself. The "derelict research station on the edge of the system" is mentioned but never charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear in the final confrontation, but the setting operates more as backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse-orchard-above-ice-floes setting is vivid and consistent, with frost-heavy branches and groaning ice that pressures the opening stakes. The vintage mirrors in the attic guide Elara's method and return as a concrete spatial anchor. The crystal fragment placed on the ground channels the storm's resolution, charging the final image. The setting constrains Elara's approach (she must climb to the attic, walk the circle) and supplies the mirrors as a resource, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cold through boots, keening sound, faintly blue fissure) and constrains the rescue action—the parasol tip hooks the railing because of the ice-crack's geometry. The "fold in patience" image and the frozen bay's "loosened grip on reality" charge the atmospheric frame. However, the clinic in the "nearby town" remains abstract, never anchoring Lila's stated purpose in physical space, and the disaster-relief mechanics (picks, shovels, canned goods) are sketched rather than integrated into her moment-to-moment choices. The marina qualifies as micro-setting that shapes one key turn (the rescue) but doesn't recur at closure to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber pavilion, stripped vines, and autumn setting are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (tang of grapes, old woodsmoke, bruised sky). The environment subtly mirrors Lila's stalled state and constrains the encounter to this isolated, liminal space. The letter—charred edges catching fading light—and the oak anchor key beats. Spatial choreography is clear (benches, vineyard rows, pavilion return). The setting charges the final image: rain arrives as Lila laughs and returns to the pavilion, marking her tentative opening.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid fantasy lexicon (whisperfield, kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion) but the parapet's mechanics remain vague—stones "rearrange," "glow," "surge," "spiral" without spatial clarity or constraint on choice. The pavilion hums and trembles but does not limit or enable tactics. The final image recycles earlier descriptions without new pressure. Micro-setting test: no object or body detail constrains a key choice or charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (scent, light, rust) and anchor multiple beats. The dove gray map case returns with thematic weight at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the kneeling/standing/walking sequence. The vines climbing higher overnight is the sole detail that materially shifts the ending choice to return with film, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The shadowed library at dawn is vividly rendered with dust motes, ink scent, cracked leather, and the crystal chandelier. Spatial choreography is clean (shelf, window, floor, chandelier). The crystal functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and charging the final image when replaced in the chandelier. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's scholarly priorities, and the "suspended hush" atmosphere supports the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with twisted rebar, bicycle frames, and rusted car doors; sensory detail (gravel crunch, cold metal, fog muffling) is purposeful and filtered through Elias's searching attention. The driftwood markers and chalk line on the ground constrain his ritual choices and guide his path, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping action. Spatial choreography remains clear as Elias moves from sculpture to sculpture. The "hush of old videotapes left unwatched" is atmospheric but doesn't function as setting—it's a metaphor for abandonment rather than a concrete location or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lunar observatory setting is vivid and specific: silver shell, marble floors, brass instruments, clouds below. The clock's physical presence (whine, vibration) and the telescope constrain Elias's actions in multiple beats. The portal at the horizon charges the final image. Minor slip: the workshop's "cavern of gears and glass" and the soldering circuit feel ornamental rather than tactically essential—Elias could plausibly have stopped the hand without those particular tools.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "radiant haven above the clouds" and floor-to-ceiling windows establish a distinct hospice setting with sensory anchors (lavender scent, sunrise gold, clouds drifting). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The vinyl turntable is the closest the setting comes to enabling action, but its mechanics are glossed ("placed the vinyl shard on the turntable")—no consideration of how a fragment plays or what technology allows it—so the object rather than the room does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal observatory is vividly rendered with brass telescopes, glass domes, and constellation-etched floors. The floating isle and the specific detail of shadows retreating at noon create atmospheric specificity. The automaton key's alignment with the Weeping Archer constellation during the brief north-pointing shadow window shows setting constraining the climactic choice. Sensory detail remains largely visual; other senses are underused. The environment charges the final image by revealing the shadow-pool gateway beneath the isle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hedge maze and fountain are vivid and recur with purpose; the moss-choked basin and thorns create tactile grounding. The garden's spatial choreography remains clear as Mara moves from hedge to fountain to exit. The bone-setting instruments anchor the healer's world without excess exposition, and the tooth's jagged edge that "once cut her thumb" gives the object physical consequence. The garden itself functions as more than backdrop—its "labyrinthine walls" and "whispers of forgotten seasons" modulate with the plot, and the final detail of the path clearing ties setting change to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's slick walls, black water, and mist are vivid and filtered through Elara's task-oriented attention. The meteorite-iron tool and rune-carved anvil are concrete and profession-specific. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The sea glass jar recurs and its constellations align at the end, charging the final image. Environment and tool constrain her polishing method, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the outside world remains generic ("wind, waves, gravel").

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moss garden and rusted server racks are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Lila's transformation project. The drip-pattern stones and bioluminescent moss ground spatial choreography cleanly. The pendant (amber/obsidian/moss) constrains the pivotal gesture when Elias presses moss into the setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail (honeyed hush, mosslight, snow outside) modulates with scene needs and reflects Lila's protective curation of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The feral nexus is vividly sketched—mist thickening into half-formed sounds, ground shifting like sand—but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraint. The seashell fragment recurs and is declared "a key," yet it never unlocks a physical door or alters Clara's tactical options on the page; its role remains symbolic. Spatial choreography (dock, nexus interior, return to dock, study) is clear, satisfying the micro-setting requirement for mid-band entry, but the environment does not pressure a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The treehouse, arbor, and harvest moon anchor setting vividly with selective sensory detail (liquid gold sunlight, luminous mushrooms, dew-traced patterns). The lyre and vine tendril function as micro-setting elements that constrain the ritual's execution. However, the arbor itself does not pressure Lira's choices—space and access remain frictionless—and the final image (sapling, dappled shadows) decorates rather than constrains the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clear but passive.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.7)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vivid and consistent: snow, frost-bitten apples, dead trees, and cold anchor the scene throughout. The discarded items (twigs, branches, apple shells) supply the materials for the seal, constraining Elias's method. However, the setting does not meaningfully narrow his options or charge the final image—he works methodically, but the environment never forces a tactical shift or surprise, keeping the setting functional but not indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marble cavern with quartz veins, light shifts at noon/midnight, and the mirror as a diagnostic tool all ground the setting concretely. The cavern functions as a living instrument whose acoustics shift with tidal rhythms, and light angles constrain Elias's method of revealing micro-etchings. The spiral staircase descent and "cellar of reason" motif appear at closure, lending spatial continuity, though the final image does not hinge on an environmental constraint in a way that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bronze grotto is vividly anchored with layered sensory detail (wet metal, moss-crusted pool, calcified whispers as "shingled hush"), and the kerosene lamp burner constrains multiple choices—relighting after a draft, angling flame at different burdens. The starlight fissure provides both spatial grounding and a method for orienting the lamp. The micro-setting (lamp, niches, specific burdens like thorns and obsidian) directly shapes Kael's tactics across beats, and the grotto's physicality charges the ending when he leaves it behind, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The loft's rain-streaked skylight, chipped kettle, workbench, and ash wood are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (steam curling, sawdust smell, fractured light). The carving blank and knife constrain Clara's hand movements and the final windowsill placement charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The "rust-hued peace" is evocative but slightly abstract; the setting does pressure the reflective mood without forcing a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kinetic lagoon is rendered with vivid sensory particulars (bruised violet, electric gold, westward slosh at dawn) and its fractured time affects Veyra's perception (seed still a seed, sun stuck). The lagoon constrains her scavenging choices and the camera wheel itself is a concrete object handled across beats. Micro-setting (froth, shore, depths) is used purposefully, and the final wade into the current shows spatial consequence, elevating the category despite the somewhat ornamental carousel backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The abandoned terminal is established early with vivid sensory detail (domed roofs, bruised twilight, shattered glass ceiling, moonlight pooling). The setting supplies the sextant piece and dormant conduits, both of which Lila uses, meeting the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography remains vague during the climactic recalibration—readers cannot trace which conduits she reroutes or how the tools interact with the infrastructure. The final image of the equation projected on the wall does charge the ending, lifting the score above mid-band despite missing occupational specificity in the engineering work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: brass pendulum, quartz forecourt that sings when touched, moss-patched flagstones. The forecourt constrains and enables—Lira must touch it to unlock the bear's response and her own insight. Petrichor anchors atmosphere across beats. Spatial choreography is clean (workshop → oak door → courtyard → archway). The quartz panel's warmth and hum charge the closure moment, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    The canal, barge, and warehouse are vividly rendered ("liquid silver," "drowned coins," "door hanging askew") and grounded early. However, the setting pressures mood more than choice—Elias walks freely to the warehouse without spatial obstacle or environmental constraint altering tactics. The sundial-as-object constrains slightly (its shadow guides), satisfying the micro-setting allowance, but the warehouse interior supplies only atmosphere, not a resource or barrier that changes the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("muddy banks," "lantern flickered"), lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor create a coherent atmosphere that modulates with discovery beats. The fulgurite glass functions as a micro-setting constraint when Elias aligns it with knots, shaping his decoding action. Fog thickens at the turn when the woman appears, charging the final tableau, though the spatial relationship between Elias, the fisherman, and the woman lacks clear choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shadowed autumn garden supplies vivid sensory anchors (jasmine, moss, fading light, autumn wind) and the thread is handled twice with tactile detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting supports tone and atmosphere effectively, but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara's interaction with the garden is observational and the thread vibrates but does not block or enable any tactic. The final image uses twilight and the thread's glow purposefully, lifting the score within the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vivid and consistently rendered; the gears, pistons, and bioluminescent flora establish a coherent world. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The palace's transformation at the end—metal fading, stone blooming with moss—directly charges the closure image and reflects the thematic shift from mechanical to organic. This meets the 9+ gate for Q3 (environment charges the final image), but sensory detail occasionally tilts toward catalog ("riot of bioluminescent flora," "liquid light") without POV filter, and the stalactites' resonant tones remain ornamental until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, and dunes are vivid and purposefully selected. Sand's hiss and glint operate as micro-setting anchors. Spatial choreography is clean (edge, kneeling, dunes behind). The lagoon pressures the metaphor (fertile soil from ash) but does not constrain a tactical choice in scene; the coin and kelp are used, not the lagoon itself. Strong descriptive control without final-beat constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains provides concrete imagery (dry basins, mosaic tiles, clocktower, library) and the stained glass box is handled across multiple beats. The marble-in-drain moment constrains the final action—Lira must physically pry it open—so the micro-setting (the drain) charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Lira's goal-directed attention. No occupational depth is required at this length and none is attempted; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nebula garden offers vivid, purposeful sensory detail (gas-clouds "shimmered like mother-of-pearl," crystalline trees with fractal leaves). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choices—petals drift and sonar pings, but these don't alter Lumin's tactics or options. The gear is placed at the tree base as a symbolic gesture, not because the setting forces that move. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (damp earth, forgotten roses, glass rattle, lantern flicker) and functions as both memory repository and living presence. Spatial choreography is clean: Marlow walks, pauses, unrolls the ribbon, watches butterflies swirl. The setting constrains through its glass-domed enclosure and ancestral associations, and the final image of butterflies lingering "in his bones" charges the closure with embodied resonance. The recurring motif of glass panes rattling with "thundering calm" modulates effectively with emotional beats, though the greenhouse's transformation from abandoned to "breathing" relies more on assertion than demonstrated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is vivid and integral: its shuddering and cracking directly pressure Lirael's task, and the algae-covered rake handle becomes a functional object. Sensory detail is strong ("slick with salt and time," "air thickening like syrup") and filtered through Lirael's professional attention. The tower and ridge constrain her choices and charge the final image when the obsidian seals "smooth as glass," meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt silo and velveteen gloom anchor setting vividly early. The tapestry on stone slab and the oculus showing stars provide concrete spatial grounding. However, the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded by spatial or material limits. The final image gestures toward stars "shimmer[ing] with approval" but this remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure element that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher quill are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (iron-rich ink, iridescent blue, ice groaning like ancient bones). The spire's thermal shifts and the lake's freeze cycles are tracked as data sources, lending purposeful atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—Lira's work proceeds indoors at her desk, and the lake's thaw is observed rather than navigated. The quill nib dulls and splinters but this change does not alter her tactics or charge the final image, capping the setting's role as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember alcove is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bioluminescent moss, mist, iron-and-memory air) and the setting subtly mirrors Lira's internal state through the glow and enclosure. The moss's breathing glow during the signal's peak ties environment to emotional beat, and the alcove's cliffside isolation reinforces her solitary quest. Spatial choreography is clear (radio, cloak pooling, boots on gravel outside), and the mist functions as a recurring atmospheric anchor. The micro-setting constrains her ritual and charges the final departure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vanishing point gallery is vividly rendered with impossible angles and dissolving art, and the porcelain mask receives specific tactile detail ("edges biting into her skin"). The rocking chair and ash-scattering tools anchor micro-setting and body in the scene. However, spatial choreography between Lira and Elias remains vague, and the gallery's architecture does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as backdrop. The final image of dawn beyond the walls gestures at setting but does not charge the closure beat with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    The sewer setting is vivid and specific ("putrid perfume," "algae-choked water," "moldy tomes"), and the sunken city ruins supply scavenging opportunities that matter to Elias's project. The cog, needle, and sediment layers constrain his choices and charge the final image when he aligns the cog and needle as a crude astrolabe. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and sensory details (stench, rust, dripping water) are filtered through Elias's priorities, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet library, autumn light, and stained-glass windows are vivid and consistent. The zither's soundhole rosette returns in the final image and charges it visually, earning credit. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Clara and Elias could meet anywhere without altering tactics. Sensory hierarchy is present (dust motes, maple leaves) but remains decorative rather than pressure-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted greenhouse with moss-streaked glass and the violet celestial light create a vivid frame. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling beside the plant, violet light seeping through cracks). The pruning shears and the plant's physical transformation (yellowed leaves, translucent bud) constrain the action sequence. However, the greenhouse functions primarily as backdrop; it does not force a tactical choice at closure. The celestial alignment provides atmosphere but does not tighten the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lightning collection tower is vividly rendered with copper cables, energy crystals, and "nectar dusk" creating a distinct atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (booth, tower base, hives). The tower constrains the plot—its failure drives the conflict—and the "nectar dusk" return at the end charges the closure image. However, the setting doesn't force a difficult choice; it serves as backdrop more than crucible. The term "nectar dusk" feels ornamental despite its reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bay setting is evoked with selective detail ("streetlights daydreamed in their amber haze," water lapping at boots) and the orris root shard is handled twice (dock, then bay's edge). However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere rather than constraining choice—Lira could conduct her experiment anywhere quiet. The final image (houses pulsing with golden light, curtain twitch, porch light flicker) charges the ending but doesn't alter tactics or options. The "displaced objects" motif recurs but remains ornamental until the ending glow.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater garden is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, obsidian statue, coral beds, and silt-covered pedestal. Sensory detail (gloves slick with algae, foxglove-stained glass gleaming like liquid starlight) is purposeful and filtered through urgency. The pedestal's structural weakness directly enables the retrieval, and the garden's transformation at the end (fountains spouting, coral brightening) charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    The infinite staircase constrains movement (steps vanish/reappear), the chipped die functions as talisman and differentiator, and the dice orbit charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (seventh loop, 14th loop, edge of step), and sensory detail ("ozone and regret," "metallic groan") is selective and purposeful. The setting directly enables the rupture action and the perpetual-motion outcome, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and vermilion/sapphire inks establish vivid sensory anchors. The brush's moon-tipped bristles and the lexicon *The Whispering Tongues of Forgotten Seas* are specific and tactile. The greenhouse functions as sanctuary and the smog as ambient menace, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics—the setting supports mood more than plot. The brush's weight and the moonlight slicing through grime charge the final image but do not shift Lila's options in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto city, waterfall mist, crystalline pool, and moss-carved arches are vividly rendered and establish atmosphere. However, setting remains largely scenic: the cave's dampness and chill are noted but do not force a tactical choice or alter the final image. The oven's heat at closure provides sensory contrast yet does not constrain Lila's decision to teach. Spatial choreography (cottage near hives, pool at the grotto's heart) is coherent but not leveraged for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rocky shore, hunger stone, lighthouse, and low tide are anchored early and vividly. The lighthouse beam merging with the stone's glow at the climax charges the setting, and the smooth stones revealing a path show environment shaping the protagonist's final move. Sensory selection is strong: "damp sand," "fog like a blade," mercury "shimmered." The micro-setting (yoyo chamber, cogs, copper wire) functions as tool-constrained action. Minor slip: the lighthouse's interior ("clocks hung on the walls") appears only in the final beat without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    The funhouse is vividly rendered with cracked mirrors, condensation, and twisted rooms that create atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent—Mara stands, steps, fumbles the book, reaches for the thread—and the cloak clasp is handled repeatedly, anchoring micro-setting to her body. The setting modestly constrains action (mirrors reflect the shadow, the labyrinth traps her inside) and the green luminance charges the climax image, lifting this into the mid-6s. Anchors are reused efficiently (mirrors, clasp, dictionary) without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and blue-hour sky are vivid and specific, grounding the piece in a tactile, precarious world. Sensory detail is purposeful: salt spray, kelp ropes, apples thudding, and the gong-like bark create a multi-sensory soundscape. The mallet's grooves and the lightning-scarred trunk are micro-setting elements that constrain Leeward's choices (angling the mallet, pivoting in the narrowed circle). Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image (the driftwood mosaic). The orchard's physicality shapes tactics and closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly rendered with tactile detail (grooves, brine, mud) and the shells' awakening directly charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the tunnel descent and emergence. The reed whistle and journal function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices (playing the pattern triggers the split; the journal redirects her understanding). One small slip: the watchers' physicality shifts without clear spatial logic ("forms shifting like dunes" then "silhouettes now sharp"), briefly muddying the stage picture at a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-choked station, rusted door, and tunnel symbols (rose, key, broken chain) are vivid and selective. The illuminated letters constrain Elara's investigative path and the rosebush's death marks a temporal boundary. The chamber's shelves and timeline T charge the final reveal. Micro-setting (stone bench, archway, tunnel walls) successfully guides choices and pressure without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "arches cradling murky water," the mosaic floor "cracked and veined with algae," the hidden hatch with "screaming" hinges. The setting constrains Elara's access (drawbridge risen, water depth) and supplies the chamber that triggers the climactic discovery. Sensory selection is strong—silt, algae, liquid amber light—and the environment charges the final image as she reaches shore. The inkwell functions as a micro-setting element, handled across multiple beats and reweighted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken library is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (bloated spines, bioluminescent algae, slick stairs) and constrains choice (the blackout forces alternative perception, the dry vault preserves the journal). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. The stamp's owl crest aligning with the door indentation is a micro-setting constraint that enables the vault opening. Minor deduction: "dappled resolve" as a visual descriptor is ornamental metaphor rather than concrete detail filtered through POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating island tea garden, bioluminescent moss, and workshop perch create a vivid, purposeful frame. The glass basilica's paradox (descends while ascending) is integrated into the grief-folding logic and charges the final image when its spires shed ascending stars. The gem and lantern constrain her method (polish until the stone weeps, capture light), and the workshop's lavender smoke and moonstone bowl anchor sensory particulars in her craft. Spatial choreography between workshop and tea garden below remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating observatory, glass floors, fractal veins, and smoldering crater are vivid and purposeful. The geode guides her "like a compass," the node's ozone/ash smell grounds the descent, and the final image (veins of light in the ground) charges her new path. Spatial choreography is clear (observatory above → spiral staircase down → vortex at node). The recurring crystal object constrains the hunt choice and charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate in principle, though the observatory's "labyrinthine corridors" are mentioned but never navigated, leaving one setup underused.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory's stone arches, rusted dome, niches, and Cassiopeia alignment are vivid and purposeful. The lever mechanism and light-beam niches constrain the climactic choice (pull to align), satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail is selective: "hum in the air," "chill of the stones," "fractal shadows." However, spatial choreography wobbles—Lira's grappling hook catches "a protruding bolt" at the dome's apex, but she then "pulled" a ground-level lever; the hook's function is never paid off. The "brilliant dimness" in the final paragraph is asserted but not woven through action.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt terrace, salt air, and beach setting are vivid and purposeful. The driftwood carvings constrain Elias's investigative method and charge the middle beats with tactile specificity (cedar sliver, split heart). The watch's coldness and the sand shifting beneath his feet anchor sensory perception to his emotional state. However, the terrace itself—signaled early and reprised at the end—remains more atmospheric frame than a constraint that alters his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The parapet, mist, and storm are vivid and mood-consistent. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (parapet → staircase → exchange ground → return). However, the environment does not constrain a choice during the exchange itself—the mist and storm frame atmosphere but do not alter tactics or options, keeping the setting one step from indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Coastal launch, kayak cockpit, lighthouse spiral stairs, and the compass as micro-object anchor the piece with purposeful specificity. The compass's scratched brass and fogged glass constrain meaning (each scratch as a regretted choice), and the lighthouse's skeletal tower half-swallowed by ivy provides a tactile goal. Sensory detail is selective: salt air, liquid mercury tide, waves slapping hull, tangerine and violet clouds. However, the utility poles as "land's bones" and navigational method remain vague—no distances, no sight-lines, no on-page demonstration of how Clara uses them to steer, which leaves a promised constraint unfulfilled and slightly generic in a piece that otherwise delivers vivid micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underground lake is vividly rendered—"moss that pulsed faintly blue," "liquid light where bioluminescent algae swirled like drowned stars"—and the descent through the bodega grate supplies concrete spatial anchors. The lake functions as more than backdrop: wading into it triggers the reflections that constitute the labyrinth, so setting enables the central revelation. However, the lake does not constrain a choice or force a tactical tradeoff; Mara observes rather than acts within the space, keeping the setting just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard's permanent moonlight, moonthorn petals, and phoenix ashes create a vivid, consistent sensory envelope. The spice-paste (cardamom, star anise, moonlit dew) functions as a tangible ritual object that Lira handles across beats, and the fox, owl, and willow-whispers deliver props (feather, obsidian shard) that ground the magic in physical exchange. The scent-based conjuring method and the moon-reflected pond charge the final image when the phoenix stands "ablaze with moonlight." Minor slip: spatial choreography of Lira's position (kneeling among blossoms, then undergoing metamorphosis) remains slightly vague, but the orchard's constraints shape her ritual choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered with moss, silver birch, and edges dissolving into mist, and the floating-island premise constrains the encounter. The saucer's crack and the tree's hourglass roots provide concrete focal points. The setting charges the final image (the path home through parting mist) and the glade's shuddering twice signals instability that pressures Elara's actions. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the fantastical elements. The body (shift snagging on bark) and recurring objects (cards, saucer, cloth) function as micro-setting that shapes beats and the ending, meeting the 9+ quick test's threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.6)
    The *Eirenicon* is vividly particular: patched asteroid metal, ghostly hum, hologram forests, bioluminescent garden beyond. Spatial choreography is clean (corridors, core, meditation chamber, door). The locket constrains the opening of the door, fulfilling the micro-setting test, and the garden charges the final image. Minor deductions: the ship's "breathing its last" shudder and systems rebooting feel mechanical rather than sensory; the meditation chamber's holograms serve backdrop more than tactical pressure. The gravitational quirk is mentioned but never alters movement or choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The black sand beach, smoking volcano, and slow-dancing stars provide vivid sensory anchors. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout—Lira at the tide line, the man crouched nearby, bugs swirling overhead. The glowing footprint constellation and warmer sand signal environmental response to her choice, giving the micro-setting some charge at closure. However, the volcano's "approving rumble" at the end edges toward pathetic fallacy rather than earned environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The luminous fort and Armory Tower are anchored early, and the sundial's bronze face and grooves matter to the puzzle. The blackout affects visibility but doesn't constrain choices—characters move freely and the puzzle proceeds unimpeded. The hidden chamber at the end supplies tools and scrolls but arrives too late to shape tactics; it's outcome rather than pressure. Micro-setting (quill holder, sundial slot) enables the climactic unlock, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff, frictionless water, and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors and constrain Lira's method (rocks must align with aurora shifts, eels hang suspended without friction). The aurora's color deepening to "bruise-purple" modulates with tension and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting actively shapes her tactical choices and participates in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-lit observatory is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (groaning iron ribs, rain-streaked viewport, lantern flame in draft). The darkroom timer and the envelope function as micro-setting elements that recur and constrain choice. The storm itself charges the final image ("let the storm kiss his wonder") and the observatory's isolation enables the vigil. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting's constraints—ash-clogged mask, cold aching scars—pressure Kael's physicality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass atrium, sundial floor, and brook are vivid and purposeful; the tin card's needle-hole projections charging the space elevate the setting beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography (épées, pedestal, sundial angles) remains clear throughout. The sundial's incomplete lines function as both arena and map, constraining movement and charging the closure image when Kael aligns the card with its angles. Sensory selection is strong (prismatic shadows, water trickling, gears whirring) and filtered through the duel's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted library with corrugated metal, cracked glass, and flickering bulbs supplies vivid sensory anchors. The tin's false bottom and hidden floorboard constrain Cedar's movements across multiple beats, and the moon's climb tracks time visibly. However, spatial choreography blurs when Cedar pulls the tin from his coat mid-scene after earlier establishing it's hidden beneath a floorboard—no on-page retrieval reconciles the contradiction, weakening micro-setting integrity at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arbor's glass ribs, flickering compasses, and the hidden room supply vivid spatial detail that constrains Clara's search and charges the final beat. The film projector and descending staircase offer tactile, goal-directed discovery. Sensory selection is strong—smudged glass, fogged lens, vibrating strings—and the arbor's constant hum threads through the piece. The setting's "tidal pulse" syncing with Clara's heartbeat risks overt symbolism but remains anchored in present perception. The micro-setting (piano bench latch, false bottom, narrow staircase) qualifies under the allowance and shapes the middle turn, elevating the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridge's "mosaic of color: violets bled into golds" and sensory anchors (jasmine, iron) are vivid and filtered through Lira's role. The seed's iridescent surface and the cavern's liquid-light pool constrain the peak beat and charge the closure attempt. However, spatial choreography inside the cavern (mirrors, pool, her kneeling position) floats without clear grounding, and the ridge itself functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure after the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The islet's breeze, damp earth, wet kelp, and cerulean horizon are vivid and filtered through Yorick's craft-focused attention. The lace—spools glowing faintly blue, intricate as antique linen—functions as both tool and micro-setting, shaping the middle sequence (stitching acknowledgment, admission, forgiveness) and charging the final image when it hangs on the studio wall. The shipwreck's barnacled hull and parted water ground the climax spatially. Minor slip: the studio's "wooden planks" and workbench are generic; more specific detail (grain, tool marks, wear) would deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and specific—collapsed panes, uprooted orchids, mold, silt-clogged drains—and consistently filters her attention as a scientist of slow catastrophe. Environmental details like dust settling in crevices and fungal growth are not ornamental; they function as her new “data,” effectively merging setting and methodology. The flood’s aftermath shapes what she can observe and what choices are available (she can’t return to a pristine lab world here). The ending shifts physically away to the symposium, so the greenhouse’s atmospheric pressure is slightly less present in the final image than it might be at a top level.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, frost, and glasswork are vividly rendered and filtered through Lirael’s artistic eye, producing a strong, coherent atmosphere (“bowl of indigo,” frost as prisms, fire-etched shard). Setting is not mere backdrop; the canyon’s frost enables the mapping method and the crevice constrains movement, while the chamber and shard are decisive loci of discovery. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with recurring motifs (frost, fire, glass) charging the final plan for the panels. It stops short of fully constraining her options in an inescapable way, but it does meaningfully shape how she finds meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The winterglass conservatory is a striking, integrated environment: ice-glazed panes, breath in cold air, and the behavior of the winterglass plants all shape atmosphere and the mechanics of her work. Setting is not a backdrop but an active participant—the glass transmits vibrations, the plants respond, and the cold reinforces both her trauma and the sense of a sealed laboratory-sanctuary. Professional/occupational detail (botanist, rare plants, tuning forks and sensors) is selective yet convincing, filtered through Lirael’s artistic lens. The final image of a conservatory “alive with invisible music” and then as “winterglass sanctuary” charges the environment thematically as well as physically.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater city library is vivid and specific—coral and rust, bioluminescent books, a dome half-buried in silt—and the setting coheres tonally with the story’s themes of drowning and preservation. The environment materially matters in that the lens’s function (underwater beacon) and the city’s magic sustaining Marisol are inseparable from place. It doesn’t much constrain moment-to-moment tactics (the repair work could largely occur anywhere), but it strongly charges the premise and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, sanctioned moon, and “amplified quiet” create a distinct, atmospheric setting that feels specific rather than generic. Sanctions, curfew, and the ridge location subtly constrain behavior (midnight runs, quiet gatherings), integrating world rules with action. The bell as an object-setting hybrid charges the space effectively, especially in its final, repurposed state. A bit more tactile interaction with the broader environment under pressure could have elevated the sense that place actively shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid, with the twilight viaduct, moss-slick path, and impossible flowers creating a strong, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s liminal concerns. The woods, lone tree, and still pool all feel of a piece with the tone and theme. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or introduces real complications; it is primarily a beautiful backdrop and metaphorical echo rather than an active pressure. The viaduct does usefully frame the story in the opening and closing, charging the final image somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The living bridge garden is vividly realized and integral: its pulsing vines, shifting planks, and impossible geometry aren’t backdrop but the mechanism by which time is accessed and then rewritten. Environmental changes track with plot turns (vines retract, paths stretch into infinity, bridge collapses and reforms), directly constraining and reflecting Elara’s actions. The recurring objects (bridge, bench, photographs) all charge the final image of stabilized, glowing photos. Setting is both atmosphere and engine here, with only minimal excess description.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center and piano bench are vivid, with concrete sensory details like dust, rusted cuffs, and the ghost of cotton candy. Setting integrates into action—the bench hides the stair, the carnival’s collapse explains scavengers—but the environment rarely constrains her tactics beyond being a disguise and an access point. The subterranean vault is sketched efficiently, with the iron-and-ivy door and glass vials carrying clear atmospheric charge. The final outside image (dry soil trembling, wall rubble) connects world and theme, though the physical mechanics of instant growth remain more poetic than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and highly specific—the sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, aurora, and underwater-forge all feel original and sensorially rich. Environmental elements are not just postcard detail: the shipwrecks supply the “absences,” the genetically modified trees provide the crucial root, and the forge is the operational heart of the climax. The aurora and rusted hulls charge the atmosphere with a coherent, eerie beauty that mirrors the thematic focus on memory and loss. This world feels both cohesive and functionally necessary to the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald station under golden sunset and then early night is vividly rendered; windows, clocks, the abandoned ticket office, and the guard’s rhythms all create a tactile, cinematic environment. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s professional eye (defenses, train schedules) and through the light-obsessed motif, so atmosphere and concept are tightly braided. The station’s devices (grate, pressure floor, guard) do shape her tactics, though the “emerald” quality itself remains mostly tonal rather than a concrete constraint. The recurring interplay of station light, jar glow, and sky at the end nicely charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned control room is vivid and sensorial—dripping meltwater, frost-choked circuitry, sun through shattered windows—with detail consistently filtered through Kael’s attention. Environment matters: the thaw itself enables discovery of the hidden compartment, and the room’s abandonment mirrors his thematic concerns with entropy and fracture. The recurring bookmark, handled in the light of the room, charges the final image. This is strong, economical worldbuilding that supports both mood and action.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “rusted library under stars” with labeled aisles and decaying scripts is vivid and thematically apt, echoing the idea of inherited scripts and roles. The child’s cast as a physical repository for the notes is a smart, specific use of environment. The setting does some light tactical work (shelves as cover, a script as a thrown distraction) but mostly operates atmospherically rather than as a hard constraint. Overall, it’s textured and purposeful, if not fully weaponized in the story’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fort, cliff, storm-remnant, and sea are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s perception of hush and erosion. Environmental details (groaning walls, skittering pebbles, the archway lee) feel lived-in and reinforce the theme of layered silences. The setting participates in tone and final imagery (map light in the cracks), though it seldom constrains concrete choices beyond providing a secluded, weathered space. Very strong atmosphere that stops just short of having true tactical bite.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight, rime-coated benches, and ice-frozen fountains create a vivid, coherent environment that supports the tone. The setting recurs at the end and is explicitly thematized as the locus of “mundane mysticism,” charging the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains action; it’s more an atmospheric stage than a force shaping choices. Still, the ice violin as an object-in-setting meaningfully bridges world and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystal whispering forecourt is vivid and functional: rain-slick stones, humming crystals, and the altered environment post-rain all shape mood and tactical movement. The crystals’ hum literally guides them and intensifies toward the climax, and the lens plus tickets operate as embedded tools/objects-as-setting. The final image of the forecourt “gleamed like a promise” and humming secrets ties environment tightly to thematic closure. A bit more non-visual sensory work could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The garden maze and algorithmic world of “measurable luck” are vividly and economically realized, with the maze’s shifts and sensors directly constraining tactics. Details like hedges that absorb light and the twisting trellis feel particular and thematically aligned with uncertainty and adaptation. The environment and the marbles as recurring objects both charge the final image of the maze blooming “because of” its wounds, which strongly supports the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The xenobiology station above ammonia clouds, lavender twilight, and the terrariums full of alien flora and winged creatures are vivid and integrated into moment-to-moment action. The environment participates in the conflict—the station shuddering, the creatures thrashing in their enclosures—but mostly as backdrop rather than a constraint that genuinely narrows options. Details are selective and on-tone (“icy warmth,” “muted lavender glow”), if occasionally edging toward decorative. Overall the setting feels specific, atmospheric, and coherent, even if it doesn’t fully bear thematic or tactical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered and meaningfully interactive: water affects movement and reveals the code, lanterns shape visibility, floating instruments and dripping pipes evolve with the action. Details are filtered through her musician’s sensibility (unstruck chords, timpani throbbing through the water), which deepens both mood and character. The environment charges the final image—the house “holding its breath” as she leaves—with a strong sense of place and expectation. A bit more constraint or danger from the flood itself could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain weather station, aurora, and village are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Lirael’s perceptions, with recurring details (wind, glass, bearberry) evolving in meaning. Environment isn’t postcard; isolation, structural fatigue, and thin soil all metaphorically and practically charge her choices and the final image. The aurora’s “sorrow” and the bearberry’s habitat in “cracks” elegantly link setting to theme without heavy-handedness. There’s room for one more concrete way the crumbling mountain constrains action, but the current integration is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned tunnel and underground chamber are vividly rendered with tactile, sensory detail (ivy, rusted rebar, condensation, blue light, colossal machinery), and these spaces concretely shape his actions (fitting the valve, descending the shaft, leaving the wheel as sentinel). The valve wheel functions as an object-as-setting, structurally and thematically charging the final image. Environmental mood (damp, echoing, humming) tightly supports the horror-industrial tone without overexplaining world rules. A slight ceiling comes from the relative lack of environmental constraint on his choices beyond “go deeper or not,” but what’s there is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: the overgrown library, bioluminescent fungi, black river, and catacomb-like veins are vividly rendered and filtered through the keeper’s sensibility. Environmental details are purposeful and tonally cohesive, supporting the themes of entropy and secrecy. The library and river images return at the end with reweighted meaning (the library now a “bridge,” the river gone but conceptually active). Still, the world mostly frames rather than constrains tactical choices; the setting could shape action slightly more to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sage Ridge, ancient oaks, “dreaming roots,” and the eclipse create a cohesive, gently enchanted atmosphere that supports the concept of ordinary magic. Details like dry leaves, moss-cloaked boulders, and the cello under the gnarled oak are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it clearly charges the ritual and the final walk down the ridge. The recurring “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” line works as a tonal frame rather than empty ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The reclaimed silo library is vividly realized—“steel ribs rusting into the earth,” “bronze quiet,” ash-filled hearth—and consistently filters through Elias’s sensibility as a historian of inanimate whispers. The environment is not mere backdrop: the steel walls are explicitly positioned as memory repositories, Clara’s ritual ties smoke to structure, and the final image depends on the silo resonating with released stories. Objects like the brass poker, railroad spikes, and medieval tapestry feel tactile and lived-in. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it deeply charges the atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lighthouse, storm, tunnel, and hidden chamber are vividly rendered and tonally integrated, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The environment is more than decorative—its isolation plausibly enables covert operations and the flare and ferry visually charge the ending. That said, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces difficult choices; she encounters no logistical or physical resistance from the environment. The specificity is strong, but its functional pressure on the story’s stakes is moderate rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is striking and specific—the velvet-lined paradox room, shifting labyrinth floor, and the dimensional anchor all feel concrete and integrated with the action. Environment and objects (anchor, console, void, indigo paint) don’t just decorate; they directly constrain and enable choices, especially in the climax when circuits are revealed and the void is “painted” into equilibrium. World rules are surreal but internally consistent and learned through use. The final image of touching the void with the indigo brush charges both setting and theme.

    The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the core imagery of reflection, duality, and the “mirrored horizon.” The nautilus, prismatic light, visible breath, and still surface all feel selected through Lirael’s sensibility rather than as tourist catalog. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, it does charge the final image and the thematic stakes about time and reflection. Sensory detail is rich but not so dense as to obscure action.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is vivid and atmospheric, and the return to it at the end gives the final image a satisfying echo; the childhood alley shard also lands clearly. However, the environment mostly frames rather than constrains action: Mara’s choices are inward and temporal, not meaningfully limited by the physical space. The “darkening brightness” motif ties setting to theme nicely, but the world rules of this place remain more impressionistic than fully particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drum maker’s cavern, hides, brass horn, and seasonal air build a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that matches the story’s preoccupation with vibration and hush. Details are filtered through Lila’s tactile and vibrational priorities, which suits a deaf music teacher and avoids generic scenic cataloguing. The environment subtly participates in the action—the drums vibrating in sympathy, the mirrored hush, the seasonal threshold at the cavern’s entrance—though it rarely hard-constrains choice. The recurring objects (phonograph, horn, drum) effectively charge the final images, even if they don’t quite reach the level of physically shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The courtyard, fog, rooftop, and dead-lit quarantine patch create a coherent, atmospheric world that feels specific to a weather-obsessed protagonist. Details like ash instead of rain and the storm recorder as a tool integrate environment with plot rather than sitting as backdrop. The courtyard’s return at the end—now morally reweighted—nicely charges the final image. A bit more interaction with the environment under duress could have pushed this into truly standout territory.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants is vivid and sensorially rich—prismatic light, relic flowers, ultraviolet panels—and the city’s smellscape at the end nicely mirrors and softens the opening tension around scent. Details are generally filtered through Lirael’s olfactory focus, which suits her character. The environment underpins theme and mood more than it constrains choice; the greenhouse could press more concretely on what she can or can’t do. Still, the setting is integrated and memorable, not a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto and star-lit sky are vivid and sensorial, with strong, selective details (“baked by centuries of sun,” walls peeling to constellations) that mirror Kael’s inner state. The setting integrates with action—the walls display his symbols, the grotto becomes a kind of loom or canvas—but it doesn’t quite constrain his physical options so much as frame his realization. The recurring rope as a tactile object meaningfully charges the final image. Overall atmosphere is rich and coherent, just shy of using environment as a true tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is memorable, sensorially rich, and thematically apt. Environmental details (glass acoustics, humidity, salt, ship hulls) are woven into the action and directly shape the sound and atmosphere of Lira’s performance. The burned rainforest and harbor create a coherent post-catastrophe world without clunky exposition. The greenhouse/bowl/fire triad also charges the final image, grounding the abstract theme in concrete place.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber grotto and its static, translucent walls are vivid and sensorial, with professional detail (orchid under unique electromagnetic field, blotter petal) filtered through Elias’s occupational eye. Setting is tightly integrated with his method—he literally “reads” the air’s charge—and the amber light and waning static subtly mirror the opening and closing of his work window. That said, the environment rarely constrains choice or creates obstacles; it’s more a beautifully rendered stage than an active pressure. The final image of the humming grotto and cased petal is resonant but not fully weaponized against the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The harbor town, breezy library, and salt-tinged night are vivid and selective, with details like the ceiling fan and toddler’s encyclopedia tower giving the space personality. The recurring objects (locket photo, shells, ledger, fan) link atmosphere to theme effectively. Setting lightly shapes events—the fan delivers the envelope; the library becomes the social bridge—but it doesn’t strongly constrain choices or tactics. Still, the seaside/library milieu feels lived-in rather than generic, and it supports the story’s gentle, reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystalline orchard and crater are vividly imagined and consistently filtered through Kael’s sensibility, with glass trees, prismatic branches, and liquid light integrating atmosphere and theme. The obsidian arbor and the way light bends at the crater edge both recur and charge the final image, giving the setting more than postcard value. However, the environment mostly frames rather than constrains action; Kael’s tactics don’t significantly depend on physical limits imposed by this world. Still, the specificity and coherence of the place are well above average.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop canal system, moss-crusted stones, suspended raindrops, and the shimmering tunnel are vivid and specific, with details filtered through Lila’s illustrator sensibility. The environment does more than decorate: the canals’ pulsing and fissure are the gateway to the core event, and the pendant functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. However, the physical rooftop and city don’t significantly constrain her choices beyond providing a vantage and portal; they’re richly imagined but not fully weaponized against her. Still, atmosphere and world-building are strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern orchard, stalactites, mineral-fed soil, and starlit fruit are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Setting is not just backdrop: the dripping water, shifting stones, and orchard thriving on chaos are explicitly tied to her final realization about emotion and loss. The mosaic stone and its fractures function as a micro-setting tool that directly shapes tactics and charges the final image. A slight excess of descriptive richness in calmer beats is the only minor drag, but it does not blur spatial or emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library is richly realized: stained glass, dust-capped books, crawl spaces, pipe chases, and the mildew-and-oil basement all feel tactile and lived-in. Setting is filtered through Mara’s expertise—she moves with practiced precision, which deepens credibility. Environment shapes options (she must navigate pipe chases, pry a grille, hide the decoder in an alcove) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The atmosphere is controlled and consistent, though the outage and city beyond remain more tonal than truly constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: mossy trellis, glass greenhouses, steam, wet soil, and storm season all feel tactile and lived-in. Details are filtered through Eleanor’s botanical sensibility, which sharpens specificity (e.g., focus on the linden and hellebore). Weather and moisture subtly underpin the theme of transformation by making the explosive vine growth and plant behavior plausible. The environment more charges the final image than constrains choices, but it does so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal island is vivid and specific—the salt-bleached cliffs, rusted debris from the water wars, the converted lighthouse, and the rain-carved rivers all feel lived-in and tactile. Environment meaningfully shapes action (following the rain trails to the island’s heart) and reappears conceptually in the final painting of the island as a bridge rather than a tomb. Details are filtered through Marin’s artistic eye, keeping the description purposeful rather than touristic. The setting strongly supports mood and theme, though it could constrain late-stage choices a bit more directly for top-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered through multi-sensory detail—sound, light, texture—and never feels like postcard description. Setting is tightly integrated with action: the cave’s song and light react to the pilgrim, flare and fracture with the pearl, and settle into a new configuration that charges the final image. World rules (crystals singing, cave as living thing) are consistent and learned through what changes during the scene. The cave clearly constrains and expresses the stakes, though a hair more use of physical constraints (e.g., terrain affecting movement) would push this toward absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ivory harbor after rain, with its glistening arches, cobblestones, and specific sites (lighthouse cottage, eastern quay, central plaza), is vivid and coherently sustained. Details are filtered through Lirael’s archivist sensibility, and the recurring image of the polished statue and the harbor’s physical emptiness effectively mirror the thematic “absences.” The trumpet valve as an object is strongly situated in place, especially at thresholds and public loci. While the environment doesn’t deeply constrain choices, it does charge the images and supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vault beneath the clocktower, condensation-slick walls, mist “like the breath of a sleeping giant,” and stained-glass dome all create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: the cracks in the pavement, the hidden wall, and the staircase physically structure his choices. The environment mirrors the piece’s liminal theme without tipping into heavy-handed symbolism. While the setting charges the journey and tools, it doesn’t fully constrain a hard choice at the end, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stargazer’s tower, cliff, and whale migration are vividly drawn and anchored early, with tactile and auditory details that feel filtered through Clara’s priorities. The environment functions as more than backdrop—the isolation, exposure, and whales’ songs all mirror and modulate her internal state, culminating in the final image of breaching whales against the moon. The recurring sea/sky/whale imagery charges the ending without feeling overexplained. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it meaningfully shapes mood and thematic valence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prismatic escondite, warped geometry, ozone-metal air, and neon-streaked void are vivid and sensory, with consistent world rules (solar storm → spatial anomalies). Setting details are filtered through Kael’s perceptions and often mirror his state (fractured rainbow / fractured time, hollow self in mirrors). However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond mood and cosmological mechanism; they don’t have to navigate it in a way that alters options. Even so, the place is distinct and its collapse meaningfully charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    The funeral home prep room is efficiently evoked—“smelled of lilies and ironed linen,” dummy casket, mahogany, fluorescent lights—and the sensory palette is brisk and apt. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting/object anchor that recurs and colors the final image. However, the room itself rarely constrains tactics; aside from the hiding place and the fake-body reveal, the environment doesn’t evolve or apply much pressure. The setting feels vivid but somewhat interchangeable for the core negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop setting are vividly and specifically rendered; details like mineral-rich soil, refracted mist, and the salvaged observatory lamp create a coherent, atmospheric world. The environment is filtered through Althea’s sensibility as a stationer and collector of textures, which deepens tone rather than reading like a tourist catalog. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices or behavior—it frames, rather than pressures, the action—so it stops short of charging the closure in a decisive way. Still, as atmosphere and specificity, it’s strong enough for publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The port-city container labyrinth is exceptionally vivid, with concrete sensory detail (“salt tang,” “flaking paint,” “tide hissed against the pylons”) and evolving weather that alters the physical situation. The environment meaningfully constrains action: tiers flood, ladders must be climbed, shadows and shifting containers create risk and cover. The recurring physical world (containers, harbor, tide) also mirrors his interior erasure/fragmentation without becoming heavy-handed allegory. At this length, the setting feels lived-in and integral rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, cliff, dying sun, and interior props (control panel, half-finished cello, journals, dome) are all concretely rendered and consistently filtered through Lira’s attention. Objects-as-setting (shell, cello, dials) meaningfully charge the atmosphere and final image rather than serving as mere décor. The dome creaking open to reveal a star-thick sky at the end cleanly ties environment to thematic resolution. The physical setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it does shape tone and the logic of the experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The raft city carnival is vividly evoked through selective, sensory detail (“fried dough and diesel,” “gilded barge,” Alley of Whispers) and is consistently filtered through Lira’s organizing mind. Setting elements meaningfully interact with action—the graffiti network is embedded in walls and hulls, the Alley becomes the tactical hub, and the barge’s arrival physically stages class/power dynamics. The foundation stone chip as a recurring object charges both the campaign and the final image, tying place to history. The floating aspect is more atmospheric than constraining, but the environment overall feels specific and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lunar summit is rendered with strong, selective detail—“glow of her suit’s headlamp carving a silver path through the dust,” Earth’s pale crescent, the fresh crater—firmly anchoring place and mood. Setting meaningfully constrains action: the airless cold, dawn angle, and crater geography all matter to timing and to the vial’s operation. The recurring objects (visor, vial, camera, Earth on the horizon) charge the final images rather than feeling like set dressing. A bit more non-visual sensory grounding could push this higher, but what’s here is purposeful and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The misty rail depot, anchor lift, and water basin are vivid, tactile, and well-integrated into Lira’s way of perceiving, with strong specificity (braille tool belt, prismatic hues on the walls). The basin in particular functions as a charged object-as-setting, constraining her diagnostic method and returning in the final image. Weather and industrial machinery shape tone more than tactics, but they are consistently threaded through action rather than as a static backdrop. This is high-level atmospheric work, just shy of the very top because the environment doesn’t significantly alter her options beyond the basin’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen lake, rusted outpost, and pitted plateau are vivid and tonally unified, with specific, tactile details (pine-resin cigarette, hissing stove, glowing “veins of liquid fire”). Environment clearly shapes action—travel requires snowshoes and camp, the ice must be chipped to reach the light, and the cold nearly kills her. Recurring condensation and frost patterns effectively carry mood and motif, especially when echoed in the final scene. The setting could constrain choices even more in the discovery beat, but as-is it feels lived-in and integral rather than postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich: the archway, cracked cobblestones, frozen clock, weed-choked fountain, and rusted bell all contribute to a strong atmosphere. Details feel filtered through Kael’s sound-conscious perspective, with emphasis on hums, thrums, and footsteps. Environmental elements evolve meaningfully—the town physically rearranges as rhythm returns—but they seldom constrain hard choices. This is excellent scene-building and mood work, just shy of using environment as a true tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater temple and Blackroot Ocean are vividly rendered—algae-slick stone, bioluminescent dome fragments, pressure through the fissure—and consistently filtered through Mara’s urgent perception. The environment constrains choices (having to cling to the archway, squeeze through the jagged fissure, race the storm) rather than serving as mere backdrop. World rules about sound-trapping architecture and the hush’s physicality stay consistent and are revealed via action. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment during the climax could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse prison on the jagged reef is vividly realized—“skeleton of stone and regret,” copperlight seeping like old blood, confessional lattices lining the chamber—and these details are tightly filtered through Elias’s perception. The environment meaningfully shapes mood and possibilities: the labyrinthine prison, the threat of the tide, and the ascent to the lighthouse peak all echo his internal navigation of guilt and legacy. The recurring objects-as-setting (lattice, scuffed door, reef below) charge the final images with accumulated significance. Physical constraint is more atmospheric than tactical, but the setting’s imaginative specificity is strong enough for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and winter-cracked fields are strikingly specific and atmospheric, with details like crystalline fruits, endless night, and rune-etched glass deeply integrated into mood and meaning. The environment directly shapes the premise (prison/sanctuary, time trap) and the resolution (night shattering into dawn, fields blooming), so setting clearly charges the final image. World rules around the orchard and bead are sketched through action rather than dense exposition, keeping things legible. A bit more tactile interaction from Elara with the space under pressure could further tighten the link between environment and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon labyrinth, red stone, and tide pools are vividly rendered and filtered through Lira’s sensibility, creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. Environmental details like the murals, pulsing walls, and skyless canyon support the sacred/ruined thematic contrast. The setting does shape some options (twisting corridors, absence of sky, the central pedestal), but it’s more evocative than constraining in tactical terms.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The catacomb orchard with bones and roots is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lirael’s perceptions, creating a strong, eerie-sacred atmosphere. Setting isn’t just decorative: roots impede and then guide, the tomb’s architecture (sun-hole, pedestal) constrains where the sundial must go, and the orchard becomes the public stage at the end. Sensory detail (damp earth, old incense, myrrh) is well-chosen rather than exhaustive. The environment clearly charges the final image of her kneeling at the glowing shrine amid this bone-root landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The golden arcade is vividly realized and integrated: glass ceiling, vendors, AI walls, and the 21st-century fountain all feel textured and specific rather than postcard-like. Crucially, setting isn’t just backdrop—the arcade’s “heart” (the fountain) literally conceals the chip and thus constrains where the solution can be found, and the arcade-as-archive reframes the entire environment by the end. Details like chalk traces under stalls and solar-gel water elegantly merge atmosphere with worldbuilding. A bit more non-visual sensory texture under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the cobalt observatory, frosted windows, autumn wind, and the eternal candle all feel specific and lived-in. The candle in particular operates as an object-as-setting, constraining action (sacred, carefully moved) and charging the final synchronizing image. Environmental details are integrated with character perception, not dumped, and the mood of chill, star-haunted isolation supports the themes of secrecy and revelation. It narrowly misses a higher band because the observatory itself doesn’t significantly limit or force tactical choices beyond being a picturesque container.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth, clawing roots, spirits’ songs, and condensation on leaves create a rich, immersive atmosphere tightly aligned with the story’s emotional concerns. Environmental details are specific and filtered through Lirael’s sensibility, with the labyrinth’s shifting roots and moonlit waters echoing internal movement. The shard’s glow seeping into soil and its smoothing across time charge the final images. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices beyond tone and method, but it deeply charges the mood and thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-clad atrium, moss-stained bench, and ruined reef/aquarium imagery create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors Lira’s internal state. The brain coral fragment functions effectively as a micro-setting object, recurring and charging the final image at the negotiating table and in her open palm. Environmental details are selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic. The atrium and mist, however, remain mostly tonal rather than materially constraining her options, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard and pervasive fog are richly realized and threaded through nearly every paragraph, shaping tone and meaning (the fog as amnesiac force, the greenhouse as fragile studio). Details like encrypted notes in hollow trees, skeletal peach groves, and light cast on damp walls feel both specific and thematically loaded. Environment isn’t just backdrop; the thinning fog at the climax and the reclaimed carnival history charge the final reconfiguration of place. While the setting constrains mood more than physical choices, it’s deeply integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly imagined and consistently filtered through Marisol’s professional eye—“crushed minerals and dreams,” “wind chime shaped like a fractal,” cracks that “shimmer” as if breathing. The environment and tools (concave dish, fractal chime, mural) are not postcard details; they actively enable the reflected-sound method and charge the final image of the garden as a mental/experiential space. World rules about sound becoming tangible are sketched economically but feel coherent within the piece’s fabulist logic. The recurring nickel and mural effectively function as micro-settings that constrain and frame her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: tarantula, moths, orchids, jars, and flytraps all contribute to tone and to plot (the pheromone test, moth arrow, secret door). The later community garden shard feels slightly less textured but still grounded and functional. Environmental details are filtered through a character with scientific and poetic bias, which sharpens specificity. The setting charges the final image—the bioluminescent garden as public language—though it could constrain choice even more tightly to push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gargantuan shell, Coral Abyss, glowing moss, and off-key wind create a striking, coherent environment that’s filtered through Lira’s sensibility. Setting images (moss, shell migration, wind songs) recur and charge the ending, where the tree and wind-borne song feel like natural outgrowths of the world. While the environment mostly supports tone and theme rather than tightly constraining physical choices, it is specific and memorable enough that the story would collapse without it. Description is lush but remains intelligible and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal library above the clouds, stained-glass shelves, glass-orchids, and auroras together create a vivid, integrated environment that feels inseparable from the story’s mood and premise. Setting details are filtered through Lirael’s caretaking priorities (humidity, resonance, tools) rather than as a static tour. The bamboo tube, orchids, and museum depths all charge the final images (rainbows, humming library, rising nameless emotion). The environment subtly constrains choices—the extinct bamboo source, suspended chime, and fragile archive all inform what repair is possible and at what conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The extinct language archive is vividly evoked—the “mothball-scented vault,” brittle parchments, and restricted section create a strong, coherent atmosphere tied to Elara’s vocation. Details like the glass ink well and runes are well-chosen and recur in the ending image, charging the final moment. The environment does shape options (Henrik, the key, the restricted manuscript), though it rarely constrains her in a way that forces tactical adaptation. Overall, the setting is specific and lived-in, firmly supporting tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The breathing dormant volcano and crumbling amphitheater are vividly drawn and filtered through Lira’s geologic/mechanical sensibility, with nice touches like molten-red stone and volcanic rivers straining against floodgates. The environment’s rules stay consistent and the recurring “breath” motif effectively mirrors the tension between dormancy and latent danger. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices; it’s more symbolic canvas than active pressure on her tactics. Even so, the surveyor’s chain as a tool within this environment helps charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The attic and skylight are vividly rendered—old paper, wood polish, dust “like tiny galaxies”—and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: it provides the pigeons, the ledgers, the journals, and the dust motes that become his decoding medium. The attic’s transformation into a “sanctuary” during the song and then a place he must physically depart from gives the space emotional charge in the final beats. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain options in a practical sense, it meaningfully shapes perception and the symbolic logic of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: the drifting prism terrace, shifting light, warped railing, cornfield patterns, and “fractured hush” all feel tactile and imagistic. Environment directly affects choice—the prisms briefly align to reveal a hidden path, the grain patterns guide her navigation, and the maze’s heart and lingering hush charge the final image. Details are filtered through Lira’s trained eye (grain, weather codes, compass-like stalks), giving the world a strong POV bias rather than a tourist catalog. The only thing keeping this from an even higher score is that the physics and rules of the drifting terrace remain suggestively vague rather than fully exploited as constraints on possible tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater research city is vividly realized—pressure of the sea, bioluminescent flora, decaying corridors—and consistently filtered through Mara’s attention to light and rhythm. Setting is integral to the premise: the phenomena and the sense of isolation could not simply be transplanted to a generic lab without major changes. The burnt feather and the underwater “constellations” function as charged micro-settings that color the final image. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain practical choices, but it strongly shapes tone, stakes, and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The iridescent cave / crystal geode is richly and consistently realized, with details like crater glass, bioluminescent walls, moss-carpeted alcove, and the pool of liquid light all integrated into action rather than static description. The setting does real work: the labyrinthine tunnels and “unremembered” dead ends encode the central mystery, and the geode’s heart and pool constrain how Lira can seek answers. Environmental shifts (light turning golden, walls humming) mirror and charge her discoveries without feeling purely decorative. The final image in the pool of liquid light effectively fuses environment and theme, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade is vividly evoked—salt in the cobblestones, flickering neon, mechanized clown, fountain at the heart—and these details are filtered through Lira’s strategic eye. Setting isn’t just decorative: the fountain is a spatial target for her coded melody, the clown mirrors her thematic concern with breaking loops, and the ocean’s “breath” underpins the idea of patterned chaos. The bishop-as-object and fountain light flare both charge the final third. This is near–publishable-level environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight garden under stars, luminescent mist, and pulsing moss are richly imagined and consistently tied to her body and actions, with details like the moss as a “second heartbeat” and mist thickening as pressure rises. World rules (nostalgia ban, cosmic verse, Archive) are sketched efficiently and feel coherent with the environment’s texture. The setting meaningfully shapes the action—the garden as liminal space where she can dance, fracture reality, and test the ban—rather than serving as mere backdrop. The final image of her at the garden’s edge, where twilight turns to night, nicely charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bay, mist, dawn light, and the “prism atrium” are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail and a coherent mood. The setting feels lived-in and tailored to Elara’s vocation, with light and glass-inflected perception shaping what she notices. While the environment frames her ritual beautifully, it rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it’s more canvas than active pressure. Strong atmosphere and specificity lift this above average but short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ridge, frost, forest, and moonlight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a firefighter and a haunted son. The recurring environment (ridge as threshold, forest as once-enemy now resilient) meaningfully mirrors the internal arc and charges the ending image of him walking downslope. The porcelain box and hourglass function as micro-settings/objects that strongly shape mood and closure, especially in the last reveal of the moving sand. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, it is thematically and atmospherically integral.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto is vividly rendered—bioluminescent algae, tide-polished stone, mercury-like pools—and these details are viewpoint-filtered rather than touristic. Environment and objects (stalactites for anchoring, air currents, algae brightening/dimming) are not just backdrop but interact with her actions and discoveries. The final image of the grotto’s mouth “like a mouth about to speak,” tied to her listening, recharges the setting in a thematically charged way. A touch more direct constraint (e.g., a limitation imposed by the grotto’s physics) would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly realized—the ivy, damp stone, moss, ash, and climate-shifted world all feel specific and sensorially grounded. Environment is not just wallpaper: the fireplace and ivy literally hide and then reveal diaries and the alcove, and the climate-shifted context informs the walls’ “fear of the heat” and makes the burning of the strip thematically charged. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the passage’s throat/food metaphor entwines setting with existential stakes. This is publishable-level atmosphere, just shy of exemplary because the climate dimension could constrain present-tense choices even more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and selective—wet stone, jasmine, prism parapet, echoing terrace, bells—and consistently filtered through Lirael’s sensory and artistic attention. Environmental elements interact with action (sound refracting in glass, echoing bells disrupting her song, damp slick surfaces), not just postcard description. The recurring parapet and terrace atmosphere charge the final image even if they don’t tightly constrain choices. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The terrace, statues, volcanic stone, and celestial imagery create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and details are filtered through Elara’s perspective in a way that supports tone and theme. The statues’ “sorrow and serenity” and the clipboard’s tactile history effectively mirror the tension between war and fragile peace. While the setting does not strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges the final image as she descends under the statues’ “silent vigil,” tying environment to the cost and continuity of conflict. The balance between description and action stays mostly economical and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The salt flat, cracked riverbed, thunder, and later storm are vividly rendered and strongly atmospheric, with the map and salt physically interacting with his actions. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options but does charge the symbolism of drought, erasure, and artificial control. The storm’s final dissolution of the egg and the yellowed map in his office both tie setting into the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and mostly filtered through his worldview, avoiding tourist-list description.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered and woven into both mood and action (snow crunching as rhythm, refracted shadows echoing her fractured intent). Setting details feel chosen rather than generic, and the environment’s tone—cold, luminous, empty—supports the thematic defiance against a larger, unseen city. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain her tactical options, the sanctuary itself is a functional object-location hybrid that frames and focuses her goal. The final image of falling snow as “quiet defiance” gives the setting a thematic charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vividly drawn—the “rusted crown,” skeletal ribs, and curved wall all support the spectral, liminal mood and justify the projection effects. Details like the ribs “fracturing” light and the dome’s isolation echo the thematic concern with half-truths and fractured narratives. However, beyond atmosphere and projection surface, the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices or tactics in the conflict. The setting feels integral to tone and image, less so to concrete decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto above the clouds is vividly rendered—mist like spun sugar, moss, peach-and-lavender clouds—and consistently filtered through Lirael’s contemplative gaze. Setting supports tone and theme: an elevated, secluded, almost liminal space where small lives and vast sky coexist, mirroring her focus on invisible threads. Environmental details are woven into action (knees in moss, spider silk, the sky through which the monarch travels) rather than offered as static postcard description. While the grotto does not strongly constrain her tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image of her walking home through this quiet, secretive world.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The icebound sanctum, glacial stone, aurora, and mosaic of names are vividly imagined and integrated into Kael’s perception, not just listed. The environment participates in key beats—the ice “listening,” the beam piercing the ceiling, the aurora fracturing—which charges the final image. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful, with snowmelt, iron, and light all echoing the memory theme. It remains more atmospheric than constraining; the setting deepens mood and theme more than it limits or alters concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest are vivid and sensorial, with weather, vines, and concrete decay all mirroring the directive’s erosion and the theme of renewal. Details like the candle, bergamot-and-iron scent, and vines glowing emerald under storm light feel specific and lived-in. The environment subtly shapes the story’s logic (this is a place of old science and new wilderness) and charges the final image of the ruins and buried seal. It rarely constrains choice in a tactical sense, which keeps it just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The palace is vividly and economically realized—the “dusky harmony,” amber/violet sky, bioluminescent chamber, and desert wind are all well-chosen and sensorially concrete. Details are filtered through Elara’s mind as an astronomer and rationalist noticing star-eyed gods and number tiles, which keeps the setting from feeling like a generic ruin. The environment shapes mood and theme more than concrete tactics; apart from the physical presence of panels and corridors, the palace doesn’t significantly constrain choices. Still, the setting’s atmosphere clearly charges the final image of her emerging into twilight, tile in satchel.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “soundless sanctuary” is vividly and economically drawn—the velvet-lined walls and devouring silence give a clear, atmospheric sense of place. Silence as a mirror for inner noise conceptually fits the theme and slightly charges the rituals. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces choices; it mostly serves as tonal backdrop rather than an active pressure. The music box and pin function as a kind of micro-setting around which action coheres, but the sanctuary itself could be swapped for another quiet room with modest rewrites.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ruined orchard district, fog, frost, and glass imagery are vivid and tightly integrated into the story’s dreamlike, liminal atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Elias’s craft sensibility (mirrors, glass, frost-shimmer) and becomes operative in the ritual: the mirrors hung in a circle and the frost-glow participate in opening the path. The final return to the district “holding its breath” and twilight frost shimmering ties environment directly into the charged closing image. The one limitation is that the district constrains mood more than concrete tactical options, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lira’s tactile engagement (climbing branches, moss nests, rafters creaking). The environment is not just backdrop: the vertical orchard and abandoned cathedral physically frame her work and symbolically echo the breach and reclamation. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of the glowing quartz eye within the rafters’ orchard, even if it doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices. Sensory range is good, with a slight lean toward visual and atmospheric description over other senses.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The astral orchard, pulsating soil, waterfall of liquid light, and infinite library are vivid, sensorially rich, and consistently filtered through Elara’s curatorial, pattern-seeking gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop: the orchard supplies the key object, the grotto substitutes for her “restroom” thinking space, and the final tree literally receives the cameo and defines closure. World rules (nonlinear inheritance manifesting as parallel cameos and timelines) feel cohesive within the surreal frame. A slightly tighter link between the asteroid’s physical isolation and her personal risk could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain-bookstore and its sentient shelves are vivid and functional: spiders, shifting aisles, black-velvet “Silence” volumes, and the floating, infinite Library all shape what Elara can do. Details are filtered through her expertise, so language and books feel like tools and hazards rather than postcard scenery. The environment does constrain her tactics (navigating by touch, counter-charms, tactile reading), and the final chamber’s vastness suits the conceptual stakes. It stops short of 9-band because the setting does not explicitly charge the final image with a concrete, new constraint or cost beyond mood and scale.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship in fog, rusted rides, and the nameplate chamber create a strong, specific atmosphere that’s thematically aligned with forgotten stories. Environmental details like the sewn-into-walls journal and vanishing ship integrate with plot and closure rather than sitting as décor. The shift to the sunlit meadow is clear and meaningful, reweighting the earlier decay. Still, the setting rarely constrains tactics or introduces concrete hazards; it shapes meaning more than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered—gears, pendulums, vibrations, and sparks create a tactile, atmospheric space that feels lived-in and particular. The setting participates in the action (gears slowing, jamming, showering sparks) and metaphorically mirrors the temporal/archival stakes. The corridor and circular chamber are more archetypal but still serviceable, with the pedestal and single scroll focusing attention. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain her choices, but it does charge the images and supports the story’s temporal and mechanical themes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harmonic caves are vividly realized and tightly integrated: sound behaves like light, echoes fossilize in ice, and the environment directly dictates the method of problem-solving (reading cracks, locating the whisper’s coil). The echoing, humming, and static aren’t mere décor; they generate pressure and frame every choice. Objects-as-setting—the echo stone, the ice wall, the spiral—constrain action and charge the final image of a “duet of hush and hum.” Description occasionally verges on lush, but it remains purposeful and coherent with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass pavilion, its fractured panes, storm wind, and humming walls are vivid, tactile, and integrated with action (moonlight through the shard to the apex, vibrations that shatter the hush). The setting meaningfully constrains and enables choice: the mosaic, apex, and architecture shape how rekindling is even possible. World detail (poisoned seas, vanished stars, void of silence) conjures atmosphere efficiently without bloating exposition. The environment also charges the final image, where the pavilion’s song becomes a literal and symbolic beacon to survivors.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: solid fog, stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and shadows all serve the memory/identity premise instead of being mere scenery. Environmental elements constrain and color her actions (the fog’s density, the cracking sky, the humming crystal surface) and charge the final image of lingering hum after evaporation. The world rules around “memory’s breath” and crystal resonance feel internally consistent and learned through her work rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: fire-lilies, liquid light fountains, and a starless sky create a strong atmospheric and sensory signature. Details are filtered through Lira’s craft-minded eye, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The fortress and its lilies are not mere backdrop; the chamber and its dormant blooms directly shape her options and the final image. A slight tendency toward lush description for its own sake keeps this just shy of the very top tier, but the world feels integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto, tide, and starlight are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail that feels filtered through a professional observer of tidal pools. The environment is not just backdrop; it mirrors and gently pressures choices—this is her liminal refuge, and the turning tide and cicada on the rock charge the final image. The jade cicada functions as an object-as-setting anchor that meaningfully frames the theme of metamorphosis and “transition periods.” It stops short of directly constraining physical options, which keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bunker and the xenial trellis are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory contrast between metallic, clanging silence and honeyed, “almost edible” quiet. The inversion gravity and trellis above the clouds are not just backdrop but actively shape what’s possible (floating ascent, doll drifting away, sprout through the floor). The recurring environmental details (metal wall, hatch, vines, crack in the floor) all tie into the final image. World rules are simple yet consistent, supporting mood and theme without overexposition.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drifting prism terrace, canals, and crystal/obsidian architecture are vivid, specific, and tonally cohesive, with details like “towers of crystal and obsidian that refracted the moonlight into liquid fractals” doing real atmospheric work. The storm glass and gondola are meaningfully embedded tools rather than wallpaper. However, the environment rarely constrains options or forces tactical choices; it serves more as lush backdrop and thematic mirror than as an active pressure. Strongly rendered, but just shy of using setting as a true structural lever.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful—kaleidoscopic waterfall, bioluminescent pears, murals, and the spiral staircase all emerge in direct relation to Lira’s actions. Environmental details (the waterfall veil, the hollow tree, shifting sky colors) are not postcard extras; they gate access, signal time, and embody the story’s liminal, sacred atmosphere. The recurring ruby/glow motif ties world-building to the final image without over-explaining. A slight limitation is that the environment rarely constrains tactics in a way that forces hard choices; it serves more as enchanted scaffolding than as active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sanctuary is vivid and specific—ashen charcoal, old smoke, starlight—and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception. The threshold and doorknocker are not mere décor; they constrain options, physically mark the boundary Kael hesitates at, and charge the final image. Environmental reactions (the sanctuary shuddering, the threshold pulsing like a heartbeat) tie setting directly to emotional and metaphysical stakes. Description is economical yet atmospheric, supporting tone and theme without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and geodesic dome are richly imagined and consistently used, not just as backdrop but as mechanism (mushrooms absorbing concepts, spores crystallizing into diamonds). The submarine porthole bolt and the dome’s pressure systems directly constrain Mara’s choice and shape the final image, satisfying the “object-as-setting” gate. Sensory detail is sharp (cobalt and violet canopies, fluorescent pollen, condensation-slick metal) and filtered plausibly through a working mycologist. A slight sense of safety—environment recovers with no apparent physical cost—keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, and gramophone are vividly rendered and filtered through Lirael’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment is not just scenic: the specific desk, horn, and sound behavior of the room directly enable the hidden-compartment mechanism and thus the plot. The recurring visual palette (sepia, gold, shadow) meaningfully shifts from tomb-like to cradle-like by the end, charging the final image. It stops just short of 9-band because the setting shapes options primarily through a single device rather than pervasive constraint on her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: greenhouse glass, moon-petals, alchemical vines, the rotating stage, and the orb chamber all feel tactile and visually fresh. Environmental elements actively shape action (strings above the stage, staircase revealed, orbs as preserved possibilities) and evolve with events (greenhouse shudders, shatters, becomes ruins). The final contrast with the wheat field under auroras reweights prior imagery effectively. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the predominately visual would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The foster care file room is vividly evoked—“mildew and forgotten years,” bowing shelves, dust circles—and the environment is filtered tightly through Elias’s archivist eye. The room and its dust patterns aren’t mere backdrop; they provide the physical clues that let him “unfurl the story” and give the final act of labeling a new folder a charged, situated feel. The button as a recurring object is also strongly embedded in the physical space. Still, the setting mostly supports mood and method rather than imposing hard constraints on choice, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The auric lagoon, mangroves, bioluminescent tunnel, and battered relay station are vivid and sensorial without stalling momentum. The environment constrains tactics—submerged tunnel, drones over open water, mud, and current all shape how they move. The lagoon’s shift from gold to silver and the warm key in her palm echo the thematic shift at the end. World rules (drones, relay, algae-lit tunnel) feel consistent, if only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto, mist, moss, and prism atrium are vividly rendered and recur meaningfully; the environment feels integral rather than decorative. The atrium’s acoustics and refracted light function as more than backdrop, especially when it “flares” in response to the musical struggle and then settles into a faded glow that charges the ending. Sensory detail is rich but generally purposeful, with water drip as metronome and dewdrops as mirrored closure image. The setting doesn’t overtly constrain his options (he could conceivably play elsewhere), but it clearly acts as the vessel and amplifier for both prophecy and counterspell.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid, specific, and tactile—“branches twisted like ancient veins through the clouds,” moss-covered floor, filtered green light—and these details are filtered through Elinor’s work-focused perception. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the floating island’s heart, falling leaves with shifting markings, and storm in the “lower clouds” all intersect with the central problem and outcome. The environment constrains what’s possible (leaf messages, silverseed harvest, skyborne vantage for storm warnings) and charges the imagery at the end. It stops short of absolute top-tier only because the arbor’s physical constraints don’t actively complicate her tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vivid and sensorially rich—moss-slick cave, subterranean waterfall, derelict greenhouse with swirling leaves—and consistently filtered through Elias’s tinkerer sensibility (gears, copper, blueprints). The waterfall, hatch, and greenhouse shafts meaningfully shape action, especially the fall and the retrieval of the compass. The final return to the greenhouse with seeds uses the space as a reconfigured, hopeful version of earlier decay. A slight excess of evocative detail in places risks decorative feel, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-washed foundry, molten pit, and metal smell are vivid and specific, and they’re filtered through Kael’s professional eye as an alchemist, which grounds the magic. The environment meaningfully enables the ritual (molten metal as medium for the coin) and tonally mirrors his grief. The recurring foundry/kintsugi imagery charges the final loss of the coin, now fused into the metal, even if the last line could lean a touch more on physical environment. Overall, the setting feels purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Echo Gorge, the humming pebbles, the spectral harp, and the “hush of a hidden sunrise” produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Lira’s perspective. The environment supports the tone and concept (echoes, spectral residue, sound distortion) rather than feeling generic. That said, the setting mostly frames mood and symbolism; it rarely constrains tactics or creates concrete obstacles. The crocodile’s tooth does charge the final image, functioning as a micro-setting object that partially compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is strongly realized: bioluminescent veins, UV spores, and reactive light that flares at his skin create a distinctive, oppressive atmosphere. Setting is tightly tied to his past (UV lamps in interrogation) and current ordeal, so the environment continuously mirrors and pressures his interior state. The spores burning on his skin as “ultraviolet penance” and the tree’s pulse syncing with his own integrate worldbuilding with theme and emotion. While the forest doesn’t constrain concrete logistics, it clearly shapes psychological stakes and charges the final image of him walking deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s market and its vertical, smoke-hung architecture are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Lira’s perception (e.g., cracks forming constellations, dust spelling languages). Setting is integrated with action: the mist staircase, underbelly paintings, and mural all guide her path and method rather than serving as backdrop only. The lighthouse and its lens recur as charged images that frame the final understanding. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it does strongly charge the final image and the logic of the retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and sensory—the “blue-gray haze,” “peeling laminate,” and cracked plaster integrated with action rather than staged as a static backdrop. Environmental specifics (ticket counter height, ceiling cracks, hidden compartment) directly shape what Elias can do and how he discovers the past. The circus angle (clown ghost, canceled performance) adds texture and thematic resonance without overwhelming the scene. While strong, the setting could constrain choices or danger more sharply to feel indispensable rather than atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass orchard library, hanging shelves, frost-laced panes, and sea of clouds are vividly specific and consistently integrated into action (dew collection, frost maps, shelves swaying, panes cracking). Setting is not mere backdrop: frost patterns dictate the rupture point and later guide the rebuilding, and the floating nature of the library raises the risk that the clouds themselves could unravel. Sensory detail (ink, ozone, fractured rainbows) is economical but evocative, supporting tone and theme. The environment clearly charges the final image via the etched spiral in the air and the library rising on the “winds of change.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The baroque asteroid, visible cobalt time-haze, temporal storms, and bioluminescent fungal archives create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting repeatedly shapes events: storms enable visions, mirrors act as conduits, fungi literally encode history, and the asteroid’s core ecology underpins the thematic reveal of a rooted, symbiotic civilization. These elements evolve coherently and charge the final image of Kael in the garden with the shard and fading haze. A slight tendency toward cataloging ornate details early keeps it just short of the very top band, but world rules remain consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    The resonance chamber, copper walls, and artisanal tools are vivid and integrated into action rather than ornament; the chamber’s hum and amplification directly shape the ritual and its stakes. Details like “needles of obsidian” and “threads of spun starlight” track with Elias’s professional eye and the story’s magical logic. The music box and stone chip function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and constrain what tactics are possible. A slightly broader sense of the world beyond the chamber might deepen atmosphere, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: the derelict factory, limestone cliffs, narrow fissure, and subterranean lagoon are sensorially vivid (especially smell) and always filtered through Lira’s obsessions. Environment constrains action (tight entrance, darkness, cold water) and the lagoon as place decisively charges the final image and thematic stakes. Weather and industrial silence are woven in without feeling like postcard description. This atmosphere is a major asset and would be hard to replace without breaking the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is a strong asset: the storm-tossed archway, fog, bruised sky, and later coral-and-timber village all feel textured and distinct. The archway and lantern slide work as charged objects, with the environment (storm, fog, labyrinthine island) mirroring the temporal and narrative confusion. However, the weather and terrain seldom constrain tactical choices beyond mood—they don’t materially force decisions once the slide appears. The strongest integration is the archway as portal and recurring silhouette, which effectively charges both the inciting beat and the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abbey, amber pavilion, cathedral, and etched window are concretely rendered with strong sensory specificity (“amber pavilion,” changing light on etchings, violet glow) that supports tone and theme. Setting is consistently filtered through Mara’s artistic and botanical biases, which sharpens atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her options beyond providing access to the window, it does charge the central images and the final return to autumn leaves. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The zeppelin-library, shimmering dunes, obsidian lagoon, and fungal-lit tunnels are vividly realized and filtered through Mara’s anxious attention. The environment constrains choices at key points—the lagoon as threshold, the tunnels with booby traps, the staircase opening only via the debris message. The zeppelin’s role is mostly bookending and timekeeping rather than an active constraint on tactics, but the atmospheric integration is strong. Description generally serves mood and pressure rather than feeling like a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting of Paper-Lantern Cove is vivid and specific: crumbling piers, salt-laden air, spectral lanterns, and the history of phosphorus mines all feel textured and lived-in. Details are filtered through Elias’s obsessions (apothecary, elixirs, artifacts) and the lanterns’ brightness later marks the town’s revival, so the environment does charge the final image. Non-visual senses (salt, brine, dust) help the atmosphere without clutter. The world’s rules remain consistent, though the environment mostly reflects rather than constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper is vividly rendered and thematically integrated: roses responding to breath, the tree’s pulse, stars through the canopy, and the city’s lights below all echo memory, rootedness, and impending awakening. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; it’s the physical locus of both the childhood recording and the present decoding, and it charges the final image of charged stillness. Environmental details are selective and filtered through Voss’s long stewardship. While the garden doesn’t physically constrain choices, it strongly frames and deepens them, especially at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound atrium, shattered-glass sky, and crystalline dome are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Lirael’s perception. Setting interacts with events—the ice takes roots, melts, and threatens the atrium’s stability conceptually—rather than remaining a static backdrop. The recurring objects (acorn cap, egg, sapling) are well-situated in space and help track the ritual. It stops just shy of the very top tier because the environment rarely constrains tactics in a way that forces hard choices, even though it beautifully mirrors tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sanctuary above the clouds, the bell tower, and the solstice weather are vividly rendered and continually tied to action (e.g., the bell’s tone interacting with the microclimates, the sundial marking zero hour). Setting isn’t just postcard; the high, thin air and clouds directly affect what kind of sound is needed and how the storms react. The final image of the sanctuary “humming” and winds as allies is charged by all the environmental groundwork. A slight overreliance on stormy-gothic imagery keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The plateau, station domes, obsidian-strewn path, aurora, and crater are all concretely rendered and filtered through Zara’s sensibility, creating a strong atmosphere. Setting participates in action: the plateau makes the walk a small ordeal; the station and its disused instruments frame the tension between science and listening. The yellow lantern and crater function as charged micro-settings that carry into the final image. A slight tendency toward decorative cosmic description keeps this from the very top band, but the integration is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scorched wasteland and abandoned beekeeping oasis are vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the themes of desolation and fragile memory. The stained glass box and hives act as charged micro-setting elements that frame Elias’s ritual and inflect the final image of shards scattered like stars. Environmental pressure is more atmospheric than tactical; the wasteland doesn’t significantly constrain choices beyond mood. Still, the integration of setting and symbolic objects into the ending image is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald silo is vivid and particular—moss, rust, humming machinery—and the buried capsule plus its “guts” make the space feel physically and conceptually lived-in. Setting is not mere backdrop; the silo’s shadows, the hatch, the mercury coil, and the urn fragment all actively shape options and the final understanding of time. Environmental details are tightly curated and filtered through Elias’s purpose-driven perception. The setting also charges the final image by remaining as a locus of layered time after he leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vividly rendered through specific, tactile details (silver-veined surface, twisted reeds, kelp, broken shell) that mirror her project of reassembly. Setting is tightly tied to action—storm debris provides the raw material for her tapestry, and the lagoon’s changing light charges the final images. The drake feather and kite string operate as recurring objects within this environment, deepening mood rather than serving as static decoration. While the lagoon doesn’t impose hard physical constraints, it thoroughly shapes tone and thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper-wrapped oak are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action, not just described. Environment directly shapes tactics (remodel via living stone, wiring trees to pillars) and charges the final images (her last breath “soft as copper on oak,” the island enduring). World rules—stone grown from the core, spirits speaking through growth—are clear and consistent without exposition dumps. Setting and recurring objects function as the emotional and thematic stage, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and uncanny figures (wolf with moth wings, child with clockwork heart) are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lirael’s sensibility. Setting and objects (tower resonance field, sculptures as “mirrors”) are not just backdrop but integral to how the ritual works and how the final realization is framed. Weather and atmosphere (“bronze quiet”) deepen tone rather than stall momentum. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it strongly charges the conceptual and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly particular—the blooming jetty, dead reef, bone-and-ash fertilizer, and oncoming storm all work in concert to shape tone and meaning. Environmental constraints (salty, barren sand; collision of saltwater and freshwater) make his choice of location feel consequential and not generic. The reef’s death and the liminal jetty space charge the final image of flowers flickering like “tiny flames” against approaching darkness. This is highly effective micro-worldbuilding, though the environment exerts more atmospheric than tactical pressure on on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly and economically drawn, with concrete objects (harvester carcass, corrugated-iron shack, cylinders, piano-table) that feel lived-in and specific. The preserved leaf and the cylinders function as recurring objects that charge both the middle and the final image. The environment supports the tone and concept—post-war scarcity, scavenging, and repurposed culture—but it rarely constrains choices in a way that changes tactics. Still, atmosphere and world rules are consistent and well integrated with the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observation deck, distortion field, frosted glass, and endless Institute corridors are vivid and specific, filtered through Elio’s scientific and familial lenses. The compass rose as a recurring object meaningfully charges the setting and directly influences the final decision. World rules around time dilation and shutdown-era quiet feel consistent and integrated rather than dumped. The environment shapes mood more than hard constraints on action, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting work is strong: the icebound spire, narrow ledge, bioluminescent fungi, and obsidian chessboard all feel specific and atmospheric, filtered through Kael’s task-focused perception. Environment and objects occasionally constrain action (slick ledge, trembling ice, the single window, the charged chessboard), and the sky’s transformation at the end visually confirms the resolution. The pocket sundial lid and cloud-city below subtly charge the final image without over-explaining. A bit more use of the tower’s physical constraints to influence his tactics could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering gallery and museum during interregnum are vividly evoked—sound, shifting exhibits, and the living-feeling chessboard fuse atmosphere with her psychological state. The acoustics and “whispers” are not mere decoration; they pressure her to stop and sharpen the feeling of resistance and ritual. The chessboard as a micro-setting/object is tightly integrated with the final image as she leaves with it. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it does successfully constrain psychological experience and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-spanning labyrinthine bookstore and the crystalline cavern are vividly rendered with selective, evocative detail (spiraling shelves, dust galaxies, bioluminescent fungi) that feels filtered through Lirael’s perception. Setting and recurring objects (stone, feather, mercury skin, obsidian shards) meaningfully shape choices and charge the final image of her altered body. World rules (stone as key/mirror, seeding via feather) are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. A minor limit is that physical constraints of the mountain/bookstore don’t press on tactics as much as they might, functioning more as atmosphere than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and frayed tapestry are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated into the action. The environment constrains and guides his choices: he must navigate the etched lines and interact physically with the tapestry and pedestal. Thunder and stillness create a coherent, eerie atmosphere that supports the theme of suspended time and guilt. The setting’s rules are lightly sketched but consistent enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The canyon of endless echoes, bone towers, and the pale spire are vividly rendered and conceptually integrated into the story’s mechanics, not just its mood. Setting actively shapes events: Kael paints on bone, the echoes refract his words, and the forbidden spire becomes the literal lens that scatters truth as light. Environmental responses (the canyon’s shudder, hush, laughter, and final sigh) mirror and pressure the human conflict. A minor limitation is that the physical logistics of the ritual and village life remain abstract, but at this length the chosen details feel precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The acid sea, copper hull, and gear-filled floating workshop are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Lira’s sensory experience and fears. Environment is not postcard: acid fumes shape her respirator use, the sea’s roar and workshop’s shuddering escalate tension, and the final “mirror” insight directly reframes the setting into thematic infrastructure. The tools (vials of liquid light/shattered starlight) and statue feel specific and lived-in, not generic props. A minor quibble is that the “neon-green acid sea” image is revisited more descriptively than tactically in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the quay, cliffs, and especially the cave and pool are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“brine and limestone,” “shaft of sunlight,” “hundreds of shells”). Environment meaningfully shapes the story: the fork, narrowing walls, and light fissure guide his movement and discoveries. The recurring objects (mirror, shell, pool) charge the final image and embody the “temporary eternity” tension. This is atmospheric without becoming a static postcard, and it’s tightly filtered through Elias’s painterly eye.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt lighthouse, bruised sky, thick post–heat wave air, and salt-scented stairwell create a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived in rather than touristic. Setting details (the garden pots on the eastern wall, the rain beginning as she hums) are tightly integrated with the magical logic and emotional tone. The lighthouse doesn’t strongly constrain her options beyond providing elevation and isolation, but it atmospherically underwrites the liminal, signal-sending premise. Sensory focus on scent, weather, and sea makes the world feel specific and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the starlit, rusted signal station on a drowned coast feels tactile and lived-in, and the environment (scrap metal, antennae, ocean, moon) directly shapes what she can do. The censer foot effectively functions as a micro-setting object, constraining choices and charging the final image when it spins and gleams. Atmosphere supports the theme of loss and spectral return without tipping into muddle. A slightly broader sensory range beyond visual and smell could have deepened immersion, but what’s there is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard in the ravine, the storm, and the hut are vivid and selective, with strong opening and closing images (“chandelier of green,” “the orchard would wait”). The environment does exert some pressure—the coming storm accelerates her trip to the oak and the hut—though after they reach shelter, weather becomes mostly atmospheric. The world detail around the empathy virus is sketched economically and plausibly enough to support the premise. Setting could do more to actively constrain the climax rather than sit as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal dock, bruise-purple sky, mist, and rusted hatch are vivid and sensorially rich, and they’re integrated into action rather than sitting as static description. The lighthouse, dock, and hidden understructure create a layered sense of place that fits the mood and theme. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the opening and closing images and reinforces the isolation motif. The atmosphere feels purposeful and specific enough for a high score, if not quite transformative of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—from “emerald shards” of light and bioluminescent fungi to the obsidian pedestal—anchoring place and mood effectively without bogging the story down. The creek, ants, and cavern all shape behavior (she follows them, descends, confronts the pedestal) and recur to charge the final image of “following them home.” Environmental details are filtered reliably through her attentive, map-focused perspective. The piece could push pressure a bit more via the physical environment (danger, difficulty) to make the setting constrain her choices rather than mainly decorate them.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: balcony above clouds, the steep ridge, fireflies, and the ember grotto as a “wound” all feel tactile and thematically charged. Environmental detail is well-filtered through her attention, and sensory specificity (mist condensation, ozone, “lacy menace”) builds mood without losing clarity. The grotto’s physicality (slick stones, sparking gravel, pulsing walls) supports the metaphor of an open wound convincingly. It stops short of directly constraining tactical choices in the climax, but it strongly colors and mirrors the internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ember nexus, cooled lava shards, clocktower forge, and Ashen Sea all feel specific and sensorial, filtered through Elara’s technical, light-obsessed lens. Setting is not just backdrop: the nexus’s fading is the core external problem, and its stabilization at the end charges the final image and confirms success. Tools and micro-setting (sun engine, shell, workbench) are consistently handled and spatially coherent. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual description over full sensory spread keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain cabin, snowbound grave, and icy crevice are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the piece’s haunted introspection. Environmental details (creaking logs, pine resin, moonlit shaft in the cave) are selective and filtered through POV in a way that deepens mood. The setting does modestly constrain choice—he must climb, squeeze through the fissure, confront the ledge—but it functions more as atmospheric mirror than hard tactical pressure. Still, it charges several key images, especially the grave and the hidden scroll.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The water clock repair shop, fog, and river are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Lira’s sensibility, creating a strong, specific atmosphere. Recurring details—the submerged gears, algae, and fog—mirror her occluded perception and the theme of reading through distortion. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it clearly charges the final image (fog lifting, clocks chiming) and is far from generic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating tea platform, mist, moss-choked forest, and alchemical ink are vivid and tightly filtered through Kael’s attention, creating a strong, consistent atmosphere. The environment is not postcard-only: the platform shuddering and the mist parting into a literal path materially shape the ending. Recurring objects (platform, mist, forest) charge the final image of descent and reception by the trees. The setting could exert a bit more tangible constraint on his tactics under pressure, but what’s present is already publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sheet music archive is vivid—“towering stacks of yellowed scores,” dust that “smelled of regret”—and clearly anchored. The orchard and workers outside provide a complementary layer of setting that matters at the end when the chainsaws roar to life. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does meaningfully charge mood and closure. Overall, the specificity and integration with theme are strong, if not quite at the “indispensable constraint” level.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient library is vividly rendered with smell, light, and vertical scale, and the “resounding hush” recurs as an atmospheric throughline. The mural, hidden passages, and shifting shelves all emerge from the setting and support the mystical tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or imposes concrete difficulties; it’s more stage than obstacle or tool. Strong mood and specificity, modest functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fjord, cliffside station, hydraulic mechanism, and observatory deck are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Lorn’s attention; they never feel like neutral backdrop. Environmental details (salt-streaked walls, still water like a second sky, horizon line blurring) directly shape the images that matter at the climax, especially when the sea becomes a “giant clock face.” The mantle key and submerged clock together function as charged micro-setting at the end, constraining what Lorn can understand and do. This is high-level atmospheric work, just shy of the very top band because the environment doesn’t quite force a concrete choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and permeable barriers are vividly realized and integrated into action—the barrier tests, the liquid parting, the spore rain at the end all arise from world logic, not postcard description. Kael’s professional gaze filters setting details in a character-specific way (energy patterns, oscillations, fractals). The environment constrains tactics (he must work *through* the barriers and the fungal heart) and charges the final image of spores nourishing crops. A slightly heavy reliance on light/bioluminescence imagery keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “rainwashed library” and the subterranean subway corridor with ozone and iron are vivid, selective, and tonally aligned, and details like the mica lantern pane and chalk outline are well integrated into action. The environment gently shapes choices—the closed wing, the shifting floors, the fork in the tracks—without needing heavy exposition. Weather and space return at the end (“tears mixing with rain”) to charge the emotional cadence. The piece could push slightly further in letting physical constraints complicate tactics, but as-is it’s strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The subway utility tunnel and underground booth are vividly evoked—“concrete veins,” damp earth, old copper, flickering bulbs—and they meaningfully mirror the story’s concern with hidden, infrastructural connections. The glass harmonica disc functions as a charged micro-setting object, its sound literally filling the tunnel in the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics (most of the drama is telephonic), but it does shape tone and plausibility in a way that would be hard to duplicate in a generic setting. Integration of sensory detail is economical and largely filtered through Mara’s work-focused perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly realized: salt and jasmine, “horizon a bruise of violets and gold,” shipwreck graveyard turned blooming jetty, nightshade and moonflowers pulsing like hearts. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s archivist sensibility, tying environment to memory and record-keeping. The jetty and its flowers charge the final image—the flowers closing “as if in prayer” mirrors the covenant’s fragile, tended state and her quiet commitment. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, it’s inseparable from the story’s logic and tone and meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The station and ivy are vividly and economically rendered—the ivy “pulsed like a second heartbeat,” the moss-carpeted platform, the mural of the dissolving train—and the environment’s eerie, organic decay supports the loneliness/reciprocity theme. Setting details are consistently filtered through action (the ivy shivering as the ghost appears, the tracks vanishing into the wall), so the atmosphere never lapses into static description. The station doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does anchor the mythos (plague-train, sorrow on the tracks) in a way that would be hard to transplant. Overall, it’s rich, coherent atmosphere rather than a fully tactical environment, but at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultrasonic forest, upside-down river, and sentient biota are vividly drawn and consistently rule-bound, with details like frequencies and vibrations feeding directly into how Elias navigates. Setting is filtered through his non-visual perception in a way that feels both imaginative and character-specific. Environmental features (frequencies dropping, the Silver Vein, the thickening moss) actively shape his path rather than sitting as backdrop. The world-building is rich and purposeful without tipping into static exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The gravitational anomaly is vividly rendered (“warped the air like glass,” stones hanging, leaves spiraling upward) and establishes an immediate, distinctive atmosphere. The pen and anomaly together function as a micro-setting that shapes what’s possible (timeline visualization, gravity shifts) and charge the final image as he walks away with the pen humming. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, always filtered through Elias’s professional, bodily experience. The world’s rules are consistent enough for the length and support tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor by moonlight, with its “liquid silver” water, creaking ropes, and lapping waves, is vivid and tonally precise, and the soundscape is especially well integrated with the premise. The environment feels lived-in rather than touristic, and it underwrites the central metaphor of silence as something textured rather than empty. While the harbor doesn’t strongly constrain choices—these events could plausibly occur at another quiet liminal space—it does charge key images (the crowd gathered at the dock, the dawn over the water). The final image of the harbor “alive with sound” at night versus quiet at dawn meaningfully leverages setting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive—humming walls, shadowed halls, chambers of maps and forgotten languages—feels vivid and thematically aligned with the idea of “alive” knowledge. Details are selective and purposeful, with the building almost personified as it “shivers” in response to her art. The setting frames all action and clearly underpins the final realization about gardens and tending, but it rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics beyond providing specialized rooms. More tactile interaction or environmental pressure (e.g., dangers, protocols, physical constraints) would lift the setting from strong backdrop to fully active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly and specifically realized (flowers humming, vines thrumming, color-coded memories), and they’re tightly integrated with Eli’s inner state. The environment is not decorative: it’s the mechanism of memory, the reason for his journey, and the frame for the final image of drumming as activation. World rules (vibrational plants, entangled memories) are consistent and learned through Eli’s interaction rather than exposition. The setting meaningfully charges the last beat, where the garden “singing” and lagoon’s promise encapsulate his new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The port-city container labyrinth, ozone-tainted air, vibrating metal, and storm-lit symbols create a vivid, tactile environment that feels specific and lived-in. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: echoes, metal walls, and shifting rows directly inform the “whispers vs shouts” tactic and the sense that the space listens and reconfigures. The zodiac-marked containers and hidden chamber of maps deepen atmosphere and theme without over-explaining the world rules. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk or constraint from the moving containers themselves could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are the standout strength: the cobalt dock after rain, the bruised sky, wet planks, and chipped blue shutters all feel precise and lived-in. The environment is not just backdrop but medium; the dock, canal, shutters, and mirror collaborate to make light-patterns possible and to literalize “teaching darkness the value of stars.” The weather and water tone (“bruise on glass,” “stillwater tension”) consistently mirror the emotional stakes. The final backward glance at faint patterns on the dock charges the place as a memory-bearing surface.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt library, mist, magnetic grotto, and magnetite pieces are vivid, specific, and thematically consonant with “amplified quiet” and second thoughts. Setting is not mere backdrop: the grotto’s field hums, tugs at zippers, and is framed as a place where “past and prophecy touch,” and it’s tightly bound to the father’s history and Clara’s magic. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices—it charges the atmosphere more than it alters tactics. Still, the final image of the library and glowing chess windows is strongly anchored in place.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marine setting is vivid and specific: “sublittoral fringe,” kelp forests, bioluminescent fish, and the trembling, eroding island create a tangible, atmospheric world. The fringe as a liminal zone effectively mirrors Lira’s transitional state, and the shift from murky fringe to brighter deep supports the thematic movement from constraint to possibility. Environmental details are well-integrated into action—she kneels in the surf, swims into dark water, feels the island shudder—rather than pasted on. The world’s rules (mythic whale guardian, dissolving scrimshaw) are consistent enough for this lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The farmhouse, gray light, and looming turbines are vividly sketched and recur in ways that mirror Lirael’s internal state—the “giants stealing the wind’s voice” is particularly effective. The micro-setting of table, bouquet, knife, and wood feels tactile and inhabited, and the turbines’ hum and shadows give the atmosphere a low, oppressive thrum. These details do charge the final image of shadows lengthening into night. However, the environment mostly serves as mood and metaphor rather than as a concrete constraint on what she can do in the scene, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action—the humming, cracking, falling crystals, and “liquid glass” underfoot all participate in the transformation. Setting is filtered through Lirael’s aesthetic sensibility, which gives specificity (e.g., “lantern-moth hush”) real character charge rather than feeling like a tour. The atrium/colonnade ultimately functions as a threshold, explicitly redefined at the end, so environment meaningfully shapes the closure image. A slightly clearer sense of physical risk from the lake could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glassblower’s courtyard is vivid and specific—molten-glass orbs, kiln, ivy, tourists—and the magical ecology (plants that “remember,” cobalt dust, moth, singing orbs) feels coherent. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the courtyard, plants, and glass objects are the very tools by which Elias accesses the hidden world and through which the final image is staged. The phoenix-altered world is sketched economically yet persuasively. This is strong, publication-ready atmosphere; the only thing keeping it from the very top band is that the physical environment constrains choice more thematically than logistically.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the story’s strongest asset: the “laboratory of lost sounds,” brass dials, carbide lamp, and cave carved with equations all feel vivid and thematically appropriate. The environment meaningfully shapes action—the lens slot in the console, the cave acting as an instrument, the mountain’s hum all constrain options and enable discovery. Sensory details (golden shadows, damp earth, vibrations through bone) are purposeful rather than decorative. The recurring lab vs. mountain environments also charge the final image where machines fall silent for the mountain’s song.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory is richly rendered and integral: its altitude, decay, dome, and lanterns are all tied to how Elias’s ritual works. Setting details (crumbling mountain, rusted telescopes, glass dome) are filtered through his grief and craft, deepening atmosphere rather than feeling touristic. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of the observatory as a beacon. A touch more sensory variety beyond visual/abstract (cold, smell, sound) could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The loft, skylight, and rain are richly realized and strongly filtered through Elara’s perception (“glass dripped like a thousand inverted hourglasses,” rain as a “lens”). Setting is not postcard: the rain dictates where cards are placed and the skylight becomes a literalized way of “seeing cracks” in the city’s mask, charging the final revolution image. The micro-setting of tape, cards, and floorboards is coherent and tactile, with the loft clearly functioning as a memory- and pressure-bearing environment. This is near–publish-ready atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the bronze prism pagoda, twilight light, dust motes as “atoms of nostalgia,” and the glowing carvings all create a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Details are filtered through Lirael’s sensibility as a historian, so the worldbuilding feels purposeful rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the pagoda and its light literally and symbolically transform the room and her path (“It wasn’t a tomb. It was a seed.”). While the archive doesn’t tightly constrain her physical options, its taboo status and reactive architecture do shape the narrative stakes and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “blooming library above clouds,” petrified-petal shelves, and spider-silk-and-starlight robes create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels consistent and lived-in. The library’s role as an archive directly enables the comparison of footage, so setting isn’t mere wallpaper. However, the blooming/above-clouds aspects are largely aesthetic; they don’t significantly constrain action or force specific choices. The recurring river stones function as a micro-setting object that strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: mist, rafters, skylight, and the terrarium all filter through Lira’s sensibility and echo her internal state without devolving into generic mood. The “misty workshop under the stars” frames the entire piece and the tail under starlight returns at the end, charging the final image with quiet transcendence. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, it functionally operates as a cocoon where her reconstruction can occur, and the material details (tools, glass, velvet, adhesive) are concrete and well-used.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower, damp stone, old paper, twilight, and the living ivy create a strong, specific atmosphere that feels inhabited rather than generic, and the hourglass/tunnel function as environment-as-mechanism. The coffee-ring mosaic as literal pathway through memory is an especially fresh, grounded detail that integrates setting with plot. The tower’s dawn light at the end subtly supports the internal shift without over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The projection booth is vivid and specific—dust, decayed film stock, rattling window, rain—and feels lived-in rather than touristic. The Alhambra itself is not just backdrop but the functional container of the letters and history; the booth is explicitly described as a place that “incubate[s] that pain.” Environmental details (rain, hum, lilacs, creaking lobby) mirror and charge the emotional movement and the final descent from the booth. The setting meaningfully shapes the premise and final image, not just the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The aurora-lit archway, etched stone, and jar-lined chamber are sensuously rendered and tightly woven into action rather than offered as static backdrop. The environment actively shapes events—the archway is the literal portal; the jars’ labels define what’s at stake in choosing one; the aurora’s light and “taste of ozone” keep the scene embodied. The recurring tools and objects (archway, sextant, jars, aurora) charge the final image of dawn and the fading archway, even though the physical setting no longer constrains choices at the end. A touch more use of non-visual senses under peak pressure could further deepen the atmosphere, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid, economical, and consistently filtered through Kael: “bioluminescent sand that pulsed like a heartbeat,” “burnt honey and static,” crystalline towers humming with stored emotions. The glowing dune and archive are not just backdrops; they define what’s possible (only place left to dream, memories stored in stone) and charge the final image of tiny flames taking root. World rules stay impressionistic but coherent, reinforcing the dream/quantum conceit without needless exposition. The environment could constrain specific tactical choices a bit more, but it already heavily shapes meaning and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is vividly and economically rendered—ironwoods, copperwillows, brassbark oaks, steam and gears all feel tactile and sonically precise. Setting is not mere backdrop: the trees’ distinct sounds provide the decoding method, and the clearing’s socketed pedestal creates a concrete decision point. The final transformation to bioluminescent, veined trees and moss grounds the conceptual shift in sensory change. World rules stay consistent enough that the forest-as-brain revelation reads like a deepening, not a retcon.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridgeway is vividly and consistently realized—the bruised twilight, shifting paths (thorns → roots → slope), and salt-and-iron air all feel specific and integrated with action. The environment does exert some pressure (vanishing paths, mutable terrain), and the ticket punch functions as a micro-setting/tool that orients movement and anchors the final image. That said, the ridgeway’s constraints remain mostly atmospheric rather than forcing distinct tactical choices. The world feels cohesive, but the magic could shape decisions even more strongly to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt fortress under snow, mercury-glimmering walls, greenhouse, music room, and spiral staircase create a vivid, coherent environment that shapes mood and symbolism. Setting is filtered well through Elric’s duties (greenhouse herbs, silverware, the specific bench bolt), giving the place a lived-in specificity rather than tourist catalog detail. The environment charges the final image (bolt gleaming, snow seeming to melt at the piano’s note), even if it doesn’t strongly constrain logistical choices beyond the piano space itself. World rules around cobalt, nerve regeneration, and hymns remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ancient temple library and star-carved walls are vividly evoked and tightly tied to the events (hidden map, mosaic trapdoor, celestial alignment). Environmental features shape tactics: knowledge must be gleaned from the stacks, the trapdoor is concealed in the star mosaic, and the collapse reveals sky, charging the final image. Most description is visual and aurally focused, with limited sensory breadth, but it remains purposeful rather than postcard-like. The setting supports tone and plot rather than merely decorating them.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oceanic setting and the monitoring station are vividly evoked—the barnacle-like station, weakened sun, atoll edge, and storm of bioluminescent plankton all carry strong atmosphere. Details are filtered through Lira’s ecological and scientific sensibility, which sharpens specificity (bleaching corals, sensor arrays) without becoming encyclopedic. Environment does influence action somewhat (storm, deck observation, the ability to “follow” the glowing path), though it rarely constrains choices tightly. The recurring atlas page and plankton light nicely charge the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is sharply drawn—rusted cranes, half-buried drones, a gaping roof, and the ancient stone circle half-buried in rubble all feed both atmosphere and action. Setting details are POV-filtered (bare feet on cool floor, dust shaking from rafters) and the stones function as a micro-setting that literally focuses the climax. The time-of-day and sky color (“amber to violet”) mesh with the idea of marginal, liminal alignment. The final image leans more on metaphor (“a storm, gathering”) than a concrete reprise of the spaceport, which slightly underuses the rich environment at the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The volcanic hot springs and ruined bathhouse are sensorially rich (sulfurous mist, moss-slick rock, bubbling water) and integrated into action, not just painted in. The setting constrains choice—vault beneath the springs, planting the embryo there, reconstruction crews as a clock—rather than being a neutral backdrop. The plants as part of the environment double as a telepathic chorus, further entwining setting and function. It could push higher if the physical environment exerted more direct risk or resistance on her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arboretum on the seaside cliff is vivid and sensorial—wind-twisted pines, salt-bleached roses, iron gates—and these details are filtered through Lila’s intent to find stillness. Crucially, the environment isn’t postcard-only: stone, sea, salt, and lavender are the somatic anchors she uses under pressure, directly shaping her tactics and the final image. The abandoned lighthouse context subtly parallels the loss of external guidance, enriching atmosphere without over-explained symbolism. A touch more interaction with the physical precariousness of the cliff could have heightened constraint, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The forgotten library in a lighthouse, warped books, salt-rotted wood, and smudged lamplight create a vividly textured, tonally unified environment. Setting is not just backdrop: the lighthouse’s disused function, the missing lens, and the precarious staircase ascent frame his inward turn and the final web ritual. Objects-as-setting (tarot box, threads, broken cards, candle) are re-used and charged, especially in the final image. A bit more constraint (how the physical space limits or forces specific actions) would be needed to push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The desert, wind-carved encampment, eclipse light, and the Tower of Hours are sharply drawn and tonally cohesive, creating a strong, slightly uncanny atmosphere. Details like the metallic drone against earth-toned tents and ink whipping into fractal spirals feel specific and filtered through Lira’s attention. The environment mostly frames mood rather than constraining tactics; the desert trek, for instance, is more gestured than lived through. Nonetheless, setting and objects (ink, drone, tower) meaningfully charge the story’s premise and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “echoing library under snow” is vividly and consistently evoked—the frosted glass, ice crystals, towering cryo-shelves, and breath-fog all build a tangible, chilly hush. The environment supports tone and concept (frozen truths, thawing rebellion) and is integrated into action via the cryo-chamber rather than remaining pure backdrop. That said, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond atmosphere; Lirael’s actions would be nearly identical in a less distinctive facility. The snow and echoes charge the final image thematically but don’t yet exert concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vivid and integral: the dome’s containment vs. the howling sandstorm, the heat, the thorns, and the ballast sand all concretely mirror and constrain the thematic question. Details are economical yet specific (crimson cacti, fractured starlight sand, amber glow at dusk), filtered through Lira’s agricultural and pacifist lens. The dome and roses directly charge the final image—her palm on the glass, the plants drinking ballast dust—so the environment is not mere backdrop but the medium of meaning. World rules (tower fall, airships, sandstorms) stay consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered and integrated into action—crystal trees, humming moss, visible shockwaves—rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental rules (sound-to-light translation, resonance, patterns) remain consistent and are learned through Kael’s manipulation of tools. The setting directly constrains tactics: he must use vibration, the spike, and the garden’s responses to reach the goddess. The final note and shimmering soil explicitly charge the closing image with the environment’s ongoing, altered presence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory above the clouds, humming gears, and rosewood desk are vivid and integrated into Clara’s perception rather than feeling like set dressing. The observatory functions as a sanctuary and vantage point, thematically “above” the pollution and secrets she uncovers, and it frames both her decision and the final image (dome opening to the sky). Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does meaningfully charge the emotional and thematic stakes. Detail economy is good: a few well-chosen images do most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” with walls humming, ozone and regret, and haunted machines creates a distinct, textured atmosphere that suits the premise. The amber, the wasp, and the sound-focused machinery recur meaningfully and frame the action. The corridor and nursery inside the firmware are more generic, but still anchored with concrete props like the crib and letters. Environment influences tactics modestly (machines to amplify letters, scanner for amber) rather than strongly constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto, mist, tiles, and sand are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s artistic perception, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop: acoustics, tile-lined walls, and the mutable sand directly shape what she can attempt (pattern-making, tile insertion) and how the grotto responds. The recurring objects (tile, mandala, mist) help charge the final image without feeling overdetermined. The one limit is that environmental constraints don’t impose much concrete *cost*—the world supports her more than it resists her.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and coherent—the ash and ozone, fractured-glass stars, shattered sky, and mosaicked plaza form a strong, sensory-rich environment filtered through Elias’s perception. The recurring mosaic surfaces (minaret fresco, tessera, stepping stone) do thematic double duty and charge the final image effectively. While the plaza and sky rarely constrain concrete choices, they shape tone and resonance in a way that feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard within the hedge maze is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: sensory details (apples tasting of autumn twilight, gravel in a minor key) are filtered through Elias’s synesthesia and never feel generic. Crucially, the setting is not just backdrop—the maze rearranges itself to mirror the coin, then dissolves into a convergence clearing, directly shaping the story’s structural turn and final image. The environment’s responsiveness to sound and memory charges the stakes around fracture and repair. This level of purposeful, character-filtered setting is close to publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    The light-painting studio is vivid and specific—ozone, acrylic, neon-blue light, concrete floor, malfunctioning rig—and clearly filtered through an artist’s sensibility. The muscovite geode operates as a micro-setting object whose presence shapes tactics (he literally uses it as compass/template) and charges the final image. World details like the telepathy pills and leaked memo are economical yet enough to ground a near-future corporate context. The setting supports theme and mood well, though the room itself doesn’t significantly constrain choices beyond being the natural lab space.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal cave network, salt air, tides, damp sand, and bioluminescent algae are vividly rendered and integrated with action (the gust that warps the display, the algae touch that triggers the portal). The environment feels textural and specific rather than generic, and the cave’s liminality mirrors the thematic liminality of transitional objects. However, the setting rarely constrains Lira’s choices or tactics; it frames and charges the experience more than it pressures it. As atmosphere and worldbuilding, it’s strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The warehouse, cliffs, and canyon are vividly rendered with concrete, atmospheric details (“amber warehouse,” “wooden beams groaning,” “carpet of sawdust”). The environment is filtered through Mara’s mindset and resurfaces crucially at the window in the final image, where the cliffs and canyon literalize the echo’s origin and thematic depth. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges tone and closure. Overall specificity and integration with mood are high and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is a standout: Zephyr Bluff in mist, “silver hush,” cold iron railing, frost-kissed gravel, and damp earth all feel tactile, selective, and filtered through Mara’s spy sensibility. The environment constrains choice—she picks this isolated, muffling bluff for secrecy—and the weather and season echo her internal liminality without becoming overbearing. The bluff and pillbox recur to charge the final image (mist parting, a sliver of sunlight, her touching the engraved box), giving the place emotional and thematic weight. This integration of landscape, body, and object into the arc supports a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, and ferry are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Thaddeus’s professional familiarity. Details like “eyes like wet coal,” the hull “slicing through the fog like a knife through linen,” and the gutters starting to tick at the end give a strong, coherent atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices beyond timing and mood, it thoroughly shapes the piece’s texture and thematic frame (the river as a living palimpsest). The recurring sensory anchors—fog, water, ticking—evolve subtly from anticipation to fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wasteland and beekeeping oasis are vividly rendered—“skeletal hives,” “horizon bled orange,” sunflowers at the edge of blackened sand—and the recurring objects (lantern, sunflowers, well) are well integrated. Environment and objects do charge the meaning of the ending: the oasis as a hive of memory; the lantern glass as carried promise. However, the setting mostly frames and symbolizes rather than constrains tactics or options; Mara is never physically limited or endangered by it. Very strong atmosphere, slightly shy of using place as a true pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor, fire escape, and bait shop are sensually and specifically rendered—the salt and diesel, the bobbing boat, the stale interior air—anchoring mood and character priorities. Moonlight and darkness are not just backdrop but thematic agents, especially when the window is opened and the harbor “breathes.” The recurring micro-settings (rosebush, jasmine, the dock planks) are integrated into action and symbolism without feeling like a tour. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it convincingly charges the emotional choices and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “tidal library above clouds,” coral walls, swaying shelves, and stone circle hum are vivid and specific, with details filtered through Lirael’s experience. Setting is not postcard-only: the hum animates the shelves and sundial, and the environment literally reconfigures to offer new tools once she commits to her path. The recurring sundial and the tides of the library charge the final images and help embody the theme. A slight excess of descriptive luxuriance keeps it just shy of top-tier rigor, but the world feels distinctive and structurally relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, marble, and glass orbs are sensuously and economically drawn, with “prismatic quiet” and “liquid light” giving a distinct atmosphere. Setting interacts with theme—the pond receives the sinking orbs, the temple houses the spiral, weather clearing after cloudbursts parallels emotional clearing—even if these are more symbolic than constraining. The environment doesn’t strongly limit tactical options, but it does charge the key images (pond, orbs, spiral) that shape the ending. Overall it feels specific, integrated, and tonally cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The university radio station and its basement—transmitter hum, vintage equipment, oscilloscopes—are concrete and integrated into action, not just backdrop. The setting meaningfully constrains tactics: her only weapon against cosmic entities is the station hardware and its frequencies. Academic and campus details (the board, students arguing in the quad) are light but effective in broadening the world. While vivid, the environment could further heighten stakes by impinging more directly on choices under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cathedral is vividly realized—“starlight filtering through shattered stained glass,” the organ, and the twisting, rubbery corridor all create strong atmosphere. Crucially, the environment constrains choices: the living, shifting architecture physically resists him, and the nexus becomes a literal gateway at the end. Details are purposeful and filtered through his anxiety and awe rather than feeling like a catalog. World rules (dimension thresholds, organ-triggered shifts) are sketched but consistent enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry and mist are sharply rendered—“mist clung…like a second skin” and the pit as an “abyssal mouth” give strong atmospheric specificity. The environment supports theme by functioning as a tomb layered with history, and the physical features (pit, boulders, dirt) enable the discovery of drag marks and the locket. Weather and darkness constrain them to lantern-light, which justifies the close, tactile focus on tracing and sketching. Setting could pressure choices more directly (e.g., physical risk), but it already does substantial tonal and functional work.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The weather station, cliffs, and storm are vivid and tactile—“salt and ozone,” “spongey gray” sky, sickly green clouds—and consistently filtered through Clara’s professional gaze. Environment constrains action (isolated tower, roof with instruments, dangerous storm) and charges the final image as she stands exposed under anomalous weather. The recurring objects (nail, journals, instruments) are embedded in place rather than feeling like props dropped into a void. At this length, the integration of weather science and eerie atmosphere is strong enough to feel lived-in, not touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain pullout and van are vividly evoked through smell and texture, and the world feels lived-in rather than generic. The flake itself functions as a micro-setting/object that strongly charges the atmosphere and the final transformation. While the environment doesn’t significantly constrain options beyond serving as a liminal frontier, the sensory specificity and integration with Elias’s attention give it weight. The new realm (“ground beneath his feet felt like memory”) extends the setting motif effectively into the conceptual space.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The abandoned circus train is an evocative, specific setting with strong atmosphere (“carriages half-swallowed by ivy,” “scent of old wood and forgotten dreams”). Its imagery of ruin and spectacle mirrors the startup’s collapse and Elias’s inherited criminal past. However, the environment rarely constrains his options or tactics; it mostly functions as a symbolic and emotional backdrop. The final image with the bills on the carriage window ties the object to the place, but the train could be swapped for another ruin without breaking the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory “like a silver moth trapped in amber,” frosted dome, brass sextant, and crater rim ground the piece vividly and in character-filtered ways. The variable stars, prism, and holographic temple chamber build a coherent, textured fantastical geography. Environment shapes method (astronomical tools, prism) more than it constrains choice, so the setting feels richly atmospheric rather than tactically binding. The dawn over the crater and the daylily telegram reprise give the final image a satisfying spatial and sensory frame.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The orchard vortex and cursed lake are vivid and sensorially rich—“decaying fruit and ozone,” clawing branches, ghostly shapes in the water—and they feel inseparable from the story’s mood. The setting functions as more than backdrop: the vortex physically pulls her in, the lake “holds” the frozen confession, and the stilling of trees at the end mirrors her internal shift. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete tactical options; it frames and intensifies rather than actively dictating what she can or cannot do. Even so, it charges the final image enough to feel integral.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt glade, Glass Labyrinth, and sutured sky are vividly realized with strong sensory specificity (ozone and elderberries; two moons at the end) and a consistent dreamlike logic. Setting details are well-filtered through Lirael’s perception and support the uncanny, liminal tone. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than functionally shaping choices. The reprise of the glade and altered sky in the final image does charge the ending, but not at a 9+ level of environmental necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—bones, roots, black fruit, bioluminescent fungi—and consistently filtered through Lirael’s sensibility. Crucially, the environment constrains action: the skeleton, roots, and tree are not just décor but the mechanism of the bargain and the source of the fruit she must eat. The setting’s logic holds, and the return to the surface world at sunset recharges the underworld imagery in the final beat. A slight excess of atmospheric detail in early paragraphs edges toward luxuriance, but it remains purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry office trailer, perched above a chasm of granite and “smelling of mildew and regret,” is sharply drawn and thematically apt as a limbo space for a failed showbiz life. Details like the faded concert posters and crate labeled “Miscellaneous Memorabilia” are specific and filtered through Lenny’s sensibility. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it meaningfully mirrors his internal exile and charges the idea of “rocks to crush” versus fragile relics. The recurring object (grille cloth) functions as micro-setting at closure, tactile in his pocket and carrying reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “magnetic arbor above the clouds” is vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through action (glassy pathways, lodestone trunks, ionized storms). Environmental details feel filtered through a working scientist’s eye and modulate tone effectively. The arbor’s hum, roots, and leaves also charge the final image and reinforce the thematic shift. The setting could constrain choices a bit more explicitly to reach the top band, but it is already a strong asset.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered and consistently integrated—the brackish pools, glass dome, and creel all feel inseparable from how identity is altered and stored. Environmental details (tides as time, brine, kelp, moonlight puddles) are thematically and functionally tied to the acts of smelting and migration. The setting does real work by providing the mechanism and metaphor for transformation and by charging the final image of wintersun serenity. It stops just short of 9+ only because the environment rarely constrains specific tactical choices under pressure; it’s more a beautifully coherent ritual space than an adversarial landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal caves are vividly realized with strong, purposeful detail (quartz veins as heartbeat, obsidian shards, spiral of crystals, cathedral-like final image). Setting and object merge effectively into the metaphysics of the story—the lattice and latent radiance feel native to this environment. While the cave doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics, it does conceptually govern what’s possible and charges the key images and the ending. The occupational angle (bunker inspector in these otherworldly caves) sharpens specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The station and ivy are richly specific and consistently filtered through Mara’s obsessions—“liminal space,” ivy as “green archive,” tributary of the Thames, etc. Environment and micro-setting actively guide choice: graffiti in the bathroom, arrows to the drainpipe, the tributary as a place where she tests the metaphor in sound and image. The ivy preserving graffiti and later “leaning closer” then turning gold under sunset charges the closure image thematically. Setting does more than decorate; it’s the physical grammar of the story’s emotional journey.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing, mist-filled library is vividly rendered, with the pulsing light and shifting books integrated into both mood and mechanism of the plot. Environmental cues (humming shelves, intensified glow) guide her choices rather than sitting as static backdrop. The space feels specific and atmospheric enough to be memorable, even if it doesn’t impose hard constraints on what’s possible.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, and ice-crystal violin are vivid, sensorially rich, and consistently filtered through Lira’s attention. Setting elements constrain or charge choices: the observatory as archive, the plants in her office-turned-greenhouse, and the fragile violin all shape what she can do and what it costs. The final images—plants rooting into the foundation, mulberry stain, stardust—reconfigure the space into a charged microcosm of her decision. A slight excess of lush description edges toward ornamental in a few lines but doesn’t undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: the aurora’s pulses guide her timing, the skyborne grotto and threshold of stillness both constrain options, and the pool’s physical cracking directly escalates risk. Details like bioluminescent moss, obsidian runes, and the liquid starlight pool feel purposeful rather than decorative, and they evolve with the action. The environment explicitly charges the final image (the stabilized threshold, aurora’s “approval”), giving the space thematic weight. This is a strong example of worldbuilding serving both plot and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “umbral grotto above the clouds” with its “vineyard hush,” mist-shrouded pools, and ancient elderwood feels textured and distinct, with details clearly filtered through Lirael’s reverence. The environment mirrors and softens the emotional stakes, and recurring objects (tree, clouds, shell) are nicely embedded in place. However, the grotto rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more thematic backdrop than active pressure. That keeps the atmosphere strong but short of fully indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse, wind, and chimes are vivid and functionally integrated, with the environment literally producing the “truth-song” that must be interpreted. The cloak, mirror shard, and chimes operate as tools and micro-settings that constrain choices and perception. Weather and architecture (wind, windows, tower, dawn) are not postcard garnish; they press on the method and the mood. This is strong, economical setting work that meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto, pond, and floating platform are vivid and specific, with magnetic hum, liquid-mercury starlight, and bioluminescent moss all integrated into action. The environment isn’t just pretty; the pond and its ripples are the operative mechanism of the experiment and of the final realization. World rules (magnetic field bending time inward) are introduced through observation and maintained consistently. The recurring image of the ripples concretely charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon of bone towers and “endless echoes” is vivid, distinctive, and consistently filtered through Kael’s perception. Environmental elements (echoed voices, ancient carvings, layered dust) support the tone of long, devotional study and subtly mirror his obsession with the past. The stone arrowhead as a recurring object ties setting, history, and the pulse together and charges several key beats. Still, the setting rarely constrains specific tactical choices in scene; it’s more atmospheric than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, hollow core, keystone, and impossible garden are vividly rendered with concrete, sensuous detail (frosted arches, moss-covered paths, glowing flowers). Setting is integrated into action: mist walking interacts with the ice walls, the keystone literally reshapes space, and altitude contrasts with the lush sanctuary. The environment mirrors the thematic movement from cold abstraction to intimate warmth. Still, the setting mostly enables rather than constrains choice; it could push harder on his options to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, docks, and sunken library are rendered with rich, purposeful detail (“wooden planks groaned like old bones,” warped book spines, brine and decay) and always filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The wreck and the pristine inner library meaningfully shape his choices and the final image: he must wade in, unlock door 13, and that enclosed space becomes the crucible for his revaluation of memory and sound. Setting isn’t mere backdrop; the hotel key and the numbered door interact with place to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ambered observatory deck, crystalline bubble, and shrinking cosmos are vividly evoked and feel integral rather than generic. Tools and environment (console, sensors, holograms, coins in amber light) are actively used rather than merely described, and the setting tone supports the elegiac, end-of-universe mood. The observatory doesn’t sharply constrain options, but it does function as a charged, liminal space where his choice/realization must occur. Sensory selection skews visual but is controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory is vividly realized—dust, rust, cracked marble, celestial gears—and consistently filtered through Elias’s purpose and profession. The setting is not a postcard; it supplies the wax cylinders, the broken clock that hid the atlas, and the dusk light required for the prism ritual, so environment constrains tactics. Atmospheric details like “stars winked into view, their light ancient and indifferent” charge the final image thematically. A small further integration of physical obstacles or practical constraints could elevate it even more.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sapphire viaduct, oxidized bell, and churning sea are vividly and economically rendered, giving a strong sense of material place and atmosphere. Setting isn’t just postcard: the height, glass, niche, and water flow concretely shape Elias’s tactics with the bell and the drip. The environment also mirrors theme—the exhausted sea and brittle glass echo his brittle devotion—without feeling heavy-handed. A touch more sensory variety under peak pressure could push this higher, but it already operates at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridgeway, reservoir, receding waterline, and skeletal town are vivid and specific, with details like “foundations like broken teeth” and the mossy churchyard integrating setting into mood and theme. The environment functions as a liminal space where the past resurfaces, charging the final image of walking the ridgeway along a trail of photographs. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it meaningfully shapes atmosphere and the conceptual stakes around erasure versus remembrance. World rules (drowned distillery, aging dam, exposed ruins) stay coherent and support the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and starling-filled sky are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elara’s gaze, creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. Setting elements do more than decorate: the orchard as secluded lab, the waterfall as veil to the outside world, and the starlings as “sky script” all shape how she approaches the crystal. The recurring objects (crystal, flame, starling) charge the final images and feel coherently of this place. A slight bias toward the visual over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vividly and specifically rendered—bioluminescent veins, mossy nodes, liquid-silver clouds, hidden city below—and consistently filtered through Kael’s technical attentiveness. Setting is not just backdrop: the nodes, canopy, and heights directly shape the problem and the solution. The parachute buckle-as-key functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his options and charges the final image. World rules remain consistent, though the piece could lean even more on environmental constraint (e.g., physical peril in the trees) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock dojo, chasm, and rewriting sky are vivid and quickly legible, and details like the cracking platform and stones falling into the abyss integrate setting into the action. The environment supports tone and theme (precarious ground under an unstable sky mirroring identity flux). The final image of descending on invisible paths as the vortex stabilizes effectively uses setting to charge the resolution. It stops short of being fully constraining—fall risk and altitude don’t significantly alter tactics—but the specificity and integration are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The brook, the nocturnal haven, and the storm are vividly rendered and recur in ways that matter: brook soil is used to plant the seed, the plant migrates to the brook, and the final key and future-room vision are framed by that setting. The workshop details (bench, lamp, spectrometer) are selective and character-colored. Environment does subtly constrain choices—his proximity to the brook enables the particular planting and the final discovery—but the pressure remains gentle rather than urgent. Still, the setting significantly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered—condensation, grooves of laughter, flickering bulb—and these details feel purposeful rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes events: the tunnel’s acoustics and “echo-storing” nature are the entire basis of Marlowe’s method and the final eruption of light and voices. The leaf blower and bulb act as micro-setting objects that frame constraint and effort. A touch more interplay between physical space and his tactics or movement could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen garden and mist are vividly drawn and consistently used as more than backdrop: they cloak Mara, distort sound, and literally part to reveal the moss path. The library atrium is efficiently but evocatively rendered, and the recurring tools (lantern, fountain) help stage the key turns. A bit more concrete interaction with the harshness of the cold or physical constraints of the space could push the environment from strong mood to inescapable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly woven into the action: the ember nexus, obsidian plateau, ash winds, and smog-choked sky all filter through Kael’s stressed perception. The environment isn’t mere backdrop; the nexus’s shuddering, fading glow and ember winds mirror and pressure his race against decay, and the crozier functions as a charged tool-object that constrains his tactics. The final image—“The ember nexus bloomed at last, frozen in twilight’s embrace.”—beautifully reweights earlier details and ties atmosphere to thematic closure. A slight increase in how the physical constraints (heat, ash, fumes) affect his body and options would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned radio tower city above the gorge is vividly and consistently rendered, with strong atmospheric detail (“scent of ozone and decay,” rusted girders, river of light). Setting is filtered through Kael’s professional eye, turning towers into antennas and corridors into conduits in his vision, which deepens both world and character. The environment does modestly shape action—he climbs the spire, works at the observation deck, and the gorge’s latent energy becomes literalized in the ending image. The setting feels integral, though it could constrain his choices even more directly to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The spectral grotto, liquid starlight, bioluminescent veins, and shifting docks are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action rather than feeling like backdrop. Crucially, the environment constrains tactics—the radio is tuned to match the grotto’s pulsations and the veins’ patterns teach the “language” Kael must echo. The final image of the Hourglass constellation and the earlier fungal spirals echo the core object and reweight the ending. A slight excess of lushness in places keeps this just shy of the very top tier, but the integration of setting, tool, and theme is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Optical Illusion Gallery is vividly and economically realized—glass façade as “liquid fractals,” living floor, infinite mirrors—and the environment meaningfully shapes the story’s logic and events. The setting directly enables the eruption and the transition into the infinite web space, and the final glance back at the gallery reinforces its role as a threshold. Sensory detail leans visual, but it’s purposeful and well-filtered through Clara’s conceptual focus. World rules are internally consistent within this surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The benthic city, the reinforced glass dome, abyssal darkness, and bioluminescent aliens are vivid and cohesive, and they strongly support the tone. Details are filtered through Lirael’s professional gaze (constellations, geometry, edges), which helps specificity feel character-driven. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete options; pressure, cold, and depth are mentioned but don’t force tactical decisions. The recurring chain link as object-setting enriches the atmosphere and theme more than it shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium is vivid and textured—“bruised violet” twilight, moss, fountain, piano, cobwebbed gallery all create a strong, coherent mood integrated with Lila’s movements. Details are filtered through her work and sensibility rather than feeling like a tourist list. While the setting mostly supports atmosphere rather than constraining concrete choices, the atrium as a place “where the dead called” and the fountain as the locus of the photo do subtly shape what can happen and where. The recurrence of mist and interior architecture into the final beats helps charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: rust and salt in the air, moss-slick walls, tidal flooding, and rusted 1947 machines all feel tactile and era-specific. The environment directly pressures choices—the “between tidal changes” window and rising water constrain her time and movement. The undersea infrastructure and the facility’s decayed purpose culminate in the final idea of cables as etched memorials, charging the last image. Detail selection is purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal observatory under snow is vivid and specific, with frost-laced windows, the dome, and old computers woven into action rather than static description. The porcelain shard and ink function as micro-setting elements that recur and charge the final image. The environment mirrors the internal state (cold, isolating, humming with “ghost” signals) effectively, even if it rarely constrains concrete tactics. Strong atmosphere, just shy of using the setting as a real physical limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon of echoes and bone towers are strikingly specific and integrated into action: echoes distort birdsong, towers serve as vantage points and then vibrate, and the narrow ledge plus abyss shape her physical risk and final act. World rules (echoes multiply sound, runes respond to resonance) are learned through her experiment rather than exposition. The environment isn’t just decorative; it demands payment and literally swallows the diamond, charging the closure image. A slight further evolution of sensory detail under peak stress (e.g., how sound physically assaults her) could push this toward truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underground garden is sensuously realized—humid air, moss-caked roots, mushroom stool, rusted phone—and consistently filtered through Elara’s scientific lens. Setting details (“The earth doesn’t forgive,” heavier confessions underground) resonate thematically and color her choices, even if they rarely hard-constrain movement. The recurring arrowhead functions as a tool-object that decisively charges the final image. A bit more use of physical layout or environmental constraint in her key choice could make the setting structurally, not just atmospherically, indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard is vividly specific and strongly filtered through Lira’s perspective—metallic peaches, humming grass, liquid starlight—and the sky-bridge and statues are spatially coherent. Setting is not mere backdrop: the statues’ patrols, the crack in the stone, and the orchard’s suppressed magic all constrain and enable Lira’s tactics. The final image of the remade orchard listening back charges the environment with new meaning. Description density is high but largely purposeful and never leaves us in a white room.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt arcade, jagged border, and bottled storm are vividly rendered and tightly woven to tone and theme; images like “neon veins pulsing like a wound stitched with light” establish a strong atmospheric baseline. The storm physically affects the environment—lightning over barbed wire, machines flickering to life—and those changes charge the final mood and thematic reweighting. Setting is consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, avoiding tourist-catalog description. The one shortfall keeping it from an even higher band is that the environment shapes emotional stakes more than it constrains concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned circus train, carousel, and hidden courtyard are vividly rendered with strong, purposeful sensory detail that aligns well with Elio’s sensibility. Recurring objects (wind bells, the halo fragment, the fountain, wildflowers) contribute to atmosphere and to the final charged image of renewal. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does shape the emotional stakes and the thematic arc from rusted abandonment to living oasis. Overall, setting is a clear strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scientific poetry library is vivid and particular—Edison bulbs, leather volumes like *Theorems of Moonlight*, floating manuscripts in the hidden room—and all are filtered through Eleanor’s sensibility. The scarf, books, and diagrams form a cohesive micro-setting that supports the magical transition. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does deeply charge the final mood and meaning. The space feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the piece’s quiet uncanny.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering archipelago and lighthouse are rendered with rich, selective detail—salt, bruised sky, stones that “breathed secrets”—creating a strong atmospheric anchor. The environment is thematically fused with the premise (a place where time folds, dreams flee, and light behaves strangely), and this strangeness underpins the key turn when light “pools” and resists blending. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactical choices, it does charge both the ritual and the final image (the archipelago’s “approval”). World rules are consistent enough for a lyrical mode and never confuse orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight,” damp moss, and cobbled alley create a strong, consistent atmosphere that suits the metaphysical premise. Setting is filtered through Elias’s perspective and the starlight/nexus meaningfully participate in the turn (the star pulses, the nexus reshapes reality). Details are selective and not overstuffed, though they lean heavily on the visual and cosmic register. The environment charges the mood more than it tactically constrains choice, which keeps it from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are vivid, strange, and consistently filtered through Elias’s professional gaze, giving us salt-crusted glass, kelp-tangled masts, luminous fungi. Setting details are economical yet rich, and they evolve with the action (the tide rising, the wading among wrecks, the fairy ring as both focus and final perch). The environment shapes method more than it constrains physical choices, but recurring objects (fairy ring, sextant, locket) clearly charge the closing image. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk from tide and rust could have deepened the setting’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The forgotten library, ivy-draped stone, damp parchment air, and the playground swing’s creak form a vivid, unified atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Details like the “shard of amber sunlight trapped between two panes” are sensorially rich and thematically charged, returning at the end as a metaphor for changing fate. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics (Lirael could arguably perform this scene in any secluded room), but it does meaningfully charge the final image and underwrite the idea of exile and hidden knowledge. Integration of setting into perception and action is consistently strong.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “verdant parapet,” mossy stones, and waterfall threshold are sensorially rich and tightly bound to the magic’s mechanics. The environment subtly constrains action (slippery climb, edge of the falls, needing the pool as portal) and charges the final image as the waterfall’s song returns to harmony. Detail is selective rather than touristic, filtered through Elara’s working intimacy with the orchard. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere, just short of the very highest band where setting would impose sharper tactical constraints or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight is vivid and tonally integrated, with refracted light and humming glass establishing an otherworldly but coherent space. The setting’s rule—that it “accumulates” and must eventually “let go”—directly motivates the timing of this ritual. Environmental detail (prisms, starlight, attic, labeled box) is economical and consistently filtered through Mara’s task. The setting enriches mood and theme more than it constrains concrete choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: rain-scoured frescoes, moss-buried stones, and the glowing henge all mirror the shift from eroded to intact meaning. Environmental details (rain, chill, light bleeding through the stone, the descent underground) are integrated into action rather than feeling postcard-like. The repeated fresco/saint imagery directly charges the final chapel image, where the saints now smile. The world’s rules (silent vibration, threshold-like henge) stay internally consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken ship library is vividly evoked—the warped shelves, salt-crusted books, pressure-distorted space—and the environment’s hush and decay nicely mirror Elara’s preoccupations with entropy and memory. The underwater setting supplies critical tools (tape recorder, tuning fork) that make the plot possible, rather than serving as pure backdrop. The recurring micro-setting of the snow globe functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image. Still, the physical constraints of being underwater remain mostly atmospheric; the environment shapes mood and discovery more than it tactically limits or redirects action.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The courtyard above the clouds, the mist, and the humming stones are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, creating a convincing liminal space. Weather and environment meaningfully interact with the premise (the ghost thrives in storms, the stones “carry” the code), and the plate as a handled object charges the final image. The setting feels integral to the act of encoding and to the tone, not a postcard backdrop. It stops short of constraining specific tactical choices under pressure, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire, frozen elevator, and clouds below are vivid and specific, with details like frost on the glass and dust sparkling “like starlight” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it deeply colors perception and metaphor (ice vs. flame, prison vs. lens, ascent vs. grief). The goggles and scattered light function almost as micro-settings, changing what can be seen and understood. The final image—“Somewhere above the clouds, a flame flickered”—feels organically rooted in this environment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sky gondola, crumbling tower, brass telescope, and cloudscapes create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Lila’s professional eye. The environment isn’t just pretty; the broken tether and drifting heighten the sense of suspended fate, and the telescope becomes a charged micro-setting that carries into the final image. Weather and sky are integrated into action (her categorization work) rather than being static backdrop. A slightly stronger sense of physical peril from the setting could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oak trunk library is richly realized—damp bark, hollowed interior, shelves, hidden panel—and the environment directly shapes action through the panel’s placement, the grain’s star patterns, and the physical threat of demolition. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet soil, old parchment, dust raining at impact) and the later contrast with the “starless city sky” reweights the setting at the end. The only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band is that the demolition site’s physical logistics and danger remain slightly abstract rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The antique airship, copper hull, and starling-filled sky are vividly rendered and feel lived-in, and the dusty hopscotch board is a strong, specific anchor that doubles as a map. The environment does shape choice: only an airship at this altitude and position can follow murmurations into that void, and the cargo hold’s forgotten game literally hides the coordinates. Setting details are filtered through Lira’s professional gaze (constellations, coordinates), which helps integrate worldbuilding with character. While weather/airship mechanics don’t constrain tactics in granular ways, the sky and birds very clearly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library, cloud-perched and frostbound, is vivid and sensorially rich, with details filtered through Kael’s perceptions. Environment supports tone and concept: mirrors, frost, and cold all echo memory, fragility, and repair. Setting does constrain tactics slightly (searching reflections, scraping frost, hidden alcove) though not in a high-pressure way. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet, pearl-fruited trees, floating rock arches, and nebula of respite create a vivid, distinctive environment. Setting is not just backdrop: the arches’ crumbling and the nebula’s fragility define the stakes, and the arch physically anchors the climactic scene. The butterfly bell functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image. A slight limitation is that sensory detail leans heavily visual and atmospheric, with less tactile constraint on tactics moment to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, cliff, fog, rust, and the pane of hush create a vivid, tactile environment whose specific properties constrain the action and charge the final images (the tower shuddering, pane cracking). The setting is filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lenses (“even time could rust”), and the micro-setting (pane, stairs, satchel) is tightly integrated. Weather and isolation support the tone and stakes without feeling like postcard description. This could edge higher only if the physical environment posed a more explicit obstacle or choice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the cliffside labyrinth, frost, mechanical birds, crumbling fountain, and pulsing roots all interact with Kael’s choices. Environmental constraints (birds patrolling above, frost strengthening illusions, hidden door under water) materially shape tactics and the story’s climax. Details are filtered through Kael’s bias—his hatred of the birds, familiarity with the map—and the final image of frost blooming and roots thrumming charges the closing stakes. It falls just short of the very highest band because the “cliffside” aspect never meaningfully constrains movement beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The braided ravine and river foam are vivid, sensorially specific, and tightly tied to Elara’s way of noticing as a chemist. The environment isn’t just backdrop; its behavior (braiding, clustering foam) directly triggers the central conceptual shift and recurs in the final release of the chrysalis. The contrast with the studio gives just enough counter-setting to ground the emotional pivot without diluting focus. A slight tendency toward overt symbolism (“three rivers twisting like strands of rope”) keeps it just shy of exceptional subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the glass orchard library on clouds, prismatic panes, jars of particularized absences—creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elara’s priorities as a vendor of nothingness, which keeps the world from feeling like a catalog. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it does charge the final image of stars on glass and the library’s hum of “untold stories,” deepening thematic resonance. This is high-caliber scene-setting, just shy of truly tactical use of environment.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: desert fortress after rare rain, coral icebound pavilion, and vials of liquid memory all feel lived-in and specific. Environmental details are POV-filtered through a chef who “tastes” spaces, which deepens both worldbuilding and character. The pavilion’s cold, the wet stone, and the rare rain all affect what he can sense and how he acts. The final image of the fortress “tempered by the rain” elegantly ties atmosphere to thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astronomical clock tower and grain elevator are richly rendered and tightly integrated into meaning, not merely backdrop; dials tracking constellations, multilingual bells, and “rust and grain” language all filter through Elara’s perception. The setting actively charges the final image: the repaired weight, the chime at midnight, and the villagers gathered at the tower base all depend on this architecture and its symbolism. Environmental specifics (candlelight, stone steps, iron gears) are well-chosen and not generic. The world-building’s only limit, at this length, is that the rules of the tower’s semi-sentience remain evocatively loose rather than fully embodied in constraint and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moonlit canyon, shifting symbols, and canyon-as-memory-vessel are vivid and consistently filtered through Kael’s attention. The setting isn’t just decorative: the canyon is explicitly where things are “buried” and where “the rocks remember,” making it the source of the memories he accesses. Tools and environment (mirror shards, laser, headband, liquid crystal) are tactile and integrated into action rather than listed. The final charged image—the transformed mirror showing “a mosaic of entangled memories” in that canyon context—feels strongly rooted in place.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto, mist, moss-slick stone, and clandestinely luminous walls create a vividly textured, integrated environment that directly shapes Lira’s navigation and the rules of the world. Gravity inversion, mist-thickening, and tight tunnels all meaningfully influence action and perception rather than functioning as backdrop. The manuscript and keys also work as charged objects within this setting logic. The only minor limitation is that environmental danger never quite sharpens into real physical risk, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The siskin alder grove, stump, moss, and porcelain insulator form a tightly integrated micro-setting that is vivid and sensorial without feeling like a static postcard. Environmental specifics (the grove thickening into an amphitheater, moss cradling sound, hedgehog as seasonal marker) both mirror and enable the story’s central action. The setting tangibly shapes the climax and final image: the stump as instrument, alders as audience and later performers, shards buried beneath. World rules around a silent world and vibratory listening stay internally consistent and are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The magnetic nexus, twilight sky, and basalt monolith are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action: the nexus’s pull, the eclipse, and the stone all interlock to enable the covenant’s revelation. World rules (star-mages, basalt, constellations as chessboard) are implied through concrete images instead of exposition. The setting actively shapes the climax—this revelation can only happen here and now—rather than serving as a backdrop. The recurring stone-as-micro-setting and the nexus’s center as planting site also charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The workshop, its tools, and the fireworks outside are vividly rendered and strongly atmospheric, with good integration of sensory detail (“aged wood and soldering flux,” the rattling window, the grimy glass). The environment does more than decorate: it supplies the tools and acoustic context for the frequency-based solution and frames the thematic contrast between internal quiet and external celebration. Still, the setting rarely constrains choice in a way that raises stakes; it supports tone more than it pressures action. The recurring window/fireworks image nicely charges the final moments but doesn’t fully transform options.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The treetop village, mist-shrouded valley, and Lira’s scent-focused perception create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific rather than generic-fantasy. Environmental details (lanterns, wooden walkways, fog, canopy light) are filtered through her herbalist priorities and tied to the corpse flower’s growth. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully charge the story’s mood and final image of communal gathering around the bloom. The sensory palette, especially smell and light, is used with intention rather than as a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet with floating arches, midair rivers, and inversion effects is vivid, sensorially rich, and integral to the story’s logic. Setting details (roots in cracks, pooling spheres of water, thrashing vines) are consistently filtered through Lira’s attention and profession. The arches and inversion directly shape both the problem and the solution, and the final image of strengthened golden vines charges the thematic turn. A bit of descriptive density borders on ornamental, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly realized and tightly integrated with plot: the arrangement creates the deadly wind phenomena, shapes her path, and literally has to be climbed to reach the climax. Details like salt-stained gravel, sodium lights, and the electrical buzz support tone without feeling touristic. Crucially, the environment constrains options and charges the final image of the port as a hungry machine. This is one of the story’s most publication-ready elements.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and marble worksite are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with action (the ice responds to sound and color; the aurora provides the method; the marble pulses with inner light). Details like “frost spiraled like ghostly breath” and “sculpted hush made flesh” are specific and character-filtered through Lira’s sensibility. The environment materially shapes what can happen—sound interacts with ice, distance necessitates nonverbal, synesthetic connection to Veyra. The final image of the transformed cavern, laughing and humming under the aurora, is charged by all this prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thunder-Echo Range, the canyon’s “avalanchingly quiet heart,” the obsidian staircase, and the time-pooled chamber are vivid, specific, and filtered through Kael’s role and mission. The setting does more than decorate: Veil’s Edge and the echoing range justify why the ritual must happen here and charge the silence/sound motif that culminates in the final twilight walk and rearranged markers. Environmental details stay consistent and tactile (driftwood, runes, petrified pine, ozone) and evolve with the plot. The world feels large beyond the scene without bogging down in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the valley of thinning starlight, the burnt sapphire smell, the brass-and-ink letterpress all feel concretely realized. The halo fragment functions as a charged micro-setting object, constraining choices and anchoring the climax when it settles into his palm. The workshop itself is more atmospheric than tactical, but its tools (press, glass case) integrate naturally into the action. Sensory details remain purposeful and filtered through Elias’s analytical yet wonder-struck gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and tightly integrated into action (“Plant it where the aurora touches the stone”), not just a backdrop. Weather, light, and terrain (slick frost, twilight, coiling aurora) all shape mood and the ritual itself. The recurring objects—the pendant, the sapling—are spatially coherent and charge the final image. There’s room for slightly more tactile interaction with the environment under peak pressure, but what’s here is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and car window are vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The arbor and prism function as charged objects that frame both the experiment and the final realization. Environment does modestly shape action (using the frosted car as medium, stepping into the arbor), though it could constrain choices more aggressively. Overall, specificity and integration are strong, just not yet transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensory and occupational lens (cloth on branches, the loom’s creak, the amber bead in her palm). Setting details like the creek, the crow chase through the bamboo, and the weather shift on the breakthrough morning are active rather than postcard. The environment also charges the final images—the travelers’ visits, the whispering bamboo—which helps the ending resonate. The orchard could constrain or shape a concrete tactical choice once more directly (beyond atmosphere) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard planet with floating rock arches, the mine tunnels, and the cavern of fractured core shards are vivid and specific, giving this piece a strong atmospheric signature. Setting details are generally purposeful—the arches’ trembling and the pale fruit mirror the world’s decay, and the cavern’s shards concretize planetary pain. The environment shapes tactic only lightly: Jorin simply walks the tunnels and chooses one passage; the arches and orchards are more backdrop and payoff image than constraints. Still, the recurring arches and silk provide a charged visual frame that helps the final transformation land.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned repair bay and its transformation into a gleaming alternate version are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (skeletal gantries, emergency lights, hovering ship). The setting is filtered through Kael’s tools and profession, which strengthens atmosphere and plausibility. While the environment mainly serves as a stage rather than an active constraint, the platform and bay function well as a charged locus for the portal. The recurring physical space at both ends underlines the parallel-world conceit without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, and sea are vividly and economically rendered (“air tasted of iron and brine,” windows rattling, salt-streaked walls), always filtered through Elias’s long familiarity. Setting is not postcard-static; it shapes his role, underlines isolation, and charges key objects (lamp, window, stones, glass). The haunted room and the failing lamp meaningfully inflect the final image of a “new kind of light,” so environment clearly charges closure. Minor opportunity remains to let the physical danger of the sea/rocky coast constrain choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald lighthouse, cliff, and roaring ocean are vividly rendered and recur as an environmental pressure (wind, height, isolation) rather than postcard backdrop. The lantern and its glass serve as a micro-setting/tool that directly channels and contains the magic, and the final image of the lighthouse’s light cutting the dark is thematically charged. Sensory detail leans visual and auditory but feels purposeful and filtered through her practiced familiarity. The setting doesn’t quite constrain a concrete tactical choice beyond stepping to the edge, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is a major strength: the floating rock tea house, valley mist, obsidian stones, and sun slicing through clouds all feel specific and integrated with Lin’s perception. Light and environment actively shape meaning—sun trails, reflective stone, and mist become tools in how she senses and “tracks” stories. World rules are consistent and learned through observation, not exposition dumps. The final image of mist burning away under morning heat effectively charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is a major strength: the stormlit tower, damp stone, moonlight that heals, and root-lined corridor all feel vivid and specific. Environmental details meaningfully interact with action—the moonlight heals his cut and seems to power the tower’s properties; the wall’s shimmer permits passage; the roots transmit memories. The world rules are consistent and mostly shown through experience, not exposition dumps, despite a few explanatory sentences. The atmosphere supports the contemplative, uncanny tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the alchemical orchard, mica windows as “lungs,” endless night and a twin realm of erasing light—and these details are not mere backdrop but linked to function (capturing dreams, exhaling woven dawns). Environmental elements (fruit lighting, windows glowing, night fraying) charge the final image and embody the theme of moderated light and memory. Rules of the world are consistent enough for this length and learned through observation and action rather than exposition dumps. A touch more tactile interaction under pressure (e.g., constraints imposed by glass, cold, or fatigue) would push this into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library and secret Society spaces are vividly and economically drawn—the oak shelves, vaulted ceilings, candlelit chambers, and mirror room all feel concrete and tonally unified. Setting is filtered through Eleanor’s state (e.g., perceiving the library as both relic and refuge), and the Third Shelf functions as a charged micro-location for closure. The hidden-in-plain-sight quality of the setting aligns with the theme of unseen threads and concealed grief. Still, the environment mostly supports mood rather than constraining action in a way that would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tea house and overgrown palace courtyard are vivid and sensorially grounded—damp earth, jasmine, moss-speckled floorboards, ivy-choked roof—and the garden’s growth is tightly interwoven with Elias’s inner movement. The environment isn’t just scenic; it hosts the impossible bread, the humming walls, and the guerrilla garden that embodies resistance to “creeping normality.” The final image of a thriving courtyard in a sleeping city gives the setting real closing weight. It could press on practical choice a bit more, but as atmosphere-plus-symbolic engine it’s strong.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly realized—frosted panes, sagging shelves, illusions in the walls, ice prism—and these details are integrated with action rather than feeling like static backdrop. The environment lightly constrains tactics (she uses an ice prism; the wind and frost underscore fragility) and the dawn above the clouds charges the final image. However, the setting could exert more direct pressure on her choices beyond mood and tools. It’s rich, atmospheric, and specific, just shy of being fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pirate market under the pier is vividly realized through smell, texture, and social logic, and the clock tower plus bell chamber are specific, spatially coherent micro-settings. Environmental features constrain action—the hidden market, spiral stairs, bell, and pedestal all shape how Lira must approach the device. The recurring watch fob object functions as a micro-setting tool that shapes choices and charges the final image. A slight further evolution of how the dissolving market interacts with her escape could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lavender bluff under aurora, the elections of the forests, and the sensory-laden soil are richly specific and strongly integrated with the premise. Setting details are not mere backdrop; the bluff is the epicenter the compass points toward and the elections’ effects are felt in rumble, light fracture, and taste. The environment mirrors and amplifies the concept of places carrying weather and pain. It stops short of tightly constraining tactics, but it meaningfully charges the story’s atmosphere and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered—humming walls, refracted lantern light, moss under his knees—and these details are filtered through Elias’s artistic sensibility. The environment meaningfully participates in the central device: crystals and lantern light interacting with the canvas to cast the door-shadow, and the cave’s hush mirroring his internal silence. It doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does shape tone and the mechanics of the key image. High-level atmospheric work, just short of utterly indispensable constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and layered sectors are sharply rendered and feel materially inhabited (“moss-slick floors,” “Venus flytrap fens,” spores, filtered domes). Setting directly constrains action (nectar to placate carnivorous plants, the hazardous descent to Sector 7-B) and underpins the AI’s use of conversations as dome fuel. The final image—returning to plant the orb at the dried oasis—recharges the world-building in a thematically coherent way. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in the opening paragraph flirts with ornament, but most detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bluff above the clouds, the mist, the bells, and the kinetic apparatus are vividly rendered and integrated into action—wind, light, and melting ice literally produce the music. The environment constrains and enables choices (a high, secluded bluff as sanctuary; visitors must climb; the wind and altitude are functional, not postcard dressing). The recurring objects (bells, iceberg fragment) charge the final image and track consistently. The piece stops just shy of 9+ because the setting rarely pressures Elara’s tactics; it mainly supports her vision.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dome, desert roses, ozone-and-lavender air, and petal-shaped solar panels are evocative and tightly tied to Clara’s role and the thematic box/containment motif. The glass dome as a macro “box” reconfigures meaning at the end, charging the closure image. Environmental pressures (magnetic storm, dimming lights) are felt but stay mostly atmospheric rather than fully constraining her tactical options. Overall, setting is vivid, purposeful, and integrated into character perception without sliding into static tour-guide description.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The courtyard at dawn, with damp earth, cobblestones, and the tarnished mailbox, is vividly rendered and tonally cohesive. Details are selective and tied to Clara’s sensibility as a curator who notices textures and age. While the setting creates atmosphere and a sense of community, it rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond providing a plausible gathering point and the physical presence of the mailbox. The environmental specificity supports mood more than pressure but does so at a strong level.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken laboratory and harbor are vividly rendered (“concrete bones entwined with kelp and rust”), with environmental details woven into action rather than listed. The setting meaningfully shapes events through the airlock, holographic projector, security drones, and the sinking lab, not just as backdrop. Recurring objects (the dice, the vial) and the watery ruin atmosphere charge the final image of the lab sinking and the dice in his pocket. A slight opportunity remains to let the physical constraints of being underwater press more directly on tactics and time.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The docks, whale carcass, cliffside flowers, and above all the salt crystal chamber are vividly realized and sensorially specific, giving the story a strong physical and tonal anchor. World rules (gravity pockets, luminous jagged crystals) are largely learned through Elias’s movement and discovery, not exposition. The chamber and crystals matter functionally—they hide the panel, form the tunnel, and are the substrate where memories are stored—so the setting meaningfully shapes what can happen. A bit more interaction between environment and risk (e.g., salt’s fragility or danger) would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, moss, and fireflies are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the mood and magic (“When the crane’s wing drinks the brook’s reflection…”). The environment feels tactile and lived-in, and the water is functionally necessary for the ritual. That said, the setting rarely constrains choice or introduces friction; it primarily supports atmosphere rather than exerting pressure. Still, for a short, quiet piece, the specificity and consistency are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop garden, old library, and dome under the meteor shower are vividly and economically rendered, with details like wisteria, cracked pavers, and the hum of traffic grounding the scene. The environment supports tone and theme (sleeping building, celestial timing) rather than feeling like a postcard. The Leonids as a cyclical cosmic event meaningfully charge the ritual and final moment. The setting rarely constrains physical options, but it does conceptually shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet garden, seashells, and ash-scattered dawn are sensuously rendered and strongly filtered through Lirael’s perceptions; the environment mirrors and charges her inner state without feeling like a mere backdrop. The setting evolves causally—the garden shudders, roses lose color, stems skeletonize—as a direct consequence of her actions, and its erasure at the end carries emotional weight. The seashells function as both tools and charged objects anchoring the magic. A slightly broader sensory range (sound, temperature, tactile discomfort) at the peak would push this further.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora’s pearl twilight, and dripping stalactites create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically apt (“liquid time” mirroring her work with history). The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, but it does charge the images of time, penance, and secrecy, especially with the hidden niche and the aurora washing over her at the end. Details like moss-veined floor and carved forgotten gods are specific and filtered through the ritualistic mood of her task. World rules remain consistent and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, and standing stones are vividly and economically evoked, with strong integration into action (climbing, pressing the shell to stone, the summit circle). The environment feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the mythic melancholy of the piece. While the setting shapes the story’s logic (echoes trapped in stone, climbing as pilgrimage), it rarely constrains tactical choices under pressure; there is atmosphere more than hazard. The recurring shell and carved symbols effectively charge the final image, boosting the sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glacier shrine, candlelight, and “borrowed starlight” are vivid and tonally cohesive, and the ice environment frames both opening and ending. The snow globe and altar work well as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Environmental specificity is strong and consistently filtered through Kael’s vocation and sensibility. The setting mostly amplifies mood rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, textural, and thematically integrated: harbor lights, mist, parapet stones, tide, and fireflies all mirror the focus on subtle labor and pattern. The “whispering parapet” and post-rain atmosphere shape what is possible to perceive (sounds, lights, subtle movements), effectively steering Kael’s attention and the story’s mood. The bamboo whisk and the fireflies operate as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. This is elite-level atmospheric work, even if it doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The wasteland orchard and radioactive dust storms are vivid, specific, and repeatedly engaged—trees leaning inward, dust freezing, chamber under the soil—so the environment feels integral rather than decorative. Setting details are filtered through Mara’s investigative lens, which keeps description purposeful. Crucially, the orchard/stillpoint ecology constrains the core choice and charges the final image (cleaner air, relaxing trees), meeting the “object/setting as pressure” test. A bit more tactile interaction under pressure (e.g., physical difficulty moving in a storm) could sharpen the constraint even further.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, and city-as-feral-circuit-board are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Kael’s perceptions. The environment constrains and enables his project (altitude for clarity, storm as language, the portico as literal prism) and directly shapes the climax when refracted light alters the hourglass and his understanding. The recurring objects—the portico, hourglass, storm—clearly charge the final image. Description is dense but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes” with salt, sand-drifted floorboards, and dawn light in “wistful gold” creates a strong, specific atmosphere, and the mother-of-pearl music box is sharply rendered. Setting is filtered through Elias’s sensibility, and the recurring return to the loft charges the final image. However, the environment mostly functions as mood and container rather than an active constraint on choices or tactics. The piece is richly atmospheric but doesn’t quite use setting as pressure, which limits it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drift-ice marina, golden sunset, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail and a consistent emotional palette. Setting is not just backdrop; the ice’s hum, creaks, and the lighthouse beam all tie into the story’s sonic and liminal themes. The environment shapes tone more than tactics, though the ice as conduit for vibrations is a nice functional touch. The final image of the beam sweeping the water and “guiding ships—and perhaps souls—home” effectively charges the setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, viaduct, and iron filings are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action (moonlight through the fissure, ice refraction, the hum vibrating the lake). Environment meaningfully constrains the method—he must work with the frozen surface and moon’s angle, and the lake’s thaw reweights the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, with weather and stone shaping tone and tactics rather than functioning as static backdrop. Worldbuilding feels coherent and embodied without lapsing into exposition-tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly evoked—the damp echo after rain, mildew smell, grated floor, and shaking as the train passes all create a tactile, oppressive atmosphere. The tunnel’s continuity across centuries (runaway slaves to modern maintenance) meaningfully ties setting to theme and to the lantern’s function. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain moment-to-moment tactics beyond housing the secret compartment, it frames isolation and danger credibly. The lantern as a recurring, charged object-as-setting effectively anchors both memory and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The shop is vividly evoked through smell, clutter, and tactile detail (“oil, aged wood, and the faint, metallic tang of clockwork gears”) and the storm outside adds atmospheric counterpoint. The environment feels lived-in and specific to this craft, and it harmonizes with the themes of precision and repair. However, the setting rarely constrains action or forces choices; it’s more thematic backdrop than an active pressure. Still, the clockwork-heart-on-the-counter image does help charge the story’s central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea, sulfurous wind, and corroding mist are concrete, vivid, and tightly woven through action (“acid mist… eating at her tools,” the sea roaring when the algorithm engages). Tools and environment (the *Skein*, the workshop’s machinery, the tower from the sea) constrain choices and charge the final image of the bell’s hum. World rules are consistent enough to feel coherent while remaining fantastical, and the setting strongly supports tone. A bit more direct interaction between the hazardous sea/air and her in-flight tactics could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The social network archive is effectively sketched—servers humming, holographic interfaces, “ghostly impressions in the system’s memory”—and the recurring patch acts as a micro-setting object. The space feels coherent and supports the investigative mood, and the environment briefly constrains action once alarms and drones engage. However, the archive could more sharply shape tactics (e.g., specific constraints of corporate systems or physical layout under threat) rather than serving mostly as atmospheric backdrop. The derelict research station is important conceptually but remains underdescribed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes and salvaged ship mirrors create a striking, original atmosphere, with weather and environment woven into action (“ice groan beneath the lighthouse’s foundation,” “edges cracking like glass”). Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility and mirrors the thematic concern with wreckage, memory, and empathy. The recurring objects—the orchard, floes, aurora, and crystal—charge the final image effectively. The environment lightly constrains action but could press more concretely on her choices to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drift-ice marina is sharply rendered (“skeletal network of docks and ice-encrusted boats”) and more than scenic: the fissure, frozen bay, and cold directly shape what’s possible in the rescue. Environmental details interweave with Lila’s numbness and the story’s liminal tone, and the final image of her at the marina edge with the wind and ice charges the ending. Sensory range is good, though a bit sight- and metaphor-heavy relative to other senses. Overall, the setting feels lived-in and thematically consonant without becoming over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, and autumn weather are vivid and sensorial, and they’re filtered well through Elias’s steady, reflective gaze. Environmental specifics (acidic soil, unpredictable rain, early frost) are thematically integrated into his metaphor about imbalance and thriving. The rain at the end subtly shifts the atmosphere and supports the tonal turn toward lightness. Setting rarely constrains concrete choices, but it consistently charges the mood and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: whisperfield dunes, kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion, and conjured clearings all feel of a piece and sensorially grounded. Environmental elements actively shape the action—the parapet tests worthiness and conducts power, the pavilion urges and then quiets, the dunes erase footprints. The final images (glowing clearings, parapet’s “salute,” humming lattice) are charged by earlier description. This world is memorable and coherent, even if not fully exploited for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Lila’s perceptions and the healing motif; details like vines climbing “like green fingers” and the gold-violet light feel specific and atmospheric. The environment doesn’t so much constrain choices as it charges every reflection and the final image, functioning as a symbolic crucible for her grief. The recurring contrast of organic curves versus industrial straight lines is especially effective. This setting is a major strength and central to the story’s identity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The library is vividly realized—"shadowed," dust motes, cracked leather, dawn light—anchoring time, place, and tone with strong sensory specificity. The crystal as a recurring object meaningfully charges the environment and final image, transforming mere setting into a perceptual tool. The quiet, almost sacred atmosphere of the library directly supports the thematic exploration of hidden patterns. Setting could more actively constrain choices, but as mood and lens for perception it is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The foggy sculpture garden is vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with the junkyard metal forms, pawnshop, and videotapes forming a textured, coherent world. Environment is not just backdrop: the fog, maze-like sculptures, and driftwood from the shoreline shape his tactics and make the markers necessary. Recurring objects (chalk lines, driftwood, humming metal) all feed into the final image, charging the ending with concrete specificity. It stops just short of the very highest band because the environment influences mood and navigation more than it imposes truly inescapable constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory, domes, clouds, ozone, and instruments are sensuously rendered and integrated into action (using telescope, clock, generators). Environment does constrain options somewhat—he’s in an isolated, elevated observatory facing structural damage—but the “lunar” label conflicts with pine scent and mountainside, muddying world-consistency. Details are strongly selective and atmospheric, but the setting could influence tactical choices more sharply. Still, the observatory-as-vessel idea meaningfully charges the central conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds,” lavender scent, and sky imagery create a distinct, almost liminal hospice setting that supports the mood well. Details are economical but vivid—the windows, clouds, and sun all echo the piece’s preoccupation with transition and light through darkness. The vinyl shard doubles as a micro-setting object that charges the final exchange. However, the environment mostly colors emotion rather than constraining choices or tactics, which keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are vividly drawn and meaningfully integrated—the shifting constellation floor, the isle’s shadow, and the thinning veil all feed directly into the climax. Details like brass telescopes, glass domes, and humming runes feel purposeful rather than touristic. Crucially, the isle’s geometry (shadow pointing north; shadows pooling beneath it) constrains the timing and nature of Lirael’s choice, so setting is not just backdrop. A bit more sensory variety beyond visual/auditory would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hedge maze and hidden garden are vividly drawn and quickly legible, with tactile details (ivy, honeysuckle, crumbling fountain) that feel purposeful rather than decorative. The fountain and maze meaningfully constrain choice: the fountain becomes the site of the ritual and the maze’s path literally shifts once the emotional/ magical work is done. The garden’s “tapestry of memories” image reinforces atmosphere while tying into the emotional stakes. A slight increase in how the physical space complicates or endangers action could lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto and its tools are vividly and economically rendered—“serpentine grotto,” “walls…pulsed with a faint, reflectively vibrant glow,” meteorite-iron tool, rune-carved anvil—creating a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting details are integrated with action (the grotto as light source, the jar’s constellations aligning with the stars, the mist parting to reveal the path) rather than postcard description. The environment and recurring objects (pool, jar, pearl) meaningfully charge the final image of the pearl dissolving into the sky. While the grotto doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, it convincingly feels like the only place this work could happen.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned data center/moss garden is vivid, specific, and filtered through Lila’s sensibility, with strong sensory and textural choices (“honeyed hush,” “servers as anchors,” drip-etched map). Setting and recurring objects (servers, moss, icicle pattern, pendant) are not just backdrop; they structure metaphor and action, culminating in the planted sapling and glowing pendant at the end. The world’s physical rules remain coherent, and the environment constrains/defines what they can do—tend plants, map drips, alter jewelry—rather than offering abstract scenery. A slightly stronger sense of the outside world impinging (e.g., cold seeping in, sounds from beyond) could make the sanctuary vs. exposure contrast even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “feral nexus in mist” is vivid, sensorially rich, and tightly integrated with Clara’s internal state and the theme of messy, unfinished endings. Details like the half-formed creatures, shifting ground, and cold-fire lantern feel specific and purposeful rather than generic fogginess. The seashell as a recurring object bridges nexus and study, charging the final image. The environment shapes what’s possible—Clara goes there precisely because it’s a place where endings behave differently.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The verdant arbor, treehouse workshop, moonlit forest, and emergent mushrooms and sapling are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Lira’s sensibility. Setting and objects (tendril, lyre, sapling, harvest moon) aren’t just backdrop; they’re the medium through which the remedy occurs and the final image is charged. The atmosphere of living, responsive nature is sustained and deepens as the ritual unfolds. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain options, but it does meaningfully frame and color every choice and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid and tonally aligned, and details like frost-bitten apples, creaking dead trees, and snow are tightly woven into action. The environment does supply the materials for the seal (twigs, branches, hollow apple shells), so it’s not just backdrop. Still, the setting could constrain choice or risk more sharply—for instance, the cold mostly aches rather than materially jeopardizing the attempt. Atmosphere is strong and integrated, but not yet fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern, quartz veins, and shifting light are vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s investigative mindset, making the environment feel like a living instrument rather than backdrop. Setting details (noon and midnight light, fissures, acoustics) directly inform the mechanics of solving the problem and charge the final image of glowing veins and harmonic hum. The world’s rules around sound and echo-harvesting remain stable and are learned through his actions rather than exposition dumps. This is rich, economical scene-building that meaningfully shapes choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bronze grotto is vividly realized through tactile and sensory detail—the metallic air, calcified whispers, starlight fissure, and shingled hush all feel integral rather than decorative. Environment constrains tactics (he must orient the lamp by the angle of starlight, manage drafts, navigate niches) and charges the premise of trapped souls. The recurring movement between grotto and outside world (snowmelt, pine air, village) provides a tonal and thematic counterpoint that reinforces what Kael carries out. The only thing holding this short of the very top is that the final image leans more on the satchel and workshop than on a fully recharged environmental callback.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, rust hues, kettle, candle, and windowsill are vividly rendered and recur in ways that mirror Clara’s emotional movement. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it does meaningfully charge the closure: the lion on the rain-lit sill and the candle turning raindrops into stars create a resonant final tableau. Details are selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic; the “rust-hued peace” and “damp wool and old parchment” support the theme of beauty in decay. The setting feels like a lived-in psychic as well as physical space, though it stops short of materially forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kinetic lagoon and the rusted carousel are vividly particular—“bruised violet and electric gold,” “sun hung like a stuck coin”—and consistently filtered through Veyra’s habituated familiarity. Setting is not postcard: it shapes behavior (her scavenging practice, the seed that never grows, her mother’s drowning site) and charges the ending (the rose emerging from the same waters that ate the camera wheel). World rules around time-fracture, while surreal, feel internally consistent and thematically linked to stasis and regret. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned spaceport and post-carnival emptiness are vividly realized (“domed roofs gathering dust under a bruised twilight sky,” collapsed atrium, shattered glass, dormant conduits). Setting is not just backdrop: the terminal’s infrastructure is what allows the redirection of flows, and the atrium glass break exposes the sextant. The sextant-as-object and the terminal-as-system both charge the final image of the light equation, satisfying the tool/setting-as-constraint test. A bit more sensory variety beyond visual/aural would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is a major strength: Vellichor Keep, the brass workshop, the quartz forecourt, and the petrichor all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental elements aren’t just decorative—the forecourt sings under rain, the sanctuary’s silence defines mood and theme, and the keep’s physicality charges the final “not a prison…a compass” reframe. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially smell and sound/its absence. The only ceiling comes from setting rarely constraining concrete tactics beyond mood and epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The twilight barge canal and crumbling warehouse are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the piece’s liminal, haunted quality (“water…holding its breath”). Details are well chosen rather than exhaustive, and the sundial works as a recurring object that charges the final image. That said, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces a specific choice; it frames mood more than it shapes action. Strong atmosphere, modest functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor, golden dock, snow, fog, and fulgurite are rendered with strong sensory specificity and consistent tone (“watercolor blur,” “oceanic hush”). Setting is filtered through Elias’s attention in a way that suits his contemplative nature. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain his choices, it meaningfully stages the appearance of the cloaked woman and sacralizes the ending image on the dock. The recurring objects (rope, glass, dock) clearly charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed garden, moss, jasmine, and “silver river” thread are vividly rendered and recur in ways that charge the atmosphere and final image. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, supporting the tone of hushed, melancholic reverence. The thread as an object-as-setting directly connects to memory and absence, functioning as both environment and tool. While it doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, it absolutely charges the story’s emotional and thematic space.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The suspended palace of Vyrthra, crystal spires, and stalactite anchors are vividly realized and filter strongly through Corvin’s sensibility, with details like “liquid light” and “air tasted of oil and regret” fusing setting and mood. The environment reacts meaningfully—the humming stalactites, slowing gears, and blooming stone charge the final transformation image. World rules (mechanized era vs organic genesis) stay internally consistent and are learned through how Corvin moves and works rather than via pure exposition. The one limitation is that the palace’s suspension doesn’t much constrain tactics; it’s atmospheric more than structurally determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes,” skeletal kelp, hissing black sand all echo damage and latent fertility. Environmental details are filtered through Lira’s mindset and professional instincts, not touristic cataloging. The volcanic sand motif returns in the final grain she drops, charging the last image and tying place to theme. The lagoon itself doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it does shape the story’s emotional weather and symbolic logic with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vividly realized with strong, selective detail—the clocktower, mosaic, library, and dry basins all feel textured and of a piece. Setting is not postcard-only: fountains and urban ruins directly shape her search path and the nature of the payoff when water/memories return. The recurring image of the fountains and the stained glass box charges the final image of resurrected water and “wet cobblestones.” Sensory range leans visual/aural but is purposeful and well-integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nebula garden is vivid and specific—petals as “forgotten constellations,” sonar-flora, crystalline trees—and the environment is strongly filtered through Lumin’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the sonar guides movement, the trees host the ghost, and the garden’s chorus actively “approves” the turning point. The calculating gear merging with the tree’s light, and the final image of it spinning in the garden, charges the environment with thematic weight. A slightly tighter link between physical constraints of the garden and Lumin’s options could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse is vivid, sensorially grounded (“damp earth and forgotten roses,” rattling glass, butterflies beating at panes) and functions as a character-like container for grief. The environment isn’t just postcard description; it houses the lingering poems/echoes and makes the spectral mentorship plausible. The butterfly migration and lantern light evolving over evenings subtly track emotional progression. Setting strongly charges the final image (leaving the greenhouse with ribbon and internalized light) but stops just shy of actively constraining a hard tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian ridge, tower, and sea are vivid, textural, and tightly integrated with the stakes: the ridge shudders and cracks when the pendulum stalls, and the environment literally seals as balance returns. Details are filtered through Lirael’s workmanlike perspective—glass shards underfoot, iron veins, salt—and never feel like a neutral postcard. The setting constrains her options (she must climb in the dangerous pause window) and charges the final image of smooth glass. This is strong, publication-ready environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“cobalt silo,” “velveteen gloom,” oculus to the stars—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a gardener of graves. Environment participates in the story: the visible constellation through the oculus matches the tapestry, and the silo’s repurposed history ties into the 1899 date. The final image of her stepping back into the star-lit cemetery feels charged by the earlier cobalt/starlight imagery. While the space doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it meaningfully charges the mood and mechanics of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and quickly anchor where we are; details like iron-rich ink, kingfisher dives, and groaning ice contribute to atmosphere and theme. Environment meaningfully shapes stakes: a world “resigned to perpetual winter” makes thaw revolutionary, and the spire’s cold/time-stopped feel mirrors constraint. However, the spire could more directly constrain her choices in-scene rather than mostly serving as a symbolic backdrop. Overall, the setting is textured, legible, and thematically integrated without turning into a mere postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember alcove, bioluminescent moss, mist, and ashen plains are vividly rendered and filtered through Lira’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details recur and evolve—the moss brightens with the signal, the mist parts and then reseals—so the environment participates in the emotional cadence even if it rarely constrains action. The technical feel of the radio and the iron-tasting air deepen the world without over-explaining. The final image of her leaving the alcove into the whispering plains is charged by all this prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vanishing point gallery is vividly realized—the impossible angles, breathing walls, fading artworks, and the old rocking chair create a strong, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the story’s obsession with impermanence. Details are filtered through Lira’s artistic sensibility (what she notices is light, ash, shifting perception), which keeps description from feeling like a tourist tour. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices in a practical sense, it continually charges them: the knowledge that “by morning, it will all be gone” reweights her act of leaving the portrait unfinished. The setting feels integral to tone and theme, though a more direct interaction between the gallery’s rules and Lira’s tactics could have pushed this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sewer and sunken city are vividly and economically rendered (“putrid perfume,” “plague-era flags,” “sunken temples”), with strong sensory grounding. Setting is clearly filtered through Elias’s obsessions—sediment as “layers of history,” the ruins as a “labyrinth” of meanings—so atmosphere and worldview are tightly fused. The environment constrains them plausibly (scavengers in an abandoned, plague-emptied city) though it shapes mood more than tactical options. The recurring cog and sediment imagery help charge the final image of him still digging.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “velvet library,” stained-glass windows, autumn leaves, and dust-mote light create a rich, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Clara’s sensibility. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain physical options, but it meaningfully frames the library as a secular sacred space, which charges both Elias’s first note and the final sanctuary image. The recurring rosette, embedded in this environment, helps bind setting and theme. This is vivid, economical world-building, just shy of the kind of environment-as-active-obstacle that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rusted greenhouse and violet celestial light are vivid and tonally apt, with mossed glass, iron frame graffiti, and ruined-city context all feeding the mood of fragile reclamation. Setting is mostly atmospheric rather than constraining—nothing in the geography or material limits her options beyond the alignment condition, though the greenhouse as a salvaged ruin does thematically mirror her goal. The environment does charge the final image: a “sculpture of light and life” inside decay directly ties space to theme. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint (temperature, crowding vines, structural instability) would elevate the setting from backdrop to more active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lightning collection tower, copper lattice, drones, and blackout city are vivid and specific, with details like “nectar dusk” and “wings glinting in the nectar dusk” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Setting is tightly integrated with action: Clara’s booth, the hives, and the cables all matter to what she notices and chooses. World rules (awe-powered infrastructure) are introduced through concrete interaction rather than abstract exposition. The final image of the brightened cables and buzzing drones is strongly charged by the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quiet bay, streetlights, and shoreline houses are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Lira’s sensibility (“streetlights daydreamed,” houses that seem dormant then glow). The environment does more than backdrop: its stillness and quiet explicitly justify why she chose it as the test site and charge the final image of hushed, listening houses. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—mud, water, light—without devolving into a tourist catalog. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain choices, but it significantly colors the stakes and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater city garden is vividly rendered—bioluminescent algae, coral beds, crumbling fountains—and those details feel specific rather than generic. Setting meaningfully constrains and enables action: the sealed pedestal, the silt, and structural cracks define how Mara can access the ampoule. The environment also charges the ending, when the garden “breathes” again and mirrors the ocean’s healing. Occasionally the description leans toward decorative lushness, but it generally stays purposeful and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The infinite staircase is vividly realized—the spirals, parchment stone, vanishing steps, “air tasting of ozone and regret”—and its mutable geometry shapes what is possible. The environment constrains Kael’s options (no conventional direction, steps rearranging) and underwrites the theme of boundless confinement. The recurring micro-setting of the steps and edge where he ruptures the stone directly affects the pivotal action. A bit more tactile interaction with the physical strain or danger of the space could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The smog-choked city and rooftop greenhouse are rendered with strong, purposeful sensory detail—“air tasted of burnt copper,” dew-dripping ferns, orchids like “defiant lips.” The greenhouse functions as sanctuary and crucible: it’s where the experiment, the visitation, and the reconfiguration all occur, and the smog’s outside pressure gives that sanctuary weight. Moonlight and the brush operate as charged recurring objects that explicitly color the final image (“a quiet rebellion against the smog”). This is rich, selective atmosphere that supports both mood and theme without feeling like a mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto city, waterfall, mist, moss, bees, and oven-heat create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific and lived-in. Setting details are well-filtered through Lila’s sensibility (museum guide, baker, guardian of memory), and the environment mirrors the thematic thaw effectively. The emerald lens and the pool at dawn charge the final image, even if they don’t tightly constrain physical choices. Overall, place is a major strength, though its influence on tactics remains more tonal than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rocky island, low tide shore, and derelict lighthouse are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s mindset. Setting constrains and enables choice: low tide exposes the stone and later a stone path; the lighthouse provides the stored light that powers the feedback loop. Environmental details (fog, damp sand, creaking reverse gears) directly charge the final image and are not mere backdrop. The specificity and integration of place with mechanism and fate thematics are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vividly evoked—bruise-colored sky, twisted mirrors, condensation, cracking glass—and its features (mirrors, shadows, labyrinth) directly shape how the threat manifests and is battled. The opera cloak and its clasp function as charged objects, returning in the final image to anchor closure. Sensory detail is mostly visual with some tactile and auditory touches, but the selection feels purposeful rather than touristic. The environment could constrain Mara’s movement or options even more to reach the top tier, but it already does strong, specific work.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating driftwood orchard is striking, precise, and atmospherically rich, with kelp ropes, tide, and salt spray all feeding directly into action. Environment constrains and enables choices: the driftwood circle is both stage and instrument, the rogue current’s past damage motivates her project, and the lightning-scarred tree focalizes the climax. Sensory detail is well-filtered through Leeward’s musical/prophetic lens rather than tourist listing. The setting also meaningfully charges the final image of the mosaic, satisfying the 9-gate except for a slightly decorative tilt in a few metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly rendered and integral: arches, quarters, submerged chambers, and the crack beneath the Market District all shape what Lira notices and what she can do. Sensory detail (brine, mud, etched walls) is selective and filtered through her cartographer’s mindset, and the world’s rules feel internally consistent. Crucially, the shells and gate meaningfully constrain choices and charge the final image as they shift and flood the city. A touch more evolution of the lived, day-to-day surface city could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The overgrown station, ivy, rosebush, rusted door, and tunnel are vivid, concrete, and consistently filtered through Elara’s historian gaze. Setting isn’t just backdrop: ivy literally conceals the tunnel entrance, the rosebush anchors the mythic time constraint, and the bench with the illuminated A is both landscape and puzzle. The subterranean chamber and its letter T extend the motif spatially and thematically, charging the final decision to “take the letter” with environmental weight. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk or constraint in the tunnel itself could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly realized and integrated into action—the arches, cracked mosaic, algae, and half-drowned architecture are not just backdrop but the medium of her work and discovery. The setting meaningfully constrains options: the raised drawbridge isolates her, the waterline and submerged chamber shape how and where she can move. Environmental details (sunset turning water to “liquid amber,” the pavilion as a shadow hump under stars) track emotional beats and charge the final image. This rich specificity stops just short of transformative constraint at the climax, but is still a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library is vividly realized—sodden shelves, algae-slick stairs, bioluminescent jars—and consistently filtered through Lira’s attention. The environment constrains and enables action: darkness, water, and rusted metal shape how she moves, how she discovers the vault, and how the vault can plausibly remain dry. The recurring play of fractured moonlight and submerged machinery charges both atmosphere and the final image of her emerging to the surface. World rules (flooded city, preserved chamber) are internally consistent and discovered via action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and particular: floating islands as lily pads, bioluminescent moss, lavender smoke, and the paradoxical glass basilica all feel specific and evocative. Details are filtered through her craft and grief, so the environment reflects inner state without feeling like a generic tour. Crucially, the basilica and the garden aren’t just backdrops; they participate in the climax (spires shedding light, patrons witnessing, cranes rising). The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that physical constraints of the space rarely pressure her choices beyond symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating observatory, glass floors, crater, and subterranean “veins” are specific, atmospheric, and thematically aligned with trauma and hidden potential. Setting is woven into action (tracing cracks, descending into the crater) and meaningfully shapes images at the end (veins of light stretching into the horizon). However, the environment constrains choices less than it could; the observatory and crater are more stage and metaphor than obstacle or tool that forces tactical adaptation. World rules for unused potential and nodes are consistent but remain slightly abstract, keeping this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory and dusk setting are vivid and integral: arches, dome, niches, and Cassiopeia’s position all directly govern what is possible. Environmental specifics (lever, niches, starlight beams, vibrating stones) drive the core mechanics of the climax rather than serving as backdrop. The recurrence of stone, light, and prism textures effectively charges the final image of “brilliant dimness” and the frequency in her mind. A touch more non-visual sensory texture under peak pressure could push this toward the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt terrace, salt air, and deserted shore are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong atmospheric frame. The driftwood carvings and ocean function as more than backdrop: they’re both investigative tool and thematic mirror for buried truths. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with motifs (cobalt tiles, waves, carvings) returning in charged ways. The setting does more to echo and enable than to constrain choice, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal parapet, mist, and storm are vividly and economically rendered, giving the piece a strong sense of place and mood (“stones pitted by decades of salt and regret”). Environmental details are filtered through Clara’s sensibility and support the neutrality/liminality theme. However, the setting rarely constrains or redirects concrete choices; it’s more atmospheric than tactical. The recurring object-as-setting (the drawer pull) does charge the final image, but the physical environment itself could press harder on action to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The coastal setting, kayak, lighthouse, and utility poles are vivid and tightly woven into Clara’s perceptions rather than feeling like a generic seascape. Environmental details (cold salt air, “liquid mercury” tide, creaking lighthouse steps) mirror her internal state without becoming heavy-handed, and the compass as a handled object functions as a micro-setting at the emotional core. The geography is coherent and matters to her choices—she has to paddle, beach, climb, and then re-enter the water. There’s still room for one more moment where the physical environment constrains her options under peak pressure, but what’s here is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The subway descent and the bioluminescent lake are sharply rendered—“liquid light,” “drowned stars”—and the environment is integrated with the premise via regret-eating bacteria and reflective waters. Setting is not a neutral backdrop; it is the mechanism by which the labyrinth of choices is made visible. The recurring baseball functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image. That said, the hospital and city are sketched more generically, with less tactile specificity than the underground segment.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight, moonthorn blossoms, spice mortar, and phoenix relics create a vivid, coherent environment that shapes both mood and action. Setting details are strongly integrated into the ritual mechanics (petals tremble, animals offer objects, ashes in the soil) rather than functioning as postcard description. The environment clearly constrains and enables choices—it’s the necessary locus of magic and the creatures’ participation. There’s minimal weakness here; one could imagine slightly more tactile use of terrain or physical limitation, but it’s already publication-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The midnight glade above the clouds, the city of glass, the birch tree with hourglass roots, and the recurring saucer create an intensely atmospheric, specific environment. Setting is not mere backdrop: the floating glade, mist, and tree structure physically channel her choices (where to lay the cards, where to climb, where to fall) and frame the final path “home.” World rules are consistent in their dream-logic, and small details (ozone, lilac scent) are filtered through her emotional state. The setting charges the final image—the path through mist, the cloth over her shoulders—making the environment integral to the story’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The recycled spaceship and its decaying systems are vividly rendered and meaningfully tied to the stakes (it’s dying, which forces action), while the bioluminescent garden beyond the door reconfigures the story’s emotional space at the end. Details like walls patched with fused asteroid metal and the “ghostly resolve” of systems feel specific and thematically apt rather than touristic. Environment and objects (the ship, the altar, the garden) all charge the final images and help define before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    The black sand beach, smoking volcano, and slow stars are sensuously rendered and tightly woven into the mood and imagery (“sand remembers fire,” the volcano’s “low, approving rumble”). The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options—Lira is never truly threatened by the volcano—but it does meaningfully charge the final images (the warm, shifting sand and the new constellation-map imprint). The recurring hush feels anchored in the setting’s physicality rather than abstracted atmosphere, giving the world a rule-like texture. Overall, it’s richly specific and thematically tuned, if more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    The luminous fort, sundial, Armory Tower, and hidden chamber are concrete and visually vivid, and the quill holder functions well as a recurring, plot-relevant object. The blackout and architecture meaningfully shape tactics (working by starlight, secret stair, lantern kept low). Sensory range skews strongly visual and atmospheric, with limited non-visual grounding, but what’s present is coherent and purposeful. The setting supports tone and action rather than feeling like decorative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal bluff under the aurora is vividly realized, with the frictionless sea and suspended eels giving the setting a specific, uncanny physics that feels integral to the concept. Details like “liquid green and violet” aurora, boots sinking into damp sand, and still-as-glass water are well-filtered through Lira’s attention to pattern. The world’s rules (no friction, aurora revealing geometries) are consistent and learned through action rather than dump. Setting could constrain choice even more explicitly—right now it enriches tone and concept superbly but only lightly limits her options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is richly rendered—iron ribs, liquid-mercury clouds, lantern, and charts all filtered through Kael’s poetic sensibility. Setting and objects (mask, timer, envelope, star maps) mirror his interior and the themes of censorship and rarefaction without feeling like a neutral backdrop. The environment subtly constrains choices (isolated refuge from the Ministry, storm as both shield and pressure) and charges the final image of “the storm kiss his wonder.” It stops just shy of a 9-band only because the physical environment doesn’t directly force a tactical choice in the scene beyond mood and seclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and light patterns are vivid and integrated into action—light through the needle holes literally reconfigures the space into a stellar map and charges the final image. Environment and objects constrain and guide choice (the sundial’s angles shape footwork; the card’s projection halts the duel), and the setting’s obsession with light mirrors the philosophical “illumination.” Specific sensory detail is mostly visual, but it is purposeful and filtered through the duel’s choreography rather than touristic description. A bit more non-visual texture or how the space tactically limits them could push this to the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rusted prison library under flickering bulbs is sharply realized, with corrugated metal, cracked glass, and star canopy grounding mood and place. Setting is not mere backdrop: the library as skeletal refuge, the hidden floorboard, and the star-lit, bulb-dimming environment all echo the fragile order versus anarchy motif. The coffee tin and floorboard function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices and charge the final image when he hides the tin again. A slightly broader sense of the prison’s operational constraints (locks, surveillance) could further sharpen how place shapes options, but what’s present is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal arbor, glass ribs, mood compasses, and layered clocks create a vivid, idiosyncratic environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting is filtered convincingly through Clara’s perceptions and mirrors her internal tension (swaying tides vs. stuck clock vs. spinning needles). The arbor’s architecture and technology (lost-and-found, bench compartment, projector, hidden staircase) directly enable the plot. Environmental motifs (tides, horizon inviting night, compasses spinning faster) also charge the final image, satisfying the object-as-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridge and its blooming, chromatic landscape are vividly drawn and integrated into the stakes (this is the place whose memory is at risk, and the monsoon will literally drown it). The dream-cavern of mirrors and liquid light feels of a piece with the world’s logic and supports the thematic emphasis on fractured memory. Setting details are sensorial and purposeful rather than touristic, with recurrent images (ridge, monsoon, seed, mirrors) reappearing in altered forms by the end. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain specific tactics in scene, so it stops just shy of top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The islet, post-rain air, wooden studio, and churn of the sea are vividly sketched and tonally aligned with the story’s melancholy. The compass, lace, bonsai, and ghost ship act as charged objects that help build atmosphere and support the magic rules. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond requiring a boat trip; it’s more mood than pressure. Still, the return to bonsai and the lace on the wall gives the setting a satisfying closing resonance.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory specificity is excellent, grounding abstract concepts in "silt-clogged drains" and "moth-eaten ferns." The greenhouse functions effectively as a textured crucible that contrasts with the character's clean scientific background.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sensory details like the “indigo bowl” and “fractured rainbows” effectively ground the scene in a specific atmosphere. However, the sudden appearance of a “hologram” from a glass shard strikes a discordant, high-tech note that clashes with the elemental, low-magic tone established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "winterglass" imagery is atmospheric ("walls glazed with ice"), but the "heat-mapping sensors" clash tonally with the botanical setting. The environment functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmospheric details like "books floated like jellyfish" are vivid, but the world logic is fragile (booking commercial passage to a lost city, living underwater in a diving suit for years). The setting serves the mood well but collapses under scrutiny regarding the protagonist's survival and access.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arbor is a vivid, specific anchor ("wet clay," "red tiles") that effectively grounds the community's ritual. The setting details actively support the atmosphere, though the "amplified quiet" functions more as a poetic motif than a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("soft edges," "glowing faintly") and evasive descriptions like "hues that defied naming," which fails to ground the reader. The "moss-slick path" is a rare concrete touch, but the environment generally feels like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "living bridge garden" is established with vivid, lush imagery ("vines pulsed like veins"), creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the description sometimes drifts into ornamentation ("slow-motion symphonies") that feels performative rather than grounding the reader in the physical constraints of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on atmospheric clichés ("ghost's whisper," "dust and forgotten cotton candy") rather than specific, tactile grounding. Spatial logic breaks when a piano bench—typically a small furniture item—opens to reveal a staircase, creating a confusing physical geometry that undermines immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral to the plot; the greenhouse provides the resources (root) and atmosphere that shape the tone. The imagery of the aurora and the rusted hulls creates a distinct surreal environment. The dead peach tree serves as both a physical prop and a thematic anchor, satisfying the constraint requirement for high marks.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "emerald station" and "golden hour" provide a cohesive, visually distinct atmosphere that anchors the magical realism. However, the setting's physical constraints—like the guard and the floor—feel like set dressing rather than obstacles that actively shape the protagonist's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are competent ("molten silica," "hummed with the drip"), effectively establishing the atmosphere. However, the control room itself feels somewhat generic, lacking specific machinery or spatial constraints that force unique tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting leans into heavy-handed symbolism (aisles labeled *TRAGEDY*) at the expense of verisimilitude; the library feels like a constructed stage set rather than a physical space. The atmosphere is established through adjectival piling ("hummed with the breath of forgotten things") rather than sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific imagery ("stone teeth gnawing," "barnacle"), grounding the abstract magic in a tangible place. However, the heavy reliance on adjectival phrasing ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") occasionally pushes the atmosphere into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, with the frozen courtyard effectively integrated into the plot via the melting violin. Sensory details establish a strong mood, though the transition to the time loop relies heavily on visual holograms.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "crystal whispering forecourt" is vivid but functions largely as a static backdrop; the environment does not constrain Elias's movements or force tactical trade-offs. The "humming" crystals add atmosphere but the setting feels like a generic fantasy stage rather than a lived-in space affecting the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The maze setting is atmospheric, though the juxtaposition of high-tech sensors and mystical vines is handled somewhat loosely. The specific imagery of the marbles is nice, but the initial confusion caused by using "dresser" for both the profession and the furniture piece ("withered vine dresser... Her dresser") creates a momentary orientation stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Setting details are visually clear ("ammonia clouds," "lavender glow") and establish the scene well. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop rather than constraining Veyra's choices or pressuring the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the flooded pit and "floating cello bow" create a vivid, tangible atmosphere that constrains movement. The sensory details ("glistening like spider silk") ground the ghostly elements effectively, though the mechanics of the lanterns remain slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The station environment is established with atmospheric specificity ("steel barnacle," "rattling windows"), but the village scene relies on generic descriptors ("old herbalist," "hands like tree bark"). The contrast between the high-tech station and the organic valley is effective but slightly predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with competent, atmospheric details ("mouth choked with ivy," "slick with condensation"), though it leans on genre-standard imagery for urban decay. The "colossal machinery" in the chamber remains vague, missing an opportunity for the specific industrial horror implied by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric description creates a cohesive mood, though it relies on standard fantasy tropes like "moss-choked stone" and "bioluminescent fungi." The obsidian refuge offers a starker, more specific visual, but the "overgrown library" feels generic, lacking the unique, lived-in details that would distinguish it from similar settings.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting description is lush but generic ("ancient oaks," "moss-cloaked boulders"), providing atmosphere without constraining choice or action. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the conversation rather than an active force pressuring the protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "reclaimed silo library" is realized with vivid, atmospheric detail ("steel ribs," "scent of old paper and rust") that grounds the abstract premise. The physical constraints of the silo (the fireplace, the curved walls) actively shape the protagonist's investigation, satisfying the integration standard well.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse and storm provide a solid, if familiar, atmospheric anchor. Specific details like the "tea-stained recipe cards" work well, though the "damp earth" and "filing cabinets" of the safehouse feel generic.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details like the sound-swallowing velvet and the indigo paint create a distinct atmosphere, though the "dimensional anchor" itself remains a vague sci-fi prop. The setting successfully mirrors the theme of muffled containment.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, prismatic specificity ("crushed moonstone," "obsidian slab"), effectively grounding the ethereal concept. While atmospheric, the environment primarily serves as a passive backdrop for reflection rather than applying active pressure to the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    The viaduct provides atmospheric visuals, but the "holographic" projection from "ancient runes" creates an unaddressed genre clash. The "labyrinth" remains an abstract concept rather than a concrete environment forcing tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cavern atmosphere is established with competent sensory details, though the "mirrored hush" remains somewhat abstract. The setting generally supports the fable-like tone but does not actively constrain the protagonist's choices beyond providing the magical object.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.5)
    The opening courtyard scene establishes a solid atmosphere, but the "rogue zone" relies on generic dystopian shorthand (flickering lights, tattered lab coat). Spatial geography is fuzzy; the transition from the rooftop view to the zone perimeter elides the travel logic, making the city feel like a series of disconnected set-pieces rather than a cohesive world.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("rain-soaked earth," "wilted lavender") and effectively anchor the atmosphere. The greenhouse setting supports the theme of preservation well, though the "ultraviolet" mechanic feels like a convenient plot device rather than an environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "terra-cotta grotto" anchors the scene with vivid, tactile details like "ancient skin" and "baked by centuries." The setting effectively pressures the mood, though it leans slightly into generic mystical tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is evocative, with specific sensory details like the "damp, earthy scent" and "condensating glass" grounding the scene. However, phrases like "glass cathedral" and "salt and memory" lean into genre clichés (ruin-porn aesthetic) rather than fresh, character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.8)
    The amber grotto is visually distinct, with vivid details like the "translucent" walls and "violet spectacles." However, the setting is largely ornamental; the "static electricity" and specific time of dusk provide atmosphere but do not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adjustments on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    The library setting is established with some vivid, if romanticized, details ("lighthouse eyes," "paper-scented calm"). However, specific elements like a toddler stacking encyclopedias late at night after a symphony strain credibility and distract from the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is visually distinct ("crystalline orchard," "prismatic glass") and integrates well with the protagonist's craft, as seen in his use of tree sap. However, the environment functions primarily as an ornamental backdrop; it establishes a mood but does not apply significant physical pressure or tactical constraints on the character's choices until the final clue.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.3)
    The integration of the giant's physiology with the canal mechanics creates a distinct, vivid atmosphere ("snores causing the water to ripple"). While the rooftop setting is grounded, the magical "tunnel" relies on generic fantasy imagery ("shimmering light," "diver through syrup") that lacks the specificity of the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.5)
    Specific elements like the "mechanical birds" and "chipped glass eyes" work well, but the orchard itself leans on generic fantasy descriptions ("liquid starlight," "moon’s pale gaze"). The setting feels like a backdrop for the ritual rather than a lived-in space exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric ("sapphire hush," "dust-capped books") but leans into purple prose that distances the reader from the gritty reality of a crawl space. While the geography is clear, the environment functions more as a static backdrop than a source of constraints or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "steamy" greenhouse are functional but generic. The "mossy trellis" frames the story well, but the setting largely serves as a backdrop for the lesson rather than a source of constraints or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like "rooftops caved in like broken ribs" establishing a distinct atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the mood, though the backstory of the "water wars" remains largely textural rather than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    The musical cave is an active participant in the story, reacting to the characters with specific sensory details (light, sound, vibration). The setting successfully grounds the magical elements, though "solstice moon" feels a bit generic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.4)
    The physical descriptions of the harbor are competent, but the social/world logic undermines immersion; leaving a valuable brass object unattended on a dock in a post-exile, poverty-scarred city strains credibility. The setting serves as a backdrop for a scavenger hunt rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric, with strong visual details like the &quot;skeletal remains&quot; of the clocktower and the &quot;brass edges dulled by time.&quot; The environment supports the mystical tone, though the &quot;fortress&quot; concept remains abstract until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmospheric details ("indigo sky," "fogging glass") are competent but generic, functioning as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The setting fails to exert pressure on the character's movement or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is vividly described with specific sensory details ("taste of ozone," "walls bled crimson"), effectively grounding the reader. The "escondite" concept provides a colorful backdrop, though the spatial shifts feel somewhat like set dressing until the final mirror interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with standard sensory details (lilies, mahogany), but the environment does not significantly constrain the action beyond providing cover. The "breach point" dialogue attempts to leverage the setting conceptually, but the physical space feels largely like a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are lush ("crushed violets," "faint, almost magical glow") but remain largely ornamental, failing to constrain tactics. The setting provides atmosphere but does not exert pressure on the protagonist's choices or shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the container labyrinth provides a functional atmospheric backdrop with decent sensory details like the "salt tang" and "diesel and decay." However, the descriptions lean into generic noir tropes ("bruised sky," "rusting behemoths") without enough specific, grounding geography to make the navigation feel earned. The environment shifts conveniently for the plot rather than constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The observatory is rendered with solid, if standard, atmospheric details like "dust motes" and "rusted telescopes." The specific props (shell, cello) anchor the scene well, though similes like "fossilized question" strain for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details like "fried dough and diesel" provide a solid anchor, though the setting often leans into standard "cyber-circus" tropes. The environment serves largely as a backdrop rather than a source of physical constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lunar atmosphere is established with vivid sensory details ("silver path," "golden gas"), effectively grounding the reader. The setting supports the tone well, though the "airless chill" penetrating a spacesuit is a slight scientific distraction that momentarily breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the depot atmosphere is established, the central mechanic—a blind character diagnosing servo oscillations by feeling the "warmth" of specific colors refracted through water—strains physical credibility. This "magic box" solution clashes with the industrial sci-fi setting and feels like a convenient workaround for the disability constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.6)
    The frozen landscape is established with some sensory competence ("smelled of pine resin"), but the setting often dissolves into abstraction ("skeletal relic"). The magical properties of the convergence and the phrasebook are not grounded in the established reality, making the world feel inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Atmospheric details like the "clock tower frozen at 3:17" and the "mosaic of decay" effectively ground the setting, though the description occasionally feels static, prioritizing visual aesthetic over environmental constraints that force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details like "lavender and saltwater" and the "algae-slick stone" create a distinct, tactile atmosphere. The setting effectively constrains the protagonist's movement and heightens the sense of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but destabilized by aggressive personification ("scuffs gnawing," "hinges screaming") that distracts from spatial grounding. While the "copperlight repose" provides a consistent visual filter, the shifting geography of the labyrinth feels like a convenience to avoid concrete navigation, leaving the reader disoriented in a negative sense.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is established early but relies heavily on gothic clichés ("shadows pooled like ink," "spectral iridescence"). While the greenhouse setting is clear, the descriptions are ornamental rather than tactile or restrictive to the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details are vivid but often filtered through heavy figurative language ("like exhausted eyes") rather than grounded immediacy. The setting is visually distinct, but the "wharf" aspect of the character feels disconnected from the desert canyon environment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "orchard of bones" is a vivid, specific concept that grounds the fantasy elements well ("roots twisting... through ribcages"). However, the environmental obstacles (coiling roots) are introduced and then immediately neutralized by the magical object, failing to act as a persistent constraint on Lirael’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is a strength, effectively blending the archaic and futuristic with details like "solar gel" and the "kinetic" brass-railed balcony. The "golden arcade" provides a distinct atmosphere that grounds the story, although the "heart" of the arcade being a fountain feels like a generic set piece compared to the specificity of the surrounding details.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "cobalt observatory" provides a vivid, if slightly ornamental, atmosphere with details like "constellations of dust." However, the setting operates mostly as a static backdrop for dialogue rather than exerting pressure or constraining the characters' tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The transformation of mangrove leaves into glass-like surfaces for condensation is a vivid, specific detail that creatively interprets the prompt. However, some descriptors ("ancient fingers," "silvery sheen") lean toward generic fantasy atmospherics.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The specific artifacts (coral, cast) provide good tactile anchors, but the atmospheric description leans on generic markers ("mist," "twilight"). The setting functions more as a mood board than a pressurized environment that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("moss-choked paths," "crumbling greenhouse") that effectively ground the reader. However, the imagery leans on familiar "ruined beauty" tropes, and the mechanics of the light painting remain somewhat vague. While the atmosphere is cohesive, the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "sound wave garden" is vivid and functionally integrated, with details like the "fractal wind chime" and "concave dish" grounding the fantastical elements in pseudo-science. The setting actively constrains and enables the protagonist's method, satisfying the requirements for a strong score.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid, with distinct details like the humid air, carnivorous plants, and specific insects creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the description sometimes lists elements (butterflies, beetles, tarantula) rather than integrating them into the pressure of the scene. The transition to the secret room and garden provides clear spatial anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gargantuan shell and bioluminescent abyss are evocative, grounding the fable in distinct, imaginative imagery. However, the setting functions primarily as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is lush and atmospheric, with "glass-orchids" and "prismatic whispers" creating a strong sense of place. The environment actively constrains the problem (extinct materials), though the sensory description occasionally leans toward the ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archive atmosphere is established well with sensory details ("mothball-scented," "static of forgotten tongues"). The setting supports the tone, though it acts more as a backdrop than a constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric ("molten-red stone," "pulsed like a sleeping giant") but operates largely as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The "breathing" of the amphitheater provides rhythm but doesn't constrain Lira’s choices or endanger the delicate work, missing an opportunity for environmental stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The attic setting is established with decent sensory grounding (smell of polish, golden haze). However, the dust motes—a crucial setting detail—are overburdened as a magical plot device, straining the physical credibility of the space. The transition to the "vast sky" at the end feels generic compared to the attic's claustrophobia.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "drifting prism terrace" and "fractured hush" provide a strong, atmospheric anchor that permeates the scene. The sensory details, like corn stalks bending "like compass needles," effectively ground the surreal concept, though the spatial logistics of the terrace's drift remain slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    The underwater atmosphere is established with competence, though it leans on standard descriptors ("silent decay," "scientific wonder") rather than distinct, hard-edged sensory details. The setting serves as a backdrop for the light show but does not constrain the characters' choices or impose physical limitations on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and textured, with the "crater glass" and "obsidian" providing strong, tactile grounding for the fantasy elements. The specific interplay of light and bioluminescence creates a cohesive atmosphere, though the "iridescent cave" leans slightly into generic high-fantasy aesthetics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "tidal arcade" is a vivid, distinct setting, and details like the mechanized clown and neon fish provide good texture. However, the geography remains somewhat vague (spatial relationship to the fountain), and the setting largely serves as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.6)
    The garden is atmospheric, but descriptions often lean into abstraction ("obsidian grace," "forgotten hymns") or cliché ("star-spangled canopy"). While the moss and dust provide some tactile grounding, the setting feels more like a constructed stage for the magic system than a lived-in environment that constrains the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the visual imagery is consistent, it relies heavily on stock descriptions ("water still as glass," "tapestry of colors") that feel decorative rather than constraining. The setting, while established, acts as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a source of pressure or distinct atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with clear anchors, but the description leans heavily on purple prose ("celestial bodies pirouetted," "spilled milk") that distances the reader. While the environment is physically present, it functions more as a backdrop for internal monologue than a source of pressure or constraint. The "hard softness" paradox is inserted as a descriptor rather than evoked through sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The verticality of anchoring a hot-air balloon within a grotto is a compelling, specific spatial arrangement that grounds the scene. However, relying on stock descriptors like "liquid mercury" and standard bioluminescence flattens the atmosphere into generic fantasy rather than a distinct, pressured environment.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details like "wet earth and iron" and "charred fragments," effectively grounding the reader. The concept of an "echo cartographer" promises auditory detail that is only partially delivered, as the climax is primarily visual and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength, with the wet stone, jasmine, and prism parapet effectively grounding the magical elements. However, some descriptors lean toward the generic ("spun gold," "ancient whispers"), which softens the specificity of the "mirage painter" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is atmospheric ("volcanic stone," "weathered statues") but remains a passive backdrop; the environment does not constrain tactics or force a trade-off. The descriptions establish a mood but do not interact causally with the negotiation process.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the "salt flat stretched endlessly" and the "cracked earth" ground the surreal ritual. The sensory details of the salt crunching and the "ghostly blue" egg create a strong texture. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal desolation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is visually distinct ("prism sanctuary," "silver courtyard") but interacts with the character only as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or tools. The imagery leans heavily on standard high-fantasy tropes without granular, tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "skeletal ribs" and "fractured light" of the dome actively shape the projection mechanics and thematic resonance. The physical space is well-integrated with the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily into "purple" ornamentation ("mist curled like spun sugar," "tasted of dew and distant thunder") without constraining the protagonist's choices. The "grotto above the clouds" provides atmosphere but does not exert physical or tactical pressure on the weaving process.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "icebound sanctum" is established with vivid sensory specificity ("snowmelt and iron"), and the tactile visualization of the rope mechanics grounds the fantasy elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is anchored and functional, providing the necessary isolation for the scene. However, descriptions lean toward stock phrasing ("vine-draped," "muffled the outside world") and the environment serves more as a backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmospheric details like "star-chart eyes" and "cuneiform tablets" effectively ground the scene in its specific history. However, phrasing like "bioluminescent light" (a pleonasm) and the unexplored "forge for forbidden alliances" dilute the setting's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.9)
    The "soundless sanctuary" is established as a place where "whispers died," yet characters converse effortlessly in standard dialogue, immediately breaking the setting's primary constraint. The "shifting reality" serves as ornamental background description rather than a pressure that constrains time or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but constructed from stock fantasy descriptors ("crumbling husks," "skeletal branches") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain action. The environment provides mood but rarely forces a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central concept of an orchard in cathedral rafters is evocative and grounds the fantasy effectively. However, the execution relies on sensory clichés ("whispering secrets," "raining down like confetti") that dull the atmosphere. The setting provides a backdrop but does not actively obstruct the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "pistachio shell cameo" is a wonderfully specific and tactile object that anchors the fantasy elements. However, the broader setting relies on genre tropes like "liquid light," "pulsing soil," and "whispering blossoms" that reduce the atmosphere's distinctiveness. The environment feels more like a scenic backdrop than a source of physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with tactile details like the spider-filled hollow and velvet-bound books creating a specific, ominous atmosphere. The physical environment actively pressures the protagonist, though "sentient library" is a familiar trope.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)
    The carnival ship offers atmospheric, specific textures like the "calliope swallowed by vines," anchoring the first half well. However, the transition to the generic "sunlit meadow" dissipates the tension and specificity established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.0)
    The clock tower setting is atmospheric and consistent with the genre, providing a functional backdrop for the action. Sensory details like the humming gears and flickering torches are vivid, though the "mechanism room" feels somewhat generic and does not constrain the protagonist’s choices in a specific, unique way.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid synesthetic details like "sound bent like light" and "fossilized echo." The physical manifestation of sound as ice and the specific geography of the "whisper's coil" create a distinct, immersive atmosphere that grounds the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on standard post-apocalyptic tropes (shattered glass, poisoned seas) and purple descriptors ("skeletal wind chimes," "fractured ice") that draw attention to the prose rather than the place. The mechanics of the pavilion—splitting sunlight but aligning with constellations—are contradictory and under-imagined.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "solid fog" and "crystal whispering" concepts are vivid and specific, grounding the abstract themes in a distinct physical reality. The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like "liquid light" and "sulfur and rosemary" are vivid, though the descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("bloomed violently"). The setting is imaginative but functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a cohesive atmospheric tone ("silver," "scent of salt and moss"). The grotto feels grounded, though the setting primarily serves as a backdrop rather than an active constraint on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting relies on generic dystopian markers ("cool metal wall," "flickering bulbs") and "rust and fear" clichés. While the gravity inversion is a strong concept, the "xenial trellis" feels like an inserted term rather than an organic part of the ecology, lacking sensory specificity beyond being a "lattice."

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid but relies heavily on high-fantasy clichés ("kaleidoscopic spires," "liquid fractals," "onyx") that serve as ornamentation rather than constraint. The environment functions as a static backdrop for reflection rather than a force that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("bioluminescent fruit," "iridescent veil") that feel decorative rather than constraining. The environment functions primarily as a container for clues rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "ashen air" and "cold iron" establish a mood, but the setting lacks spatial grounding, feeling like a floating gray room. The repetition of "ashen charcoal" and vague "fading threshold" mechanics limit immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details ("cobalt and violet," "fluorescent pollen") that ground the surreal premise. However, the mechanics of "conceptual pressure" remain abstract, functioning more as a magic system than a tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "sepia reading room" and "golden shadows" create a consistent, if slightly heavy-handed, atmosphere. Spatial anchoring is clear, though the descriptions lean on adjectival stacking ("eloquently silent," "liquid gold") rather than interaction. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "moon-petals" and "vines pulsing" create a distinct, suffocating environment. The sensory details of the greenhouse effectively contrast with the final release, grounding the magical elements in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmospheric details of mildew and decay are competent, but the setting logic undermines the story's reality (the physics of the dust preservation). The specific placement of the dust clues feels constructed for the plot rather than organic to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "auric lagoon" provides a vivid visual anchor, though the description ("molten gold" vs. "numbing") contains slight sensory contradictions. While the setting is physically present, it functions largely as a backdrop for action rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details ("cold brass," "damp air"), creating a cohesive atmosphere, though the "prism atrium" feels more like a stage set than a constraining environment. The "grotto" elements are largely decorative, providing mood rather than forcing the character to adapt his physical tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "ashen skyborne arbor" provides a functional backdrop with some distinct imagery ("twisted like ancient veins"), though the "mossy green haze" feels slightly generic. The physical constraints of the setting are minimal; the environment serves as a passive container for the plot rather than an active pressure on Elinor's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details like "moss-slick" and "barnacles" effectively ground the subterranean setting and establish a strong atmosphere. However, the spatial logic—climbing up to a greenhouse only to fall directly back into the subterranean waterfall—strains plausibility without clearer geography.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.8)
    The foundry setting is established with some sensory detail, but immersion is broken by the jarring prompt insertion "factually mystical blend," which contradicts the otherwise gritty atmosphere. The transformation of the workshop into a "cathedral" feels unearned by the preceding descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospherically rendered with strong sensory details like "pebbles that hummed" and walls like "stone ribs," effectively establishing a mythic tone. While vivid, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop; it does not impose specific physical constraints or tactical difficulties that Lira must navigate beyond the initial walk.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and acts as a functional constraint, reacting to Elias’s presence with hostility. The integration of the "pewter strap" as a grounding micro-setting is effective, though some descriptions ("shadows shifted like liquid") lean toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details like "iron lattices that hummed" and "tapestry of smoke," creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the imagery leans heavily into standard fantasy aesthetics without creating specific constraints that pressure the protagonist's choices. The market feels more like a backdrop for the aesthetic than a lived-in environment that shapes the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "blue-gray haze" and "peeling laminate" are functional, though the spatial logic of an elevator shaft inside a ticket office is confusing. The setting serves as a generic spooky backdrop rather than a specific, constraining environment that forces unique tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "glass orchard" and "swirling sea of clouds" create a strong, consistent atmosphere. While the imagery is vivid, specific details like the book title *Chronicles of the Unspoken* drift into generic fantasy tropes that slightly undermine the unique aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "baroque asteroid" and "root city" concepts create a distinct, vivid atmosphere. However, the description becomes repetitive (the phrase "cobalt haze" appears four times in a short space), reducing the freshness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The resonance chamber is a vivid, active setting that directly influences the narrative by amplifying sound and aiding the repair process. Specific sensory details like the vibrating copper walls and the "syrup of sound" ground the magical elements effectively. The setting feels integral to the repair method rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's anchor; the juxtaposition of the "sharper" post-industrial petrichor with the subterranean dampness is vivid and specific. The sensory details of the cave—"slick with moisture," "resonant hush"—effectively ground the speculative elements, though the visual of shadows as "ancient fingers" detracts from the otherwise fresh imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the archway provides a physical anchor, the setting descriptions often lean into melodrama (&quot;stones groaning,&quot; &quot;bruised sky&quot;) without constraining choice. The insertion of &quot;turbine-hum reverie&quot; creates a jarring technological anachronism within the established organic/mythic atmosphere, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Imagery is vivid ("fiery confetti") but leans toward decorative purple prose; the setting details function more as static backdrops than as constraints that force character tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid imagery like the "obsidian lagoon" and "bookshelves that seemed to defy gravity." The atmosphere of the dunes and the bioluminescent chamber is well-rendered and anchors the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details like the "phosphorus-rich ore" and "amber bottle" establish a distinct mood, though the "ghost town" aesthetic leans on familiar tropes. The setting serves as a passive container for the plot rather than an active force that resists or complicates the protagonist's efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid imagery like "bruise-purple twilight" and roses blooming for human breath effectively grounding the speculative elements. The environment constrains the character's scope and enhances the mood of ancient patience amidst collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established with clear visual anchors (atrium, ice, starlight), though descriptions lean toward generic high-fantasy tropes ("sky like shattered glass"). The environment functions adequately as a stage for the ritual but lacks tactile specificity that would constrain the protagonist's physical choices beyond the immediate placement of seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    The sanctuary and its relationship to the clouds are established with some vivid imagery ("arched windows framing storms"). However, the sensory details often lean on clichés ("howled like lost souls") rather than specific, grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting creates a generic "ancient sci-fi" atmosphere but fails to constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics. The "overlooked era" and "crumbling plateau" serve as static backdrops rather than active elements of pressure. Specificity is replaced by broad descriptors like "ancient constellations" and "velvet expanse."

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("sun that had forgotten mercy," "skeletal reminder") without specific, tactile constraints that force choices. The "contextual clues" of the light and dust are described in summary rather than grounded in the beekeeping environment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald silo is a distinct, vivid anchor that grounds the abstract premise effectively. Sensory details like the "metallic tang" and "sloshing mercury" build a solid atmosphere, though the description occasionally pauses the momentum rather than fueling the action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are vivid but skew toward generic "fantasy pastoral" (silver veins, cobalt depths) rather than specific, grounded textures that constrain action. While the lagoon provides the materials for the ritual, the setting functions more as a backdrop for the mood than a source of friction or pressure. The "burnished hush" and lighting effects are competent but decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The visual integration of the copper wire with the ancient oak and stone pillars is distinct and grounds the magic system effectively. The setting details ("living stone," "reddish gleam") support the atmosphere well. However, the sensory descriptions occasionally lean on standard fantasy tropes ("humming" energy, "liquid sun") rather than fresh, idiosyncratic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with specific details like the "wolf with moth wings" and "oxidized copper" skin grounding the scene. The imagery effectively supports the tone, though the list of sculptures borders on a museum inventory.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric and cohesive, with vivid details like "crushed bone and ash" and "violet and gold" petals. The setting actively integrates with the action (soil, birds), though descriptors like "gloom-hill" and "sky bled" lean toward generic fantasy tropes without deeper specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The scrapyard setting is rendered with competent visual details ("rusted carcass," "corrugated iron"), but it functions largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The environment does not force trade-offs or shape the protagonist's tactics beyond providing the initial props.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is a standout strength, with specific sensory details like "ink made from crushed meteorite dust" and "constellations warp[ing]." The setting actively pressures the protagonist’s perception, grounding the abstract time dilation concepts in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid, with specific details like the "sound of silence" and "ozone and old parchment" grounding the fantasy elements. However, descriptions often lean into standard tropes (bioluminescent fungi, crystalline walls) rather than unique sensory constraints that force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    The whispering gallery is atmospheric, though descriptions rely on standard literary similes ("curled like smoke," "frayed like old lace"). The setting amplifies sound but doesn't deeply constrain tactics beyond providing a backdrop for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mercury skin and obsidian stone are vivid visual anchors. However, the labyrinthine bookstore itself feels like a generic backdrop rather than a constraining environment; the "dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies" and "crystalline walls" are standard fantasy imagery that do not create a specific, lived-in atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmosphere of the time-frozen village is established effectively, though the spatial logic of the labyrinth (etched lines vs. dissolving walls) blurs in the middle. Sensory details are competent but standard for the genre ("gleamed faintly," "muted by time").

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually distinct but functions as a static, "white room" fantasy backdrop. Sensory details are present ("damp stone," "bruised sky") but often lean into genre clichés rather than specific, grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "acid sea" and "copper hull" provide a distinct initial atmosphere, but the workshop interior relies on abstract, "purple" props ("vials of liquid light," "shattered starlight") that lack sensory grounding. The "gears and cogs" description feels generic compared to the specificity of the acid threat. The environment functions more as a mood ring than a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details like "sapphire paint" and "boots crunching on pebbles" are solid, but the cave relies on generic fantasy imagery ("faint glow," "perfect symmetry"). The setting serves as a passive container for the epiphany rather than a source of pressure or constraint that forces a unique choice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmospheric detail is a strength, with the "scent of damp stone," "salt-kissed soil," and the specific garden elements grounding the magic. The setting actively supports the mood, though some descriptors ("bruised sky") lean toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    The censer foot provides a strong, specific grounding object that anchors the fantasy elements. While atmospheric, some descriptors lean into generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("skeletal fingers," "rusted antennae") rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.6)
    Strong opening imagery ("chandelier of green") grounds the setting effectively. The ravine and storm provide a tangible atmosphere that mirrors the internal tension, though the pathetic fallacy is standard.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on "adjective-noun" pairings ("opal dock," "bruise-purple sky," "hollowly," "brittle"). The "opal dock" is a vivid image, but the environment serves more as a static backdrop than a source of constraints or tools that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sensory details are vivid but rely on familiar phrasings ("emerald shards," "frozen tears") that border on purple prose. While the cavern is lushly described, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint that forces tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific sensory details ("ozone," "cobalt grotto," "bleeding starlight"). However, the description occasionally stalls momentum with decorative phrasing that doesn't constrain the character's choices. The environment serves as a backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details like "breath visible" and "shards of cooled lava," grounding the fantasy elements. However, the environment serves largely as a backdrop and does not forcefully constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics beyond the general atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established with competent but generic details ("weathered logs," "pine resin") that do not uniquely constrain the action. The grave is a strong opening image, but the environment largely serves as a static backdrop for introspection. The sensory details ("bruised purples") lean into standard literary tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospherically distinct, with the fog, algae, and ticking gears creating a strong sensory texture that grounds the scene. The visual of the "trembling calm" effectively establishes the mood, even if the shop's function is plot-weak.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("spilled milk" mist, "liquid starlight"), though the "tea ceremony" aspect is largely set dressing rather than a constraint that shapes the action. The environment feels tangible, but the floating platform's unique physics or risks could have pressured Kael's choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of a "sheet music archive" with an orchard on the brink of destruction creates a vivid, melancholic atmosphere. The sensory details, such as the dust smelling of regret and the chainsaws idling outside, effectively ground the supernatural elements in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("aged paper," "candlelight") that do not constrain the protagonist’s tactics or force specific interactions. The "shifting shelves" and "serpent" corridors serve as visual dressing rather than physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is excellent, with sensory details like "salt-streaked walls," "brass mechanism," and the "lines" on the water creating a tactile, immersive atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ quick test criteria for setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visually distinct but described with generic sci-fi/fantasy adjectives ("fractal," "quantum," "bioluminescent"). The environment functions more as a backdrop for the theme than a tangible place with physical constraints; the "heart" of the farm operates on convenient dream logic rather than established world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and distinct, with the "rainwashed library" and "ozone-smelling subway" grounding the magical elements well. The sensory details are specific (mica pane, damp paper), though the transition between spaces feels slightly dream-like and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's anchor, with specific sensory details like "damp earth and old copper" and the tactile "shattered window" sound of the harmonica creating a vivid atmosphere. The environment effectively isolates the protagonist, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is lush and establishes a strong atmosphere with specific details like "flowers glowing faintly" and "roots twisting." The blooming jetty effectively grounds the magical realism, though some descriptions ("bruise of violets") lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly overwrought, sensory details ("bruised sky," "moss-carpeted stage"). While atmospheric, the environment functions more as a static backdrop than a source of constraints or resources that shape the tactical choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is a vivid concept, and the sensory shift from sight to touch/sound is handled well ("teeth ache," "pressure and warmth"). However, descriptions occasionally slip into visual abstraction ("shimmering canopy") that filters poorly through a blind POV.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly is established with vivid, sensory-specific imagery ("air like glass," "stones hung midair") that grounds the scene. The setting actively facilitates the "history as web" projection, integrating well with the core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting relies heavily on exhausted literary clichés ("liquid silver," "whispering secrets," "lapping waves") that flatten the atmosphere into a generic backdrop. While the visual of the camera framing the moon is specific, the surrounding description lacks the grit or sensory freshness required for immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid, grounded by specific textures ("crushed obsidian," "gold spiral") that enhance the atmosphere. However, the spatial geography blurs significantly during the summarized montage section.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is vivid but leans into abstract, "purple" description ("plants a living instrument") rather than tactile reality. The environment functions more as a museum backdrop than a source of constraint, only becoming interactive in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shifting container labyrinth is a vivid, specific environment that actively pressures the protagonist. Atmospheric details like the "static hum" and "ozone" ground the fantastical elements effectively, though the specific mechanics of the storm remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the dental mirror and shutters offer specific imagery, the setting relies heavily on clichés ("groaning like old bones," "rough as gravel," "bruised sky like a bruise"). The atmospheric details feel painted on rather than integrated into the pressure of the scene. The repetition of "bruise" in the opening line ("bruised sky like a bruise") breaks immersion immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magnetic grotto is a vivid, specific micro-setting that physically constrains the action (the zipper humming, the magnetite pieces). The sensory details of the iron filings and the "cobalt" atmosphere ground the scene well. However, the logic of "mist-swirled aisles" inside a library is slightly fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The sublittoral fringe is rendered with standard postcard imagery ("kelp forests swayed," "bioluminescent fish") that serves as a passive backdrop. The setting does not exert pressure or constraint on the protagonist's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sensory details of the bone-colored farmhouse and the slicing turbines are vivid and establish a bleak atmosphere effectively. The environment provides the materials (wood scrap) for the central action, integrating setting with plot. However, the setting acts more as a backdrop than an active pressure system forcing specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "quartz veins" and "cobalt atrium" grounding the magical realism effectively. However, the descriptions occasionally stall momentum, and the environment yields too easily to the protagonist rather than imposing constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("sunlight fractured through molten-glass orbs," "brass keys glinting like molten gold") that effectively ground the magical elements. The environment feels distinct and lived-in, successfully establishing the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric descriptions like "golden shadows" and "brass dials" establish a consistent steampunk aesthetic, though the "texture of sound" relies on standard metaphors (sandpaper/silk). The setting details function as backdrop rather than forcing constraints on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory setting is established with vivid, if slightly romanticized, sensory details ("cold stone floor," "rusted telescopes"). The visual of the "curtains of intention" is strong, though the global coordinates feel somewhat abstract and list-like rather than grounded in the scene's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and specific, with the "rain-beaded skylight" and "silver serpent" tape grounding the surreal premise. The loft feels distinct and atmospheric, though the reliance on adjectival stacking ("onyx-inked," "rain-beaded") occasionally clutters the image. The setting actively frames the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit occasionally purple, imagery ("dust motes... atoms of nostalgia"). While the atmosphere of the twilight archive is cohesive, the sensory details often lean on generic fantasy tropes (glowing runes, humming artifacts) rather than specific, grounding interactions that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "petrified petals" and "glass dome" offer vivid imagery that grounds the fantasy setting effectively. However, the environment serves mostly as a backdrop rather than constraining choice or forcing tactical improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but suffers from logical slips for the sake of imagery (mist curling around *indoor* rafters implies a lack of a roof, yet there is a skylight). The "shimmering stillness" and "velvet" create a stage-set quality that lacks grit or sensory friction beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmospheric details ("damp stone," "frosted hourglass," "swirling like a storm") establish a solid mood. However, the "tunnel lined with coffee rings" struggles to land as a concrete physical space, hovering uncomfortably between metaphor and literal structure without full sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The booth is rendered with decent sensory attention ("smelled of dust and decayed film"), grounding the scene. However, the reliance on pathetic fallacy—the building sighing and approving, the rain matching her internal ache—undercuts the specificity of the setting, turning the environment into a mood ring for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    Visuals are vivid but purely ornamental, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics. Descriptions like "iridescent tendrils" and "stone columns etched with forgotten constellations" set a generic fantasy mood but do not function as active setting elements that shape the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and immersive, effectively using sensory details like "burnt honey and static" and "bioluminescent sand" to ground the surreal premise. The environment actively interacts with the character (sand dimming, towers humming), creating a cohesive atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is vividly realized with strong sensory details like "pistons hissed like cicadas" and specific tree sounds. The setting effectively grounds the surreal premise, though the catalog of trees feels slightly list-like rather than integrated into urgent action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and establishes a cohesive dreamlike atmosphere with details like the "meadow of thorns" and "scent of salt and iron." The visual logic of the shifting path is clear and supports the magical realism tone. However, the sensory experience is occasionally dampened by abstract descriptors like air tasting of "honey and regret."

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("frozen mercury," "cobalt-infused salves"), providing a distinct backdrop that informs the tone. However, the descriptions occasionally veer into ornamental "white-room" fantasy, where the environment serves as aesthetic wallpaper rather than a source of physical constraint or resources for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but standard high-fantasy fare ("hummed with forgotten prayers," "dusty volume"). While the "Silent Convergence" adds atmospheric texture, the environment yields to the protagonist rather than constraining her. The library functions as a backdrop for plot coupons rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.7)
    The station is grounded with specific sensory details ("barnacle," "cool metal"), establishing a strong initial atmosphere. However, the climax dissolves into generic "storm" and "churning" descriptions, losing the tactile specificity that anchored the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is functionally established with sensory details ("ozone and iron"), though it leans on standard genre tropes ("rusted cranes," "half-buried drones"). The ancient stones feel superimposed on the sci-fi setting as a plot device rather than an integrated organic feature.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vividly described ("sulfurous mist," "volcanic soil"), but the environment serves largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the arboretum's specific sensory details (stone, salt, lavender) actively constrain the protagonist's grounding exercise. The environment is not just a backdrop but a tool used to achieve the resolution, though the "abandoned since the last lighthouse keeper" element feels more like atmospheric trimming than a pressure mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong atmospheric detailing ("salt-rotted wood," "spines warped by humidity") grounds the setting effectively. The environment actively pressures the protagonist. The "luminescent ache" and lighting details contribute well to the mood, though spatial clarity wavers slightly at the stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "wind-carved encampment" and "bleaching light" provide vivid, atmospheric grounding. However, the setting struggles to integrate the high-tech drone with the elemental magic of the ink, leaving the world-building feeling disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic dystopian signifiers ("frosted glass," "towered," "snow") without specific sensory grounding. The "library" concept is present but functions as a static backdrop rather than an environment that constrains the protagonist's tactical choices. Occupational details of the cryo-archive are absent beyond the prompt's requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid, with specific sensory details ("thorns," "amber light," "glass dome") that ground the scene. However, the description occasionally drifts into the ornamental ("glittered like fractured starlight") rather than constraining the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "sound wave garden" is vividly realized, effectively blending synesthetic details like "tuning fork leaves" and "liquid fire" to ground the speculative elements. The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary mechanism through which the plot and character agency operate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    The observatory setting provides a functional atmospheric backdrop with details like "grinding gears," though the "rosewood" and "coffee-stained memo" feel like stock set dressing rather than specific, lived-in constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmospheric details are vivid ("ozone and regret," "honeyed glow"), but the professional context is incoherent—a tattooist operating high-tech scanners in a research lab feels ungrounded. The setting functions more as a backdrop for imagery than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.0)
    The grotto is rendered with vivid sensory detail ("moss," "damp," "whispering gallery"), establishing a strong atmosphere. However, the introduction of a "holographic image" in the climax creates a tonal clash with the established analog/earthy texture.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("ash and ozone," "shattered sky," "rubble") without specific, lived-in detail that constrains action. While the tessera is described, the broader environment feels like a painted backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric, establishing the orchard's mood effectively, though they often lean into ornamental excess. The setting acts as a static stage for the performance rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist's options or forces tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sensory details of the studio—ozone, acrylic, and the specific tactility of the geode—are vivid and ground the speculative elements well. The environment supports the "tech vs. nature" contrast, though the specific "willowglass" descriptor feels like a forced insertion rather than organic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details like the heat-mapper's colors are vivid, but the setting often relies on generic descriptors ("vast and ancient," "towered like sentinels") and cliché atmospheric cues rather than specific, lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    The warehouse setting is atmospheric and visually distinct, anchoring the scene effectively with "sawdust" and "moth-eaten maps." While the descriptions lean slightly purple ("groaning like ancient bones"), the environment provides the necessary tools (buttons) for the plot, integrating setting with action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with sensory details ("silver hush," "mist"), though descriptors like "frost-kissed" lean into cliché. The location provides atmospheric isolation but does not uniquely constrain the protagonist's tactical choices beyond generic privacy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric descriptions of the fog and river are vivid, establishing a strong mood. However, the spatial and logical grounding of the "rain gutters"—a key environmental anchor—is muddled, confusing the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the contrast between the "scorched wasteland" and the "skeletal hives" creates a strong sense of place. Details like the orange-bleeding horizon and the specific texture of the sunflowers ground the metaphysical concepts in sensory reality. The environment actively supports the tone and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.2)
    The harbor atmosphere is established with some sensory competence ("smelled of salt and diesel"), but the specific tool (bitting gauge) is used as a mystical talisman rather than a physical object, undermining verisimilitude. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric and cohesive, though it relies on familiar "magical library" tropes (shimmering ink, flying books) that function largely as backdrop. The setting facilitates the protagonist's journey rather than providing the friction or constraint necessary to force tactical innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is visually distinct, with specific details like the "mossy edge" and glass orbs grounding the scene effectively. However, descriptors like "sun’s aftermath" and "prismatic quiet" lean toward purple prose, occasionally prioritizing sound over sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric details of the station are vivid, particularly the "hum of the transmitter" and the visual of charts converging. However, the setting descriptions occasionally lean on generic tech-thriller tropes ("maze of cables," "green waves") rather than specific, lived-in details that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting details rely on generic atmospheric tropes ("shadowed nexus," "ancient cathedral," "shattered stained glass") rather than distinct, lived-in specificity. The environment functions as a generic obstacle course rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.8)
    The atmospheric description is vivid but leans heavily on purple prose ("mist clung... like a second skin," "blurring... into ghosts"). While the mood is established, the physical reality of the setting is porous; the preservation of fragile evidence (handprint, locket) in a quarry exposed to years of weather lacks verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is evoked with solid sensory details like "salt and ozone" and "brass dials." However, the descriptor "spongey gray" feels forced to meet a prompt requirement rather than organically atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sensory details like "pine resin and old engine oil" establish a baseline, but the setting remains a static stage that fails to constrain the protagonist's choices. The transition to the "new" place is vague ("air was thicker"), lacking the specificity required for high-band immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.1)
    Description relies on generic abstractions ("forgotten dreams," "dusky harmony") and clichés rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character. The train is a passive backdrop for nostalgia, failing to interact with the protagonist's choices or the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details—frosted glass, the brass sextant, the crater’s edge—effectively ground the fantastical elements. The imagery is vivid, though occasionally the sensory details feel like set dressing rather than constraints that force choices (e.g., the observatory's specific tools don't materially affect the solution beyond the sextant alignment). The "silver moth" simile in the opening is evocative but slightly imprecise spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with specific sensory details like "decaying fruit and ozone" grounding the fantasy elements. The "orchard vortex" is visualized clearly, though the "twisting like dancers" simile is slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting offers strong atmospheric visuals ("ozone and elderberries," "cobalt light"), though the description occasionally veers into purple prose ("sutured shut"). While the sensory details are distinct, the environment feels pliable and lacks the physical resistance needed to pressure the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric description is the story's strength, with effective imagery like "roots snaked through the bones" and "bioluminescent fungi." The setting feels distinct and immersive, though some elements (spider silk thread) lean on standard fantasy tropes. The environment successfully establishes a mood of dusky resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quarry office is an evocative setting, effectively contrasting the “chasm of granite” with the fragile memorabilia inside. Sensory details like the mud-caked boots and dynamite echoes successfully ground the atmosphere and mirror the protagonist’s rough transition.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "magnetic arbor" is visually distinct and imaginatively rendered, grounding the fantasy elements well. However, the setting remains largely passive/ornamental, providing atmosphere rather than specific physical obstacles that pressure the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the bamboo creel serving well as a micro-setting that constrains the action. Orientation is clear, though the world-building concept ("after tomorrow disappeared") remains largely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but leans heavily on familiar fantasy tropes ("stalactites that dripped like frozen tears," "veins of quartz"). While the imagery is vivid, the environment serves as a passive backdrop for the magical ritual rather than a source of frictional constraints or specific tactical challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like the ivy and rust are vivid, but the graffiti content breaks immersion; philosophical aphorisms in a urinal ("The river remembers what the mind forgets") read like authorial intrusion rather than found text. The setting serves the mood well but feels curated for the lesson rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "glowing library" and "mist" are generic fantasy tropes that provide atmosphere but fail to constrain choices or generate specific obstacles. While the "propagation delay" concept is inventive, it remains a passive observation rather than an environmental pressure that forces a trade-off or tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "velvet observatory" and "ice violin" creating a distinct, lush atmosphere that supports the magical realism tone. The heat of midsummer effectively contrasts with the ice object, grounding the scene physically. The environment actively participates in the narrative through the plants and the melting ice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific imagery (obsidian shards, bioluminescent moss) that grounds the magic. The description occasionally leans toward the ornamental, with a high density of adjectives that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is established but functions as generic high-fantasy furniture ("liquid silver," "mossy nook") rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The specific prompt phrase "vineyard hush" is repeated three times, becoming an intrusive refrain that feels forced rather than atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lighthouse setting provides a suitable atmospheric container with sensory details like "salt-stained stone" and "damp wood." The objects (cloak, chimes) effectively function as micro-settings that constrain focus, though the environment itself exerts little pressure on the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Imagery is vivid ("liquid mercury," "bioluminescent moss"), but the specific biome logic is disjointed; "sycamore hush" suggests a temperate forest while the "floating rock" and "grotto" imply an alien or subterranean void. The setting provides a backdrop for the action but does not actively constrain Elara's choices or force a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "bone towers" provide a striking visual concept, but the description leans on stock imagery ("bruised sky," "skeletal fingers") and lacks tactile grounding. The setting feels like a static backdrop for the epiphany rather than a pressurized environment that constrains Kael’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("dagger of frost," "ancient tomes") rather than specific, sensory grounding that constrains the character. While the visual of the garden is clear, the environment yields passively to the protagonist's desires rather than exerting pressure or shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like "salt-bitten wind" and "leather that shimmered like oil" effectively establish the mood. However, the spatial logic of the "sunken ship" versus the "pristine" library creates orientation debt—it is unclear how he breathes or moves from water to air, disrupting immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on repetitive descriptors ("ambered" appears four times) and generic cosmic imagery ("void," "crystalline") that functions as a static backdrop. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer tactile resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory setting is established with functional sensory details ("dust and rust," "amber light"), though they lean toward generic atmospheric tropes. The specific tools (prism, cabinet) are well-integrated into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the "sapphire viaduct" and the physics of the bell serve as essential constraints for the magic system. The sensory details ("frozen light," "sickly green") effectively ground the abstract magical concepts in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric detail is strong, with "violet" skies and foundations like "broken teeth" grounding the scene effectively. The sensory environment of the reservoir feels lived-in and distinct. The spatial relationship between the levee, the ridgeway, and the exposed town is generally clear, though the ease of access to the submerged/exposed areas raises minor logistical questions.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established, but relies heavily on high-fantasy visual clichés ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "liquid stained glass," "trapped starlight") that distance the reader. The environment feels like a stage set rather than a place with tactile resistance, though the mud footprint at the end offers a welcome grounding detail.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "nocturnal arbor" and "liquid silver" clouds create a distinct, atmospheric sense of place. The bioluminescent details are vivid, though the "fractal light" description leans slightly generic compared to the specificity of the parachute gear.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is vivid but operates largely as a static backdrop; the "rewriting history" concept remains atmospheric wallpaper rather than a constraint on the fight. While the visual of the floating dojo is clear, the environment does not force tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "nocturnal haven" and workshop are established with specific, atmospheric details ("soldering circuits," "volcanic soil") that ground the surreal elements. The setting effectively supports the mood, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of high-pressure constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.3)
    The tunnel setting is established with some sensory detail ("slick with condensation"), but the description often slips into abstraction ("grooves of forgotten laughter") that distances the reader. The physical reality of the space feels secondary to its metaphorical function.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details like "rime like ancient ghosts" and "mist swallowed sound," effectively creating an atmospheric container for the scene. The transformation of the garden into a "thought" aligns well with the magical realism elements, though the geography of the fountain relative to the cultist's fall is slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "tasting of rust" and the "obsidian plateau" establishing a solid atmosphere. The environment interacts with the magic system (ash, twilight), though the focus remains tight on the immediate courtyard. The "wounded heart" simile in the opening is a bit cliché, but the overall sense of place holds.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details, effectively grounding the fantasy elements in the physical decay of the tower. However, reliance on standard descriptors like "skeletal hand" and "gorge yawned" detracts from the otherwise specific atmosphere of the "serenely electric" ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid, if occasionally lush, imagery ("liquid starlight," "bioluminescent veins"). The specific visualization of the docks "layered atop one another like pages in a book" is an excellent, grounding detail that serves the timeline-merging concept well.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but leans on familiar "illusion" tropes (mirrors, fractals, shifting floors) without specific, grounding details that make it feel lived-in. The environment functions more as a metaphorical backdrop than a tangible place with distinct rules or constraints. The "void" sequence is spatially vague.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "benthic city" is established with clear visual anchors like "reinforced glass" and "spired silhouettes," providing a solid backdrop. The sensory details ("pressure more intense," "cold glimmer") effectively ground the scene, though they rarely constrain the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically vivid but leans on decorative, slightly purple description ("mist curling... like spectral cats," "bruised violet") rather than providing constraints that shape tactics. The "labyrinth" is declared but not spatially grounded, serving as a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric detailing is strong, with "skeletal map of dried seaweed" and "moss-slicked concrete" grounding the facility effectively. The sensory environment mirrors the decay well, though the prompt-mandated "crashing hush" feels slightly forced in its insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "opal observatory" and "frost-laced windows" establishing a strong mood. However, the sensory details occasionally lean towards the decorative ("ghost of starlight") rather than strictly constraining choice or action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong visual anchors like the bone towers. However, descriptions lean toward high-fantasy abstraction ("throat of endless echoes") rather than tactile interaction, creating a sense of distance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, with specific details like the rusted cordless phone on a mushroom stool grounding the weirdness. While some descriptions veer into cliché ("iridescent as oil on water"), the underground garden feels distinct and appropriately oppressive.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and establishes a clear "techno-magical" aesthetic with the crystalline engines and metal fruit, creating a distinct atmosphere. However, descriptions often lean into generic "purple" fantasy tropes ("captured sunsets," "liquid light") rather than grounded sensory details that constrain the character's choices. The environment feels more like a static backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "cobalt arcade" and "jagged line" of the border establish a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the magical realism. However, the reliance on heavy adjectives ("brittle," "cobalt") risks becoming repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    The initial atmosphere of the rusted train is functional, but the transition to the sunny courtyard destroys the setting's credibility without establishing a magical realism frame. The "misting hush" motif is atmospheric but overused. Spatial anchors disintegrate mid-story, turning the setting into a generic dreamscape rather than a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "scientific poetry" concept is inventive and grounds the setting effectively (equations and sonnets sharing space). However, sensory details occasionally slip into cliché ("lavender and ink," "dusty tome") rather than offering specific, surprising observations that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies on generic lyrical fantasy markers ("whispering stones," "bleeding horizons") that do not constrain the character’s tactics. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a source of friction or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric markers ("cobbled alley," "damp moss," "starlight") without specific, grounding details. The "nexus" is defined only by vague metaphysical properties, failing to act as a concrete environment that constrains or pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse and fungal star-maps create a distinct, atmospheric setting that grounds the fantasy elements. Sensory details like the "salt-crusted glass" and "ivory caps" are vivid and specific. The environment pressures the action slightly via the tide and sand, though the potential for greater atmospheric pressure is underutilized at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.5)
    Specific sensory details like "damp parchment" establish atmosphere, but the "playground swing" simile creates a jarring anachronism against the quill-and-scroll aesthetic. The setting feels constructed around prompt requirements rather than organically lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    The setting is vivid but relies on generic fantasy imagery like "sunlight dripped... like liquid gold" and "pink tongues." While the parapet and waterfall are spatially clear, the descriptors feel decorative rather than constraining or specifically grounded in a lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but functions as a static backdrop; the "glass walls" and "prisms" are ornamental details that do not constrain the action or influence tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "rain-scoured frescoes" and the map's "jagged tear" effectively ground the surreal elements. The contrast between the archival vault and the mossy henge creates a strong sense of place, though the underground chapel leans slightly toward generic fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting lacks fundamental physical credibility for a story centered on a physicist. Describing paper manuals as having "salt-crusted spines" and tape decks as intact after decades in the "abyss" ignores basic decay, turning the sunken ship into a dry haunted house and breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on vague, ethereal descriptors ("tinkersong wonder," "misty courtyard") that lack tactile specificity. The environment feels like a generic backdrop rather than a pressurized space that constrains the character. The "driftingly alert" mist is an awkward anthropomorphism that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmospheric details of the icebound spire are vivid but rely on standard steampunk/fantasy tropes. The lack of clarity regarding the physical space—whether the study is a room or the elevator car itself—undermines the reader's grounding in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "brass telescope" and "wicker belly" grounding the ethereal premise. The atmospheric transition from night to dawn supports the emotional arc well.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the reader in the damp, hollowed oak. Sensory details like "muted earth tones" and the smell of "wet soil and old parchment" create a strong, specific sense of place that supports the guild’s legacy theme.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sensory details are serviceable ("copper hull," "liquid darkness") but often lean on clichés. The "void" and "shimmering tunnel" are generic fantasy spaces that lack the specific, gritty texture established on the airship.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmospheric details ("ice-bound shelves," "shattered ice") effectively ground the scene in the specific location. However, the "Hall of Mirrors" functions as a standard trope without a fresh sensory or psychological twist.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with generic fantasy tropes ("floating rock arches," "ancient sentinels") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the characters' choices. The environment functions as a backdrop for the fable rather than a physical space with distinct rules or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "pane of hush" is a strong, specific invention that anchors the scene and constrains the protagonist's actions. The atmospheric details (salt, decay, spectral glow) support the tone well, though the lighthouse itself is a somewhat standard trope.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with the "nut" serving as a brilliant grounding object that bridges the micro and macro scales. The contrast between the natural rot and the mechanical birds is vivid, though the "illusion" aspect of the labyrinth mentioned in exposition is not dramatized in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ravine and the foam are rendered with specific, grounded detail that anchors the abstract chemical metaphors. The setting actively mirrors the internal state, though the scientific overlay occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "glass orchard library" is visually distinct and consistently rendered, providing a functional backdrop for the concept. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; the "swirling sea of clouds" and "translucent panes" do not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's tactical options or the scene's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the tactile intersection of the "arctic" pavilion, "wet stone," and "salt" creates a vivid, grounded magic system. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, forcing physical engagement (numbing cold, stinging cuts) that mirrors the emotional stakes. The transition from the alien ice of the pavilion back to the warmth of the kitchen creates a powerful sensory contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The juxtaposition of the astronomical clock and grain elevator is distinct, but the setting largely functions as a static backdrop for the metaphor rather than a physical space of constraint. Sensory details are present ("creaks," "starlight") but often lean into atmospheric cliché ("hush of borrowed starlight") rather than concrete, lived-in interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The canyon and mirror are anchored clearly, but the description relies heavily on stock atmospheric tropes ("liquid mercury," "ancient rock"). While the mirror functions well as a focal prop, the setting details are ornamental rather than creating pressure or constraints on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the gravity inversion providing a strong visual anchor. However, descriptors occasionally drift into purple prose ("clandestinely luminous," "mist... like living things"), and the "seeds of vigilance" remain abstract concepts literalized as objects rather than integrated into the world's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the tactile interaction with the stump is vivid, the opening description of "needle-thin leaves" on alders (which are broadleaf) is a significant botanical error that breaks verisimilitude. The setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "magnetic nexus" provides a vivid backdrop, but the description "hologram of sorts" disrupts the fantasy tone with anachronistic phrasing. The setting provides atmosphere but does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's tactical options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is functional but relies on standard tropes (cobwebs, dust, rusted tools) without unique sensory pressure. The "shadowed workshop" serves as a static backdrop rather than an environment that constrains the protagonist's choices or tactics in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting details are list-like and generic ("vines," "lanterns") rather than grounded in immediate, constraining action. The descriptor "olfactorily sensitive nose" is a distracting tautology that undermines the sensory authority of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The visual concept of liquid spheres and floating arches is vivid and strongly anchored. The setting actively creates the navigational challenge (following water flow), though the "socket" mechanism detracts from the organic verisimilitude established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with distinct sensory details like "salt-stained gravel" and "sodium lights" grounding the weirdness. The atmospheric density effectively supports the mood, though the personification of the containers occasionally leans heavily on simile.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid but veer into decorative "purple" descriptions ("sculpted hush made flesh") that do not constrain choices. The setting facilitates the magic conveniently rather than providing friction or resources that require ingenuity to navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Thunder-Echo Range is established with distinct sensory details ("petrified pine," "obsidian"). The setting actively constrains the protagonist via the labyrinthine terrain and the specific mechanics of the "Veil's Edge," integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory-rich details like "burnt sapphire" and "iron filings" that ground the fantastical elements. The atmosphere effectively mirrors the protagonist’s clinical detachment, though some descriptions ("stars bled," "symphony of hues") veer into abstraction. The specific machinery of the letterpress adds tangible weight to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the aurora and frost providing a strong visual backdrop. While immersive, the environment functions mostly as scenery rather than a source of pressure that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The quartz arbor is described with vivid, if slightly standard, fantasy imagery. The integration of the car is the weak link; its presence in a mystical forest setting is unexplained ("a car sat parked"), appearing solely to satisfy the prompt's method requirement without grounding in the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is established with sensory specificity, blending the natural (bamboo, rain) with the magical effectively. The "rummage sale box" provides a nice textural contrast to the timeless orchard, grounding the magical elements in concrete, tactile detail that constrains the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting imagery is vivid ("floating rock arches," "skeletal hand") but leans heavily on standard fantasy tropes without deepening the narrative logic. While the environment is visualized, it functions more as a static backdrop than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting utilizes competent but standard genre binaries: the rusting, dusty "real" world versus the gleaming alloy of the alternate reality. While sensory details like the "scent of ozone" and the visor’s "mosaic of colors" provide some texture, the environment largely serves as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lighthouse setting is rendered with competent, atmospheric detail ("salt and age," "iron and brine"), though it relies on standard genre tropes. The sensory work is consistent, but the environment serves more as a passive backdrop than a source of constraints that force unique tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.3)
    The lighthouse and lantern imagery is vivid, effectively using light and shadow to create atmosphere. However, the setting operates mostly as a stage for the ritual rather than a pressure cooker; the "wind screaming" is a standard atmospheric trope that does not constrain her choices specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with vivid, ethereal imagery ("obsidian stones," "golden threads") that supports the tone well. While atmospheric, the "floating" nature of the tea house is largely aesthetic and does not constrain the action or physics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively establishing the mood of the "stormlit tower," though some descriptions veer into standard fantasy tropes ("brass gears," "cracked like a spider's web"). While the environment is detailed, it serves largely as a backdrop rather than an active constraint that forces the protagonist to alter his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting is visually lush but suffers from static description that does not constrain the protagonist's movement or choices. While the mica windows are integral to the plot, the orchard feels like a backdrop for lyrical imagery ("liquid twilight," "molten gold") rather than a pressurized environment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric details are competent but rely on standard magical-library tropes ("gold filigree," "vaulted ceilings," "shadowed aisle"). The setting serves as a functional backdrop but lacks the specific, gritty texture or unique constraints that would elevate it beyond a generic set piece.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with distinct sensory details ("damp earth and jasmine," "green flames"). While atmospheric, the description sometimes halts momentum, and the "secret garden" trope is played relatively straight without subversion.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "colors bleaching like old ink" and the "quartz hush." The "frozen library" concept is well-integrated into the mechanics (ice prism), grounding the magic in the physical environment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sensory details ("sagging planks," "mildew and fear," "corroded clock tower") create a vivid, tactile atmosphere. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, though the specific mechanics of the "sound of trust breaking" device feel slightly out of sync with the gritty, barnacled aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    The synesthetic approach to setting (tasting ozone, soot, blood) is vivid and effectively anchors the supernatural elements in the body. However, the visual descriptions occasionally lean into purple prose ("liquid light," "petals trembling like wings"). The bluff is well-realized as a pressure cooker for the event.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    The crystalline setting is vivid and integrates well with the light-based climax, providing necessary tools for the resolution. However, the description often leans into purple prose ("prismatic," "fractured rainbows") that distances the reader rather than grounding them in sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively blending the "glass domes" with the "toxic sky." Details like the "zinc-etched postal plate" and "poisoned honey" ink ground the fantasy in tangible textures. The environment actively constrains the protagonist (flytrap fens), fulfilling the requirement for setting as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on standard fantasy tropes ("whispering bluff," "ancient stones") without constraining the protagonist's actions or choices. While the specific kinetic sculpture details are visual, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established with some evocative sensory details ("synthetic air tasting of ozone and pressed lavender") that ground the sci-fi elements. However, the "magnetic storm" remains largely atmospheric, failing to exert concrete physical pressure on the protagonist’s choices beyond dimming the lights. The environment is vivid but functions more as a backdrop than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with generic "cozy mystery" markers (damp earth, gleaming cobblestones) rather than specific, sensory grounding. While the courtyard is visually present, it serves as a static backdrop for exposition rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric, but physical constraints are inconsistent; Kael snaps fingers and dances in a diving suit that previously had a fogged visor, with no on-page transition to remove the bulky gear.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting details are reasonably vivid, particularly the "brittle white fragments" and the "gleaming silence." However, the "pockets of gravity" remain somewhat abstract in their physical manifestation, functioning more as a magical plot device than a tangible environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("moss," "fireflies," "brook") and abstract descriptors ("smoothed hush") rather than tactile grounding. The description of eyes as "terrestrially cosmic" undermines physical realism and immersion, reading as purple prose rather than character detail.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and active, with the rooftop garden and meteor shower integrating meaningfully into the ritual's mechanics. Sensory details like "glass panels fracturing the starlight" and the "hum of distant traffic" establish a specific, grounded atmosphere that supports the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with vivid but overly ornamental descriptions ("velvet," "ink," "veils") that feel static. The introduction of "resonance structures" creates a jarring register clash with the fantasy garden atmosphere, breaking the tonal consistency of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sanctuary is vividly rendered, effectively framing the isolation required for the act. However, descriptors like "liquid time" and "thick as velvet" push the atmosphere toward the ornamental, occasionally prioritizing aesthetic signaling over sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.7)
    Atmospheric descriptions like "rock split like a scar" establish a solid visual tone. However, abstract phrases ("unseen things") and generic fantasy tropes weaken specificity, and the setting rarely constrains the protagonist’s movement.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The glacial shrine offers some vivid imagery ("candles... borrowed starlight"), but the setting feels static and disconnected from the action. The timeline impossibility (100-year-old survivors) breaks the world's internal consistency, making the specific relationships feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting provides atmospheric visuals but suffers from repetitive descriptors ("liquid silver," "silver threads"); the physical logic is strained by the presence of a delicate bamboo tea whisk during rough net-mending work on a damp parapet. Sensory details like "drowsy fireflies" lean into cliché, diminishing the specific texture of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard’s imagery is vivid, with "miniature suns" and "rust-colored dust" effectively grounding the surreal elements. The setting actively pressures the protagonist via radiation and the "hum" of the anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is vivid but suffers from "white room" syndrome, where the observatory feels like a stage for props (gears, hourglass) rather than a lived-in space. While the "cobalt glass portico" is a strong image, the description is often overwritten ("drowned skies," "circuit board gone feral"), drawing attention to the prose rather than the environment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting contains evocative details ("warped floorboards," "salt and old wood"), though descriptions occasionally drift into abstraction ("positively wistful gold"). The environment feels static, serving as a backdrop rather than pressuring the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sensory details are vivid ("tangerine and lavender") but tilt toward ornamentation rather than constraint. While the ice is used for the mechanic, the setting largely functions as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces specific tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and functional, with the physics of the "magnetic viaduct" and "moon paths" firmly grounding the action. Sensory details of frost, iron filings, and basalt create a cohesive atmosphere that actively shapes the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details of the damp, echoing tunnel effectively ground the scene and reflect the post-drought constraint. The sensory environment supports the mood well, though the transition between the physical tunnel and the vision world could be sharper to heighten the disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is the strongest element, providing specific sensory details (metallic tang, graphite) that ground the scene. However, the pathetic fallacy of the storm mirroring the internal state feels slightly contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, effectively utilizing sensory details like the "taste of rust" and "sulfurous winds" to ground the fantastical elements. The floating workshop and acid sea create a distinct physical reality that constrains the action (e.g., acid eating tools), though the sudden appearance of the bell tower feels spatially convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting consists of generic sci-fi tropes ("glowing labyrinth," "cold light," "holographic interface") without distinct sensory specificity. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "orchard on ice" is a visually distinct concept, though the "vintage store" descriptor feels anachronistic to the mythic tone. The setting serves largely as a decorative backdrop rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "drift-ice marina" is atmospheric and vivid, with details like "skeletal network" and "blurred by frost" effectively grounding the mood. However, the mechanics of "trawling" ice with picks and shovels are vague, and the physical reality of the rescue (weight, leverage vs. the fragile tool) is ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details ("lacquered wood," "acidic soil") are competent but operate largely as mood lighting rather than active constraints. The setting frames the scene pleasantly but does not force tactical choices or create physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of atmospheric labels ("whisperfield," "murmuring pavilion") that float without sensory grounding or tactical constraint. The "kinetic parapet" functions as a magical convenience rather than a physical space that shapes the characters' movements or choices. The environment provides mood but not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established, but descriptions often drift into purple prose ("scent of memory and possibility") rather than concrete sensory grounding. The environment functions more as a symbolic backdrop for the protagonist's thoughts than a tangible place exerting pressure on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with standard atmospheric details ("dust motes," "faint scent of ink," "cracked leather") but lacks constraint; the library functions as a generic backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The attribute "sonically reflective" is introduced but immediately followed by a visual description ("prismatic fragments"), creating a jarring logical disconnect in the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is vivid and specific, with details like "twisted rebar" and "bicycle frames" grounding the surreal elements; the fog functions well as both mood and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "scent of ozone" and "tarnished brass" ground the scene well. However, the mix of "lunar observatory" (implies moon) and "scent of pine" (implies Earth) creates a slight orientation wobble regarding the actual location.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is described in abstract, ethereal terms ("radiant haven," "above the clouds") that detach the story from the physical reality of a hospice. Sensory details are frequently mixed with abstractions ("smelled of lavender and hope"), blurring specificity and reducing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with competent, if standard, fantasy imagery ("brass telescopes," "swirling mist"). While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint that forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers (ivy, honeysuckle, moss) that fail to constrain action or generate atmosphere. The physical space of the garden feels abstract, serving only as a backdrop for dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly realized with specific sensory details like the "zephyr bloom" and "lichen," successfully grounding the magical operation in physical reality. The setting actively provides the resources (light, stone, water) that constrain the character's work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of "skeletal remains of servers" with bioluminescent nature creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. The "icicles melt in sequence" detail grounds the abstract concept of the data center in concrete physical observation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details like the "cold fire" and "seaweed dress," but the "feral" aspect is underplayed; the nexus feels like a gentle, guided tour rather than a wild, untamable place. The imagery leans on standard atmospheric tropes (mist, shadows) rather than specific, surprising textures.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on stock fantasy descriptors ("liquid gold," "verdant arbor," "silver sliver") rather than specific, grounding details. The atmosphere is cohesive but generic, lacking the unique sensory constraints that characterize high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "frost-bitten lanterns" and "crushed apple shells" effectively grounding the magic. The environment supports the tone well, creating a tangible sense of place that enhances the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details like the &quot;taste of damp stone&quot; effectively ground the scene, but descriptions often rely on standard fantasy tropes like &quot;frozen starlight.&quot; The cavern's acoustic shifting is a strong specific detail, but the setting largely serves as a passive container for the puzzle rather than exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "bronze grotto" is a distinct, evocative setting that effectively constrains the action (dampness, starlight angles). Sensory details like "wet metal" and "moss-crusted pool" ground the fantastical elements, though the specific phrase "shingled hush" loses impact through overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly adjectival, sensory details that anchor the mood effectively. The "rain-beaded skylight" and "damp wool" create a coherent atmosphere, though the description leans toward static "literary" set-dressing rather than environmental elements that actively constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "kinetic lagoon" is established with vivid, specific imagery ("stuck coin," "bruised violet") that effectively grounds the surreal premise. The atmospheric details are woven into Veyra's actions, though the reliance on adjectives occasionally slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is rendered through "purple" clichés ("bruised twilight sky," "skeletal remains," "labyrinthine corridors") rather than specific, sensory interaction. While the location is established, it functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources; the "maze" is mentioned but never navigated as a tactical challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sensory details of the keep and the forecourt are vivid and integral to the plot; the singing floor is a strong example of setting-as-action. The atmosphere is thick and consistent, though occasionally the density of description slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is rendered with purple descriptions ("liquid silver," "drowned coins") that create a generic atmospheric wash without constraining action. The warehouse functions as a static container for the plot coupon (the blueprint) rather than a lived-in space that pressures the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is vivid and effectively establishes a mood of reverence; the "golden dock" and "watercolor blur" ground the scene. The fog serves as a functional constraint, focusing attention on the immediate interaction, though some descriptors lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy markers ("shadowed garden," "pale gown," "scent of jasmine") rather than specific, constraining details. While atmospheric, the environment functions as a static backdrop that accommodates the protagonist's needs rather than pressuring them.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is visually grounded but relies on standard genre tropes ("bioluminescent flora," "crystal spires") without unique specificity. The phrase "tasted of oil and regret" is an abstract stylistic reach that dilutes the sensory immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with "obsidian lagoon" and "volcanic sand" grounding the scene effectively. The environment mirrors the internal state well, though some descriptions ("hissed like a secret") lean toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting descriptions are heavy with atmospheric adjectives ("bruised," "ashen," "fractured") but lack physical solidity; the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The nebula garden is established with vivid, ethereal imagery like "mother-of-pearl" and "crystalline trees." While atmospheric, the description leans on soft, abstract metaphors ("petals drifted like forgotten constellations") rather than concrete, tactile details that would ground the speculative elements.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse setting is established with vivid, atmospheric sensory details ("damp earth," "brittle leaves"). The butterfly migration provides a strong visual anchor, though the "thundering calm" is a slightly confusing sensory image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "blackened spine" of the ridge and the "fractured shards" effectively grounding the surreal concept. The environment exerts tangible pressure on the plot through the cracking obsidian, integrating atmosphere with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is visually distinct ("cobalt silo," "oculus") but decorative, serving as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources. The sensory details are frequent but often slide into purple prose ("skeletal finger," "velveteen gloom") rather than grounded specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "obsidian spire" and "frozen lake" provide a vivid, if standard, high-fantasy backdrop. However, the setting functions primarily as scenery rather than a source of specific, tactical constraints that force Lira to adapt her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and clearly drawn, though it relies on genre tropes ("ashen plains," "bioluminescent moss"). The environment provides mood but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts; the mist and cold are mentioned but easily managed.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the mask and ash provide some texture, the setting relies on generic surreal descriptors ("impossible angles," "shadows pool") that lack concrete grounding. The gallery's mechanics are interesting but operate as a background condition rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is established with sensory density ("muck," "moldy tomes," "rust"), grounding the abstract themes in physical decay. The "sunken city" atmosphere is vivid. Some descriptors lean toward generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("crumbling arches," "sediment"), but the environment functionally pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "velvet library" establishes a distinct mood, though the outside world is rendered in generic terms ("news reports"). The sensory details are consistent but often ornamental ("autumn’s light gilded the dust motes") rather than functional constraints on action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, if standard, post-apocalyptic imagery (rusted greenhouse, moss). Sensory details are prioritized, particularly the violet light and synesthetic tastes, though the "last era before the Collapse" framing feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The imagery of the tower and drones is distinct ("lattice of copper cables," "bee-shaped machines"), anchoring the fantasy elements well. However, the mechanics of the world remain vague, serving the metaphor rather than establishing a grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with some sensory detail ("weathered dock post," "amber haze"), but relies on pathetic fallacy ("streetlights daydreamed") rather than concrete constraints. The acoustic properties of the bay are mentioned but do not significantly pressure the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater garden is vividly realized with specific details like "bioluminescent algae" and "obsidian," creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset, though the "foxglove-stained glass" is a confusing image (glass does not typically stain from flowers). The setting effectively grounds the magical elements even when the plot logic wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The staircase is atmospheric with details like "breathing" and "shimmered like aged parchment" establishing the surreal physics. However, sensory details occasionally slip into abstraction (tasting "regret"), which dilutes the physical immediacy of the setting by relying on metaphor over concrete stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric ("burnt copper," "smog-choked"), though some descriptors ("defiant lips") feel strained. The contrast between the greenhouse and the city is effectively established.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like the "moss-carved arches" and "crystalline pool" create a tangible, atmospheric world. The opera glass functions effectively as a micro-setting element that anchors the backstory in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmosphere is well-rendered with sensory specifics like the "slow exhale of low tide" and the damp sand. The setting actively integrates with the plot, as the receding tide reveals the path to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting uses standard horror tropes ("bruise-colored sky," "peeling paint") that establish atmosphere but do not uniquely constrain tactical choices. While the mirrors are mentioned, the environment functions largely as a generic backdrop for the confrontation rather than an active pressure cooker. Spatial choreography is clear but uninventive.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and highly specific, with "sun-bleached driftwood" and "kelp ropes" grounding the surreal premise. The physical constraints of the narrowing circle directly influence the choreography (forcing her to pivot), satisfying the requirement for the environment to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, tactile details like the "calcified bone" and "tastes of salt and iron." The integration of the turtle mythology into the architecture (Market District, Shell Quarter) is immersive and grounds the fantasy elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The station description is competent, with ivy and crumbling stone establishing a clear atmosphere, though the "symbols on the wall" feel like convenient set dressing. The setting serves as a static container for the clues rather than an active force that constrains or complicates the protagonist's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("silt," "liquid amber"), establishing a strong mood, but the spatial logic is incoherent. The coexistence of a waded approach, a functional drawbridge, and a dry subterranean chamber with preserved paper/specimens after a century of submersion strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere of the sunken library is established with vivid sensory details ("cracked and bloated" spines). However, the physics of a dry chamber behind a simple rusted door in a submerged city strain credibility without an airlock mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is lush and specific ("bioluminescent moss," "lotus cups"), effectively grounding the magical elements. The imagery of the basilica "descending while ascending" provides a strong, if paradoxical, spatial anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "floating observatory" and the "glass floor" serve as excellent filters for the protagonist’s perception of trauma. The sensory details ("ozone and ash," "fractal shadows") ground the high-concept premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like the "crown of shadows" and "celestial keyhole" establishing a strong atmosphere. The environment interacts well with the plot's astronomical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric ("cobalt terrace," "driftwood"), establishing a moody tone consistent with the premise. However, the description often slips into purple prose ("air tasted of salt and secrets"), and the pathetic fallacy of the environment mirroring the character's guilt reduces verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is moody and consistent, effectively grounding the scene in a specific "coastal noir" aesthetic. However, descriptions often slide into "pathetic fallacy" or abstract/concrete muddles ("pitted by... salt and regret") that blur the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, if sometimes cliché, details ("liquid mercury"). The lighthouse and compass serve as effective props. The spatial confusion regarding the shifting shadows ("stretching east when they should've pointed west" at dawn implies sunset or disorientation) muddies the orientation slightly without a clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "bioluminescent lake" and "drowned stars" creating a distinct, moody atmosphere. The sensory details ("damp," "slick with moss") ground the surreal elements effectively, though the focus remains visual-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong, cohesive atmosphere; the specific ingredients (cardamom, star anise) and the "moonthorn" ground the high fantasy in sensory details. The "permanent moonlight" effectively shapes the mood and limits the temporal scope.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is a strong suit, with distinct sensory details like "ozone and old starlight" and roots coiling like hourglasses. The setting actively supports the ritual, though the "glass city" feels slightly like a backdrop change rather than a grounded space.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting details—fused asteroid metal, android midwives—are vivid and specific, creating a solid atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop; the "bioluminescent garden" is a generic destination that does not constrain the protagonist's tactics or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    The volcanic beach and "charcoal grit" provide a vivid, albeit somewhat decorative, backdrop. The setting grounds the scene visually, but the transition to the "glowing imprint" constellation map drifts into unanchored magical realism that lacks physical logic within the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric ("luminous fort," "fading amber light") and anchors the scene well. Specific details like the "half-painted sundial" add texture, though the transition from the abstract "cradle of sparks" to a literal room is slightly jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The frictionless water constraint is inventive and vividly rendered, grounding the magic system well. However, specific Earth-based terms like "Fibonacci" and "Pascal’s triangle" clash tonally with the high-fantasy setting, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric, and the darkroom timer provides a nice specific anchor. However, descriptions rely heavily on stock storm imagery ("liquid mercury," "beast in pain," "divine signature") which dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the strongest element; the integration of the "half-painted sundial" into the floor as a mechanic for the duel is a clever use of space. The "glass atrium" and "brook" provide clear sensory anchors, though the "danish tin sewing needle card" feels somewhat inserted to satisfy a prompt rather than organically arising from the world.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric description ("canopy of stars") clashes with institutional logic; the setting reads simultaneously as an abandoned ruin and a staffed prison facility, creating confusion. This spatial incoherence undermines the stakes of Marla’s presence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "tidal arbor" offers striking atmospheric imagery, but the spatial grounding falters during the key discovery sequence. The physical constraints of the piano bench and the secret room are confusingly rendered, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like "jasmine and iron" and "ferns unfurled like emerald scrolls" establish a vivid atmosphere. However, the inclusion of the prompt phrase "empirically whimsical" feels jarring and breaks the otherwise mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sensory details of Marrow’s End ("damp tang," "wet kelp") effectively establish a moody, atmospheric backdrop. However, the setting acts largely as scenery rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the characters' choices. The spatial geography of the studio and the sea is clear, anchoring the scene well.

    The prep room’s lilies/linen/casket layout is sketched with economy and re-used: casket hides her, dummy body shocks agents, ink pot sits on the same mahogany surface she crouched against. Micro-setting (the pot’s false bottom) literally constrains the final exchange. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual—but selective attention fits a child spy under siege. Enough to pass the 9- gate but no environmental turn charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bonsai-labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: knee-high oaks constrain her kneeling posture, mineral-gloss leaves refract the lamp-glow that she charts. The notepad’s mixed parchment literally supplies the “textures of different times,” fusing setting and method. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, lamp, clearing—yet the environment never physically resists or limits her; it hums complicity, not threat, so the setting enchants without constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Container labyrinth is not postcard backdrop: shifted geometry (“left at the rusted hatch, right past the broken seal”) steers his path; tide-clock narrows scavenger windows; diesel/decay smells tighten atmosphere. Micro-setting succeeds—poison label in pocket and locket against chest act as portable environments that charge final image. One sensory over-indulgence—“steel mountains that clawed at the bruised sky”—leans purple, preventing 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory’s cracked dome, slanting sun, and frozen 11:59 dials are tactile forces, not backdrop; the cello’s half-finished body acts as micro-setting that literally channels harmony. Spatial choreography is clean: shell on bridge → vibration → rattling windows → glowing dust staff. Weathered tools constrain choices: only the frayed cello can transmit the hum. The final image of dome creaking open charges every prior detail with cosmic listening.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory lineup (diesel, fried dough, neon, soot) is filtered through Lira’s planner gaze, anchoring raft-city physics in a single plank walk. The chip’s weight in pocket and raised paint under fingertip micro-locate every beat. Carnival layout evolves from labyrinth to coded banner, showing setting guiding tactics. Final image of gilded barge fading into mist recharges earlier skyline chaos with palpable temporary reprieve.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lunar vacuum is more than backdrop: temperature breach creeps through gloves, visor fogs, chronometer ticks—environment actively squeezes the body. The crater edge, visor glow, and distant Earth triangulate a micro-setting that orients every camera framing. Tool-as-setting succeeds: the vial’s glass and laser trigger constrain the exact placement and timing of her gesture. Final image reuses summit geometry (shadow against void) to recharge the stake—environment directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist-clung depot, skylight basin, and braille tool-belt are sensually selective and bias-filtered through Lira’s touch-centric POV. The anchor-lift creaks and condensation drips evolve with action, guiding her timing. Micro-setting (water basin) literally constrains the final fix—no basin, no refraction map. Final image recharges the same basin catching dawn, mirroring her endless cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rusted outpost, frost-pitted plateau, and pulsing under-ice glow are not backdrop but equipment: the generator’s hiss limits Jorn’s solidarity, the clawed ice dictates camp placement, the glowing shard becomes the new compass. Micro-setting (condensation on tent wall) literally rewrites the map, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient archway is not mere backdrop—it frames Kael’s entrance and exit, literalizing threshold and cost. Micro-setting (fork pressed to soil, bell clapper’s rust) constrains every tuning action. Sensory hierarchy follows Kael’s profession: sound > touch > iron scent. Weathered stone and weed-choked fountain evolve causally under footstep vibration; no postcard static. Final image re-uses the arch as symbol of passage, now charged with living noise rather than silence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Blackroot Ocean, crumbling archway, algae-slick stone, bioluminescent dome—each detail is filtered through Mara’s gloved, urgent touch. The temple’s sound-trap architecture isn’t backdrop; it forces her slow patience with the rusted stopper and later squeezes her ribs through the fissure. The empty vial floating beside her at dawn reprises salt-sting and lavender, charging the final image with the setting’s transformed meaning. Spatial choreography is flawless; no caps apply.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Jagged reef/lighthouse skeleton, copperlight bleeding walls, lattice as micro-setting all constrain movement and image. Sensory triage—salt, rust, metal bite—mirrors Elias’s fevered filter. Final reef vista recharges “bodies” dread, feeding RR. Environment materially shapes hover path and final stance; no white-room lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Frost clung to glass panes… shadows pooled like ink” filters perception through the ghost’s bias, framing access and threat; the crystalline fruit that hums against Elara’s gloved hand becomes a micro-setting that forces her decisive move. Every sensory detail serves pressure—spectral iridescence foreshadows the later light-vortex—so the greenhouse actively constrains tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single greenhouse set; rune etchings and the bead’s meteorite core remain consistent anchors. The environment’s shift from endless night to dawn is the visual cost that locks closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Red stone grooves, damp air, and iridescent thread are selectively layered so the canyon body becomes both obstacle and canvas; the thread’s glow reacting to song provides the micro-setting twist that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Golden arcade at dawn is more than postcard: refracted light through fountain water literally unlocks the compartment, so setting constrains the pivotal choice. Texture is selective—honeyed glass, brass rail, cyan chalk—filtered through Lira’s decoder gaze. Spatial choreography is sound; body positions track from balcony to staircase to fountain. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual, but that bias is POV-justified. Phoenix seal recurs to charge closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cobalt walls, frost rattle, domed dust, and brass sconce constrain movement and social risk; the candle’s heat limits how long Zara can safely “show” the message. The spiral galaxy cloth itself acts as micro-setting/tool hybrid that literally reconfigures under flame, charging the final image. Selective sensory triage—cold air, metallic scent, silk glow—mirrors her narrowed attention under coup anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mangrove roots/water function as micro-setting that literally guide her exit; spirits’ spatialized song constrains attention—she must pause, kneel, listen. Sensory hierarchy obeys swamp logic: peat suction, briny air, moon sheen on leaves; POV filters out fauna to foreground “ancient fingers” and condensation. Spatial choreography clean: shard placed, palm to earth, trace of letters, rise at dawn. Tool (shard) charges final image when its worn edge mirrors softened grief. No occupational detail required; world rules stable.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atrium mist, coral fragment, and child’s cast function as micro-setting: the coral’s sharp ridges literally constrain how tightly she can grip it, and the mist blurs sightlines so she must translate touch rather than visuals. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—translator’s ear for whispered ocean, tactile polyps—not tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: bench → condensation tracing → rafters for the hanging cast. Final image of cast-as-flag recharges the object without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse studio, peach-grove skeletons, and fog as second-skin are selective, sense-driven, and filter through Lira’s artist-eye. The fresco fragment functions as micro-setting: its chipped edges and star-hungry hands physically steer her next mural. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies track from crumbling glass to heart-district square without drift. Environment finally constrains the ending: the embarrassed fog thins, proving the orchard can still be lived in, not just elegized.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Garden’s E-flat drone, concave dish, and pigment-crushed “dreams” are filtered through Marisol’s restorer eye; every tactile detail later feeds the reflected-sound payoff. The mural’s micro-geography (crack, corner signature) tracks cleanly across beats and charges the final image. Environment literally bends waves that constrain her method—meets 9+ gate. Minor withholding: we never see sky shift to dusk, only told “first stars,” a hairline gap.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Greenhouse humidity, carnivorous plants, and insect choreography are vividly selective, filtering through Elias’s rogue-scholar awe. The Venus-flytrap collar lean, moth-QR pinned board, and glowing soil final image all charge choices or reconfigure stakes. Minor slip: “late-afternoon light” is the only temporal cue; we never feel the clock that “thoughts become taxable” implies. Still, the orchid corridor spatial track is flawless and the living arrow moment fuses setting with plot pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Bioluminescent shell, kelp postcard, reef-shadowed tides—every sense is filtered through Lira’s poet-perception; tactile salt-slick under her palms constrains the moment she steps outside. Spatial choreography is clean across migrations; no impossible geography. The gargantuan shell functions as both house and pilgrim vessel, its slowly lumbering journey tightening the stakes of dispersing poems—environment directly shapes tactic. Minor over-egging in “captured starlight moss” but overall economy holds; meets 9- gate by charging final image with glowing tree grown from shell floor.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal library’s light-fracture rules are taught early and constrain every move: humidity, resonance, auroral sight-lines dictate Lirael’s toolkit and song pitch. Spatial choreography is flawless—apex chime, bamboo fragments, orchid shelves triangulate without drift. Sensory selection favors resonance over visuals, mirroring internal shift from silence to new chord. Final image of rainbow-casting petals is inseparable from the repaired crack, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Archive is evoked through tactile verbs—shelves “sag,” parchment “brittle,” lamp “flicker”—and the ink well’s rune-etched glass surfaces twice to mark time and emotional drain. Micro-setting doubles as tool: the restricted-section key physically gates the final translation, constraining her night-long push. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible postures. While broader world rules (how runes glow) go unexplained, the detail is incidental, not choice-critical, so credibility stays intact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The volcanic amphitheater is not backdrop but cardiac: its groaning arches mirror Lira’s own suspense, and the final image of “volcanic glass” recharges the dormant/exposed duality. Sensory hierarchy obeys her engineer gaze—temperature, texture, chain weight—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the worn-smooth stage) literally supports her kneeling body and decryptive act. Setting constrains choice: only this stage exposes the adhesive to centuries of pressure needed for the cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The attic is evoked through tools (harness, scroll case, cassette deck) that constrain action—Elias can’t decode without them. Dust under the skylight becomes a living map whose shifting spirals directly enable the final decision. Olfactory and tactile hooks (wood polish, pigeon feathers, sunflower seed) root the scene without checklist overload. The environment is not backdrop; it is the instrument of revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terrace’s glass panels refract living light onto shifting floorboards; corn stalks “bend like compass needles”—setting actively guides step-by-step navigation. Micro-setting (warped railing knot) is handled with causal bite: its spiral pattern literally hides the door trigger. Final image reweights same light into “fractured, lingering silence,” anchoring closure. Weather is poetic filter, not tactical, keeping it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Underwater dome, decaying corridors, and bioluminescent flora are concretely filtered through Mara’s star-mapping gaze. Selective sensory triage—pressure on glass, algae swallowing walls—guides attention rather than cataloguing. Burnt feather’s charred edge catching glow is micro-setting that charges final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The geode, crater glass, and liquid-light pool are not backdrop but instruments: the glass’s regret-cloud alters Lira’s tactics, and the pool’s dissolution physically enacts the closure. Sensory selection stays tide-washed and prismatic, never touristic. Micro-setting (the obsidian pedestal) constrains the crucial seed-glass fusion beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The salt-stung neon, whale balloon, and jammed clown gears are vivid, selective, and filtered through Lira’s tactical gaze; they never stall momentum. Micro-setting succeeds: the bishop’s weight against her collarbone and the fountain’s sudden spectrum physically steer the crowd’s drift. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies track from vendor cart to fountain without teleport. A hairline slip from 9-band: the tidal mechanics (moon drag, brine mist) are atmospheric but never constrain her next bow stroke; they merely garnish.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    The twilight garden is not backdrop but tool: the pulsing moss literally cushions and records her footfalls, constellations above mirror the ones fading on her skin, and the dimming at the end signals the cost she pays. Sensory triangulation (luminous mist under bare feet, moonstone adhering to pores) keeps spatial tracking clean. Object-as-setting qualifies: the moonstone dust is both terrain and catalyst that rewrites her flesh. One minor forced phrase—“obsidian grace” feels authorial rather than POV-filtered, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered through glazier eyes: glass-still water, color fracture, the prism’s rainbow cast onto fog—details that mirror her craft and bias. The misted atrium functions as micro-setting, constraining visibility and enabling the prism’s effect; the stone’s ripple is tactile, immediate. Temperature (cold ankles, warming sun) tracks across beats, anchoring elapsed time. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating objects; environment directly feeds the final image that revalues the mundane.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ridge, frost, moon, and porcelain are rendered through selective sensory economy; gravel crunch and silk fade anchor body and object. The hourglass functions as micro-setting that constrains the final reconfiguration. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous climb. No environment detail is wasted; each filters through Elias’s fire-reading gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment doubles as instrument: bioluminescent algae react to thread color, turning walls into a live feedback console that constrains her next knot. The balloon envelope, gauge, and thread spools are tactile, salt-corroded, re-used; every tool carries prior-flight history. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rope ladder, stalactite anchor, burner flame—so the reader can map body, object, and air current without white-room gaps. Because the algae-bright wall becomes the final image that reweights the premise, the 9+ quick test is met.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage is not backdrop but actant: it parts, whispers, warms the locket—environment that alters tactic and final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; damp stone, salt air, moss that refuses footprints all filter through Lira’s cartographer gaze. Micro-setting (locket map, fireplace ash) constrains her next move. World rules remain consistent; no exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Wet prism parapet, jasmine, and bioluminescent trees are sensuous, selective, and filtered through Lirael’s painter-eye.

Micro-setting (locket, condensation) doubles as emotional barometer—every shimmer answers her song. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace statues and volcanic stone are vivid, selective, and filter through Elara’s ritual mind; weathered faces mirror her internal erosion. Spatial choreography remains clean—clipboard, shadow, sun-arc track logically. Micro-setting qualifies: the clipboard’s scars evolve and constrain her tactile choices. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis; midsummer heat and celestial slowness externalize stalled talks. Environment does not alter tactics beyond mood, so 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere supports theme with earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Salt flat and thunder function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the cracked map dictates the exact depression for the egg, and the impending storm supplies the ticking clock. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the tycoon’s selective eye—he notices iridescence, land value, and the thunder’s “low growl” but not the farmers’ names—keeping detail purposeful. Environment evolves causally: the same cracks that guide him widen by wind and rain, mirroring his moral erosion. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prism sanctuary acts as micro-setting: its refracting glass physically guides her dance path and dictates the color-fragment payoff at the end. Snow courtyard supplies hush and crunch-rhythm that matches heartbeat. Sensory triad (cold, glass-refraction, foot-crunch) stays purposive; no exposition dump. The 9-gate is missed only because the sanctuary’s physical rules (how threads are literally anchored in glass) stay vague.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted radar dome fractures light and literally shapes the staging—its curved wall is the only surface that can receive the holographic puppets, so the setting constrains the final reversal. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Elias notices ink-stained fingers and the faint hum of old signals, never tourist-cataloguing. The dome’s ribs reappear in the last sentence as a mirrored crown, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto’s “spun-sugar mist” and “peach-lavender” dusk are filtered through Lirael’s esentric gaze, constraining her movements—knees sink, fingers numb—so environment participates directly in the ritual. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. The lattice itself becomes micro-setting, its ephemerality charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glacial stone that “remembered sunlight,” rope glowing like breath, and frost-slick braids constrain fingerwork and pace the ritual. The aurora vortex externalizes the memory breach; the mosaic of names beneath the ice reweights the final glow. Micro-setting—the rope’s resistance—directly shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The vine-draped bunker functions as both coffin and cradle: vines muffle sound, leak rain, and ultimately digest the concrete. Selective sensory economy—“faint scent of bergamot and iron” from heated wax—charges the micro-setting. Spatial choreography stays clean; candle, seal, and table maintain coherent positions. The final image of walls softening into soil is the 9+ gate pass, recharging every earlier decay motif.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sandstone arches and bioluminescent chamber are filtered through Elara’s astronomer gaze—star-chart eyes of gods, equations in brick—so every surface is read as schematic. Spatial choreography is exact: corridor → recessed panel → chamber → pedestal; no impossible positions. Light sources (lantern, tile glow, violet sky) track cleanly and affect visibility choices. The tile itself becomes micro-setting: its grid, bite in her palm, and final mirror-surface constrain her final oath, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-tool.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet-muffled cavern is sketched in two swift sentences yet constrains every choice—soundlessness forces gesture, breath, and the pin’s glint to carry meaning. Micro-setting rule: the pedestal and the pin function as portable geography, dictating spatial choreography for each visitor encounter. Sensory economy is flawless—no wasted visual ticks; when light “catches the jagged edge” it’s because that glint must be seen for the metaphor to ignite.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frost-clung skeletal branches, molten glass scent, and brass gears oiled with “midnight and memory” create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the ritual: every mirror must be hung before breath can synchronize. The glass-mountain path materializes as an environmental extension of Elias’s craft, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—workshop circle, stranger’s step onto mirrored path, vanishing point. One missed opportunity: the orchard’s centuries of ruin never press a concrete limitation on the duo’s bodies or tools.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is not backdrop but tool: rafters become ladder, fallen fruit conceals the eye, moss serves as workbench. Cathedral stone and liquid starlight obey consistent fabulist physics. Micro-setting (ribbon, wire, cracked eye) directly constrains the welding action that drives climax. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Lira’s craft priorities; no postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astral orchard is never wallpaper: its whispering blossoms narrow Elara’s auditory focus, the liquid-light waterfall supplies the only “bathroom” for reflection, and the pistachio tree’s carved names physically accept her cameo to complete the inheritance. Micro-setting—the shifting cameo shell—functions as both tool and environment, constraining every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy follows her curator gaze: starlight-fruit shimmer first, then tactile pollen, finally the blue-glow soil. The final image (her name waiting inside the trunk) recharges the earlier spatial map, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)

    Observatory, forecourt, and crystal slab function as micro-setting that constrains choices—she must kneel, measure, listen; the final image of continuing hum charges the closing beat, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist bias: she notices reflections, grooves, vibrations more than temperature or smell. Spatial choreography clean; boots click down spiral staircase, puddles tracked until evaporation. Selective detail avoids tourist catalog; only named anchors are First Observer and archive elders, reused.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Blooming fortress” is no postcard; the fire-lilies, liquid-light fountains, and serpentine corridors actively channel Lira’s movement and furnish the explosive substrate for her craft. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the kerosene-soaked knot and dormant lily chamber constrain tactical choices and literally provide the fuse for the climax. Sensory hierarchy obeys her pyrotechnician bias—smell of sulfur, click of petals—so environment, tool, and body conflate into one combustible instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grotto, body, and cicada function as micro-setting: the rock perch distance shapes the gesture that bridges the argument; starlight on jade charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    The gorge’s stone ribs, humming pebbles, and creeping ink-shadows constrain movement and set acoustic stakes for the harp; micro-setting qualifies. Sensory triad (cold air, keening sound, gold sunrise) is filtered through Lira’s professional attention to ghosts. Spatial choreography is clean: bend → boulder → hand-to-hand exchange. Crocodile tooth’s condensation and later pulse evolve with plot, charging closure. Weather and dust taste return at sunrise, mirroring internal shift. No credible errors; slight over-purple “sky bled gold” is pattern-taught early and repaid, so not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    UV forest is no backdrop—its light flares in reaction to Elias’s skin, forcing tactical breath control; tree-pulse sync literally steadies his heartbeat. Pewter strap functions as micro-setting: cold bite against palm anchors spatial choreography and signals memory intrusion. Final dimming reconfigures the environment from interrogator to reluctant teacher, charging the closing image. Sensory economy tight (only visual/tactile needed), no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    The market is not backdrop but toolkit: silk stalls hum light that Lira must read; the crack *in* the mural is the door she needs; the dust-mote alphabet literally spells her path. Lighthouse lens recurs first as tapestry, then as mural, finally as heartbeat shard—object-as-setting charging closure. Spatial track is flawless: spiral mist stairs → stall counter → mural wall → weaver’s pouch; bodies never ghost. Sensory hierarchy obeys translator priorities: sight > tactile star-cool > rust-ink taste > palm scar match—never checklist. Environment constrains method: only the mural’s painted wave rhythm can sync her breath to unlock shard.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Abandoned circus ticket office is sketched with selective, sensory economy—peeling laminate, cool metal, blue-gray haze—each detail filtered through Elias’s technician gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: counter as step, ceiling crack as portal, dust piles mapped on the floor. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting/object that constrains his investigative method and reappears at closure. Fluorescent buzz death supplies a live clock that tightens the final discovery, passing the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass orchard, prismatic shelves, bottled whisper—every named object is handled or shattered, charging the final image. The frost lattice is not mere décor; its dissolution timing is the tactical trigger that amplifies the whisper. Spatial choreography is immaculate: patrons cling to swaying shelves, books flap like wings, spiral hangs in the air—environment directly constrains next moves. Micro-setting (the spiral etched mid-air) becomes the literal door the next operator must enter.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Baroque asteroid is rendered through selective sensory hooks—cobalt haze, obsidian atrium, bioluminescent fungi—each filtering Kael’s archaeological gaze. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting: handled, re-wrapped, scanned, it literally refracts light onto walls, guiding spatial orientation. Weather-as-time is more concept than constraint until the final beat, keeping environment from actively shaping tactics mid-scene. Still, the shard’s refracted glow on the atrium floor charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every adjustment Elias makes; its copper walls and runic pulses dictate tempo and tool choice. Sensory selection is POV-driven—goggles, brass, syrup of sound—never touristic. Starlight thread and obsidian needle are specific, not Ikea-fantasy props; their qualities change (glow seeping into cracks) so the objects evolve with the action. Spatial choreography is airtight: box on dais, widow at glass, Elias between them—bodies never ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Factory silence, porous limestone, mirror-black lagoon, and compass weight are filtered through Lira’s scent-biased perception, guiding her route and tool use. Petrichor density itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image; the lagoon surface and air sample literally reweight her archive. Spatial choreography is clean across squeeze, slope, ledge, wade, initials. No exposition dump; world rules learned by flashlight and silt.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Storm-archway, damp moss, kelp-haired mermaid—all tactile, never listed; environment is handled (slide pressed to keystone, sculptures dropped) so setting becomes actor, not backdrop. Sensory hierarchy obeys sculptor’s eye: grain of driftwood > distant village. Spatial choreography tight; no impossible moves. Final image of archway still howling re-crystallizes the place as charged object, meeting 9+ gate but micro-slip in “coral-and-timber huts” vagueness keeps it 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amber pavilion, latticed shadows, and melting snow provide tactile, evolving pressure; the cathedral scaffold creaks under bodily weight, integrating body-with-tool as micro-setting. Light itself becomes a manipulable object—violet glow, frosted veins—constraining Mara’s choice to paint darkness rather than bloom. Sensory selection tracks her artist gaze: she notices gradations of frost before safety. Final image of “autumn leaves fell once more” recharges the opening motif with new conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian lagoon and zeppelin library are not postcard backdrops: the lagoon’s mirror surface forces Mara’s self-confrontation and later parts to reveal stairs; the zeppelin’s creaking gondola supplies the rope ladder that clocks exit. Sensory triage favors heat-scent-decay under crisis. Micro-setting (diary) doubles as tool and mirror, constraining decryption choices. Final image of blank pages recharges black-water motif.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Micro-setting of the amber bottle functions as the core environment; its seamless surface constrains every attempt to open it and is re-weighted at closure as lens, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s apothecary bias: scent of brine and herbs, phosphorus echoes, lantern flicker felt on gaunt face. Geography stays stable; no impossible props or spatial drift. Weather (salt spray, dusk hues) affects emotional register but never solves plot, keeping atmosphere subservient to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop orchard is tactile: breath-fed roses, gnarled apple bark, phonograph horn pressed to trunk. Micro-setting succeeds—the wax shaving and phonograph cradle act as portable terrain that constrains the final replay. Skyscraper context is signaled early and stays consistent, anchoring time and altitude. Weather (bruise-purple twilight) mirrors mood without overt symbolism; spatial choreography remains clean as Voss moves from kneeling to standing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Desert and derelict hives are sketched with heat-baked specificity (“cracked earth baking under a sun that had forgotten mercy”) and supply a felt scarcity that justifies Elias’s reticence. The hut’s defiant roof and the ever-present dust act as micro-setting, constraining his daily ritual. Only the glass box attains object-as-setting status; the wasteland itself never actively narrows his tactical choices—hence no 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The silo’s corrugated moss, metallic tang, and sloshing mercury are sensually selective and guide choice—Elias kneels only where dust reveals the hatch. Environment constrains the final image: the mercury sphere forms inside this exact container, making the silo itself the crucible. micro-setting qualifies (the urn shard as “bridge”) and charges closure. Minor over-reliance on visual; other senses appear but never dominate a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cobalt lagoon, storm debris, drake feather, and kelp lattice form a micro-setting that literally steers her weaving choices: she uses what the storm delivers. The feather’s iridescence and the warming water track time and body, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—rock, shoreline, opposite shore—all tracked. Weather shift (cool → warm → amber dusk) is causal, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The living stone pillars and copper-veined oak function simultaneously as environment, tool, and micro-setting; their fused pulse physically constrains the final choice. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: Lira notices warmth, reddish gleam, leaf shudder—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the orchard’s heart, the nearest pillar, and the gourd track cleanly. The setting charges the closure image; remove the living stone and the bridge premise collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sculpture path and tower are vividly textured—glass arms, moth-wing wolf, oxidized-copper skin—each image filtered through Lirael’s analytical gaze. Rain, ivy, and bronze-quiet soundscape constrain pace and hearing, tightening perceptual scope. The fly amber micro-setting meets the 9+ gate: its dissolution directly charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean except the instant hop from kneeling statue to tower door; a single sentence of transitional distance would lock 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Jetty, damp sand, salt-air, glowing petals—details filter through soldier-gardener’s gaze and constrain tactics (where he can plant, how he fertilizes). Micro-setting object: seed pods recur and charge final image. Weather (storm) foreshadows threat but doesn’t tighten options on-page; hence just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Scrap-yard textures are vivid and selective—“rusted carcass of a harvester,” “salvaged glass,” “mouse’s nest”—and the autumn-leaf micro-setting finally constrains choice by becoming the symbolic center. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies gather, circle, cheer without drift. World rules remain consistent; no exposition dump. The environment is mostly backdrop, but the leaf’s final charge on the settlement’s ritual life lifts the score above mere atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frosted glass warping constellations, meteorite-ink quill, and vibrating gold filaments concretize the dilation field; the compass rose micro-setting constrains the final choice—its heat tells him when to move.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Icebound spire, moss carpet, bioluminescent fungi, and the brass sundial lid are vivid, sensory, and filtered through Kael’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is flawless across the narrow ledge, window slit, and chessboard. The setting constrains the final image: the spire’s harmony hums after the swap, charging the closure. One minus: the cloud-city Aetheria is named but never seen or felt, keeping environment from full 8+ leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Whispering gallery is not postcard backdrop; its acoustics literally push back, forcing her footfalls to spell words. Micro-setting succeeds: the chessboard’s missing pawns constrain her theory and final self-definition. One hairline slip: “domed ceiling” and “marble pedestal” verge décor catalogue, but the echo mechanic rescues specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bookstore-mountain and mercury-body double as setting and tool, constraining movement and reflecting choices; lantern shadows “sharp as knives” echo later stone-knife shards. Sensory triage narrows under pressure: during the cavern collapse only falling rocks and bioluminescence exist. Selective detail—obsidian dust, cedar box scent—anchors transitions without cataloguing. Spatial logic survives the dimensional flip; feather dissolves, stone embeds, body keeps reflective surface.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Platinum labyrinth lines constrain every footstep; their gradual dissolution into light charges the final image. The time-frozen bodies function as micro-setting, narrowing perception to Alaric’s heartbeat and the cued tapestry.

    Projection-booth geography—‘single window rattled,’ ‘scarred wooden table’—guides her access and object handling; the booth itself is the micro-setting that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: dust smell > flickering bulb > lilac scent, each filtering her spatial imagination. Weather shifts from rain to charged stillness, mirroring internal cadence without overt symbolism. Detail is selective; no fat, and the theater’s 1947 layer is economically sketched through film stock rather than exposition.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.1</question><comment>Dominant stake—locate and release unused love—signaled in para 1 and tightens when she palms the strip, forcing custodianship. The film vision deepens knowledge rather than narrows live options; escalation is textural, not causal, but the final image of lilac-scented custody creates undeniable cost. Agency is primarily attentional (she pockets the strip), yet it forecloses walking away. No external antagonist, but internal pressure accumulates cleanly; meets length-appropriate demand for one meaningful intensification.

    The aurora-lit archway is not postcard scenery; its shifting stones and ozone air actively yield the hidden chamber, making the setting a participant. The sextant’s brass gears and mother-of-pearl inlays are returned to at the close, recharging the final smile. Spatial choreography is flawless: Kael leans, adjusts dials, lifts a jar, kneels—every motion tracked. Sensory selection stays urgent: ozone, frost-prickle, dust motes, all filtered through a stargazer’s bias.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glowing dune, crystalline towers, and bioluminescent sand are tactile, sensory, and immediately constrain movement (sinking boots, pulsing ground). The chess clock’s etched “language of waves and particles” is a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it restarts. Selective detail—“smell of burnt honey and static”—filters through Kael’s guard-trained attention. Spatial choreography is clean; the woman leaves no footprints, a subtle status cue that never needs explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory triage—ironwoods’ minor keys, copperwillows’ tuning-fork trill—gives the biomechanical forest an audible body that doubles as brain-synapse map. The pocketed gear’s worn teeth and the moss-softened ground underfoot supply tactile micro-setting that charges the final image. Environment literally rotates around her, constraining stance and supplying the closing reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ridgeway’s shimmery disorientation is anchored in salt-iron scent, gravel crunch, and dock stone—details filtered through ferry-guide habit. Micro-setting works: the ticket punch’s worn star and the mossy stone where it’s finally placed constrain the choice to keep serving. Spatial choreography stays clean across the walk-and-return. One slip: “sky dipped low enough to touch” drifts toward generic wonder rather than sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt walls, mercury glimmer, frostbite air: sensory triad is tight and selective, filtering through Elric’s hushed attention. The bolt as micro-setting recurs until it literally steadies the bench and the story’s moral axis—meets 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across corridor, staircase, music room; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Library air “hummed with forgotten prayers,” drift-rune glows, trapdoor mosaic star-recess all constrain tactics; the body-as-setting micro-option is weak but the ink pellet as handled tool charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The station, atlas page, and bioluminescent reef function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only one atlas page exists, only the deck offers sight of the glowing coordinates. Sensory hierarchy is biologist-tight—corals “bleeding white,” “cool metal wall,” plankton “spelling out coordinates.” Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The final reef image earns a 9+ boost by charging the closure, but the earlier station description lapses into postcard tourism (“solar panels glistening”) without anchoring a choice, holding the score just under 8.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Spaceport bay is tactile—rusted cranes, ozone wind, half-buried drones—yet selective, never catalogue. The ancient stones function as micro-setting: their vibration against Lira’s palm constrains timing and charges the final flare. Light shifts from “liquid gold” to “jagged shadows,” mirroring escalation. One minor slip: “concrete and soil alike” hints at off-stage terrain we never see, but the bay itself remains coherent and choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Volcanic mud, sulfurous steam, and rusted hatch metal are filtered through an ex-guerrilla’s practiced eye—every texture is also a memory trigger. The blackberry thorns scratching her knuckles while she frees the kite is a micro-setting detail that later mirrors the hatch’s sharp edge, so environment literally constrains her body. Only the drone patrol window is stated, not shown as a sensory threat (sound of rotors, searchlight glare), so the spatial tension never peaks. Still, the hot-spring bowl becomes the story’s crucible, charging the final image with geothermal literalness.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sea-arboretum is vivid and selective: salt-bleached roses, wind-twisted pines, moss-cracked walls all filter through Lila’s painterly eye. Micro-setting succeeds—the stone bench’s cold grit anchors the freeze beat and returns charged in the final tuck. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Weather is invoked but never actively complicates, keeping the setting one notch below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library-as-lighthouse hybrid is vivid and selective: humidity-warped spines, stolen lens gap, salt-rotted wood—each detail filters through Elias’s painterly eye and constrains later action (no lens → interior gaze). Micro-setting objects—tarot box turned palette, thread snagged in box crack—function as tactile terrain that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clean: ascending spiral staircase, spreading threads at the top, candle casting elongate shadows. Weather (salt air) is integrated into ink glow, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Wind-carved tents, bleached bone skin, ozone scent—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lira’s tracker gaze. The drone’s metallic glint against earth tones efficiently signals tech/organic clash. Micro-setting works: the spilled ink on sand becomes the pivotal map, constraining her next move. Spatial choreography is clear; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “echoing library under snow” is more than postcard: the frost that blooms under Lirael’s palm, the whirring gears in frozen air, and the glass fog that times Kael’s revival all tether choice to environment. The cryo-chamber itself functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid, constraining the sole decisive action—its control panel slot is the only path to revolt—so the final image is charged by this object-state change.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass dome, crimson cacti, and glittering sand are tactile, selective, and filtered through Lira’s attention; heat and thorns guide her micro-movements. The ballast scrap’s frayed canvas and uneven engraving serve as micro-setting that constrains the final planting action. Sensory layering is economical and purposeful, never touristic; the dome’s refracted sunset charges the closing image with conceptual heat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden is rendered through Kael’s tool-mediated perception—crystal trees, humming moss, rail spike as conductor—so setting actively shapes tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys his fisher-professional bias for vibration and light. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The final image (soil shimmering around the spike) recharges earlier motifs, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory’s grinding gears, rosewood desk constellations, and coffee-stained margin act as micro-setting that constrain search methods and timeline. Cloud-top locale legitimates isolation yet never blocks credible logistics. Spatial choreography holds as Clara crosses from telescope to library to desk. Weather (pink dawn) mirrors thematic inversion but avoids overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Laboratory of lost sounds” is sketched by ozone tang and humming walls; the amber micro-setting constrains her needle pause and later powers the scanner. Selective sensory triage—ozone, honeyed glow, fractal wings—mirrors narrowing perception under pressure. Spatial track stays clean: desk → display case → scanner, bodies anchored. Setting is not broad but elementally tight, and the amber’s material logic charges the final image, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grotto as micro-setting constrains every move: acoustics dictate whispers, tile depressions guide the slotting, sand surface enables the mandala key. Mist, glow, and resonant hum evolve with beats; spatial choreography is clean—Mara kneels, stands, presses, draws. Environment mirrors internal shift from claustrophobic mist to breathable silence. No setting artifact touches closure; tile flake functions as charged object.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shattered sky and soot-sweet air are filtered through Elias’s burnt-mouth perception; the single chipped tessera becomes the micro-setting that constrains his only possible act, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and character-biased, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean in the plaza kneel-place-stand-kneel sequence; the environment quietly mirrors internal cooling without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hedge-maze-as-clock, orchard-as-theatre, coin-as-lens—each object is kinesthetically handled and reconfigures space. The garden’s synesthetic palette (“scent of violets and forgotten melodies”) is filtered through Elias’s performer sensorium, never tourist-catalog. The final blank coin charges the image, making the setting a mutable stage rig. Spatial choreography stays clean across the phantom crowd’s convergence; only the maze’s vanishing line lacks tactile staging.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Micro-setting succeeds: muscovite sliver functions as tactile compass and crystalline template, constraining every mapping move; neon-blue rigs supply shifting praxis. Ozone/acrylic smell threads through beats, grounding time elapsed since shock. Spatial choreography clean—Mara’s boots click distance before her shoulder-touch signals alliance shift. Final image of glowing lines on paper compresses studio into charged canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coastal cave is vivid—damp sand, salt gust, bioluminescent vial—yet the heat-mapper and pendant-sized tech remain concept sketches rather than tactile constraints. The cave’s tidal breath guides her path upward, so environment charges the exit image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory layering keeps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory layering—amber light pulsing inside clouded glass, sawdust swallowing footfalls—anchors POV bias. The warehouse and jar function as micro-setting that charges the final image; cliffs outside re-echo the jar’s content. Spatial choreography is stable; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Zephyr Bluff’s mist, iron railing, and gravel patch are tactile and filter through spy-trained attention; the pillbox and quill serve as micro-setting that charge the final image. Weather (spring tilt, meltwater) is repeatedly invoked but does not physically constrain choice or tighten stakes—decorative rather than tactical—so falls short of 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Fog and river function as micro-setting that constrains sound, visibility, and pacing; ferry hull creaks and gutters’ ticking are tactile cues that charge the final image. Spatial choreography across dock → boat → dock is clean. Tool (yarn needle) is handled but never alters physical choice; environment pressures ambiance, not tactics. Vivid specificity anchors mood; lacks causal bite for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Beekeeping graveyard, black-to-gray sand gradient, and the lantern’s chipped rim are tactile, choice-guiding micro-settings; the sunflowers’ impossible survival literally anchors the timeline fracture. Spatial choreography stays clean across Mara’s kneel-place-pack-walk sequence. Environment constrains the climax: only here can the glass glow, so departure = foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    The luminous harbor, salt-diesel air, and moon-silvered water are filtered through Elias’s gardener-eye—he notices bloom, shadow, crevice. The dock planks and the gauge-as-tiny-stars function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: only wood can answer the metallic tap, only the gauge can serve as gift and rhythm-keeper. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The setting subtly steers the final gesture—Mara’s shop window faces the same moonlit harbor, so opening it collapses the distance between their two fire-escape worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal library’s coral walls and moon-breath shelves constrain movement—floors shift, shelves sway—making navigation a live tactical issue. The brass sundial acts as micro-setting: its flickering extinct ghosts directly pressure Lirael’s identity choice. Sensory selection mirrors interiority—“ink shimmered like liquid starlight” matches her flickering selfhood. Final image of coral walls framing her solitary reflection recharges setting with earned independence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lotus temple and pond constrain movement (edge, mossy stone, floating orbs) and supply the glass-orb mechanic that enables the final reconfiguration. Selective sensory triad—marble curves, chestnut thrush feather, liquid-light ripple—anchors without tourism catalog; the twig spiral micro-setting recharges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Radio-basement maze of cables and vintage rigs is handled, not catalogued; the transmitter’s whine and oscilloscope green constrain her timing and signal choice. Campus quad arguments remain off-stage rumor, so the wider world stays slightly generic, but the station itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cathedral is rendered through cold stone, fractured starlight, groaning pipes—selective sensory triage aligned to POV panic. The compass point serves as micro-setting that constrains the final stab; starlight shifts from prison bars to path, mirroring interior flip. No world-rule inconsistency; spatial physics rubberizes only after organ cue, signalling rule change. Setting actively guides choice (wall stab) and charges final gateway image, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Quarry is rendered through Clara’s haptic bias—“granite ghosts,” “damp stone scent older than the year”—turning landscape into an extension of her synesthetic canvas. The ribbon fragment functions as micro-setting that literally threads through sketch, pit edge, and final frame, constraining each mark she makes. Spatial choreography is flawless: lantern placement, kneel-to-trace motion, glint-location in dirt all track. Weather (mist lifting) mirrors internal shift but stays causal—visibility improves only after they finish their joint drawing, underscoring earned clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Brass dials, frosted glass, spongey gray sky—selective sensory triad anchors every move. The weather-station roof with its “anxious instruments” functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: she must act before evacuation removes her. Salt-ozone taste and sickly-green sky evolve with plot stakes, mirroring internal dread without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: dig site east tower → desk → roof, no impossible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory triage is excellent: pine resin + engine oil immediately tilts attention; the scuffed case and jagged glass edges are tactile anchors. Micro-setting (van glovebox, guardrail vantage) constrains the discovery act. The 9+ gate met: the mountain pullout’s fogline and scaffold-wrap voids materially enable the fold; environment is the portal mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Overgrown lot, rusting carriages, ivy-swallowed metal give tactile decay; circus poster and dusk light act as charged micro-settings that mirror Elias’s suspended identity. Spatial tracking stays clean as he moves through carriages. The train’s atmosphere constrains his reflection and ultimately hosts the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Economic sensory selection keeps momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frosted dome, brass sextant, and variable-star prism are tactile, bias-filtered, and directly constrain action; the prism doubles as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent and narrow; no orientation debt. The silver-moth observatory satisfies the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orchard-vortex is rendered through motion—twisting dancers, clawing branches, ozone stink—filtered by Mira’s druidic perception. The seed’s micro-setting (pulse, hunger, final dimming) constrains her tactic of release and later serves as the charged talisman she pockets, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glade’s cobalt light and ozone-elderberry taste create tactile bias; the clipping functions as micro-setting, pressed to palm and heart, constraining the final merge. Spatial choreography stays clean across hedge shifts. Two-moon final image charges the reconfigured covenant. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object (clipping) alters final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The catacomb orchard is not backdrop: its root-snake/bone interface literally supplies the needle and thread, and the black fruit’s warmth is the final constraint that alters her worldview. Spatial choreography is clean—torch radius, root coils, clearing distance all track. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lirael’s reckless curiosity (she notices bioluminescence before danger). The environment charges the closure image: the half-light persists into the sunset sky, making the orchard’s rule-set portable.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.7)
    Quarry trailer is textured through mildew, concert posters as insulation, flicker of desklamp on frayed threads; the micro-setting of the cloth itself—its gold-crimson grid—constrains the recognition beat and thus the final image. Spatial choreography clean across the two on-page bodies. Weather (rain knock) works as pressure cue.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic arbor is never scenic backdrop; its ion storms, lodestone buds, and amber glow directly enable or resist every action. The seed-slot hollow, glassy pathways, and shifting roots act as micro-setting tools that constrain Elara’s experimental ritual. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices field gradients before colour—and the final image of a sapling swaying in a scent-less breeze recharges the whole apparatus. One minor spatial vagueness in “glassy pathways” (footing impact?) holds it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brackish pools, glass dome, and bamboo creel function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the creel must be submerged to activate. Sensory selection favors shimmer/boil/glow—purposefully narrow, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: librarian lifts creel, woman steps, plunge, emergence, feather retrieved. Weather is off-stage but implied by shifting dome tint, mirroring internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Crystal caves act as micro-setting that literally guides the climax—spiral geometry forces the pearl placement; quartz veins supply both light and conduit for global release. Sensory triage (sound, warmth, pressure) is filtered through Elias’s subterranean profession; the crown image constrains the final stance and reweights “latent radiance” from metaphor to world event.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station’s ivy arches, sluggish tributary, and broken windows are filtered through Mara’s river-chronicler gaze; every sensory pick is purposeful, e.g., the urinal’s jagged letters narrow her perception to guilt’s physical texture. The concrete platform and drain-pipe constrain her movement and supply the chalk trail that leads to the accordion’s final chord, so the environment charges the closing image. Micro-setting success: the taped bellows function as portable crucible, altering her tempo and emotional access.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Glowing mist, shifting shelves, and amber ripples are sensuously filtered through Lira’s hunter gaze; the library itself becomes an active antagonist that guides her finger to the correct book. Spatial choreography stays clean across aisle moves; no floating white-room moments. The watch-as-micro-setting constrains pacing choices, and the final flare of light irradiates the blank page, recharging the motif. Could edge higher if the environment had exacted a physical toll (fatigue, burn) visible in the exit beat.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, and the ice-crystal violin form a micro-setting triad that literally melts under her touch, constraining her final decision (she cannot play the violin without destroying it); the garden window view supplies the visual counter-future she chooses, grounding renunciation in a concrete, sensual image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Skyborne grotto, liquid-starlight pool, obsidian runes, and aurora are rendered through Lirael’s tool-trained gaze—she notices lattice integrity, moss bloom, frequency harmonies—so setting actively constrains technique. Micro-setting (emerald chip) becomes the crucible: its lattice limits how much echo it can bear, thus deciding her embellishment gamble. Spatial choreography is flawless—every kneel, lift, paint stroke tracks against the cracking pool. Final image reweights the place: “stillness was never truly still” turns setting into a waiting canvas, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Umbral grotto above clouds is atmospherically distinct—“clouds pooled like liquid silver” is a visual anchor reused with variation. Elderwood tree operates as micro-setting that literally supports the choice perch; bark texture guides climb pacing. Spatial choreography is clean: climb-descend distance tracked, herbs basket placed, no impossible positions. Setting does not yet constrain tactics to 9+ level—tree could be any tree, grotto any mist—but it suffuses tone and filters perception consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse interior is filtered through touch and smell, not postcard list; the cloak’s weight and the cedar/oak/maple chimes constrain every tactical beat. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the cloak itself becomes the environment that alters perception. Weather (wind) is not backdrop but the final speaking partner. One minor slip—“salt-stained stone cool against his palms” is stock—but it occurs outside the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The magnetic grotto’s hum, the floating platform’s vibration, and the bioluminescent moss are not backdrop but tactical instruments that constrain how trance is entered and how time folds. The obsidian stone’s pulse is handled in three beats, its final sink re-configuring meaning. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the kinetic pull of magnetism and the tactile moss keep it from white-room syndrome. Environment directly shapes the culminating spiral image—qualifies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Canyon of bone towers is vivid, selective, and biases toward Kael’s hush-mode perception; echo, dust, and moonlight are woven through action. The arrowhead functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean. No world inconsistency, but environment never actively endangers or resource-loads—description more than pressure—so stays below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Icebound spire, vapor gate, and inner greenhouse are economically etched; temperature and light gradients guide emotional tempo. The garden fountain micro-setting acts as object-in-setting, forcing memory recall that tilts the final sketch decision—meets 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail (gloved hand, fogged breath) keeps momentum; no tourist catalog. Spatial track stays clean during vapor levitation and staircase spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pier’s “salt-bitten wind” and warped book “smiles” are filtered through Elias’s lamplighter eye; the submerged library’s dome and oil-shimmer leather create tactile, POV-driven specificity. Meteor hush and lantern-streaked sky serve double duty—external mood and synesthetic setup for the color-of-sound payoff. Spatial choreography is clean: dock planks→cleat→water→door 13→desk; no impossible positions. The setting actively constrains the final image: only inside the air-locked library can the vow hues materialize, charging the closing symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystalline amber deck, worn coins, and white-hot sensor lenses constrain every move; the coin’s crescent-and-tower icon literally rewrites the hologram战术. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual warmth, tactile smooth edges, console vibration) filters through Kael’s goal-directed manipulation. Spatial choreography is immaculate—coins circle, levitate, spark; body and tool states evolve causally. Environment could charge the final image even more if contraction’s external void visibly pressed against the dome, but interior micro-setting still fulfills the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The observatory’s dusk light, rust smell, and cracked marble ground every action; the prism’s cold weight and the page’s new heft constrain Elias’s final choice. Micro-setting—the atlas page itself—becomes the closure vessel, satisfying the 9+ gate. One missed opportunity: the wax cylinders are heard, not handled, so their physicality never alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sapphire viaduct is not postcard scenery; its glass curve dictates Elias’s scaffold angle and drip mathematics, re-appears as the surface that bakes and finally cuts him. Micro-setting (oxidized bell, green copper grit under fingernails) rivals the vista for pressure. Early entrance, mid-circuit constraint, and final charged image satisfy the 9+ gate; description never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Midnight ridgeway, twilight violet, and the reservoir’s skin create a selective sensory palette; gravel crunch and mossy glass keep touch alive. The sapphire label returns as micro-setting that literally directs Mara’s path; its glassy surface refracts both color and meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean—gate, slope, churchyard, waterline—all tracked without drift. Environment subtly mirrors internal state: receding water = surfacing memory. Meets 9+ gate: label charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard–waterfall environment is filtered through alchemical priorities: color-shifting cascade as liquid stained glass, moss boundary as ritual threshold. The crystal functions as micro-setting; its warming surface tracks the beat-to-beat shift. Starling flock spatial choreography is tracked cleanly against her body and workbench. Selective sensory economy keeps visual dominance while flame adds thermal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bioluminescent veins, holographic fractals, and cloud-sea silver are selective, sensory, and filtered through Kael’s professional gaze. The buckle doubles as micro-setting, constraining every node interaction; spatial choreography stays clean as he kneels, presses, moves deeper. Environment directly shapes tactics—wrong symmetry demands tactile revision—charging the final steady glow. One minor over-adjective moment (“liquid silver”) but image still propels.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Floating rock, sky-vortex, brain-jar deliver vivid, selective imagery; jar-light reappears as closure beacon; spatial choreography stays coherent; could reach 9-band if terrain cracks had constrained footwork or final path, but environment mostly backdrop not tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Nocturnal brook haven is more than postcard: its mud receives the plant, its water guides the slime trail, its reeds conceal the key—environment directly enables climax. Sensory triad (mist, murmur, ink-black water) is filtered through Elias’s puzzle-designer eye, selective not catalogic. Micro-setting (workbench spectrometer, fireplace ash) constrains tactics. Final image of “crucible where possibility took root” marries place to theme, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Condensation-slick walls, flickering bulb, and grooved laughter-etchings anchor tunnel as sensory body; spatial choreography steady—no impossible moves. Leaf blower acts as micro-setting: weight, vibration, and cracked handle constrain tactics and climax. Sound ecology (hum, roar, off-key wind) dominates over visual, fitting POV of sound-conductor. Final image of “thousand tiny voices” recharges same tunnel air, so environment directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Frozen topiary, ice-crusted soil, and blue flame lantern are tactile and POV-filtered; the moss path’s glow directly enables the final step, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Mist operates as both veil and clock, narrowing perception under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props or geography shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ember nexus’s “crimson glow seeping through cracks” and “reversed storm” of ash are selective, pressure-responsive visuals; the crozier itself operates as micro-setting that constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy tracks Kael’s exhaustion: smell of scorched skin, stone-numbed knees. Final image (“frozen in twilight’s embrace”) recharges prior “twilight” cue, meeting the 9+ gate by charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Radio-tower-as-skeletal-hand is instant, urgent, and perpetually constraining every move Kael makes; the gorge’s mist and lunar shadow act as physical antagonists. The shard’s micro-setting function—projecting latent city infrastructure—directly shapes tactics and charges the ending image. Selective sensory economy (ozone, rust, static hum) keeps description weaponized rather than decorative. Environment, tool, and body jointly force the final ascent and visual resurrection, cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Spectral grotto is more than backdrop—its bioluminescent veins mirror the hourglass shape, guiding Kael’s pattern choice. Micro-setting counts: the empty hourglass and radio function as portable, manipulable terrain. Sensory hierarchy stays tight under crisis—starlight as liquid, hull echo as hollow—reflecting Kael’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography is clean across the sideways lurch; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selective, purposeful sensory triage: cold glimmer, softened spires, pressure-numbed fingers, metallic bite of rust—each filtered through pedagogy rather than tourist gaze. “Black water” and “energy crystals” world-build without exposition dump; micro-setting (chain link) is handled and repurposed, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent in the exterior cluster scene. Occasional softeners—“silhouettes,” “softened edges”—slip toward cliché but are sparse enough to preserve clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mist, marble, and algae-edged photograph are vivid, selective, and filtered through Lila’s tracer gaze. The atrium’s west-wing labyrinth guides physical discovery; the hearing aids act as micro-setting that constrains the final synchronization. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: damp moss scent narrows to pulse vibration. Final image of parting mist recharges the twilight dome without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Facility, staircase, chamber, pedestal—each tactile detail is filtered through Lira’s breath and lamp-beam, guiding her micro-moves. The rust-salt palate twins external decay with internal panic, charging the final hologram. Spatial choreography never slips; environment forces her crouch and hurry.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Frost-laced glass, wheezing gears, and ink-filled grooves give tactile, multi-sensory anchors; the porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that literally scores the control panel and final image. Snow and dome rotation constrain exit options, tightening the last moment. One minus: exact spatial relation between Elias and OBS-7’s speakers is never fixed, keeping this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Canyon, bone towers, and diamond all constrain tactical choices (ledge slip, echo distortion, stylus tracing). Final image of “lingering song” is charged by the vertigo-height and resonant architecture. Micro-setting (vein on her palm) doubles as tool and map—exactly the economy this length rewards.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Underground garden is tactile—moss-caked roots, mushroom stool, copper-wired phone—and constrains action: proximity to soil enables the metamorphosis. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; sharper petrichor/metallic air could tighten POV bias. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation debt. The arrowhead as micro-setting charges final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass sky-bridge, metallic peaches, crystalline cores—each detail is filtered through Lira’s tactile use (shell pressed to stone, sap smelling of memory). The locust shell acts as micro-setting that constrains her final tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: bridge tremor, geyser under roots, statues lock in place. Only the orchard’s eastern wall remains a floating landmark, preventing the last 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    ‘Cobalt arcade’ and ‘twilight’s bruise’ are immediate, sensory, and POV-tilted; the same neon cadence returns to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Shattered glass / barbed wire function as micro-setting that guides Elias’s path and bottle hand-off. Weather is more backdrop than constraint, but the arcade machines waking under storm-light supply the needed environmental feedback loop. Place nomenclature stays spare—no excess geography—so atmosphere breathes without stall.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory triage favors hush and glints—rust flakes, cool shard edges, sun-warmed metal—each filtered through Elio’s carpenter reflex. The carousel skeleton and ivy-curtained door are sketched with spatial economy; bodies track cleanly from train interior to courtyard circle. Micro-setting succeeds: the halo fragment’s crescent curve literally orients Elio to the fountain’s ripple pattern that “only he could read.” No occupational error or anachronism; weather is static mist, but it serves tone rather than choice, so just below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Scientific poetry library under Edison bulbs is sketched with selective sensory hits—lavender-ink scarf, rustling pages—rather than tourist catalog. Micro-setting (scarf as handled object) constrains the ritual beat and reappears at closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible moves. For 9+ gate, the scarf needed to charge the final image; it does so by being visibly knotted, but the library itself never pressures tactics, capping at high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting of the lighthouse sill and the palette-as-object constrain every brush decision; the archipelago’s whispering stones supply audible pressure that mirrors internal stakes. Sensory selection stays urgent—salt taste, bruised sky, liquid gold pools—filtered through Elara’s photographer-eye. No static cataloguing; each detail is handled or refracted through action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The damp moss, sinking boots, and vibrating air tether us bodily; the micro-setting of the locket-seam is repeatedly handled, charging the final dissipation. Starlight pooling inside the lock is an image that constrains the unlocking act itself. Spatial track stays coherent through the tilt. While the alley-to-void shift is abrupt, the absence contradiction is waived because the disorientation serves the closure reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sunken greenhouse, salt-crusted glass, kelp-masted wrecks—details are sensuous, selective, and filtered through a folklorist’s taxonomic eye. The fairy ring functions as micro-setting: it is handled, pried, mapped, and finally re-framed as celestial mirror, so it constrains the climax. Spatial choreography stays clean; ladder, sextant, locket, boots are tracked. Weather/tide remain background but are referenced enough to keep environmental pressure alive.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Library, ivy, cracked roof, dust, and the playground swing creak all filter through Lirael’s hush-tuned senses; every sensory pick is selective and mood-governing. The “shard of amber sunlight trapped between two panes” acts as micro-setting that later re-weights the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as Lirael retreats backwards and pours tea; no floating bodies. The world rules hold throughout—no sudden magical physics—so atmosphere serves the situational pressure without breaking credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Verdant parapet, mossy stones, and churning pool are filtered through Elara’s practiced eye; the waterfall threshold doubles as literal height and magical interface, guiding the final toss. Micro-setting of calloused hands, meteorite knife, and etched seed constrains the ritual steps. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog, keeping momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prism sanctuary is not postcard ornament: glass walls refract decision-light, cold floor forces Mara’s knees, attic box delivers the needle—environment keeps handing tools that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (frayed salt-caked knots) and sight (shifting star-colors), both filtered through restorer’s tactile bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: kneel → sit → stand → exit; no impossible body leaps. One micro-gap: “shadow stretching across the net” implies candle or star source, but light logic never contradicts action. Setting charges final image—the brightened hum is the prism itself re-tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    The rain-scoured vault frescos, brass sextant, and moss-buried stones are returned three times with shifting valence; the projector lens fog and cracked stone halos directly constrain Elias’s next micro-choice. Micro-setting doubles as body-tool interface—his ear to the vibrating stone—charging the final image. Weather and tool specificity never stall momentum; every descriptor either narrows options or reweights the silence motif. Irreplaceable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Salt-crusted aviation manual, rusted spools, and 440 Hz fork create tactile micro-setting that constrains discovery; the flooded library functions more as atmospheric mausoleum than active obstacle. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; pressure narrows attention selectively but never uses, say, taste of rust or pressure pop in ears to embody risk. Sufficient specificity to serve concept, yet environment never endangers or limits Elara’s next move, keeping it below high-band charge.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mist-cobbled aerie is sketched through Elias’s knees on stone, charcoal hiss, rain metallic on the bolt-plate—tactile, selective, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: plate, wall, cloak, storm track believably. The courtyard’s altitude and weather actively constrain (charcoal run, storm timing) and charge the final image: a bluebell pressed into now-warm metal. No world-rule inconsistency; “above clouds” is accepted as given.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire is evoked through tactile detail—frosted glass, grinding gears, pale gold scattered light—rather than postcard vistas. The goggles function as micro-setting: their cracked lenses refract hidden ice-veins, literally changing what Mara can see and therefore choose. Spatial choreography is clean; diary, goggles, and widow are tracked without continuity drift. Environment never pressures her body (cold, breath, hazard) on-page, so the setting informs but does not constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The brass telescope is handled every few beats—cold barrel, patina like old coins, final raised beacon—its tactile states tracking emotional intensification. Lantern light, wicker sway, and cloud hues are filtered through Lila’s meteorologist gaze, never tourist catalog. The vanished tower horizon at climax reconfigures spatial stakes, charging the “empty” sky with remembered weight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Oak grain, parchment smell, and tool-handling are filtered through a painter’s tactile bias; even the wrecking-ball rumble is felt as dust on canvas. Spatial choreography is flawless—no floating bodies or impossible shelf geometry. The tree-as-setting is not mere backdrop: its hollow dictates where art can be painted and where secrets can be hidden, hence directly shapes tactics. Final image of “light seeming to pulse from within the wood” recharges every prior sensory seed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Airship copper, creaking hull, and shifting starling murmurations are woven through action rather than blocks of description. The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting that literally steers plot—its worn numbers constrain her finger movements and later the ship’s course. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-true: Lira notices latitude-specific constellations, ignores rigging jargon she doesn’t know. Final orb-tunnel image reuses celestial motif, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ice-bound shelves, frost-rimed mirrors, and the crescent lock provide tactile, POV-filtered specificity; the “hauntingly bright” aura is shown through glare on cracked glass and the singing mirror edge, integrating sensory detail with action. Setting never blocks or enables a choice in a way that alters tactics, so it misses the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The copper bell’s patina, the pearl-fruited trees, and the floating rock arches are tactile, weight-bearing, and mirrored in the final image where the bell becomes the arch’s keystone. Sensory hierarchy is biased toward Elara’s gentle auric perception—shimmers, chimes, dew—which keeps description filtered and purposeful. Spatial choreography across the orchard and beneath the arch is tracked without drift; weather (twilight) is used to time the nebula’s payoff. The setting actively constrains the repair tactics (ropes, pulleys, chanting) and recharges at closure when the nebula bathes the mended arch—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rusted railing’s salt-film stains her gloves, the spiral stairs count her measured steps, the pane’s fractal depth swallows sound—environmental details constrain every move. Lighthouse shudder, fog vortex, and the pane’s inner kaleidoscope evolve causally with her song, charging the final snow of porcelain. Micro-setting (the cracked puppet head) literally becomes the map that rewires the tower’s mechanism. 9+ gate met: the pane’s nested glass is the tool whose breakage reshapes the world’s tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Frost, gravel, brass gears, and the cracked nut are filtered through Kael’s risk-calculus; every sensory pick is also a tactical one. The cliffside maze is sketched with three deft strokes yet tracks spatially as he doubles back, drops twig, kneels at fountain. Micro-setting (nut ridges biting palm) literally steers the final lock-turn, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Only the traveler’s appearance lacks environmental embedding, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The braided ravine is more than backdrop—its three-strand geography literally teaches Elara the divergence-collaboration model that rewrites her polymer work and sisterhood. Foam micro-setting constrains her epiphany; the chrysalis object-as-setting charges the final release image. Sensory economy is sharp (froth, eddies, roar) and always filtered through chemist perception.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Library-of-glass image is vivid yet selective: refracted shards, mist-muffled steps, prismatic light—all filter through Elara’s vendor gaze. Cloud-sea and floating melody are poetic but consistent; no physics contradictions. Micro-setting works: the empty jar shelf literally charges the final image when the note hovers there. Details are woven through action, not listed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Wet sandstone scent, arctic pavilion air, brackish tidal pool—each sense is filtered through Nessar’s chef-perception (tongue-first). Sandstone walls “cracked yet unyielding” mirror his own brittleness; condensation becomes spice. Spatial choreography is flawless: corridor → domed door → shelves → pool → kitchen return. Rain’s aftermath governs mood shift from oppressive to “silver moon” release. The coral-as-remorse container could be even sharper if its organic contradictions (sea in desert) were tasted, not just seen.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astronomical clock tower is never a postcard; its Latin-Norse-Sanskrit bells and grain-elevator groans press Elara’s ear and shape her tactic of singing in Greek to gears. The brass weight is micro-setting that constrains every soldered move; its final luminous swing recharges the starlight motif. Spatial choreography is clean: candle, chain, axis, and crowd track without drift. Sensory economy favors sound over sight, matching the choral librarian’s bias.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Moonlit canyon and mirror shard operate as micro-setting: the liquid-silver light pools inside the cracks Kael will later fill, binding environment to method. Sensory triage—gust dying to whisper, solder glow, glass hum—tracks attention under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → lift shard → laser pass → headband dial → glass seam; no floating props. The canyon’s breathing glyphs remain plausible hallucination under synaptic overload, so world-rules stay intact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Serpentine tunnels, mist, and low ceiling are tactile and bias Lira’s crouch, guiding her path. The “clandestinely luminous” stone and threshold light-bends are concrete, not decorative, because they signal the coming flip. Micro-setting (manuscript, box, keys) constrains the final tactile choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting: its glaze, weight, and eventual fracture literally constrain every tactic and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Treetop walkways, lantern light on leaves, and soil acidity tests are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Lira’s professional nose. The seed’s evolving musk acts as micro-setting that literally guides her next micro-move; same for the bark journal whose margins swell/relax with her pressure. Spatial choreography is flawless: we never lose track of seed, pot, Lira’s body, crowd. Final image of glowing maroon petals against twilight is the charged object that reweights all prior scent cues.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Floating arches, mid-air water spheres, and root-lattices are sketched with crisp sensory triangulation. The glider, arrow, and vines all double as micro-settings that constrain motion. Final golden-leaf image reweights the premise—setting becomes active archive. A few phrases drift toward catalogue (“centuries of fruit-bearing vines”) but never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Container geography stays coherent: red/blue color cues, ladder ridges, stacked tiers all guide spatial choreography. Weather micro-climates are shown via shiver drops and tablet warnings, never explained. Sodium dock-light reflects Anya’s investigative filter (industrial, night-shift) and charges the final image. Environment is more backdrop than constraint until the final gust; earlier winds could have been used to obstruct access or tools to tighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ice cavern functions as active antagonist: its sculpted hush literally melts and re-forms under sonic color pressure, constraining tactics—Lira must sing hues, not notes. Synesthetic filter is consistent: frost “spiraled like ghostly breath,” silence “pooled like indigo ink,” keeping every descriptor POV-charged. Tool-as-setting (bell, amber sheet) is handled with tactile specificity: runes hum when tilted, resin scent inhaled. Final image recharges the opening “sculpted hush” now made resonant, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thunder-Echo Range is evoked through sonic and tactile detail—“petrified pine and ozone,” thunder that “reverberates endlessly”—and the setting actively shapes tactics: the echoing chasms make flute-sound a weapon of revelation, the fissure staircase a literal response to music. Driftwood markers function as micro-setting that constrains navigation and is re-weighted in the final surrender-rune. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The canyon’s “avalanchingly quiet hush” mirrors the final silence, charging the ending image. One minor lapse: “bruised sky” edges toward stock metaphor, but it is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Topaz workshop under vanishing stars is sensuously anchored: burnt-sapphire air, suspended shard, ink jars knocked over. Micro-setting—halo fragment—actively constrains choices and charges the final image when it settles into his palm.

While no prop or micro-setting directly constrains the final beat, the courtyard’s evolving saplings reconfigure meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays clean; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen library above clouds is sketched through sensorial work: sagging shelves, frost-rattled panes, prism carved from ice. Details act on body—Elara’s fingers trace glass edges, wind rattles while she ignores it—tethering place to agency. The prism functions as micro-setting-tool that literally splits the final choice; satisfies 9+ gate. Minor missed chance to let temperature affect the page (ink freezing, breath cloud) but cold is still atmospherically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rotting-pier micro-setting is continuous sensory filter: “sagging planks,” “tide gnawed,” lantern flickers narrow her attention. Pirate-market geography is sketched through action—scaling the corroded tower, bell-chamber mildew—so space stays coherent while bodies move. The watch-fob-as-setting constrains final choice: its anchor shape becomes the only tool to destroy trust-capture tech. Only hairline slip: we receive no tactile map of the market stalls; orientation inside the bazaar is slightly fogged.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lavender bluff and compass ring function as micro-setting that constrains every beat: stems bow, tin hums, tastes shift tactics. Aurora acts as overhead pressure gauge, its fracture syncing with needle-freeze to crystallize final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt crystal chamber is not backdrop but active agent: its geometric recess reveals the tunnel, its salt lattice stores memory, and its silence literally hums—an acoustic texture that fuses with theme. Micro-setting (the pressed wildflowers) functions as portable chamber, paralleling the vault-rose and charging the final image. Sensory economy favors crystalline crunch, flicker-shadow, and olfactory rot—selective, urgent, never catalogued. Environment constrains the final choice: only within the chamber can gravity pockets stabilize, forcing Elias’s new vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal haven is not backdrop but instrument: moss cushions knees, water drinks paper, fireflies freeze mid-flight to ratchet tension. Micro-setting (the crane-wing as portable altar) constrains the only possible ritual move. Spatial choreography is pristine—no floating props—yet the world-rules remain tacit, keeping the lyric spell intact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rooftop garden and library dome are vividly anchored—wisteria, dust raining from rafters—creating tactile constraint.

    parapet, cliff-drop, and moonlit foam act as micro-setting: the narrow battlement lip literally constrains Kael’s body position while the moon-path on the water supplies the optic grid he “reads.” Rain-slick stone, salt-stiff hair, and vibrating bamboo tines keep tactile immediacy alive. Firefly season is more than postcard—it becomes the living code he deciphers. Spatial choreography is flawless: every step, whistle direction, and whisk-shadow projection is trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Radioactive orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: glowing apples, dust frozen mid-fall, roots in radioactive loam. Micro-setting (the diamond, the soil markings) directly constrains the final placement act. Atmosphere mirrors interior without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt glass, hourglass, and radio rig function as micro-setting that literally constrain final tactic—prism refraction requires their physical arrangement. Storm altitude is more than postcard; wind howl and glass vibration decide timing of mirror activation. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, matching Kael’s engineer-ear. Final image of glowing portico recharges opening “drowned skies” hue, now internally lit—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting rules: the loft’s warped boards, rusted cot, and drifting sand constrain footfall and jar placement; mother-of-pearl inlay becomes the single gleam that guides hope. Salt-air scent and sun-blush gold are filtered through Elias’s nostalgia-biased eye, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—jars arc from satchel to semicircle to emptied voices without teleport. Final image of box humming in his lap as he lies on the rusted cot re-uses the same two props, charging them with spent memory.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice marina is lived-in: planks crunch, resonator whirs, ice creaks under knees. The portable sonic tool functions as micro-setting, constraining every tactical choice. Color-stroke “azure-coat” repeats like a beacon, charging final image. Golden sunset is tracked to last-light deadline, tightening clock—meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Basalt pores absorbing breath, filings trembling like a heartbeat, moonlight through roof-fissure—each tactile detail constrains Kael’s next precise move. The frozen lake’s glass thickness returns as concentric ripples, re-weighted by the final magnetic pulse. Micro-setting (viaduct node etched in stone) anchors the decisive adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tunnel’s drippy echo, rusted ladder, and condensing walls are tactile and bias-filtered through Mara’s investigator gaze. Lantern-light shadows “writhe like living things,” steering her attention to cracks and stress fractures—setting actively guides discovery. Spatial choreography is flawless: ladder descent, wall scan, compartment location tracked without drift. The environment does not yet constrain final tactics, so the 9+ gate is open but not crossed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Shop air “hummed with a vibrant hush,” oil-wood-metal tang, and graphite-dusted Mrs. Elms create a tight, sense-filtered crucible that mirrors Marcus’s watchful restraint. The low storm sky and ticking gears foreshadow the pressure-cooker inside the prison walls, subtly guiding his choice to carry the heart outward. Spatial choreography stays crisp—drawer, counter, doorway tracked without drift. The setting never physically constrains a beat (door never locks, tools never fail), so it illuminates rather than shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skeletal *Skein*, acid-sea updrafts, and kaleidoscope projections are filtered through Lira’s engineer gaze; every sensory pick is a tuning dial. Micro-setting (arrow tip as clapper surrogate) directly enables the final trajectory. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible dives or gear jumps. Environment constrains the final approach: only one dive angle will thread the tower crown.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing labyrinth of server racks, cold light on walls, and the spiral-insignia patch create a micro-setting that literally guides Lira’s cursor to the wormhole coordinates. Sensory selection is biased by her archivist gaze—timestamps, visor static, obsolete code—so every visual detail is also a tool. The final image of the patch glowing under drone-red light recharges its earlier meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the derelict station remains a placeholder; we feel the map pin, not the metal hull.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes” is a fresh, high-impact anchor; every subsequent frost, groan, lantern glow is filtered through Elara’s aurora-weathered perception. The mirrors, lantern, fragment act as micro-setting that physically channel the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean up the spiral stair to attic semicircle; only nit-pick is that “orchard” implies soil yet trees root in permafrost—glossed, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice marina is rendered through pain in boots, keening ice, and the glow of a fissure—details that pressure the next move. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting: its silver filigree is too delicate for the cold, forcing delicate handling that contrasts with pickaxes and ropes. Spatial choreography remains crisp across the hauling beat; bodies, rope, boat, and crack track cleanly. Environment literally charges the final image: frost scent accompanies the first flicker of peace, making the cold the cost she keeps paying.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amber pavilion, acidic soil, oak twilight—each detail filters through painter’s eye and sentinel’s memory, steering conversation to imbalance-as-beauty. Micro-setting succeeds: burned letter edge literally touches fingertips, re-weighting final image. Spatial choreography clean; rain begins tactiley, forcing return. No static postcard season filler; every sensory note pressures the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Whisperfield dunes, murmuring pavilion lattice, kinetic stones—each is sensuously particular and filters through Mara’s skewed perception. The pavilion’s voices coil like smoke, the parapet’s rearrangement is tactile, and the conjured clearings bend time at story’s edge. Micro-setting qualifies: the parapet’s final locked spiral physically anchors the closing image. No geographic drift or white-room gaps; spatial choreography is airtight.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lavender field–factory dyad is vivid and bias-filtered: Lila notices rust crescents, vine curves, dove-gray echo. Spatial choreography is stable; the environment guides her decision to photograph again, charging the final image. Yet the 9+ gate is missed—no object or micro-setting constrains a tactical choice; the map case is carried but never limits or enables action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Library’s “suspended hush” functions as micro-setting: it constrains Elias’s pacing, filters his attention, and supplies the crystal that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail—“dust motes,” “faint scent of ink”—is woven through action, not dumped. Spatial choreography is tight; no object teleporting.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Fog, gravel, and rebar are filtered through Elias’s body and tool use; the sculpture garden’s metallic coldness constrains the final ear-press moment. Driftwood and chalk act as micro-settings that materially guide his steps. Sensory economy is tight—sound and touch dominate over visual catalog. The junkyard’s “unwatched videotapes” echo the unwatched future, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory-as-vessel is rendered through tactile specifics: brass telescope, ozone scent, wind “carrying pine and distant thunder.” Micro-setting objects—trumpet, soldering iron—constrain choices and literally enable the climax. The final image of golden-rimmed portal is charged by these prior particulars. One minor slip: “clouds churned like boiling milk” is visual-only and slightly generic amid otherwise crisp sensory economy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating-isle observatory is sketched with star-close brass and shifting star-floors; micro-setting (the key, the dais slot) constrains the climax. Sensory economy favors visual/geared texture over breadth, fitting scholar-POV. Spatial choreography stays clean across telescope-adjusting and key-insertion. The shadow-gateway image reuses the prior “shadows at noon” motif, charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Garden and maze are sketched with sensory economy—“ivy and honeysuckle hum,” “basin choked with moss”—and the tooth operates as micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies track from gap to fountain to exit without drift. The fountain’s resurrection supplies the 9-band gate (environment charges final image), but the hedge itself never tightens tactical choice beyond ambience, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto’s lichen pulses, the meteorite-iron tool hums, the sea-glass jar clicks—each micro-setting detail later constrains action (the jar’s etched constellations guide alignment at release). Mist and black water act as literal mirrors that enable the galaxy reflection, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across kneel-polish-release moves.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The server-rack terrariums and east-to-west thaw pattern constrain the orchid placement and final sapling site; environment actively shapes the partners’ joint action. Sensory selection is POV-colored: “honeyed hush” tastes the air, amber glow warms dampness, mosslight refracts off resin—details serve tone, not tourism. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies kneel, hands brush, pot centers the drip spiral. Weather (snow outside, internal heat) mirrors protected vulnerability without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    Environment, body, and shell-tool repeatedly constrain movement: crumbling dock limits retreat, mist thickens into shapes that block sightlines, shell’s warmth dictates when she pockets it. These micro-settings are filtered through Clara’s novelist gaze—she catalogs “half-formed creatures” as potential material—so detail is selective, never touristic. Final image of shell on desk charges the closure by keeping the door literally ajar, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Liquid gold” sunlight slanting through leaves carries both visual and metaphysical weight, previewing the later golden threads. The treehouse’s cogs and wind-up birds are not set dressing—they reappear when Lira pockets the lyre, proving the workshop’s inventory can be exhausted. Micro-setting win: the lyre carved from moonlit ivy becomes the literal frame through which pressure is applied; its warmth at the end signals elapsed time. The arbor’s geography stays coherent—highest branch, soil below, streambed re-wetted—so spatial choreography survives the crowd of creatures.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Subarctic crater, frost-bitten apples, flash-paper residue, twig-and-shell constellation: each tactile item is filtered through Elias’s artisan gaze and used to literally construct the closure seal. The cold is not backdrop but drill-sergeant—slowing fingers, thickening time—so environment forces tactics and charges the final gleam of the plate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop: its quartz veins become the calibration grid Elias uses, and the changing noon/midnight light angles directly constrain his tactics. Spatial choreography is steady—spiral staircase, fissure, hidden compartment track cleanly. Sensory detail is selective (damp stone taste, harmonic hum) and mirrors internal state. The setting passes the 9+ gate by functioning as both tool and final image charger.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Bronze grotto is micro-setting masterpiece: star-slotted fissure supplies orientation light, burner angle depends on it; calcified niches and patinaed brass constrain every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV urgency—taste of wet metal, whalebone hum—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography precise; lamp, thorn, obsidian positions tracked across beats. Final image—satchel under window starlight—recharges setting as existential scale.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rain-beaded skylight and rust-hued walls aren’t backdrop; the leaking glass warps city lights into the very watercolor blur she must carve solid. The ash blank’s grain is tactile under thumb, constraining knife angle and emotional tempo—environment, tool, and body fuse into one decision surface that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lagoon’s bruised violet/electric gold hues, froth slosh, and “stuck coin” sun are filtered through scavenger POV—selective, urgent. Micro-setting (camera wheel) constrains choice: its warped spokes literalize broken time and become the vehicle of release. Spatial choreography clean: kneel → sift → drop → wade; no floating rooms. Sensory economy favors tactile and visual; other senses admitted only when pressured (hissing wind). Final rose image recharges same palette, granting coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dusty terminal, shattered glass, moonlit crater—details are tactile and engineer-filtered. The sextant fragment constrains her improvised tools; the atrium’s geometry dictates the generator layout, so environment shapes tactics and final image, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean—no impossible moves. Economy is good; carnival only implied, not exposition-dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Vellichor Keep’s dormant-beast breathing, ink-stained fingers, and petrichor intrusion are selective and character-filtered. The quartz forecourt functions as micro-setting that literally sings under rain and fingertips, constraining her choice to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Canal, barge, and warehouse are sketched with sensory economy: “liquid silver,” “weathered vessel,” “door hanging askew.” The sundial serves as micro-setting—its brass warmth and star-etched face constrain every move. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or floating rooms. The environment does not literally block escape, but the final lantern-lit interior reconfigures the global meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fog, snow, and salt-bleached planks narrow perception to Elias’s gloved fingers and the rope’s resistance, constraining how gently he must handle both artifacts. Micro-setting (rope fibers, glass spirals) doubles as map and star-chart, directly shaping next tactical move. Dock’s creak and gull-cries layer sonic hush that modulates with pressure. Final image of sacred dock re-uses same anchors now charged with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The garden is rendered through tactile micro-details—moss, jasmine scent, carpet weft under fingers—each filtered by Elara’s taxonomic gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate: kneel → brush → unroll → follow back. The thread functions as micro-setting that literally guides her exit, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather (autumn wind) is used as promise rather than backdrop, charging the final beat without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vyrthra’s suspended stalactite palace is not postcard scenery; its resonant anchors and marble cracks literally answer the egg’s pulses, guiding Corvin’s apparatus placement. Micro-setting succeeds: the copper-wire nest is a tactile “tool-room” whose parts are handled, reconfigured, and finally transmuted. Sensory selection stays under POV duress—oil-taste, keening stone—without tourist clutter. Gate met, but one clause (“world reduced to…”) drifts into overview, capping at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    Volcanic black sand and obsidian lagoon are specific, sensory, and return in the final image; the sand literally hisses under tactile handling. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: boots sink, knees sink, hand scoop, grain released. The coin-as-micro-setting constrains the splint choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fountains’ dry basins and rusted clocktower gears are tactile obstacles, not postcard scenery; the cracked drain Lira pries open literally blocks her path until she bleeds. Yet the environment never forces a tactical rethink—she always knows the next breadcrumb—so the setting supports mood more than choice. The violet bookmark reappears as a micro-setting inside the library, earning partial constraint credit.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    Petals-as-constellations and mother-of-pearl clouds are poetically rendered and color every beat; the crystalline trees act as micro-setting that physically receives the gear, charging the final image. Selective sensory layering (sound of pings, tactile gear edges) keeps density high without listiness; spatial tracking never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse glass, damp earth, and butterfly shadows are not backdrop but instruments: the rattling panes echo chest-cavity, lantern glow refracts through ribbon dyes, final image of vanished flight imprints bone. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the ribbon and lantern constrain choices—colors decide when to speak, light limits where he stands. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: a carver notices texture against wool, not botanical names. Spatial choreography stays clean across nightly returns.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian ridge is handled like a living antagonist: shards cut boots, cracks mirror her face, final sealing answers her act. Salt-slick texture, low resonant hum, and spiral stairwell situate every move; the tower’s iron veins and bob scars integrate world-rule learning into action. Environment directly constrains her climb and final alignment of rake to bob, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt silo’s oculus, marigold roots, and frayed thread constellations are selectively filtered through Elara’s calloused fingertips; each sensory tier constrains her next micro-movement. The velveteen gloom isn’t just mood—it’s the literal working light that limits how far she can see into the border labyrinth, making environment an active participant in the decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian spire and frozen lake act as thermostat and clock; their thermal shifts directly shape her data sets and final prediction. The weathered oak desk, silver inkwell, and kingfisher nib are micro-settings that constrain how she can write (cold thickens ink, ash-blue feather flickers warning). Sensory hierarchy favors touch/temperature over sight, mirroring her obsession with measurable freeze cycles. Final image of burning journals in the spire’s hearth recharges the earlier obsidian motif with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting rules: the radio dial’s blue circle and the moss veins are tools that constrain posture and sight; she must lean, squint, write. Mist and gravel are filtered through a copyist’s ear—she notices “iron and memory” taste, not visual panorama. Spatial choreography clean: cloak pools, boots crunch, gravel tracks. Final image of plains reuses “ashes” but re-prices it: now a stage for her future piracy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vanishing-point architecture—walls that “resent permanence”—is more than backdrop; it dictates Lira’s tactic of deliberate incompleteness. The powder, mask, and rocking chair operate as micro-settings that constrain every gesture. Sensory selection stays tight: charcoal grit under fingernails, porcelain edges biting skin. Environment never described for its own sake; each detail reweights the central stake of transience.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The brass cog’s tidal etchings and the algae-choked canteen are tactile, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final astrolabe image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across the dig site; the moldy tomes and flickering lamp constrain Elias’s squat and shape his stance. The “sunken city” macro-setting is sketched with postcard breadth, but the micro-setting of sediment layers and sewer acoustics does the causal work, so the broader vagueness is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Velvet library, maple leaves, stained-glass, and the zither rosette are vivid, selective, and return to charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies and objects track. Autumn environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. The micro-setting (rosette) constrains Clara’s attention and finally refracts the light that reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse’s broken glass and moss function as micro-setting that literally constrains every cut—she must dodge shards while pruning. Sensory hierarchy is chef-driven: soil aroma, taste of memories, tactile vine-sap. Violet light shift is tracked through bodily reaction (gasp, tremor) rather than exposition. Tool (pruning shears) and plant-body serve as extension of setting that dictates spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lightning tower is not postcard backdrop—it constrains every beat: its copper glow provides the only light, its gravel base stages the drone wreck, its archives explain the box, and its final brightness is the payoff for Clara’s speech. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: humming air, split drone abdomen, nectar-dusk light. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (lacquer box) re-weights meaning at closure. World rules stay consistent; no techno-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Select sensory detail—“window frame leaned half an inch too far,” “amber haze”—conveys POV bias and spatial intimacy.

Orris root shard acts as micro-setting and charges the final image, satisfying micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Bioluminescent algae, obsidian statue, coral beds—details are filtered through Mara’s diving perception and narrated via tactile action (kneeling in silt, gloves slick). The garden’s laboratory logic is learned late yet still guides choice; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she threads cracks. The micro-setting (ampoule pressed under pedestal) constrains the climax pry and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. A single overripe phrase—“liquid starlight”—is offset by surrounding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Staircase operates as micro-setting—its vanishing steps literally constrain footing and tactics; the dice orbit inside its curvature charges the final image. Selective sensory palette (shimmering parchment stone, metallic groan, ozone-regret air) is filtered through Kael’s bias toward aged, academic textures. Spatial choreography is clean: dice thrown, reappear, hover at an exact orbital radius. Two minor slips—“aged parchment” and “tarnished silver” verge on cross-metaphor clutter but do not stall momentum. Environment does not merely mirror interiority; it supplies the rupture surface that enables the perpetual loop.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse is concretely anchored (“glass-domed sanctuary, ferns dripped dew”) and its door-creak admits Mr. Voss, so the micro-setting doubles as plot hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Funhouse mirrors, condensation, ozone, and moth-residue create a tactile, single-scene crucible. The cloak clasp serves as micro-setting that constrains the final grab. Selective sensory triage (visual, haptic, acoustic) mirrors Mara’s narrowing attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating bodies or impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating driftwood orchard is not backdrop but instrument: each plank’s grain sets pitch, kelp ropes act as dampers, apples become percussive metronomes. Spatial choreography is flawless—Leeward pivots inward as the circle narrows, forcing her body to angle strikes differently. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the mallet’s tactile grooves and the lightning-scarred trunk constrain her final, gong-like strike that fractures the clouds. Environment directly charges the final image; only a hairline slip of generic “salt spray” keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Shell-streets, brine-air, Market-district fracture—each detail is filtered through Lira’s cartographer eye and doubles as tactical map.

Sensory hierarchy adheres—smell of damp earth, tactile flaking gold—mirroring the softened brick without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: rosebush → Track Three arch → rusted door → chamber; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Submerged pavilion is not backdrop but tool: silt sucks boots, cracked mosaic accepts ink, hatch hinges scream—each tactile detail alters what Elara can do next. Light refracts through water to amber, mirroring her shifting internal state without overt symbolism. The inkwell itself serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Only the jarred specimens drift toward catalogue; they don’t charge closure, capping at 8.6.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment acts as third force: algae-lit desk constrains visibility, bronze grooves shape code attempt, moon-dapple texture modulates mood. Sensory triage (cold wall, rust flakes, bioluminescent jars) mirrors internal shift from murky ignorance to lucid responsibility. Spatial choreography holds—stamp, journal, door handled without teleport. Final image of fractured moonlight on water recharges initial dapple, qualifying for 9+ gate, capped only because world rule on flood mechanics is assumed, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Floating tea garden, basilica’s paradoxical motion, and moonstone bowl act as micro-settings that constrain her ascension/descent craft; final image of ascending-star shards re-uses basilica spires, passing the 9-gate test. Sensory economy is tight—lavender smoke, gem facets—filtered through lantern-maker priorities; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating glass observatory, ozone reek, fractal shadows underfoot—details are selective and mirror her cracked state. Micro-setting of the shard in palm charges the final image when it re-crystallizes. Spatial track across crater remains coherent. Environment shapes choice: glass floor cracks push her toward the node.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Observatory stones, rusted dome, Cassiopeia overhead—each detail is filtered through Lira’s drone-overlay gaze, never touristy. Dusk light is used tactically: prism fractals cue the alignment beat. Spatial choreography is clean: grappling hook arc, lever location, niche beams track without drift. The dome itself acts—rotates, vibrates—qualifying as micro-setting that constrains the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt terrace and salt air are filtered through Elias’s guilt-tinged perception; the driftwood operates as micro-setting that literally stores and constrains choices. Selective sensory economy—no tourist checklist—keeps momentum. The ocean’s rule (wood remembers) is learned through action, not exposition. High-band gate missed: the terrace itself does not return to charge the final image; only the watch and dusk do.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Storm-worn parapet, salt-pitted stone, and the brass pull’s worn scrollwork are handled under pressure; the pull’s final fall into mist recharges the setting as emotional release. Mist and tide remain present enough to narrow perception without sliding into tourist catalog. Micro-setting succeeds: the drawer pull functions as portable neutral ground that constrains her grip on guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-settings (cedar chest, salt-etched glass, spiral stairs) double as emotional calipers; the compass itself acts as portable setting that constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys kayaker attention: sound of hull slap before color of sky. Single nag: “liquid mercury beneath the dock” is atmospheric but visually impossible at dawn low-tide—minor verisimilitude wobble. Otherwise environment tracks body and tool cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bioluminescent lake is tactile—“water reaching her knees, its glow seeping into her skin”—and mirrors Mara’s inner state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: grate→descent→water’s edge. The baseball’s glow at the end recharges the motif. One minor over-clar: “the labyrinth wasn’t physical, she realized” tells what the image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orchard’s perpetual moonlight and pulsing ash-hearts constrain tactics: only here can scent-open the ghost-bridge. The clay mortar and spice-paste act as micro-setting that literally rewrites her skin; remove them and the ritual fails. Spatial choreography stays clean—fox, owl, willow approach in sequence,羽毛落在她脚边 without position drift. Final image of moon-lit phoenix re-uses the moonlight rule established on line 1.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating moss-and-birch glade is not backdrop; its dissolving edges and hourglass-rooted tree constrain Elara’s climb and fall. The saucer functions as micro-setting: its crack widening dictates when the light/chorus is released. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—ozone, lilacs, starlight—each tethered to memory. The city of backward time is revealed only when the glade’s tree is breached, making environment instrumental to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Recycled spaceship patched with fused asteroid metal” is tactile and specific; the meditation chamber’s hologram forests act as micro-setting that charges the shadow-work beat. Kwan Yin’s Tear functions as both tool and setting-in-miniature, its collapsed-star locket constraining her grip and final decision. Garden beyond door reweights Earth-memory motif, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial tracking remains coherent across zero-g float.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Black sand, low stars, charcoal grit, and volcanic hiss are vivid, selective, and threaded through action. The beach’s warmth underfoot after the final release is a micro-setting shift that charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice. Spatial choreography is ghost-clear—man appears/vanishes—but acceptable under lyric mode. Sensory economy favors immediacy over breadth, appropriate to 750-word scope.</answer>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“understand the texture of transformation”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each bug released deepens the hush and narrows Lira’s emotional option from accidental to purposeful philanthropy. No visible price (lost bug, physical risk, social credit) is dramatized; cost is conceptual. Sufficient tightening for this length, but lacks tangible trade-off that would push above 7.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Luminous fort at twilight” and blackout narrow visual field effectively; amber glow vs. starlit bronze generates texture. Setting guides choice only once (sundial slot opens the stair); otherwise it serves mood more than obstacle. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Tool-as-setting (quill holder) charges the reveal but not the final image, so 9-gate missed.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Aurora colors, frictionless water, and damp boots create an immediate tactile world; the vial of star dust functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical adjustment. Spatial choreography is flawless—rocks click, eel arcs, shadows lengthen—everything tracks. The bluff’s still tide and bruise-purple sky charge the final sigil-image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Storm-shaken observatory constrains every move: dome groans, lantern flame flickers, viewport leaks—environment forces the timer’s click and the wax seal. Darkroom timer recurs as micro-setting that paces breath and final writing; its red glow charges the closing image. Body-as-setting noted in scar topography and mask cracks. No spatial drift; weather directly shapes the vigil’s pause and the poem’s birth.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Glass atrium + prismatic light + half-painted sundial floor act as micro-setting that literally steers footwork and reflection angles; brook sound keeps temporal pulse. Light-constraint charges the final image when constellation dots hit glass, making environment indispensable to tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rusted corrugated metal, cracked glass, flickering bulbs, and the moon’s silver glaze create tactile micro-setting that constrains choice—Cedar hides the tin beneath a loose floorboard because the building’s skeletal decay *allows* it. Sensory hierarchy follows vagrant priorities: smell of old paper, scuff of boots, ink from berries. The library’s decay mirrors internal fracture without overt symbolism; starlight supplies the only reliable illumination, charging the final quill-stroke. Object-as-setting (tin) re-appears in closure, reweighting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal arbor’s glass ribs, sway pulse, and “cloud-swallowing” height act as an active force, dictating her tempo and finally framing the hush when she stops. Piano, clock, and compasses all accrue history through touch and friction. Spatial logic stays intact across the one transition. Environmental specificity is integral, not postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: color-shifts, jasmine/iron scent, soap-bubble seed. The ridge itself doesn’t constrain tactics, but the seed-as-micro-setting does; its iridescence and warmth directly cue Lira’s dream-entry. Spatial choreography in the dream-mirror cavern is coherent. One hairline slip: “the ridge would drown in storms” tells weather future rather than letting us feel it press the present beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The post-rain islet’s salt-kelp air and warped wooden studio are sketched in economical, sensory strokes; the bonsai pot and brass compass function as micro-settings that constrain handling and focus attention. Spatial choreography stays clean across the rowboat approach to the wreck, letting the ghost’s translucent figure appear without spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as both setting and micro-setting, actively constraining choice: collapsed glass limits movement, silt-clogged drains shape drainage observations, and the bamboo stake anchors the butterfly dust. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—humidity fogs spectacles, soil clings to calloused hands—and evolves causally (mold peels over weeks). Crucially, the environment charges the closure: the chrysalis in a grime-caked pipe becomes the fulcrum for Elara’s rebirth as an observer attuned to earthly entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    The canyon functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its frost maps routes, its crevice hides the shard, its silence pressures introspection. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—Lirael sees ice as prisms, stone as potential canvas. The final image of “frost glittering... sun climbing” charges closure by contrasting transience with resolve. Every environmental detail serves perception or choice; no white-room syndrome or tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The winterglass conservatory is micro-setting as crucible: its ice-glazed walls refract emotion into vibration, its stillness demands non-auditory communication, and its rare plants physically manifest Lirael’s music. Every sensory detail (breath visible in cold air, forks humming through glass) serves the central conflict. The environment constrains choice—Lirael must innovate within this hushed, fragile space—and charges the final image: leaves dancing to silent frequencies. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (silt-blocked entrance, floating shards) and charges the final image (thriving shelves under renewed light). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s profession—brine and paper over visual spectacle—and the lens’s gold-mended cracks reappear in the climax. Spatial choreography remains coherent (descent → dome → apex), and the environment evolves causally (darkness → beam → rediscovery). The recurring lens object shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s the sole delivery point and ceremonial center—and charges the final image through children’s carvings and daily bell-ringing. Sensory details (“wet clay,” “red tiles glowing like embers”) are selective and mood-aligned. However, the ridge’s geography lacks tactical specificity; the setting supports theme more than pressure. Still, the bell-as-tool elevates integration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the twilight viaduct and glowing woods constrain perception and guide ritual (breathing, vial use). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered—moss-slick path, bitter-sweet tear, foggy lucidity—but never stalls momentum. The blossoming tree and still pool charge the climax, yet the environment doesn’t *force* a choice; it reflects rather than pressures. Misses 9+ gate by lacking a spatial constraint that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The living bridge garden functions as active micro-setting: vines retract to reveal paths, planks shift underfoot, hedges bend light—all constraining Elara’s perception and enabling her ritual. The halo fragment and photographs are environmental extensions that charge the climax. Sensory detail (ozone, burnt sugar, salt-laced breeze) is filtered through Elara’s retrocognitive sensitivity, never decorative. Crucially, the garden’s reformation—photographs now glowing—directly reshapes the final image and thematic payoff, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is not backdrop but crucible: dust, cotton candy ghosts, splintered piano—all filter through Lirael’s desperate focus and directly enable or constrain action (e.g., bench hiding keys). The seed vault’s earthy coolness contrasts the upper decay, charging the descent. Final image of trembling soil reweights the setting from ruin to rebirth. Only slight deduction: “rusted iron cuffs” and “velvet-lined compartment” verge on curated aesthetic over lived-in grit.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint and thematic amplifier: shipwrecks press against glass, coral buries the anvil, aurora light refracts through fractures—all shaping Lira’s actions. The forge, dead peach tree, and vials are handled repeatedly, evolving from backdrop to crucible to mold. Crucially, the greenhouse’s salt-warped ribs and liquid-mercury aurora charge the final image, making environment inseparable from emotional resonance. No white-room syndrome; every detail filters through Lira’s synesthetic POV.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The emerald station isn’t backdrop—it supplies the grate, pressure-sensitive floor, and dozing guard that shape Elara’s tactics. The lily and jar function as micro-settings: their physical properties (petal angles, glow intensity) directly enable or warn against action. Final image charges the setting—the photograph becomes a “beacon” in the ticket office, proving environment constrains and rewards. Sensory hierarchy (amber streaks, humming clocks) reflects Elara’s urgency without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned control room isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: frost-choked circuitry impedes search, sunlight gilds dust motes to mirror Kael’s hope, and thawing ice literally reveals the compartment. The bookmark (object-as-setting) constrains choice—its crack dictates Kael’s reinterpretation, which fuels the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects his glassblower POV (visual light refraction, tactile ice/metal). Final image charges the setting: muddy ground/new grass externalizes internal thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “rusted library under stars” functions as micro-setting: its decaying scripts and labeled aisles supply both cover and weapons (the *TRAGEDY* script), while the child’s cast embeds the notes physically. Sensory detail is selective—yellowed pages “like old wounds,” boots echoing—filtered through Lila’s stunt-double attention to spatial choreography. The shell’s tactile presence charges the final café image. Only slight over-description in the opening line slightly stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its groaning walls resist Mara’s intrusion, crumbling mortar demands tactile deciphering, and archway shelter shapes her crouch. Crucially, the setting charges the closure—cracks illuminated by the map’s glow literalize how silence reveals hidden structures. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: wind, pebbles, and ambered hush dominate early; later, the tactile resistance of paper and shed gold flakes narrow perception to micro-labor. The fort’s ghost-haunted stones and pebble shore are filtered through Mara’s oracle bias, avoiding tourist cataloging while grounding myth in weathered stone.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: snow muffles creaks, ice structures melt/reform into keys/doors, and twilight shadows stretch to mirror temporal ambiguity—all constraining choices (e.g., melting violin forces immediate traversal). Sensory detail is selective (optical sensors on rime, hum of ice crystal) and filtered through robotic perception. Final image charges closure: the mundane bench-polishing gains mysticism through earned omniscience. Deducted 0.1 for slightly generic “frozen mid-splash” fountain imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crystal forecourt isn’t backdrop—it actively enables and constrains: rain-slick stones, vibrating crystals post-rain, shadows under the archway. These details guide movement, perception, and revelation. The projector lens functions as micro-setting—its cracked glass filters truth. Final image (“forecourt… gleamed like a promise”) charges the environment with thematic resonance. Every spatial cue serves the accumulative pressure and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden maze functions as both setting and micro-setting—it pressures choices (shifting paths, sensors) and supplies resources (vines to redirect). The marbles, though small objects, act as environmental anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (light-absorbing hedges, polished cracks) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. However, the maze’s “living entity” aspect leans slightly toward abstraction rather than fully constrained physical behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the nexus, terrariums, and grated floor directly constrain action (e.g., creatures thrashing against glass signals destabilization). Sensory detail is selective—lavender twilight, ammonia clouds, metallic clicks—and filtered through Veyra’s professional attention. The “icy warmth” motif charges the final image, with the station’s hum mirroring her resolve. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The flooded opera house isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges every choice: water depth slows movement, lantern light flickers to obscure/reveal symbols, floating instruments become obstacles or omens. The timpani’s final thrum ties setting to closure, proving environment shapes both action and meaning. Sensory detail (glistening bow strings, sloshing boots) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Clara’s musician POV.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mountain weather station isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices (rattling windows, cold glass, structural fatigue in maps). The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting: its smudged margins constrain Lirael’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail (metallic tang, damp earth) filters through her fractured POV, avoiding cliché. Aurora’s sorrow mirrors internal stakes without overt symbolism, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining the ending’s emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel and valve function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the valve fits only specific ports, forcing progression, and the chamber’s machinery dictates the climax. Sensory detail is purposeful—slick walls, blue pulse, icy beads—and filtered through Elias’s explorer POV. The ivy-choked mouth and dawn return frame the journey spatially and tonally. Only minor deduction: the mill’s toxic sludge backstory feels slightly expository rather than discovered through tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    The overgrown library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: algae-slick tunnels force climbing, petrified wood yields only to palm-pressure. Sensory details (scent of decaying paper, taste of iron and old rain) filter through the keeper’s desperation, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The obsidian refuge’s black sand and backward-flowing river charge the final image, embodying the thematic shift. Environment directly enables the climax—without the library’s hidden veins, the journey fails.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sage Ridge functions as micro-setting: gnarled oak roots and dreaming moss constrain choices (seating, acoustics for cello) and charge closure—the ridge’s “hush” frames the glow’s intimacy. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency: pre-eclipse, wind whispers; totality narrows to cello vibrations and curl’s warmth. Recurring tactile details (moss-cloaked boulders, polished cello wood) evolve with emotional stakes. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    The reclaimed silo library functions as both setting and character—its steel ribs, ash-clogged hearth, and rusted quiet directly constrain Elias’s actions and charge the climax. Sensory detail (scent of old paper, bronze quiet, glowing dragon eyes) is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with narrative pressure. The tapestry’s physicality and the fireplace’s debris aren’t backdrop but active conduits of meaning, culminating in the final image where environment and theme fuse.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse isn’t backdrop but crucible: its isolation enables secrecy, its history informs purpose, its spiral stairs and basement physically channel discovery. Weather (storm intensifying at decision point) and tools (lantern, typewriter, cookie) constrain action. Final image—waves’ “familiar enigma”—charges closure by echoing opening rhythm while reweighting it through Elara’s changed stance. Only minor deduction: “tea-stained recipe cards” slightly generic, though redeemed by functional disguise.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting functions as micro-setting: the dimensional anchor, velvet walls, and shifting floor aren’t backdrop but active constraints—the anchor must be destabilized, the walls absorb then vibrate with sound, the floor’s unobserved shifts mirror ontological instability. The indigo paint and loop pedal are tactile extensions of environment, directly enabling the priest’s tactics. Final image is charged by the void’s stabilization into “dynamic equilibrium,” fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)

Crucially, the nautilus charges the final image—its dimming glow after use signifies expended emotional labor—fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glowing viaduct functions as micro-setting: its spectral light guides and pressures choice, intensifying at archways to signal timeline forks. Rain-slick stones and residual luminescence tether atmosphere to Mara’s emotional state without overt symbolism. Final image of “darkening brightness” charges closure by reframing chaos as beauty. Environment constrains tactics—she must approach arches to activate runes.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drum maker’s cavern functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: hides vibrate in sympathy, walls absorb hush, wood warms under touch. Sensory detail is filtered through Lila’s deafness—vibrations in bones, air thickening—not visual clichés. The phonograph and copper wire are tools that charge the final image: the broken needle becomes a “relic,” the filament an internalized thread. Seasonal shifts (“faint rustle of turning seasons”) evolve causally with emotional thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting: its ivy trellis enables lateral progression, and its stone fountain delivers the inciting object. Fog evolves causally—from atmospheric detail to visual obstruction during escape—while the recorder constrains choice (detecting lies/particulates). Final image recharges the courtyard’s “tranquility” as earned stasis, now infused with moral clarity. Every sensory detail (ash-rain, blood-coughing, wax-stamped tube) serves pressure or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    The greenhouse functions as active micro-setting: extinct plants pressure Lirael’s mission, UV panels enable the climax, and prismatic light foreshadows “crystal shadows.” Sensory details (rain-soaked earth, parchment) are filtered through her profession and caution. Final image ties setting to theme—the city’s rain/woodsmoke becomes bearable because the greenhouse taught her to grieve. Environment directly charges closure via the vial’s placement and lantern’s glow.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting: its clay walls pulse with “vibrations of forgotten footsteps” and later peel to reveal constellations tied to Kael’s scribbles, directly charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective—starlight on ancient skin, hum of residue—but leans visual; touch dominates via rope/clay contact. No spatial drift; the single location tightens focus. However, the grotto never *constrains* choice—it reveals, but doesn’t pressure—missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its glass amplifies condensation drips into musical texture, its stone floor supports the bowl’s resonance, and its salt-fogged windows mirror Lira’s blurred grief. Shipwrecks and burned rainforest aren’t backdrop but acoustic participants (“hulls groaning in the tide”). Sensory detail is filtered through Lira’s acoustically perceptive POV—she notices creaks, not colors—and the humid air dampening strings feels lived-in. Final image recharges the greenhouse as “beginning,” fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    The amber grotto is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its static electricity enables Elias’s method, its crystals glow with emotional resonance, and its mossy floor absorbs sound to heighten intimacy.

Final image—amber light fading as Elias stores the used petal—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Every sensory detail serves character, theme, or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library functions as micro-setting: its “whimsically attentive ambiance” enables Clara’s pause and the envelope’s arrival, directly shaping her choice to investigate. Harbor details (“salt-tinged air,” “crumbling boardinghouse”) filter through Clara’s cargo-broker POV—she notices structural decay, not romantic decay. Final image of locket “catching sunlight” charges closure by tying maritime light (lighthouse, stars) to moral illumination. Weather and space choreography remain coherent across shards.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crystalline orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics (glass sap binds sculptures, light angles guide the search) and charges closure (the amphitheater clearing frames the reveal). Sensory detail is selective (prismatic fractures, molten-silver eyes) and filtered through Kael’s artisan POV. The crater’s physics (bending light, liquid-mercury time) remain consistent and constrain choice. Final image gains power because the setting’s rules enable the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal system functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: rusted railing limits movement, water’s erratic flow dictates timing, moss-crusted stones ground observation. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—Lila notices ripple patterns, not architecture. The pendant-as-tool charges the final image, its cooling signaling completion. Environment mirrors internal shift: chaotic pulses resolve to steady flow only after her journey through the tunnel of time.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively nourishes Elara’s ritual: stalactite water feeds soil, silence enables focus, mosaic stone holds ancestral fractures.

The recurring linden leaf and overnight vines charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Weather actively shapes tactics: storm aftermath enables metamorphosis and vine growth, linking environment to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal island isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: crumbling cliffs limit movement, rain carves new paths, mud slows progress, and the black-mirror pool centers the discovery. The amber brooch functions as micro-setting, its glow altering spatial perception. Final image gilds cliffs in gold, directly recharging the opening’s “salt-bleached” desolation. Every sensory detail serves Marin’s painterly POV and the story’s thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    The musical crystal cave is not backdrop but active crucible: its song dictates Elara’s emotional state, its light shapes perception, and its destabilization mirrors thematic rupture. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax—the pearl’s effect only manifests through crystal resonance—and charges the ending image (“unpredictable hum beneath the melody”). Sensory detail is purposeful (prismatic patterns on skin, liquid melody of springs), never decorative, and evolves causally with the pilgrim’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivory harbor after rain is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: wet cobblestones, sagging roofs, and tidal pooling directly shape Lirael’s observations and timing. The recurring valve charges the final image when it fits the locket-trumpet. However, while atmospheric, the setting rarely constrains choice—it enables reflection but doesn’t force difficult decisions. Still, sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The starlit vault functions as micro-setting: condensation-slick walls, fractured stone, and mist constrain perception and movement, directly enabling the arrow discovery and staircase reveal. The phantom ticket punch—a tool-as-setting—charges the final image when placed on the pedestal.

The stained-glass chamber’s fractured colors mirror his internal reconfiguration, fulfilling the 9+ gate via object and environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stargazer’s tower functions as micro-setting: its cliff-edge isolation pressures Clara’s solitude, while moss and stone ground the tile’s discovery. Whale migration isn’t backdrop—it modulates the story’s cadence (songs rise/swell/soften), directly shaping Clara’s emotional tempo. The tile itself becomes environmental constraint: its shifting symbols demand transcription, forcing engagement. Final image—whales silhouetted against moon—recharges the opening’s “indigo sky,” making setting inseparable from thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prismatic escondite isn’t backdrop—it actively warps (“doors became windows; floors turned to ceilings”), bleeds color with emotional valence (“walls bled crimson”), and collapses only after the amulets break. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: ozone and iron on the tongue, iridescent floors under silent boots. The setting constrains choice (navigation during shifts) and charges the final image—the void revealed as the escondite peels away. Every atmospheric cue ties to character state or plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prep room functions as micro-setting: lilies and ironed linen mask deception, the mahogany casket provides cover, and spatial choreography (Elara behind coffin, agents pacing) remains coherent. The ink pot acts as tool-as-setting—its violet-to-gold shift constrains Elara’s tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (cold glass, bitter ink) and filtered through Elara’s crisis-narrowed perception. Only minor deduction: funeral home specifics don’t uniquely shape choices beyond generic concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bonsai labyrinth functions as micro-setting: mineral soil, mist-refracted light, and moss-cushioned stone directly enable Althea’s work. The fluorescent lamp—salvaged, flickering—is both tool and environmental constraint; its hum dictates her dawn ritual. Final image (“notepad clutched to her chest”) charges the recurring object with earned weight. Every sensory detail (crushed violets, rough bark, cool glass) filters through her stationer’s POV, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—Kael navigates by rusted hatches and broken seals, climbs to avoid surging tides, and discovers truth in spatial pockets. Sensory detail (salt tang, diesel decay, gritty paint) is filtered through Kael’s fractured perception, never decorative. The recurring poison label and locket charge the final image. Environment directly enables the climax: without the shifting containers and tidal rhythm, the skeleton remains hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    The observatory functions as micro-setting: its cliff-edge precariousness, broken tripod, and buzzing control panel directly constrain action (e.g., positioning the shell on the cello’s bridge).

Sensory detail (dust motes, brittle cello note) filters through Lira’s myth-busting lens, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.3)
    The raft city isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: vendors resist privatization *because* of its floating, layered history; graffiti appears on hulls and tents, not blank walls. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, constraining Lira’s rhetoric and anchoring her campaign. Sensory detail (fried dough, diesel, soot-smudged faces) is filtered through Lira’s professional urgency, never touristic. Final image—smoothed chip in pocket—recharges the opening tactile cue with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The moonlit summit isn’t backdrop but active constraint: airless chill, undisturbed dust, and Earth’s distant glow shape every choice. The crater’s sharp edges demand precise placement; the vial’s function depends on dawn’s angle. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the fading gas against gray regolith and pale Earth—making environment inseparable from theme. Sensory detail (silver headlamp path, suit-seeping cold) is selective, tactile, and filtered through Lira’s professional-poetic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mist-coated rail depot isn’t backdrop—it’s active atmosphere that blurs edges, softens sound, and mirrors Lira’s non-visual perception.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-washed foundry functions as micro-setting: its iron-and-earth smell, molten pit, and corrugated roof constrain Kael’s actions and charge the climax. The zodiac coin and molten metal merge setting with object, culminating in Lira’s emergence from the pit—a fusion of environment and revelation. Sensory detail is selective (tingling nose, drumming rain) and filtered through Kael’s alchemical sensibility. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere; it enables rather than compels.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Echo Gorge isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: stone ribs press close, shadows pool thickly, and the misaligned harp’s location dictates Lira’s path. The crocodile’s tooth functions as micro-setting, constraining interaction with the spirit and charging the final image when it pulses with light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air tasted of old dust”), avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment evolves causally—from cold dissonance to birdsong—and directly shapes the closure’s luminous ache.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but active crucible: its light interrogates, its spores burn as penance, its bioluminescent veins pulse in sync with Elias’s trauma. The setting constrains choice—Elias must brace against it, read its patterns, endure its radiation—and directly charges the final image where he walks deeper into its glow. Sensory detail is selective (UV flares on skin, moss-slick ground, hum through roots) and filtered through Elias’s disoriented yet hyper-aware POV. The forest’s rules are consistent and learned through embodied interaction, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.3)
    The alchemist’s market isn’t backdrop—it’s an active micro-setting: stalls hum with trapped light, dust motes spell language, beams crack into constellations. These details constrain Lira’s method and charge the final image. The lighthouse mural evolves from static art to interactive portal, its transformation pivotal. Every sensory cue serves the Accumulative lens and closure, avoiding white-room or tourist syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned ticket office is vividly rendered through selective, tactile detail—peeling laminate, blue-gray haze, crumbling plaster—that filters through Elias’s professional gaze. The setting actively constrains action: the counter becomes a ladder, the ceiling hides truth, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, while atmosphere is immersive, the environment doesn’t *force* a critical tactical shift beyond enabling discovery; it supports rather than pressures. The mainspring barrel and dust function as micro-settings that charge the final image, narrowly missing 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    The glass orchard library isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: shelves sway, panes crack, frost lattices guide Elara’s sabotage. Every sensory detail (ink-ozone air, fractured rainbows, humming vial) serves theme and pressure. The setting constrains tactics (frost must be studied at dawn) and charges the final image (spiral etched in air). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent amid chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its temporal storms enable visions, its bioluminescent fungi store history, and its mirrored atrium amplifies lies. The shard, fungi, and cobalt haze form a micro-setting triad that charges every choice—from covering mirrors to planting spores. Final image of glowing fungi caps reconfigures the entire environment as archive, not ruin. Sensory detail (prismatic refractions, humming shard, eerie green glow) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—its hum intensifies when Elias presses his palm, enabling tethering. Copper walls, runes, glass—all tactile details filter through Elias’s artisan POV and charge the final image (stone steady and bright amid dimming light). Spatial choreography is precise: Lira steps closer, breath fogs glass, fingers brush stone. Environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism (e.g., “air thickening into syrup of sound” conveys emotional density).

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint and thematic amplifier: the porous cliffs, slick tunnel, and mirror-like lagoon directly shape Lira’s movement and perception. The petrichor isn’t just described—it’s collected, compared, and ultimately transformed by the lagoon’s ancient air. Crucially, the subterranean space charges the final image: the labeled jars now hold something sentient, altering Lira’s entire practice. Every sensory detail serves pressure or revelation, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-tossed archway functions as micro-setting and constraint: it channels memory, demands interaction, and physically anchors every key beat. Sensory detail is selective (damp moss, bruised sky, turbine-hum) and filtered through Lira’s tactile profession—she reads wood like text. The coral-and-timber village emerges only after the slide activates, proving setting evolves causally. Crucially, the driftwood sculptures charge the final image, their forms now legible as timelines and tide-mechanisms.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is micro and macro: the amber pavilion’s stone floor, latticework, and melting snowdrifts constrain action (kneeling, climbing scaffolding), while the cathedral window’s etched glass actively shapes perception—its patterns shift with light, demanding repeated visits. The body (Mara’s palm on humming glass, teeth aching) merges with environment as instrument of discovery. Autumn’s return bookends the narrative, charging the final image with cyclical inevitability. Every sensory detail serves the drive lens: frost lines “bold as veins,” violet glow, bioluminescent murals—all filter through Mara’s nocturnal obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    The obsidian lagoon constrains every major choice—from decryption method to descent—and charges the final image as both threshold and mirror. Zeppelin library isn’t ornamental; its departure horn forces deadline pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: salt/decay during wait, cold air in tunnels. Recurring symbols on walls and sand tie environment to plot mechanics, not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Paper-Lantern Cove functions as both setting and micro-setting: its salt-laden air, crumbling piers, and spectral lanterns constrain perception and mood while supplying key resources (compass, ledger, apothecary shell). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—brine, dust, amber light—filtered through Elias’s alchemical gaze. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: the glowing bottle at the cove’s heart reweights all prior decay into possibility. The amber bottle itself acts as object-as-setting, shaping tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop orchard is far more than backdrop—it’s a living archive that breathes, blooms with human presence, and pulses with ancient memory. The wax cylinder, phonograph, and gnarled apple tree function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices: Voss must return to the exact recording, in the exact garden, to decode the prophecy. Sensory detail is selective (sap-sticky faces, velvet disquiet, bruise-purple twilight) and filtered through Voss’s archivist sensibility. The skyscraper’s candle-like glow in the finale directly mirrors his heartbeat, binding environment to internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound atrium isn’t backdrop but active constraint: cold seeps into the soul, ice receives seeds and acorn cap, melting mid-air droplets crystallize consequence. The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting—its spirals glow, vibrate, and channel the vortex. Starlight through shattered-glass sky mirrors Lirael’s “wild serenity,” charging the final image where environment and emotion fuse without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.3)
    The windblown sanctuary above the clouds isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: thick air muffles sound, demanding rope-switching; cloud behavior responds to acoustic frequencies. The bell rope functions as micro-setting, constraining choice through its dual mechanisms. Final image charges the rope’s texture (“rough but familiar”) as symbol of earned harmony. Sensory detail is selective (sound over sight), filtered through Lira’s professional attention, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The plateau, domes, and aurora are vividly rendered with tactile specificity (obsidian shards, bones, flickering screens), and the yellow lantern functions as micro-setting—it constrains Zara’s perception and charges the final image when stardust glimmers within it. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Zara notices light, silence, heat, not irrelevant mechanics. The station isn’t just backdrop; its decay mirrors institutional irrelevance, making her spiritual role necessary. Minor deduction: “velvet expanse” borders on cliché, but is redeemed by immediate concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scorched wasteland and skeletal hives establish atmosphere with vivid, selective detail (“cracked earth baking,” “honeycombs dried to brittle yellow”). The stone hut and stained glass box function as micro-settings that constrain action—Elias returns to the table daily, and the box’s glow triggers the climax. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond mood; the oasis is static backdrop rather than dynamic constraint. Final image of shards scattering charges closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate partially but not fully due to lack of tactical influence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.3)
    The emerald silo functions as a micro-setting that constrains and enables: its rusted hatch, cobwebs, and damaged capsule force Elias into tactile discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the metallic tang, dust, mercury’s defiance of gravity—all filtered through his banker-turned-timekeeper perception. The final image of stars pricking the sky recharges the twilight opening, closing the atmospheric arc. Every environmental detail serves the theme or action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt lagoon is not backdrop but active participant: its post-rain stillness, warming depths, and reflective surface directly shape Lira’s actions and the feather’s luminosity. The moss-stained rock, tangled kelp, and broken shell are handled with purposeful specificity, never ornamental. Crucially, the setting constrains the ending—the tapestry dissolves *into the lagoon*, making environment inseparable from theme. Sensory detail is filtered through Lira’s poetic attention without tourist detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The temple orchard functions as micro-setting: living pillars constrain tactics (Lira must weave, not tear), and copper wire’s conductivity charges the final image. Sensory details are selective (gold-dappled light, earth-smudged hands) and evolve causally (pillars lean closer post-wrapping). The setting’s rules—spirits speak through growth, humans through angles—are learned through action, not exposition, and directly shape the remodel’s methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rainwashed tower, ivy-swallowed sculptures, and spring drizzle aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the path guides Lirael’s ascent, the kneeling figure halts her, and the amber’s glow responds to stone. Sensory detail is selective (bronze quiet, iridescent wings) and filtered through Lirael’s academic gaze. The setting culminates in the final image—the unchanged tower now charged with new meaning—proving environment shapes thematic resonance. Every object serves pressure or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice: its liminal salt-freshwater collision makes it “precisely” chosen for struggle. Sand, shell fragments, twilight hues, and storm clouds evolve causally with the coachman’s actions. Final image—petals “flickering like tiny flames” against rising wind—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Sensory detail (salt, decay, crunching shells) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action, avoiding white-room syndrome or static description.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scrapyard setting is vividly rendered through tactile details—rusted harvester, corrugated iron shack, engine-block playgrounds—and directly enables the plot (cylinders found in library ruins). The autumn leaf in wax functions as micro-setting, constraining interpretation and charging the final image. However, the “cracked wasteland” remains atmospheric rather than tactical; fissures are mentioned but never impede movement or choice. Sensory hierarchy favors smell and touch appropriately for a bloodhound POV.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains perception and choice—stars warp, time stretches, silence hums. The gilded compass rose isn’t backdrop; it vibrates, spins, warms, and ultimately guides Elio’s path. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: frosted glass, meteorite ink, golden light—all filtered through Elio’s astronomer-trained attention. The setting charges the final image: the door’s light echoes the compass’s warmth, tying environment to epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound spire functions as both setting and micro-setting: its slick ledges, bioluminescent chamber, and humming machinery directly constrain Kael’s movement and tactics. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—ozone, moss, cracking ice—filtered through his alchemical POV. The pocket sundial and chessboard aren’t just described; they’re handled, swapped, and charged with meaning. However, while the spire pressures choices, it doesn’t actively *alter* them mid-beat beyond initial access—missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on a pivotal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    The whispering gallery isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Elara: amplifying steps, shifting exhibits, silencing when the king falls. The chessboard functions as micro-setting: its missing pawns constrain interpretation, its glow signals aliveness, and its reconfiguration charges the climax. Spatial choreography is precise (pedestal, pacing, approach), and sensory detail (cold air, fogged breath, stone whispers) serves urgency. Final image ties setting to theme: the board under her arm embodies the nomadic penumbra made portable.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The labyrinthine bookstore functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its shelves constrain Lirael’s movement, its titles reflect thematic concerns, and its dissolution/reappearance marks the climax. The mountain, crystalline cavern, and bioluminescent fungi aren’t backdrop—they enable the final act (freezing stones, transforming them into feathers). Crucially, the setting charges the closure: the mountain’s peak glowing silver echoes Lirael’s mercury skin, tying environment to identity. Every sensory detail serves pressure or theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The time-frozen village functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: cobblestone labyrinth, frayed tapestry, and muted colors constrain Alaric’s choices (decoding threads, following platinum lines). Sensory detail is selective—dust, gleaming platinum, pulsing threads—and filtered through his guilt-ridden perception. The setting evolves causally: tapestry unravels as he winnows, labyrinth dissolves post-forgiveness. Only minor deduction: thunder’s role feels atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bone towers, waterfall studio, and pale spire aren’t just backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice: Kael climbs the tower to paint, the echoes distort his voice into resistance, and the spire’s refraction enables the climax. Sensory detail is purposeful (“damp stone and iron,” “glowing faintly”) and filtered through Kael’s artist POV. Crucially, the setting directly charges the final image: light scattering across bone towers makes the thematic shift visible. This environment is irreplaceable—swap any element and the story collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The acid sea, copper hull, and whirring gears aren’t backdrop—they pressure every choice. The workshop functions as micro-setting: its instability forces urgency; its dissolution mirrors Lira’s psyche. The charm and statue constrain action physically and symbolically. Final image—statue glowing amid stilled gears—is charged by environment, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal cave functions as micro-setting that actively shapes choice: its narrowing tunnels force physical submission, its pool enables vision, and its shell-lined edge contextualizes Elias’s offering. Light, brine, limestone, and pebbles are filtered through his painterly perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. The shaft of sunlight doesn’t just illuminate—it charges the final image, making the environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: its salt-streaked tower, spiral stairs, and lantern room shape every action. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—damp stone, oil, lavender-moonflower perfume—and evolves with the hum, rain, and glowing cork. The eastern wall garden isn’t backdrop; it’s a tactile resource that validates Elara’s method. Final image (glowing cork against rain) reweights the entire setting as a vessel for quiet resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The censer foot functions as micro-setting: its fluctuating weight constrains Mara’s actions (timing builds to moon phases) and charges the final image (spinning bronze at noon). Sensory detail is selective and urgent—burning insulation during soldering, salt-dulled patina, static-prickling skin—filtered through a navigator’s professional attention. The starlit station isn’t backdrop; its rusted antennae and failed hydraulics supply both obstacle and scrap for the antenna. Final glow reweights every prior tactile reference.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ravine orchard functions as micro-setting: its storms pressure Mara’s timeline, its truffles are literal currency for safety, and its isolation enables secrecy. The glass eye—a recurring object—constrains choice (used sparingly) and charges the final image (“we occlude… with truth”). Weather affects action (hurrying before rain), and tactile details (damp soil, milky glass) filter through Mara’s professional attention. However, the orchard’s “chandelier” metaphor isn’t leveraged in closure, missing a 9+ beat.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal dock, mist, and bruise-purple sky aren’t backdrop but active micro-setting: the mist parts to reveal the woman, the rusted hatch hides truth, and the lantern’s fraying halo mirrors Elias’s fragile grasp on memory. Sensory detail is selective—salt-slick planks, brine-thick air—and filtered through Elias’s keeper’s attention. Crucially, the setting constrains the final image: dawn light recharges the dock’s “opal” glow, transforming the Edelweiss from symbol of loss to hope. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains precise throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every key beat: bioluminescent fungi guide descent, obsidian pedestal centers revelation, and the creek’s rise tightens urgency. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (emerald shards, wet stone scent), never touristy. The final image—ants leading home—reweights the setting as internal compass. Deduction: “blooming cavern at midsummer” is poetic but underutilized; its seasonal specificity doesn’t alter tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ember grotto functions as micro-setting: its slick stones dictate climbing tactics, its bleeding walls constrain emotional exposure, and its “wound-like” entrance charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (focus on condensation, gravel sparks), while cobalt mist and bruise-like sky filter perception through the queen’s psyche. Crucially, the environment directly enables the climax—the starlight pool forces confrontation—and the descent’s reversal gains weight from spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ember nexus isn’t backdrop—it’s an active micro-setting: its fading embers raise stakes, its fissures chill the air, and its cobblestone cracks literally channel light that Elara manipulates. The sun engine and nautilus shell function as tool and object-as-setting, constraining choices (e.g., alignment dictates success). Sensory detail is selective (crunching lava shards, iridescent shell) and filtered through Elara’s alchemical priorities. Final image charges the nexus with renewed warmth, proving environment shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain ranger cabin, snow-buried grave, and icy crevice function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the cabin shelters but isolates, the grave triggers action, the crevice forces physical contortion to reach truth. Sensory detail (pine resin, crunching snow, slick ice) is filtered through Elias’s jaded wonder and heightens pressure. Final image charges the setting: moonlight on a blank scroll becomes a site of rebirth. Deducted slightly for not fully exploiting weather as tactical constraint during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The water clock shop functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: algae-clogged gears demand cleaning, fog limits visibility and mirrors Lira’s perception, and tools like the clamp screw carry narrative weight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “trembling calm,” “golden haze” through mist). The birthing clamp screw and water clock jointly charge the final image—their curves compared, their tension released. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating platform isn’t backdrop—it’s a micro-setting that constrains choice (no retreat, only forward motion) and charges closure (steps descend into forest path). The crow quill, scars, and mist function as embodied setting, each altering tactics: quill carves runes, scars itch as failure-map, mist parts only after transformation. Sensory detail is selective (liquid starlight ink, moss-choked forest) and filtered through Kael’s anxious perception. Final image—quill pressing against hip—recharges opening description with earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sheet music archive functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its dust, silence, and physical scores enable the ritual. The perfume bottle (tool-as-setting) and the piano (environmental object) directly shape tactics. Outside, the orchard’s hush-to-roar transition charges the final image.

Sensory hierarchy reflects Clara’s academic bias (damp paper, ozone) while narrowing under stress to floorboards and flame. Environment isn’t backdrop but active crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subway utility tunnel functions as a charged micro-setting: damp earth, flickering bulbs, and rusted pipes shape Mara’s sensory world and constrain her tools (the booth, the disc). Crucially, the glass harmonica—a recurring object-as-setting—constrains choice (she spins it to guide calls) and charges the final image (its lullaby “for the lost”). Sensory detail is selective (copper smell, static hum) and filtered through Mara’s professional familiarity, avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: its transformed flora (nightshade/moonflowers) mirrors the covenant’s altered state, and its planks host every key action. Sensory details (salt/jasmine, glowing petals) are filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The locket’s placement in the driftwood post ties object to place, and the final image of closing flowers reweights the setting as sacred space. Environment directly shapes the covenant’s survival logic.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ivy-choked station isn’t backdrop—it breathes, shivers, and absorbs sorrow, directly enabling the ghost’s manifestation. The moon rock’s glow interacts with the environment (“jagged shadows that danced like dervishes”), and the mural of the dissolving train foreshadows the climax. Sensory detail is selective (damp air, squelching mud) and filtered through Elias’s logistical pragmatism—he notices structural decay, not poetic ruin. Crucially, the setting constrains the final image: the lighter ivy reflects Elias’s internal shift, charging closure with environmental reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    The ultrasonic forest isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource. Bioluminescent moss guides, inverted river reflects inner workings, silt hides the map.

The platinum ring and constellations function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image. No wasted description; all serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gravitational anomaly isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice (stones hanging, leaves spiraling) and evolves causally (shudders when Lira touches the pen, stabilizes after Elias’s epiphany). The pen-as-micro-setting constrains action: its cold nib signals failure, warm nib signals integration. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (prismatic shards prickling skin, humming frequency aching teeth), never touristy. Final image of smoke from the chimney gains weight because the anomaly’s “strange comfort” has charged the ordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor functions as micro-setting: its liquid silver waves, creaking ropes, and moonlit docks directly supply the “unspoken melodies” Kael maps, constraining his method and charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Kael notices rhythm, not color; Lira hears pitch, not wind. The camera’s worn leather and cold metal are tactile anchors that evolve from prop to symbol. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond providing raw material; it enables rather than obstructs, missing the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lost civilization archive functions as a living micro-setting: its humming air, shivering walls, and chamber of self-portraits directly constrain and respond to Mara’s actions. The obsidian-nightshade ink, tapestry fragment, and charred canvas are tools that charge the final image—the tear healing the portrait only works because the setting is sentient garden, not tomb. Sensory detail is selective (soot, hum, calloused hands) and filtered through Mara’s librarian lineage. Environment actively participates in closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sound wave garden functions as a dynamic micro-setting: plants respond to vibration, the lagoon shifts with memory, and the tree branch enables perspective. These elements constrain and enable action—Eli drums on them, climbs them, dips into them. The final image of the garden singing ties setting directly to closure. Every detail serves atmosphere and stakes without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shipping container labyrinth isn’t backdrop—it’s an active antagonist that groans, shifts, and judges walks. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: ozone taste, vibrating metal, clinking coin—all filtered through Elias’s maintenance-worker POV. The zodiac symbol on Container 17-X directly enables progression, and the storm’s lightning illuminates the Libra sign at the precise moment of choice. Final image charges the setting: dawn light on the coin mirrors stars, binding environment to theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt dock after rain isn’t backdrop but active collaborator—the wet planks mute footsteps, the bruised sky doubles in water, and the boarded warehouse’s blue slats become prisms. Setting directly enables the central action: without rain-slick surfaces and fractured shutters, Lira’s light-weaving fails. The dental mirror and dock function as micro-settings that constrain and charge every move. Final image of lingering patterns proves environment shapes meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.4)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto aren’t backdrop but active constraint: iron filings shimmer only under moonlight, magnetite pieces tremble with intent, and the grotto’s amplification of silence enables the core dynamic. These details charge the final image—the glowing window displays shifting “like stars”—tying setting directly to thematic closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Clara’s attunement: she notices dust sighs, wood creaks, zipper hums, filtering the world through her empathic sensitivity. Every spatial cue (moss-dusted stone, spiral staircase) grounds choreography without white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: its liminality pressures Lira’s choice, and kelp/bioluminescence ground the mythic turn. The scrimshaw—cold, then warm, etched with “Detach”—constrains her final act and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (salt-blood air, moonlit whale eyes), filtered through dock-worker perception. Only minor deduction: the island’s “jagged, gray rock” lacks distinctive texture beyond archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The wind turbines function as both macro-setting and micro-setting—they supply the wood Lirael carves and cast shadows that “swallow sunlight,” directly constraining her world and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (creaking farmhouse, turbine hum, grit of sandpaper) and filtered through Lirael’s numb perception. The sunflower bouquet’s decay mirrors internal erosion. Only slight over-reliance on visual metaphor (“sky into fractured shards”) prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)

The shard and visor act as environmental extensions that constrain choices—e.g., platform quicksand effect, portal alignment. Final gleaming alloy contrasts past decay, charging closure. Sensory detail (ozone, dust motes) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lantern room functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges choices: its salt-streaked walls hide the note, its eastern window frames the ritual, and its haunted air mirrors Elias’s burden. Sensory detail (iron-brine taste, rattling windows) is filtered through his professional familiarity, never touristy. The sea glass and stacked stones evolve from props to conduits of meaning, directly shaping the final image. Every atmospheric cue serves the theme of fragile continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern, and storm-charged balcony aren’t backdrop—they constrain every action. The lantern’s wick mechanics dictate prophecy access; the cliff-edge spatial choreography forces risk (“stepped to the edge”); ocean roars mirror internal stakes. Sensory detail is selective (wind tugging cloak, flame hissing) and POV-filtered through the Herald’s ritualistic focus. The setting charges the final image: lighthouse light cutting dark = her earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock tea house isn’t backdrop—it’s a stage that elevates Lin above mist, enabling her sun-tracking vantage. Obsidian stones, valley mist, and sunlight actively shape perception and action. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting: its physical properties (iridescence, fragility) constrain Lin’s choices and charge the climax. Final image ties setting to theme—mist burns away as clarity emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stormlit tower isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: moonlight heals Elias’s wound, roots guide him, stone absorbs sorrow. Every sensory detail (damp walls, spiderweb glass, silver glow) filters through Elias’s professional attention, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The sextant and tree roots function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image—roots “glowing softly” reconfigure memory as living architecture. Weather, light, and texture evolve causally with Elias’s actions, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: mica windows constrain choice (only they “breathe in static of forgotten dreams”) and charge closure (glowing “like tiny suns”). Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira’s urgency—tactile (soil-streaked hands) dominates over visual in climax. World rules consistent: light erases memory in twin realm, shadows preserve it here. Recurring objects (lantern, runes) evolve causally—lantern’s “fragile rebellion” becomes beacon.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    The library setting functions as both macro- and micro-setting: dust-veiled shelves, disguised doors, and candlelit chambers create immersive texture, while the Third Shelf itself constrains the climax—it must be unlocked, revealing the letters. Mirrors in the chamber charge the turning point by reflecting alternate selves, directly shaping Eleanor’s emotional shift. Every detail serves atmosphere or choice; no white-room syndrome. The “enlarged tranquility” of the closing image is rooted in this lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    The overgrown palace courtyard functions as a dynamic micro-setting that constrains and enables choice: its decay invites Elias’s search, its rich soil permits planting, and its liminality allows the tea house to exist as a threshold space. Sensory detail (damp earth, jasmine, moss-speckled floorboards) is filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias, avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the setting charges the closure—the saplings tunneling into forgotten foundations mirror Elias’s own rooting in loss—and evolves causally from weeds to thriving garden. The tea house’s humming walls tie environment directly to thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly specific and functions as micro-setting: frost-laden panes, sagging shelves, and ice prism directly constrain choice (light refraction requires cold). The lantern, slides, and spectral illusions are tactile and integrated into action. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—dawn’s warmth stabilizes illusions, tying environment to thematic closure. Sensory detail (quartz hush, howling wind) reflects urgency without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pirate market isn’t backdrop—it’s crucible. Barnacled pilings, opium stench, and frozen clock tower constrain movement and signal decay, directly shaping Lira’s tactics (eavesdropping under planks, racing spiral stairs). The watch fob functions as micro-setting: its weight tips the scale, its anchor smashes the device, its cracked face charges the dawn image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (brine over silk, mildew over fear), never decorative. Only misses 9+ because the pier’s rot doesn’t actively hinder her escape.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    The lavender bluff isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: Kael kneels *because* the compass points there, and the soil’s taste shifts force physical recoil. The aurora fractures in response to the election, altering light and perception. Crucially, the setting charges closure: the stillness post-election and lingering lavender scent reframe the entire premise. Sensory detail is selective (taste over sight during climax) and POV-filtered through Kael’s analytical yet poetic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.3)
    The subterranean crystal cave is far more than backdrop—it actively shapes perception, refracting light to enable the canvas-shadow door, its “leaning” crystals functioning as silent witnesses that charge Elias’s act. The lantern’s fractured rainbows, cold moss under knees, and jagged walls are filtered through Elias’s artist POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the setting constrains and enables: without prismatic refraction, the method fails; without damp stone and silence, the internal confrontation lacks gravity. The cave earns its 9+ by directly enabling the climax’s mechanics and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse city isn’t backdrop but active constraint: toxic sky dictates vertical sectors, carnivorous flora demands nectar bribes, and sickly green light shapes perception. The gilded-leaf quill and glass orbs function as micro-settings that directly enable or disable action (e.g., detecting lies). Final image—quill unfurling as Elara ascends—charges the setting with renewed purpose, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining tactics and reweighting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    The “whispering bluff above the clouds” functions as micro-setting and crucible: its altitude, mist, and stones directly enable Elara’s work and shape her isolation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—bronze curves, Arctic blue ice, prismatic shadows—all filtered through her artisan’s attention. Crucially, the setting constrains choice (only here can silence speak) and charges the final image: the bluff remains “a testament to the symphonies of truth.” No white-room syndrome; every detail serves atmosphere, character, or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass dome, solar panels, and desert roses aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. The farm’s artificiality mirrors Clara-7’s constructed self, and the magnetic storm directly destabilizes both. The box’s bioluminescent threads and petal-shaped panels fuse setting with character. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: roses bloom brighter post-burn, proving the setting isn’t static but responsive, co-evolving with Clara-7’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting: cobblestones hold the locket, dawn light establishes rhythm, and spatial choreography (gate → mailbox → neighbors) remains coherent. Sensory detail (“damp earth and old paper”) filters through Clara’s curatorial POV. The setting constrains early action (sweeping reveals locket) and charges the final image (mailbox opened in same courtyard). However, it doesn’t actively shape tactics beyond initial discovery—hence just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken lab isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint: water drips, kelp entangles, rust degrades, light slices. The dice, journal, and vial are micro-settings that directly enable or complicate choices. Final image charges closure: kelp and rust guard secrets “by dancers long gone,” tying environment to legacy. Sensory detail is selective (fogged visor, clinking dice, glowing vial) and filtered through Kael’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The salt crystal chamber functions as both setting and micro-setting: its luminous clusters guide discovery, its shifting gravity constrains movement, and its silence charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—crunching boots, cool walls, humming air—and filtered through Elias’s ritualistic attention. The environment directly enables the climax (hidden panel behind crystals) and reconfigures meaning at closure: salt becomes archive, not mineral. Every atmospheric cue tightens thematic resonance without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the brook, moss, fireflies, and paper crane constrain and charge every key action. The crane’s wing dissolving into water directly enables closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective (coolness of water, firefly embers) and filtered through the summoner’s cosmic-earth duality. Environment evolves causally—ripples still, fireflies pause—and returns to murmur only after resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rooftop garden, wisteria, cracked pavers, and meteor shower aren’t backdrop—they pressure choices (secrecy, timing) and charge the climax. The seal functions as micro-setting: its engravings shift, glow, and unlock the dome. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (moonlight on brass, hum in the air), filtered through Elias’s tactile profession. The dome’s fractured starlight and vibrating floor directly enable and intensify the final ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    The velvet garden functions as micro-setting: its thorns, petals, and ink-like shadows mirror Lirael’s internal state and directly enable her ritual (soil for shell placement, twilight for liminal access). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she notices texture, sound, decay—not tourist cataloging. The garden’s transformation (color shedding, ash remains) charges the final image. Only minor deduction: “lavender soap” flashback briefly detaches from present spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    The marble sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables: cold stone numbs Lirael’s joints, moss-veined floor absorbs time-drips, aurora light sanctifies her craft. The heritage rose thorn functions as micro-setting: its barb gleams, it remembers wounds, it draws blood to seal truth into forgery. Final image is charged by setting—the niche in the wall is “known only to those who sought redemption,” making geography an agent of closure. Sensory detail is selective (chill of millennia, iron taste of regret) and filtered through Lirael’s purpose, never touristy.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.3)
    The serpentine nexus functions as both macro- and micro-setting: stone coils like a serpent, wind carries whispers, fissures scar the rock—all constrain Kael’s movement and perception. Crucially, the environment charges the closure: the standing stones glow in response to the shell, and the canyon “sings back,” transforming setting from backdrop to active participant. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael’s focus—hearing over sight—and details are filtered through his perceptive bias. The shell itself becomes micro-setting, its hum evolving with narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glacier shrine functions as micro-setting: its ice hums approval, candles burn as “borrowed starlight,” and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. Sensory detail is selective (flickering shadows, warped glass, scent of saltwater) and filtered through Kael’s professional sensitivity. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the ice wall is both barrier and conduit—and charges the final image when embers flare as a “beacon for ghosts.” No white-room syndrome; every detail serves atmosphere or action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the whispering parapet, rain-damp stone, and mist-laced harbor aren’t backdrop but active constraints—slick battlements shape Kael’s cautious movement, harbor lights frame his meditation, and the cliff’s edge forces physical vulnerability. The bamboo whisk and fireflies are tactile extensions of environment. Final image (fireflies at dawn) charges the setting with thematic weight. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael’s net-mender focus: touch (netting, stone), sound (whistles, whispers), then light.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    The wasteland orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource: its anomalous fertility signals the stillpoint, guides Mara’s investigation, and justifies the final sacrifice. Sensory detail (“rust-colored dust storms,” “radioactive grit”) filters through Mara’s professional gaze, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The setting charges the closure: post-sealing, “air felt cleaner,” proving environmental stakes were real. The diamond-as-tool and soil markings further integrate micro-setting into causal mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt glass portico functions as micro-setting and recurring object that constrains and charges every key beat: it frames the storm, refracts light to activate the hourglass, and becomes a “threshold” in the climax. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven—Kael feels thunder vibrations through the glass, and lightning illuminates the city like a “circuit board gone feral.” The observatory’s antiquities chamber directly enables the final turn, making environment inseparable from agency.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The feral loft functions as micro-setting: warped floorboards admit sand, rusted cot frames isolation, porcelain sink implies prior habitation—all grounding Elias’s ritual. Sensory specificity (salt, crunching sand, mother-of-pearl glimmer) filters through his poetic perception. Final image charges the loft as sacred space where past/present converge. However, the dunes remain backdrop rather than active constraint; setting enables but doesn’t pressure key choices.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures tactics: ice creaks as warning, frozen planks dictate movement, mist obscures threats. The lighthouse beam and sunset clock constrain action. Crucially, the resonator—a micro-setting—constrains every choice and charges the final image: slung lighter, it embodies transformed understanding. Sensory detail (fogged breath, lavender-tangerine bleed) filters through Elias’s urgent focus, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.3)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and viaduct aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. Ice thickness dictates lunar refraction; basalt absorbs sound, amplifying breath and hum; viaduct vibrations guide Kael’s touch. The setting evolves: ice thaws in spring but the hum remains, proving its transformation. Final image (“horizon wider”) ties spatial expansion to inner change. All sensory detail serves pressure or perception—no white-room syndrome or generic frost clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: slick walls hinder movement, stagnant puddles mark decay, and spatial choreography (ladder descent → far-end compartment) guides discovery. The lantern functions as micro-setting, its flame constraining perception (casting writhing shadows) and charging the final image (blazing as she rejects entanglement). Sensory details (mildew, brass etching, gunshot echo) are selective, urgent, and filtered through Mara’s professional bias. Weather (post-drought water pressure) directly enables the central crime.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The repair shop functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its tools, clutter, and atmosphere directly enable the thematic pivot. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Marcus notices oil and aged wood because they mirror penitentiary austerity and ritual. Weather evolves causally (storm arrives as realization dawns), charging the final exit. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *force* a tactical choice beyond providing the heart; it supports but doesn’t drive action, capping 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. The acid sea eats tools, forcing urgency; the workshop’s gears provide rhythm and material; the sulfurous winds enable flight. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: the bell rises from the corrosive sea, its hollow mouth awaiting yearning made sound. Every sensory detail (rust-tasting air, clacking gears) filters through Lira’s obsessed POV, never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The social network archive functions as micro-setting: cold light, humming servers, holographic interface—all constrain Lira’s actions (digging through obsolete code, evading detection). The patch and recurring numbers charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (fabric rough beneath fingertips, red drone lights) and filtered through Lira’s urgency. However, the derelict station remains off-page; had it appeared even in a map overlay, Q3 could reach 9+. The spiral galaxy insignia ties setting to symbol without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse orchard constrains every choice: ice floes groan beneath the foundation, frost-laden branches shape movement, and vintage mirrors in the attic enable the empathy ritual. Final image—Elara’s shadow stretching across snow as aurora approves—charges the setting with thematic weight. Sensory detail is selective (crunching boots, cold stone) and filtered through Elara’s aurora-touched perception, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop but active constraint—its skeletal docks, blurring frost, and groaning ice shape every move, from numbing boots to the boat’s entrapment. Crucially, the parasol tip (micro-setting) enables the rescue, charging the final image where it rests in her lap as peace returns. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (cold pain, keening sound), then widens in the calm aftermath. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography stays coherent throughout the haul.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber pavilion, autumn vines, and bruised sky are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s sentinel perspective.

The burned letter functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when Lila pockets it.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    The whisperfield, pavilion, and kinetic parapet aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable action. The parapet rearranges only for the worthy; the pavilion’s hum guides urgency; the dunes erase footprints, reinforcing transience. These elements charge the final image: the parapet stands sentinel, the clearings glow faintly, the lattice hums contentedly. Every sensory detail serves the Accumulative lens and thematic resonance without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lavender field and rusted factory function as a charged micro-setting that constrains Lila’s perception and artistic method. Sensory detail (scent, color, texture) is selective and POV-filtered, evolving with time of day and vine growth. The dove-gray map case and feather integrate tactilely into setting-as-tool. Final image reweights the ruin as collaborator, not corpse—fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library is vividly rendered through selective, character-filtered detail (dust motes, ink scent, cracked leather), functioning as both setting and micro-setting. It constrains choice by offering only quiet observation as a method and charges the final image via the crystal’s recurring light-play. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t actively alter tactics beyond providing solitude; its role is more reflective than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fog sculpture garden functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: fog muffles, metal hums, driftwood guides. Every sensory detail serves Elias’s quest—the gravel “once part of someone’s demolished life,” the “static hum of the present”—filtering environment through his precognitive longing. The chalk and rebar angel charge the final image, with the garden itself acting as archive and altar. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the mist.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lunar observatory isn’t backdrop but active crucible: its altitude enables the rift, its brass instruments supply tools, and its cracking dome mirrors Elias’s crumbling control. The telescope, ear trumpet, and spinning clock hand are micro-settings that constrain tactics—e.g., he must use period-appropriate parts to interface with the anomaly. Sensory detail (ozone, pine, whine harmonizing with brass) is selective and urgency-driven. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: leaping from a mountaintop observatory into a golden portal reweights every prior description of height, glass, and cloud.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” functions as micro-setting—windows frame sky as solace, light tracks time, and spatial choreography (Mira by window, Clara bedside) remains clear. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s priorities: sound over sight, scent as emotional barometer. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices; it atmospherically supports but doesn’t pressure tactics. Misses 9-band by lacking causal environmental influence on the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating isle, brass telescopes, and constellation-etched floors aren’t backdrop—they enable the plot: only here does the veil thin enough for runes to react. The automaton key and shifting shadows function as micro-settings that constrain choice (e.g., timing insertion to the Weeping Archer alignment). Sensory detail is selective (mirror-polished gears, humming air) and filtered through Lirael’s scholarly focus. The final image—shadows pooling beneath the isle—is charged by every prior atmospheric cue.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hedge maze and crumbling fountain aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the maze’s disorientation mirrors cognitive uncertainty, while the fountain’s moss-choked basin demands physical intervention. The changeling’s tooth—a micro-setting—charges the climax when paired with Elias’s. Sensory detail (honeysuckle hum, thorn-pricked fingers) filters through Mara’s skeptical yet tactile POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The garden’s shift from trickster to mirror culminates in spatial clarity on the return path, proving setting shapes resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto functions as micro-setting: its mist, reflective walls, and black pool directly enable and constrain Elara’s work (e.g., mist refracting light, pool reflecting galaxies).

Sensory hierarchy (ozone-jasmine zephyr, slick lichen) serves POV urgency without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes choices: servers anchor memory, icicle drips dictate spatial art, bioluminescent moss provides light for intimacy. The setting evolves causally (snow outside vs. heat within; thawing icicles creating patterns). Crucially, the environment charges the final image: the sapling planted among rusted racks embodies the theme. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Lila’s grief-honed attention.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The feral nexus is rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail (mist curling like kelp, cold-fire lantern, shifting sand-ground) that reflects Clara’s psychological state without overt symbolism. The seashell functions as micro-setting: its warmth, ridges, and spiral directly constrain Clara’s choices (she follows its pull, deletes the chapter because of its lesson). Spatial choreography remains coherent despite surreal elements. However, while the setting charges the final image, it doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice beyond mood—hence just shy of 9.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The verdant arbor functions as micro-setting: moonlight slants “like liquid gold,” dry streams gurgle post-melody, and luminous mushrooms bloom where threads touch soil—all constraining and reflecting Lira’s success. Spatial choreography (treehouse → highest branch → gathered creatures) remains coherent. Sensory detail (honey-and-stone air, spider-silk lyre) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the setting never actively impedes Lira’s goal—only responds—missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    The subarctic crater orchard functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: snow preserves stillness, dead trees supply materials, cold sharpens senses and slows time. Every sensory detail (frost-bitten lanterns, creaking branches, silent flurries) serves the dominant tone of “moving stillness” and reflects Elias’s internal state without overt symbolism. The setting culminates in the final image—Elias walking back through the same charged landscape—reinforcing closure. Environment directly shapes tactics (using only orchard detritus) and charges the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The marble cavern isn’t backdrop—it’s an active instrument whose acoustics and light dictate tactics.

No white-room syndrome; every detail filters through Clara’s haunted practicality.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The kinetic lagoon functions as both setting and micro-setting: its bruised violet waters constrain choice (Veyra scavenges only what it yields) and charge the final image (the rose matching its hue). Sensory detail is purposeful—electric gold froth, hissing winds—and filtered through Veyra’s scavenger priorities. The carousel’s skeletal presence shapes spatial choreography and emotional stakes. Crucially, the lagoon’s time-distorting physics directly enable the story’s conceptual core and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered (“domed roofs gathering dust,” “rusted luggage carousels”) and functions as micro-setting: its conduits, atrium crater, and shattered glass directly enable Lila’s repurposing. Moonlight and dust aren’t just atmosphere—they catalyze discovery and activation. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice enough to hit 9+; she faces no spatial or material obstacle that forces improvisation beyond what’s stated. Still, the environment charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the crystal forecourt constrains choice (Lira must enter to hear its voice) and charges closure (its fading song echoes in her renewed work). Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira’s priorities—oil/parchment vs. petrichor—and shifts under pressure (rain-soaked stone → humming quartz). Spatial choreography is precise (workshop → oak door → flagstones → archway), and the bear’s placement leverages the courtyard’s geometry. Final image ties light spilling through windows to internal rhythm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight barge canal functions as a micro-setting that charges atmosphere and subtly guides choice—the water’s stillness mirrors Elias’s focus, and the warehouse destination emerges from environmental cues. The sundial acts as a tactile tool that constrains perception and culminates in the final image. Descriptions are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered (e.g., “drowned coins” for the captain’s eyes). However, the canal doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor aren’t backdrop but active micro-settings: snow obscures then reveals the glass; fog muffles sound and softens reality, enabling the mystical encounter; the dock’s creak mirrors Elias’s aged patience. The fulgurite and rope function as object-settings that constrain and enable action. Final image charges the entire environment as “a temple to patience,” fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: patched walls signal fragility, humming systems echo “ghostly resolve,” and the ship’s shudder forces action. Kwan Yin’s Tear and the bioluminescent garden are micro-settings that constrain and reward: the locket demands shadow work, the garden validates courage. Final image charges closure—the garden’s singing leaves reframe peace as active reciprocity. Sensory detail (cold door, viscous shadows dissolving to light) is purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    The black sand beach and active volcano aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints: the grit underfoot, the hissing breath that syncs with Lira’s realization, the warmth signaling earth’s shift. The bugs’ light interacts with the environment to cast “jagged shadows,” and the final constellation map appears *in the sand*, tying setting to closure. Sensory detail is selective (hiss, velvet sky, charcoal grit) and filtered through Lira’s questing attention. The setting charges the final image: transformation is literally grounded in this place.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
