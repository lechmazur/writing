    Landscape and objects actively constrain choices: the frozen lake becomes a writable page, the viaduct’s hum sets the clock, the keystone focal point dictates the moment. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and filtered through craft (graphite, slate, polarity). The final image (compass spinning, blue sparks, reverse snowfall) is charged by those established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel is vivid and functional: iron rungs, alcove geography, darkness that the lantern actively counters. The environment and the lantern together shape perception and options, charging the final image. Details evolve with action (tallies discovered through touch; box behind a pipe) rather than static description. The setting’s metaphor (“throat”) skirts familiar but is contextually earned.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The repair shop is vivid and instrumental: tools, salvaged chronometer spring, loupes, and instruments create both atmosphere and enabling constraints. Weather and skylight modulate mood and prompt the storm-clouds line that reorients Olya’s hand. The final image—music spilling onto the street—charges the setting with thematic weight. Slightly more constraint from the environment on tactics would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Worldbuilding is vivid and functional: acid sea, rusted buoy, canvas wings, and the workshop all constrain choices and shape tactics.
