  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "air so cold it rang," "sky became a blade of starlight," "schist still warm from yesterday's sun," and frost patterns that function as both atmosphere and a method the protagonist reads. The hollow with its "imploded campfire ringed by bootprints pointing outward like rays of a black sun" constrains her understanding and charges the decision to wait. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (canyon walls narrow, opens into hollow, protagonist emerges onto desert flats), and the glass beads dropped into cracks create a micro-setting that matters at the turn when she collects them. The lone bus at the end is under-anchored spatially and reads slightly convenient, preventing entry into the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conservatory's frosted dome, shattered glass, and thermal scanner constrain Mara's method throughout. Spatial choreography is clean (service door, center stage, benches). The heat-map's color palette and the melting frost charge the closure image directly. The "diamond dust of shattered glass" and "frost-laced dome" are vivid and purposeful. Minor slip: the city's snow and seeds waiting for spring feel ornamental rather than constraining a present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail (barnacled marble boulevards, swollen volumes, brass octopus catalog with moon-phase dials, coral circulation desk). Sensory selection is strong and POV-filtered through the undertaker's mortuary lens (glass "fogged like the eyes of the many dead," shelves "aligned like processional candles"). The setting constrains the protagonist's choice—he must use the lens shard to navigate, tear pages to amplify the signal, and the octopus physically tethers him, forcing tenure. Spatial choreography is mostly coherent, though the mechanics of "underwater conflagration" and breathing/movement logistics are left vague, reducing plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor returns across three beats, its cracked dome and incomplete pebble spiral constraining Mara's exodus decision. Midnight, the valley lights, and the ridge anchor time and space early. The cart's false bottom and the rail spur donation site supply tactical resources. Wild sage rising "like unbanned prayer" charges the final image with sensory and conceptual weight, linking setting to theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct's wisteria and fog supply vivid sensory anchors ("each breath she took tasted purple"), and the camera obscura functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains the interaction (projecting the inverted gorge, hosting the man's silhouette, revealing the wisteria door). Spatial choreography remains coherent through the ritual sequence. The orchard in the final third offers a purposeful shift in environment tied to the stakes, though its fruit-as-moment metaphor leans ornamental. The setting's return to the viaduct and the final image of the protagonist walking on, "no longer searching but distributing," charges the closing beat with the world's response to her action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The living bridge garden is konkret and purposeful: the oldest arch pulses with sap, the hawthorn keystone pinches sap flow like an hourglass, moss underfoot. The hyperbolic maze layout directly constrains her descent into earlier hours, and the bridge's disintegration (planks curling like burning film) charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wet leaves, chalk smell, funeral lilies). The garden itself functions as both setting and antagonist, its geometry forcing the protagonist's final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked mirrors, buckled doors, netting that traps guards, the Tilt-A-Whirl hatch concealing the vault. Sensory detail is selective and advances action (cellophane flashing, dust rolling, "dry breath of earth"). The piano bench and operator booth constrain tactics and enable the protagonist's solution. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (redemption center, booth) charges the final image when she scatters seeds "with the same reverence a child saves a single ticket."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sunken orchard in shipwreck hulls, forge built from ships' ribs, and roots through portholes create vivid, specific setting that constrains Mara's choices (she must approach the forge, feed it absence). Sensory detail—salt-caked slate, lavender coals, aurora bleeding—is filtered through her device, anchoring POV perception. The forge functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Environment evolves causally: coals breathe, petals chime like bells after her admission. Setting detail is purposeful and tied to stakes without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The emerald station anchors place, and moonlight/golden hour frame time, but spatial choreography is diffuse: the bench, flower stall, and tiles float without clear relative positions. Sensory detail tilts heavily visual ("pale light unfurl," "wet asphalt," "spilled mercury") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding. The jar of moonbeams and the wedding ring function as micro-setting objects; the ring's inscription (coordinates, date, platform) constrains the thief's realization and charges the ending. The flower-code cipher appears once without affecting a choice. Setting supports atmosphere but does not pressure tactics until the ring's reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The control room's sensory particulars—drip-lines, rusted panels, defunct thermometer, magnetic tape, cardamom scent—are filtered through Mara's glassblowing POV and constrain her choices: she harvests mercury, uses tape for seams, burns a chair for fuel. The thawing environment mirrors and tensions her internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clear (consoles, iron struts, main console, roof cornice). The bookmark becomes micro-setting when positioned between struts to guide molten glass curvature. The final image of silver puddles reflecting a sky "finally free of winter's clamp" charges the closure without generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library under stars is vivid and purposeful: iron shelves, skylight clogged with constellations, drainage alcove with film cans stacked like vertebrae. Micro-setting detail (the projector's feed reel, perforated roof) directly enables the climactic outwitting. Sensory hierarchy reflects Leo's profession (industry speak, stunt-beat counting, "camera-smoke"). The child's cast functions as a constrained object that supplies the decryption clue. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the setting's decay mirrors the tyrant's obsolescence and Leo's fear of being "retired."

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort is vividly rendered with salt-slick stone, crenels, and echoing stairwells; sensory details (taste of iron, cold seeping through stone) are filtered through the oracle's priorities and constrain her physical positioning. The fort's groaning stones and dissolving architecture directly charge the closure image, where "stone becoming suggestion" completes the thematic dissolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the parapet perch supplies both immediacy and symbolic elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The frozen courtyard, transparent violin, and twilight setting recur and anchor spatially. However, the environment remains postcard-static—frost, gravel, dead fountain—without constraining a single on-page choice. The violin's ice-crystal strings produce sound but no micro-setting detail (temperature, grip difficulty, resonance physics) alters J4N-17's action. Setting charges the final image lyrically but does not pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal forecourt after rain and the projection booth are rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("dust floated like plankton," "rainwater still threading the crystal pillars") that charges the atmosphere. The setting enables key moves: the ventilation grate delivers the overheard confession, the exit sign hides the lens, the projector becomes the vehicle for silent apology. The body and attention filter work well under Mira's scruples-driven POV. Minor cap: spatial choreography occasionally compresses (Mira moves from booth to exit sign to booth without clear blocking), and the "resonant hush" recurs as a mood label rather than a concrete sensory anchor that constrains a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden maze functions as active setting: hedges shift to create new pathways, walls part to reveal the hidden grove, and the maze rearranges itself into a direct path at the end. The impossible apple tree and the ancient glove both constrain and enable Elara's choices, charging the final sequence. Sensory detail (spider silk cloth, morning dew, water lilies in perfect symmetry) is filtered through Elara's professional attention. The environment's responsiveness to her 0.03% day directly shapes the closure by demonstrating the garden's knowledge of her.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magnetic nexus constrains her exploration (she must touch it to engage the lever), and the aviary's "hush of beating wings at rest" charges the final image of subdued awakening. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "icy warmth," "chilled honey," "subsonic hum," "titanium ribs." The station functions as chrysalis, a micro-setting that shapes her stance. Spatial choreography remains clear across the axial spine, aviary module, and lever at the bulkhead. Minor gap: the violet cloud-sea of Kepler-9c is named but never returns to pressure a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The flooded opera house supplies vivid, purposeful detail (splintered podium, debris-strewn aisle, submerged costume racks) that grounds the reader and reflects the POV's attention. Water as both physical barrier and symbolic medium constrains movement and creates the story's central acoustic strangeness. However, spatial choreography grows vague during the descent—"hidden door behind the waterlogged wardrobe" appears without prior setup, and the final emergence to a stage "revealed" by receding water feels convenient rather than earned. The flickering lanterns contribute atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or charge the final image, missing the micro-setting gate for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The weather station is concretely realized (cot, barograph, anemometer, rain gauge) and constrains key choices: the oracle uses station tools (logbook, illustration, instruments) to externalize and measure the internal weight. The botanical illustration—decades-old, cloud-damp, foxed edges—functions as both object and micro-setting, its smudging action directly shaping the climax. The auroral light and snowfield become tactile pressure points where the expulsion occurs. Sensory hierarchy filters through the oracle's professional lens (barograph's trembling hairline, mercury's shyness) without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tunnel's rusted rail, silt-buried valve, dripping water, and overhead hatch constrain Mara's movements and charge the final act—she presses her ear to the wheel, unscrews the cap, leaves it spinning. Sensory detail is filtered through her skeptic's lens: "mineral stink of the old foundry," beads "like dry bones." The body (palm to rail, ear to rim) and recurring object (valve wheel) function as micro-setting that shapes tactics and the closure image. No occupation-level bloat; every detail serves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The overgrown library is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: moss-laced parchment, roots twining card catalogs, shelves folding into paper cranes, and the circular reading pit with mirror-water. These elements are filtered through the keeper's professional gaze and constrain navigation (the tunnel "narrowed into a burrow," the floor "cracking" from saplings). The mirror-water directly charges the final image by bearing her weight and enabling the transformation. However, spatial choreography occasionally blurs—"shelves folding into wings of paper cranes that dissolved into ash at the brush of her sleeve" mixes metaphor and literal action without clarity. The setting performs well as micro-setting under the Accumulative lens, but some details (card catalogs, stalactite lectern) appear once without reweighting meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridge setting is vivid and purposeful: silver sage, the Listening Stone with its ring of offerings, and the eclipse's sensory transformations (cooled air, twilight trills, ants freezing mid-trail) are filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities. The environment enables the ritual and charges the final image when "sage leaf flashed silver, every root beneath the ridge hummed." Micro-setting test passed: the baby curl on the stone constrains her ritual timing and anchors memory. Spatial choreography is clean throughout ascent, peak, and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    The silo's verticality and repurposed grain infrastructure constrain her climb and catalog search; the concrete loading bay becomes the ritual site where she transfers the tapestry. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven ("air tasted of cooled ember and graphite," "copper glow"). The tapestry fragment itself functions as micro-setting, growing warm and tightening against her ribs, then blank after transfer—these shifts charge the closure image and prove the environment is not merely backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse and rocky island are concretely rendered (Fresnel lens, granite spine, combers smashing, lithophone stones) and constrain Chen's spycraft (lamp provides exposure, timing descent between beam rotations). Micro-setting elements—wire specs, hollowed bolt, skiff—function as tools that enable his final move. Sensory hierarchy reflects Chen's dual focus (light as shutter, wind as escape vector). The island as "stone keys" that "tune his ribs" charges the final image, making setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sanctuary as "a fold in space where echoes lingered longer than lungs" and "vaulted ribs were struts of unraveled stillness" creates vivid, purpose-driven setting. The dimensional anchor is not merely described but stressed by "the weight of so many simultaneous truths; stone ribs flexed like whale bones." Spatial choreography (altar rail, nave, back pews) tracks cleanly. The loop pedal functions as micro-setting, constraining the priest's tactics and charging the final image where "the circuits of the loop pedal" hold the demon. The palette on the altar rail and the sanctuary's acoustic properties shape multiple choices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass spire and frozen lake anchor the piece with vivid, selective detail (transparent stairs, mirrored horizon, frost feathers), and the spire functions as organ pipe in the final movement, charging the closure image. The nautilus shell serves as stylus and baton, constraining her method across beats. Micro-setting (body, shell, glass) drives the ritual, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography wavers—her position on the spire (climbing versus kneeling at apex) and the mechanics of "mapping" memories onto glass remain impressionistic rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing viaduct is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cobalt algae, copper-and-ozone air, rain falling sideways) that filters through Kael's perception under pressure. The viaduct constrains movement (seventeen arches, fractured paths) and charges the final image when Kael steps off it. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the sequence of moves. Minor slip: "temporal papercuts" and "yesterday puddle" are striking images but slightly ornamental—they describe rather than directly altering a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cavern is tactile and purposeful: cedar dust, goatskin stretched like moonlit lakes, felt-bearing lathe, packed-earth floor conducting vibrations. The phonograph and drum become micro-settings that constrain Mara's interaction—she *must* feel through bones and floor. The needle on leather cord and snow's hush at closure charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gargoyle's eye, pneumatic shaft, and phosphorescent lichen-map constrain Elara's lateral escape and provide underground navigation, directly shaping tactics. Sensory hierarchy filters through her professional attention (wet limestone, pigeon feathers as "proof"). The courtyard's dry fountain and cloister arcade anchor spatial choreography; the shaft's descent replaces dusk murmur with "layered tranquility," charging the ending's rain-tasting image. Minor cap: the "forgotten pneumatic layers" could use one more concrete anchor to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: warm clay walls, starlight filtering "the color of dried blood," Marcus's finger impressions in clay. The rope—a micro-setting element—constrains the narrator's physical and symbolic choices, appearing in multiple beats and charging the final image when coiled at the waist. Setting details are filtered through the poet's perceptual bias (rope as "rough where it broke, smooth where it held"). The energy beings remain abstract presences without texture, which is intentional and thematically apt, though their lack of physicality means they exert pressure primarily through implication rather than spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sunken orchard greenhouse with shipwrecks supplies concrete constraint: Mara kneels between durian trees, uses ship's bell percussion, breaks rigging wire for a bridge. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ash-slick mud," "chronic hush," "drip of condensation...minor seventh"), filtered through acoustic perception. The bowl planted in wet soil and the wire-bridge both constrain and enable the final resonator, directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting is indispensable to the stakes and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amber grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: resin smell, fossilized sap pool, copper light tracking time, dust she kneels in, earth's electric hum she presses into at closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lira's professional filter shifting to raw receptivity. The vials in her coat lining and the cracked one at the end tie space to choice. Setting details are woven through action (adjusting coat, sinking to knees) rather than static catalog, and the grotto's darkening to stone mirrors her transformation's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The breezy library with clerestory windows, card catalog flapping "like gull wings," and constellations on the ceiling creates vivid sensory anchoring that filters through Marisol's maritime world. The derelict Wharf of the Lanterns and the moored research vessel provide specificity that shapes the discovery beat. Setting elements—salt wind, seawall, shuttered kiosks—are woven into action and perception without catalog bloat. The library's constellation (Lyra) and Beto's reflective coat patches contribute atmospheric texture, though neither directly constrains a choice at closure, keeping this high in the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (chiming branches, crushed moonstone paths, metallic tang of spray) and the obsidian arbor directly constrains Lira's entry ritual, charging the threshold moment. The crater's altitude and the orchard's tone modulating with dusk create atmospheric pressure that supports escalation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (lip → arbor → pathways → trunk), and the final image of "trunk after trunk" directly uses the setting to encode Lira's transformation, satisfying the micro-setting test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop canal system is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: reversed ripples, wisteria bridge with blinking blossoms, iron aviary of clock hands. The canal constrains Mira's choices (she must walk upstream, choose left at the fork) and the aviary directly houses the closure goal. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (pendant, canal flow, cage bars melting) charges the final image when she steps through "a doorway of sound."

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern orchard is vividly realized through selective sensory detail—stalactites exhaling cold dust, calcite fruit ringing under boots, turquoise mosaic spiral. The setting constrains action (climbing the tree, aligning eyes with the spiral's origin) and charges the closure image (dripping resumed, seedlings sprouting). Micro-setting elements (glass eyes in the tree fork, astrolabe's projection) function as constraint and resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; the protagonist's movements through the orchard are trackable and purposeful, with the environment evolving causally from silence to music.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is integrated: the library's pipe chases and floorboard gaps enable Elias's caching and the final uncovering; the crawl space constrains his visibility and movement. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (biography section, central reading table, knotholes). The "sapphire hush" of emergency lights provides atmospheric texture but does not constrain a choice. The outage timeframe creates urgency but the environment itself—steam pipes, joists, philosophy stacks—directly enables the protagonist's tactics and the girl's discovery, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mossy trellis, greenhouse glass roof, storm, and linden saplings constrain action and mirror Mira's state throughout: she presses against the trellis, stumbles and is caught by it, then roots into the floor. The sprinkler system kicking on and her laughter at having designed it to mimic rain is a strong moment of irony grounded in setting. Spatial choreography is clear (southern wall, trays, floor, roof), and the post-transformation nursery's spiral growth charges the final image with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal island, causeway, monastery, and rain trails are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (basalt stones, bell tower at drunken angle, frescoes bubbling underwater). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the monastery interior sequence (chamber of tide measurements, painting location) lacks tight anchoring. The amber brooch, shells, pottery shard, and glass vial function as micro-setting that charges the closure image—the vial of untouched water and the brooch's warmth shape Mara's final stance. Sensory selection is strong (wet stones, pigments mixed with rainwater, golden sunset light) and filtered through Mara's exhausted perception, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (chiming steps, luminous crystals, abyssal pits, stalactites dripping light) and the cave pearl constrains a pivotal choice when pressed to his sternum, leaving the luminescent scar that charges the final image. Spatial choreography across branching corridors and the heart-lake remains coherent. Micro-setting qualifies: the cave's physics (sound as memory, overlapping shadows) enable the transfer and reconfigure the pilgrim's perception, directly shaping closure when he perceives cave music beneath traffic. The final vanished entrance forecloses return, a concrete environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ivory harbor's gleaming cobblestones, storm-drunk bell tower, and ozone-scented conservatory gate ground the journey with sensory specificity. The trumpet fragments function as micro-setting: the valve's "pitted brass" and "absence of sound" constrain the search and charge each assembly step. The cliff cemetery's fog layers ("each layer a year I had missed") filter perception through the narrator's exile. Spatial choreography across pier, kiosk, conservatory, cemetery, and return is clear. The harbor's "fresh margin" written by tide at the end subtly mirrors the blank-page opening, supporting closure without over-signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rail yard, tunnel, and phantom punch anchor the single continuous scene. The punch functions as micro-setting: it constrains Alden's path (arrows glow, punch clacks, validating his movement) and charges the final image when it dissolves into ultramarine paint. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—cedar-smelling mist, wan gold cracks, observatory roof—filtered through Alden's artistic perception. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tunnel journey. The environment subtly mirrors internal state (fortress of stacked journals, canvases turned to wall) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stargazer's tower is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: the brass railing, the astrolabe, the stone floor that rings "like a church bell," and the spiral stairs that Mara descends at dawn. Whale exhalations, salt mist, and jasmine scent are filtered through Mara's perceptual bias, and the setting charges the final image—she releases the tile into a tide pool, letting seawater rinse the numbers. The tower's acoustics ("stones still humming") and spatial choreography (observing deck, chart table, telescope positioning) remain coherent throughout. No occupation-level detail is required here, but the astrolabe and lens are integrated as tools that constrain and enable Mara's attempt to freeze the numbers.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The escondite's crystalline, folding corridors are vivid and contribute atmosphere. The solar storm provides urgency (anchors fail at predicted moment) and the storm's plasma painting walls vermilion adds sensory texture. The wooden door functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear through descent and the technicians' ring formation. However, setting detail occasionally leans decorative ("walls grew choral, colors singing") without constraining a tactical choice beyond the storm's anchor-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prep-room setting (formaldehyde, lilacs, bone saw, eyelid weights) is sensorially vivid and tonally apt. The funeral home constrains the interaction spatially and thematically. The ink pot's physical properties (clouded glass, silver cap, swirling residue) charge the final image when the cap cracks. Minor gap: the city exterior at dawn feels generic after the dense interior specificity, slightly diluting the final beat's grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests is vividly rendered with sensory detail—moss releasing luminescence, copper wire, volcanic soil—and the setting actively constrains Aurelia's path when the trees rearrange, exposing a route she did not prune. The fluorescent lamp at the labyrinth's heart serves as a charged focal object, its C-sharp hum and porcelain base transmitting "Morse code of forgotten decades." However, the mountaintop and town below remain somewhat generic; we lack the specific geography or social context that would make the silence more than atmospheric backdrop. The transformation of bonsai into full-sized trees is visually striking and alters the physical stakes, qualifying for micro-setting pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves causally with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The container labyrinth functions as a constraint throughout: Mara climbs tiers, navigates aisles with different light qualities, and the metal walls become the canvas for her voice fragments, directly enabling her final act of stamping the memorial label. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—sodium halos, brine, groaning metal—and the micro-recorder and poison label operate as tools that charge the closure image. The port's spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the tidal rhythm filters perception without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is anchored early (sagging threshold, cracked platform, broken telescope) and the setting constrains the action: the central platform holds the cello, the telescope swings without touch, walls turn transparent. The painted seashell functions as a micro-setting object that fits the cello's f-hole and cracks to reveal the compass, directly enabling the final turn. Sensory detail is filtered through Arlen's perspective (mildew, star-dust, salt spray). The setting charges the final image when the observatory "stood silent" but would "hear…a faint resonant hum," fulfilling the 9+ gate of constraining choice and shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The raft city setting is vivid, specific, and constrains multiple choices: graffiti as resistance medium, overnight deck-swapping logistics, the foundation stone chip as anchor. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Lina's priorities (calliope music, popcorn smoke, corporate teal). Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (sundeck, midway, container alley, calliope assembly). The setting charges the final image—"bright, rickety, and unreadable to anyone who needed to own what they loved"—transforming postcard description into tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The vitrified regolith, feldspar vein, and basalt shard are tactile and functional: she buries the smaller grain beneath basalt, the anemones cling to feldspar, and Earth's blue glow paints "dawnlit melancholy" that filters all perception. The micro-setting (summit ridge, chemical grain, antique camera) constrains every choice—she dribbles water to start the timer, the terminator wind signals the end, the haptic lining syncs her heartbeat to the blossoms. Spatial choreography is clean (hip flask, pocket, visor, camera tripod) and the moonscape charges the final image: "perfect fossil imprint, a ghost flower pressed into stone."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-coated rail depot, suspended glass drippers, rain barrel, and boiler metronome create a vivid, tactile micro-setting filtered through Lira's non-visual senses. The water features and kiln constrain her repair method and the bay door frames the final release. Spatial choreography (toolbox, drone on table, rain barrel wheeled in) stays coherent. However, the depot's broader function—why a rail depot houses a lone blind artisan and hummingbird drones—remains vague, and the Aurora's harbor proximity isn't anchored until late, weakening the geography's grip on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen lake and outpost constrain her physically (ice groans, warmth from below is "impossible at these latitudes"), and the phrasebook's tactile presence (dog-ear, brittle pages) anchors her childhood question. The underground estuary's carved labels and glowing microorganisms charge the final image: the page dissolves, transferring ink to the organisms, which carry it "through subterranean arteries toward every ocean." The spiral of condensation on glass recurs (window, breath on rungs, final frost spiral), modulating from domestic observation to cosmic motif. Micro-setting detail (tripod, limestone balcony, ribbed throat-cartilage walls) is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient archway functions as a concrete anchor and charges the final image (Elian suspended beneath it). The cobblestones, market square, and bell tower are handled with purposeful detail—footsteps on basalt pavers, windows trembling, timbers leaping—and the setting constrains Elian's method (he must walk the perimeter, strike the keystone). Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through the magical-realist frame. The "bellflower sprouting" moment and the north ward's "unspoken guilt" anchor setting in both physical and emotional registers, meeting the 9+ quick test for environmental constraint on choice and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater temple environment constrains choices throughout: cracked lapis tiles, coral-grown organ, stone tendrils wrapping the mast, air pocket shrinking. Mira's professional identity (cartographer) filters perception toward mapping and recording. The crystal vial and copper coil function as micro-setting elements that enable the climactic action. Spatial choreography remains clear (floats above tiles → kicks deeper into sanctuary → pries open console → uncorks vial). The final image of the vial on the console charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, weighted toward the visual and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and Fresnel lens are vividly rendered and anchor the piece spatially. The lattice constrains one choice—Cassian fits it to the lens—charging the final beam across the reef. Sensory selection is often purposeful: "salt-bitten hinges," "lantern oil and gull blood," "communion wine fog." However, micro-setting does not pressure multiple tactics, and the impossible architecture (doors onto previous years, sprouting bars) remains ornamental rather than a constraint that shapes Cassian's route or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly detailed (copper pipes, pomegranate runes, quartz grafts) and returns at closure when the trees wither. Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop. The orientation cap applies due to Q2 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The red canyon labyrinth, driftwood loom, and dry tide pools are vivid and particular, filtered through lyric perception ("cooling embers," "spilled milk"). The loom anchors the climactic weaving and the returning tide charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test (environment constrains choice and charges closure). Spatial choreography is coherent across the spiraling descent and ascent. Deduction: the labyrinth's mechanics (switchbacks, altars, ledge) are sketched rather than grounded in tactile, lived-in interaction; Calyx drifts through rather than navigating obstacles that test his body or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific: fossilized petals, roots threading through bones, myrrh-scented air, ceiling cracks. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the protagonist's quest. The sundial base and mirrors function as charged objects that constrain her actions (aligning on vertebrae, lifting the reliquary lid). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from tomb to eastern ridge compresses geography without cost. The setting directly enables the climactic reconstruction and charges the final image of the chapel floor, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The golden arcade at dawn is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glass roof filtering honeyed beams, neon signs as tired fireflies, cool flagstones). The setting constrains choice: the postal slot's presence creates the decision point, the chalk spiral maps her hesitation spatially, and the drone's early arrival compresses her window. The futuristic-nostalgic blend (2080s neon, obsolete surface mail, copper-winged drone) coheres and the setting charges the final image as she walks away. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn wind, stained glass, and mirrored alcove are vividly established and recur across beats. The embroidered cloth and projector glass plate function as micro-setting tools that constrain the reveal. However, spatial choreography during the council-chamber scene (how she walks the corridor, spreads the map, positions the candle beneath the lens) remains abstract; the environment supplies atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice or directly charge the final image when she returns to her stool.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and specific ("roots that never quite touched," "water that healed in moonlight"), and sensory detail is purposeful throughout. The gargoyle shard functions as a recurring object that charges the closure (transforms into mirror, then breath). Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff—it serves as backdrop and mood rather than shaping the protagonist's options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atrium, mist, banana leaves, and twilight create a contained sensory world; the glass roof and droplets constrain the scene spatially and acoustically. The coral fragment functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, then resting on cast) and charged at closure when aligned with the spiral. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's exhausted, anesthetic-softened perception. The field-hospital setting and buffer-zone geography anchor the conflict without requiring occupation-level depth at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard district, toppled apple press, and cider-house wall provide tactile anchors that constrain Luma's choices: she kneels beside the press to retrieve the fragment, seeks the oldest ruin guided by the fresco's heartbeat, and presses palms to plaster that "smelled faintly of fermented stars." The fog operates as spatial pressure—folding time, knitting into a dome—and the wall's memory of every hand becomes the substrate for closure. Micro-setting (body, fragment, wall) charges the final image when the graft "heals two broken branches into one flowering tree."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden supplies vivid, concrete details (tuned basalt slabs, rose-quartz xylophone, obsidian gong) filtered through Liora's restorer perspective. The silver ribbon of sound constrains her movement in the nested sequence, and the garden's folding/unfolding structure charges the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly coherent, though the nested layers risk abstraction. The setting meets the micro-setting standard: the spoon, stones, and ribbon function as tools that enable her method and reappear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse is vividly anchored with orchid bees, passionvine, and moonlit soil; sensory detail (nectar, pollen, Voss's badge "glinting like a beetle's shell") is specific and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clear through the planting beat and Voss's approach. The setting enables the pollen-cloud trick and the warp-seed planting, but the final escape via "warp residue" lacks concrete grounding in the established world rules, weakening the micro-setting's constraint role at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly realized through ammonite cracks, apex chamber as "hollow pearl," and dew-planetarium of insomnia. Spatial choreography is clear (spiral stairs, tower, shore). The setting constrains Zale's ritual and charges the final image when blossoms "thread the spiral" and the tower becomes "bioluminescent throat." However, the shell functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical pressure; Zale's movements feel choreographed by metaphor rather than spatial necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The opal library, glass-orchid petals, and chandelier-of-hollow-bulbs create a cohesive micro-world with consistent internal logic. The cracked bamboo tube constrains her method (she must amplify through the tuning fork and quill), and the drawer system (Serenity/Wrath) supplies the tools that enable the climactic lighting. The setting charges the final image effectively: the tube falling through cloud decks to a valley grounds the conceptual sacrifice in spatial consequence. Sensory detail remains heavily visual and occasionally generic ("colorless breath," "phosphorescent plankton") but the architecture matters to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive exerts genuine pressure: shelves creak, candles snuff, the mural's stitched mouths appear and later unpucker. The glass ink well recurs as both tool and charged object, constraining her work and ultimately left behind to embody the promise. Sensory detail (ash and honey taste, iron and regret dust) is vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the side corridor exit and crowd convergence ground the final move. The environment directly shapes her restitution tactic and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amphitheater is vividly anchored with basalt benches, moonlight dappling, and the volcano's breathing rhythm. The surveyor's chain and the hidden keystone block constrain Mireya's method and drive the discovery sequence. The acoustics of the amphitheater directly enable the resolution by weaving the delegations' demands into harmony. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (vine-choked steps, orchestra floor, tenth row, stage, rim). The setting does more than frame—it actively mediates conflict, charging the final image of water and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    The attic skylight and dust motes constrain Mirela's balancing practice and charge the final image when the light "rearranges into a brief, bright chord." Spatial details—rafters, floorboards, the meteorite hollow—are woven through action and recur with purpose. Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through Mirela's particular attention (camphor, iron taste, oil-drop eyes), though some diction ("blooming withering light") edges toward ornament. The pigeon loft between chimney stacks integrates setting into the network-rebuilding plot, and the micro-setting (body, skylight, copper plate) effectively substitutes for broader world-building at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly particularized (three inches west per year, house creaking like a ship) and charges the final image when Juniper steps off its western edge. The kitchen table with carved weather symbols functions as micro-setting that constrains her method and delivers coordinates. Sensory detail is purposeful: barefoot steps reading floorboards, grain textures, the fractured hush. No orientation debt; spatial choreography remains clear across the single continuous scene. The terrace qualifies as an object-as-setting that reconfigures meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered with specific details (moon-pipes, thermocline power, salt-eaten catwalk) that create strong atmosphere. The environment supplies resources (emergency valve, chalk, porthole) but these are used for ritual rather than constraining a tactical choice. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from "only corridor left unflooded" to the atrium and then "back through the unflooded corridor" suggests layout confusion. The micro-setting (burnt feather, catwalk summit) charges the final image without forcing a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The iridescent geode is vividly realized—walls that pulse like a heart, surfaces that transliterate emotion into color, crater glass that reflects futures—and it constrains Lira's investigation by offering clues (transliterated abandonment, ash spelling "remember"). The migrating bird's skylight entry and the mosaic spiral on the cave floor are integrated into the plot's turns. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-tasting breeze, turquoise ripples of gratitude underfoot), and the setting evolves causally (geode seals after its job is complete). The micro-setting of the cave charges the final image when the new path forms and the ground hums gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade is densely rendered—corroded steel grating, waves slapping pylons, neon puddles, soapy water reflecting galaxies—and it actively shapes Cipher's tactics (the ferret's bolt-path, the photo booth as retreat, the slot machine as final gesture). The arcade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Cipher's analytical gaze, with spatial choreography remaining clear across multiple simultaneous actions.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The twilight garden is rendered with selective sensory detail—moss warm from day's sigh, dry fountain, dew, night-blooming datura scent—and the setting constrains her midnight work (sunrise would "seal the ink if she faltered"). The moonstone dust functions as micro-setting, orbiting her wrists and inscribing lines. The eastern gate and seawall anchor spatial choreography. The garden's hush and the stars rearranging into her signature charge the final image. Environment and body both shape the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (salt wind, kelp, rust, violet thread of sky, black mirror of pond) filtered through Mara's professional and personal priorities. Spatial choreography is clean (ankle-deep, pier post, flat stone, horizon). The prism and the bay's drip-and-rings micro-setting constrain Mara's ritual sequence and charge the final image when light strikes town windows. The setting does not pressure a difficult choice, but it does supply the mechanism for her communion and closure, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit ridge, granite dish, and porcelain box constrain and charge the ritual: moonlight projects the cracked pattern onto his scar, the granite becomes an altar for the spiral drawing, and the ridge's geography (narrow path, remembered rescue site) anchors each beat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("pines still smelled of last summer's burn," "tears salt-washing the burn ridges"), filtered through Elias's firefighter lens. The micro-setting (box, granite, moonlight interplay) drives the final image and the spiral's projection into the valley, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered with phosphorescence, salt breath, and kelp; spatial choreography is coherent. The altitude gauge and trial balloon function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Mira's actions proceed unimpeded by the grotto's properties. The "impossible" balloon descent and the grotto's spontaneous rearrangement of decorations into a sentence feel like authorial decoration rather than lived spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage, fireplace, and film-negative tunnel are vividly realized and constrain Mira's movements at each stage. The climate-shift flood lines, dripping corridors, and moss texture filter through Mira's professional ear and charge the closure image: the building-as-camera reveal depends on the physical architecture established early. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent, and the negatives brushing her face in the tunnel is both tactile and conceptually loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and bell tower supply vivid sensory anchors (violets, gold, wet stone, lilac scent). The blown-glass sphere is handled across beats and the terrace's spatial layout is coherent. However, setting largely functions as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows the painter's options. The prism parapet appears in opening and closing but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with fresh cost, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace functions as active setting: obsidian drinking starlight, silver veins pulsing with Kaelen's heartbeat, reflecting the war below—environment charges the ritual and final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (warm altar stone, glowing lily petals) and filtered through Kaelen's priorities. Spatial choreography is clear as mourners climb steps and build the cairn. The terrace's crumbling at dawn constrains future action and completes the ritual arc, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting must charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt flat functions as micro-setting: it "kept the shape of what was lost" and the cracks form the map guiding his ritual, constraining his approach and timing. The egg pressed into the crust, the underground crystals conducting electricity, and the final rainwater-filled footprints all charge the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful—salt crunch, dust smelling of reeds, sparks illuminating the vanished watershed—and filtered through the protagonist's guilt-laden attention. The setting materially alters tactics (waiting for the lull, seeding and holding clouds) and underpins the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    The silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and mosaic tiles supply vivid anchors and constrain Lys's path—she must kneel at the threshold, press palm to veins, work the threads. Snow melting into spring water and night-blooming cereus charge the final image with environmental transformation. However, spatial choreography inside the sanctuary is hazy: the plinth's position, Lys's movements between kneeling and stepping into the mirror, and the distance to the fountain are not tracked. The body as micro-setting (pelvic bones vibrating, barefoot prints of blood and dew) is purposeful and specific, lifting the score despite the interior vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome supplies vivid spatial particulars (broken panels, curved interior, ghost receivers) and the story uses its surfaces to stage the climactic writing. The campfire story stick constrains the ritual action across multiple beats. However, much sensory detail remains decorative—"moonlight pierced broken panels like half-lit epiphanies" prioritizes metaphor over tactile grounding. The setting does charge the final image (satellites reading his manifesto), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but pervasive ornamental phrasing and mixed metaphors (smoke forming "translucent marionettes") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is vividly rendered: emerald ferns, cloud-soil, lightning-scarred bark. Setting anchors early and recurs (transient roots, dissolving by nightfall). The moth wing caught in clock gears and the wire framework both function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. The grotto's ephemeral nature constrains the memorial's duration, lending thematic weight, though it does not force a tactical choice in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, ceremonial ropes, and punched card scrap constrain the protagonist's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional attention: "coppery ghost of old blood," "fractured lavender," "petrified incense." The rope's physical transformation from frozen to supple enables the action; the skylight and aurora modulate pressure throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling at skylight, spreading card on snow, threading rope through holes). The micro-setting—rope, card, ice—functions as the crucible that makes the closure possible.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest are vivid and textured; details like "ceiling tiles sagging in calculated arcs" and "dripping water forms a melody" show purposeful specificity. The lens-floor cracking, storm punching through, and metal liquefying into soil all constrain or enable the protagonist's final transformation. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the dream-chamber's exact layout and the vine-ladder's mechanics remain slightly vague. The setting charges the final image when the bunker becomes "a seed cracking open," satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The palace setting is vivid and layered: cedar doors, glazed bricks murmuring cuneiform, cracked lapis lions, the copper door, the hollow cube with clerestory light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Naram-bel's astronomer's eye. The inner sanctum's "hollow cube of air where no dust dared drift" constrains the covenant ritual spatially, and the final dust that "refused to settle" charges the closure image. However, the scriptorium and courtyard remain interchangeable backdrop for much of the action; the gate/lock mechanism is asserted rather than tactilely explored, missing an opportunity to ground the magical turn in physical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary's breathing walls, shifting angles, and transformation from stone to silk constrain Lira's approach and charge the final stillness. The music box is handled across multiple beats and its broken state matters tactically. Spatial choreography remains abstract but legible (floor becoming lake, ceiling becoming sky). The final image—three silhouettes against a forgetting horizon—uses the environment to reinforce closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ruined orchard, fog, and glass mountains establish a vivid, coherent dreamscape. The sextant's arc and the corridor of mirrors supply tactile anchors that constrain the protagonist's movements. However, the final sapling whose leaves are mirrors arrives late and resolves rather than complicates; the setting serves atmosphere more than it pressures tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid and purposeful: roots coil around corbels, branches weave tracery, the absent rose window pours light. The copper gear and ribbon constrain the graft choice, the scaffold provides spatial choreography for the mender's work, and the setting charges the final image (coconut-and-copper fragrance drifting over the city). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the mender's professional priorities (quartz monocle, pruning hook, cambium thrumming). The setting passes the micro-setting test by shaping the graft action and the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astral orchard and titanium bathroom pod are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (starlight-laden petals that chime, phosphorescent moss). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop for metaphysical events rather than constraining choices—Mara moves through spaces that transform around her without spatial logic or resource scarcity shaping tactics. The bathroom as "chrysalis" and the orchard's xylem plumbing are inventive micro-settings, but their mechanics don't visibly limit or enable a pivotal decision at closure. Setting remains ornamental rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting provide vivid, specific imagery (obsidian shelf, root-walls spelling warnings, staircase disguised as glossary). However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or shaping tactics; Elara navigates via magical diary mechanics, not spatial pressure. The body is rarely grounded—Elara kneels, whispers, and climbs, but these actions do not engage the environment in tactile, lived-in ways. The final ridge scene offers no micro-setting constraint that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting details are vivid and purposefully surreal (salt-streaked porthole, mildewed calliope, rotting plush) and the carnival ship's decay creates consistent atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or blocks a path; the protagonist moves through spaces that shift meaning poetically but don't alter her options. The emerald card "twitches" and she follows—the ship supplies mood but not mechanical pressure. The mirror-maze and tarot stall serve as symbolic waypoints rather than obstacles that force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered—gears "taller than confessionals," "oak beams blackened by centuries of lamp smoke," air tasting of "rust and rain." Spatial choreography is clean: spiral stair, platform, cedar chest, pendulum above. The frozen clock hands and shivering gears respond to Elara's work, directly constraining and then releasing the action. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the archivist's lens (lantern catching glint, oxidized time flaking). The rope, seal, and chest function as micro-setting elements that charge the closure image when the rope becomes "warm as fresh bread" and the village is coiled back into the chest.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The harmonic caves constrain choices throughout: stalactites that chime if you breathe too hard, mineral lace that trembles at a heartbeat, and the Abyssal Gate's frequency too old to swallow all shape the mapkeeper's tactics. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, handled multiple times and directly enabling the closure by absorbing sound and later releasing it. "Gently luminous" appears as a recurring sensory anchor (veins, lichen lantern, runes) that tracks the energy beings' feeding cycles. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent to the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass humming pavilion returns as a spatial anchor and sensory signature (single note "between mourning and morning"). The desert, mall husks, and Joshua tree are filtered through the custodian's perception and quest logic. The final image charges the tower setting by making it sing again. The prism itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the rekindling action (must align with Polaris, requires all shards). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, though some metaphoric density ("sky's black fabric," "thistle-blown hope") edges toward decorative in non-peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit observatory, obsidian stairs, crystal forecourt, and solid fog are vividly rendered and integral to the closure: the protagonist kneels on the tiles, gathers fog pellets, arranges them in lightning-statue shadow, and presses memory into their cores—all spatially grounded actions that would fail without these anchors. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("mist that had begun to harden into brittle scales," "pellets clattered," "liquid again"). The crystal tiles constrain the final choice by offering the whispered wisdom that enables her synthesis. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the descent from dome to street level tracks consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming fortress with stone petals and the spiral stair with constellation murals establish a vivid, coherent setting anchored early. Spatial choreography (dry moat, stair, battlement) tracks cleanly, and the kerosene rag knot and mosaic tiles are handled on the page, constraining Luma's rocket-building choice. The final image of the fortress "continuing its slow nocturnal opening" charges the closure with environmental change, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for Q3, but some descriptions (gunpowder-and-pine perfume, the corked darkness) lean ornamental rather than shaping immediate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto is vividly anchored—limestone ribs, phosphorescent glow, basalt ledge, dripping vault—and the tidal pool constrains the chronicler's method of observation. Sensory selection reflects urgency: salt on lips, chill of dawn, brittle star navigating sharp edges. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, charging the final exchange and the closure walk. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting's texture (silt layering, stone changed by weight) directly supports the thematic reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The xenial trellis constrains choice: planks "yield like memory" until trusted, forcing Lira to limit exposure; the narrowing rail creates a membrane she must break. Sensory details are selective and voice-filtered: "gilded hush coated the air, thick as honey yet weightless, tasting of the silence that follows a last breath." The inverted sky with dangling roots charges the collection beats. Spatial choreography remains clear across ascent and descent. The final image—porcelain doll "wedged between two vines"—anchors closure. The body (lungs, skin, hair tugged by inverted gravity) functions as micro-setting throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drifting prism terrace is not mere backdrop: it moves three meters east per minute, hexagons signal safe boarding, the carbon silk cable constrains transit, and the lattice walls channel distant train whistles that pressure the commuter's guarded heart. The storm glass vial is handled across multiple beats (loosened, cradled, emptied, refilled) and its mechanics constrain Nilo's tactic (waiting for crystal formation). Spatial choreography is clean (terrace, gate, helm, rail). The micro-setting (vial, dial, prisms) charges the final image: Nilo cradling the vial, tuning the dial to zero. Minor slip: the "cloud-sea mirroring the prisms" risks decorative symmetry without tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting details are vivid but purely ornamental: the kaleidoscopic waterfall, bioluminescent fruit trees, and hidden orchard never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (palace wall → waterfall → orchard → stairway → throne room) and the futuristic-nostalgic fusion is consistent, but no environmental feature pressures the protagonist. The plasma torch and neural implant are mentioned once each without recurring or shaping moves. The ruby throne appears only in the final image without prior setup, failing the micro-setting payoff test.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ashen sanctuary with collapsed roof and scorched circle anchors the scene vividly and constrains the ritual space. The doorknocker ring is handled twice (pressed to chest, then to the boy's chest), charging the threshold motif. Starlight filtered "like frozen tears" recurs, lending cadence. The setting does not constrain a choice—it serves as stage rather than obstacle—but the micro-setting (the scorched circle, the iron ring) supports the final image enough to enter the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies vivid sensory detail (copper spores, 42-hertz hum, glowing caps, mycelial lace) and the setting directly constrains action: the drip line guides Lira to the root-cave, mushrooms dim to fuel the reaction, spores spell "paid in full." The submarine bolt pendant functions as micro-setting, charging the closure when twisted to form the diamond. Spatial choreography is clear (porthole → rows → hose → cave → cliffs). The farm's intersection with pyramid-scheme metaphor feels thematically coherent but the root-cave's pressure mechanics ("doubled," "invisible wrench") remain slightly abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sepia reading room supplies concrete anchors—brass gramophone, carpet fleurs-de-lis, northwest shelves, tall window—that Arin navigates to find the crank handle and later uses to address the city. The room's acoustic properties ("standing waves") and spatial layout constrain the search and enable the climactic broadcast. Sensory detail is vivid but occasionally veers into decorative excess ("dust looked like powdered light") without always filtering through urgency. The setting charges the final image when Arin lifts the bloodied atlas page at the window, satisfying the 9+ gate test for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse setting constrains movement through the choreography pattern and actively shapes the transformation scene through alchemical properties (silver sap, gravity-reversing apples, mercury sky). Spatial details remain coherent: upside-down trees, miniature stage at center, door threshold. Sensory selection is purposeful (phosphorescence, rosin smell, cinnamon-incense, clockwork ticking) and filtered through the knight's attention. The recurring silver sap coats his limbs at closure, charging the final image. The "endless night" and "reality shifts" timeframe function as both atmosphere and constraint, though the mechanics of when shifts occur remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The file room (mildew, fluorescent hum, banker's boxes, gooseneck lamp) supplies tactile constraint and charges the ending. The button and dust function as micro-setting objects that enable Rowan's archival method and anchor the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (peppermint secretary, peeling label "like old scab"). Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8+ because the environment enables rather than tightly constrains a pivotal choice; the room permits rather than forces the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    The auric lagoon, starlight reflections, and defunct phone booth create a vivid, purposeful setting. The booth's glass, reel-to-reel beneath the coin box, and "MAINT" slot are specific and tactile. The lagoon's reflections guide Mira to the booth, and the booth's wiring enables the climax, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. However, spatial choreography during the sprint and inside the booth remains somewhat vague, and sensory selection (damp boardwalk, cooling planks, salt-aged tape) occasionally lists rather than filters through urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The radiant grotto and prism atrium are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (limestone walls, fractured rainbows, glass vibrating in sympathetic tuning). The setting constrains the saxophonist's tactics: the grotto's acoustics become "the instrument's second body," and the atrium's micro-tonal echoes force him to alter his fingering. Dewdrops, ferns, and moss are filtered through the protagonist's perception and recur with evolving significance. The spatial choreography between grotto and atrium (half a mile up the ravine) remains clear, and the environment charges the closure image as the grotto "exhales, radiant with relief."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ashen skyborne arbor and floating grove details are vivid and consistent. The moonstone cabochon dust speck and ascending leaves constrain Mireya's attention and frame her project, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography (highest bough, catwalks, lichened branch) remains clear. The "hush where past meets prophecy" and the final mulch-scent callback charge the frame without overwhelming momentum. However, the mirror arbor and verdant reflection above arrive as postcard description rather than a resource or constraint that alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean waterfall constrains the peak choice: Elias must wade in and dunk his head to retrieve the compass rose, making the environment a physical crucible. The Thames-side cellar, greenhouse above, and basalt ledge are grounded early and remain spatially coherent. The recurring three-seventeen timestamp and the compass-star seam in wet ash charge the final image when all clocks point toward the cellar. Sensory detail—cold mist, stinging dark, mercury-ladder chill—is selective and tied to urgency, though the "Victorian navvies who heard the same echo and fled" feels ornamental rather than pressure-building.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The foundry's gutters, anvil, charcoal heart, and rain-washed cobbles supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through alchemical perception. The portable alembic and zodiac coin constrain the ritual beats and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (door, anvil, scales, doorway), and sensory selection—hissing raindrops, iron smell, rose-gold vapor—supports the accumulative pressure without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (throat of stone, lichen, mist painted with unnamed colors) and the harp wedged between boulders provides a concrete anchor. The crocodile's tooth and the river stones constrain Elara's movement and supply the mechanism for the final beat, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The piece meets the 9+ gate (environment/tool constrains choice and charges the final image), but minor ornamental excess ("luminous ache," "liquid apology") slightly dilutes functional detail.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and pressure device: leaves "vibrating at the frequency of a polygraph needle," sap printing bruise-colored fingerprints, hot trunk. The pewter strap (micro-object-as-setting) is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image when left behind. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the walk. The ultraviolet penance detail—photons "calibrated to the exact shade of shame"—roots the surreal premise in sensory specificity. Minor issue: the forest's "low hum" and moss appear late without prior anchoring, slight continuity slip.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's market (rope bridges, swaying catwalks,vendored ephemera) and the painting as portal are vivid and constrain the protagonist's method of access. Sensory detail is purposeful: "copper and salt," "pigment-warm dusk," "tide-gnawed ruins." The lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting, charged with tactile warmth and recurring presence that directly enables the time-crossing choice. Spatial choreography (market to cliff to market) tracks cleanly. The environment charges the final image ("market lanterns rearrange into a spiral").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly particularized (peeling posters, warped linoleum, sagging acoustic tiles, ticket stubs dated 1987) and constrains Mara's choices: she climbs the desk, pushes aside ceiling tiles, and finds the temporal crack. Micro-setting details—the mainspring barrel's brass tarnished to old blood, moonlight through the ticket window—charge the final image when the child ghost hands her the warm ticket stub. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens: she analyzes dust accumulation patterns, feels the building's pulse like an elevator cable. The circus setting is not merely backdrop; it supplies the props (ticket stubs stamped ADMIT ONE TO THE SKY) that literalize her ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Glass orchard library, cloud-sea, frost patterns, letterpress gears-as-petals deliver vivid, purposeful detail. The floating deck tilts when ballast-books slide starboard—spatial choreography clear and causal. Frost rearranges into a spiral that Corwin inhales; the pattern constrains his next choice (he steps through broken pane onto cloud). Micro-setting and recurring object (frost) charge the closure image when his name appears on distant windowpanes. Passes Q3 9+ quick test: frost constrains the peak choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The baroque asteroid with visible time, obsidian walls, mirrored halls, and collapsed harpsichord is vivid and purposeful. Covering mirrors constrains Aurelia's method and the palace architecture shapes her tactic, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is selective (velvet drapes, mercury ceiling, marble pedestal) and filtered through her revolutionary lens. The setting pressures choices and charges the final image, though some description (cherubs, opera boxes) leans decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered ("vaulted hollow of copper and rust," "walls breathing with the low hum of forgotten chimes") and the lantern's flame as honesty-detector actively constrains Elias's choices. The orrery's petals, gears, and the chamber's veins of gold are integral to the closure image, charging the final beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's professional lens (tool roll clinking, gears breathing). The recurring small object (the chip) functions as micro-setting, and the chamber's rule (wilts near dishonesty) shapes the protagonist's tactic (honest confession), meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean lagoon is rendered through powdered-shell beach, black glossy water, and fossil confetti on the spiral stair—specific, tactile, and filtered through Ivy's collector lens. The compass tugs "like a hound," the stone door exhales, and the air warms with "a hush so resonant it rang"—sensory hierarchy reflects her professional attention. The lagoon constrains the final choice: it "required tribute, not testimony," forcing her to uncork all vials rather than merely observe. Spatial choreography (pier → cliff base → spiral → beach → water's center) tracks cleanly. The environment charges the closure when rain falls upward and refills the vials "with something older than rain."

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Basalt archway, tide-wet stone, salt-gray wood, and storm pressure constrain Maela's choices—she must carve during the lightning duel, wedge the slide into driftwood grain. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (foam across lenses, pine pitch smell, turbine-hum, oarlock hush) and filtered through sculptor's priorities. The archway functions as ledger and throat, its grooves signatures of debt; it charges the final image when the carved miniature echoes the stone arch. Spatial choreography stays coherent across storm, carving, and skiff departure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber pavilion, copper ribs, ginkgo trees, and moonflower vines are vivid and purposeful. The pavilion's glass panes become the canvas for her final mural, constraining her method and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is filtered through Liora's artistic priorities (leading in cathedral windows, etched glass, indigo paint). Spatial choreography is clear across the seasonal arc. The micro-setting (pavilion floor, cot between pillars) shapes her nightly vigil and the visitors' later encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian lagoon constrains action (sand as shackles, water as cipher) and charges the ending image (speaking "above the obsidian lagoon that once swallowed light and now gave it back"). The debris-grammar system is vivid and purpose-driven. The floating library zeppelin anchors early but remains largely backdrop after the descent; it provides the loudhailer at closure but does not pressure mid-scene choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("hot glass-grain," "liquid night").

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paper-lantern ribs, the flagpole, the choked well, and the beach constrain choices throughout: the narrator pulls a ledger page from the well (supplies material), anchors kites to the flagpole (spatial resource), and uses seawater to mix ash-ink (micro-setting as toolkit). Sensory selection is purposeful—sulfur mixed with brine, ash spirals, gulls beyond dunes—and filtered through the alchemist's craft-oriented POV. The recurring lanterns function as both setting signature and closure device, charging the final image when their cycle is institutionalized.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop orchard is vivid (quince, medlar, Judean date palm, drip basin) and purposeful: the shaving lands on soil, the basin triggers memory, quinces bear oath-faces, the ledger rests beneath the tree. Micro-setting (basin, soil, bark) constrains the immersion choice and charges the final image ("orchard would be gone—transmuted"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (quince-juice ink, greenhouse glass quiver). The orchard's transmutation into "velvet disquiet" reconfigures the space's meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium is vividly rendered (frost-feathered orchard, fountain shedding ice skin, starlight seeping through glass) and the oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice—she places it on ice, breathes names into it, uses it as cradle for seeds. Spatial choreography is clean (walkway, fountain center, snowfield exit). The setting charges the closure: the atrium's dome "glinted once… then dimmed," and the snowfield becomes the stage for her spiral-bearer walk, fulfilling the Q3 9+ gate of environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The windblown sanctuary constrains choice throughout: altitude cleanses her ears, the balcony holds the barometer, the belfry requires a climb that delays action, and the cathedral bell rope's physical presence (thick as her wrist, smelling of pine-tar soap) charges the climax when she ties it to the servo. The micro-setting—pocket barometer, toggle box, field pad—functions as essential toolkit that tracks pressure and enables the switch. The final image of six low notes rolling across the cloud sea rewrites the station's function from civic warning to mountain courtesy, with the setting (above the clouds, stone balcony, flagstones that breathe) anchoring that transformation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: electric scent, moon nailed to the sky, clouds like slow whales.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory setting—dome, telescope, brass instruments, rotating sigh—provides concrete sensory anchors and the mirrors' final arrangement directly enables the closure gesture of welcome. The yellow lantern glass recurs with specificity (cracked, warm, transparent transformation) and charges the ending through the afterimage discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear across the station's interior and mountain road, and the setting's abandonment pressures the janitor's solitary ritual, meeting the 9+ gate of constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with sun-cracked frames, toppled apiaries, and scorched wasteland sensory anchors. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, constraining Alden's ritual and charging the final image when the fracture seals. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: ash spirals, soot motes, violet and emerald light refraction. The scent of blooming clover at the end directly contradicts and transforms the scorched desolation, meeting the constraint-and-charge test for 9+ eligibility. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emerald silo functions as more than backdrop: its internal ladder offers "each rung a sentence he could feel in his palms," the rim provides the noon-light experiment, and the base hosts the garage sale that enables the final exchange. The urn fragment's "crazed glaze looked like cracked hourglass glass" and the price tags' evolving descriptions create a micro-setting of objects that constrain and charge choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (metallic dust on the tongue, unnamed color of noon light). The silo's verticality structures the arc—ascent for solitary discovery, descent for communal exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt lagoon, wet sand, tideline debris, and dunes provide vivid sensory grounding filtered through the poet's attention. The drake feather and the spiral drawn in sand constrain on-page actions: he kneels, presses the feather, speaks the line. The final image—tide erasing the sand-writing—charges the ending with a concrete cost (impermanence made literal). Micro-setting qualifies here: the feather, tin, sand, and tide all participate in choices and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stone pillars "grown, seeded by ancients who sang calcium into lattice" and copper wire constrain Mara's remodeling method; the orchard's micro-currents shape her tactics across multiple beats. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "pillars cry…fragrant resin," "harmless blue fire that smelled of chamomile and rain." The final image charges when footprints fill with copper dust, grounding the mystical transfer in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (altar, ladder, rows, sea path).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed tower, moss-softened earth, wet lichen, and spring runoff provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Mara's scientific lens. The amber shard constrains her path (she presses it to the seventh sculpture, it floats in the convergence chamber) and charges the final image (she plants it in soil). Spatial choreography is clean: base → sculpture path → spiral staircase → dome → descent. The sculpture path's "dusty footprints" and "overgrown" state matter thematically but don't alter her tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vivid and purposeful: coral dust, land-flowers on planks, flower-drunk sand, and the lattice of roots all constrain the coachman's movements and choices. The reef's death and the battlefield beneath the jetty provide a layered setting that charges the ritual. Sensory detail is filtered through the coachman's perception ("narrow vastness," "breath of ancient smoke that smelled of myrrh and gunpowder") and the environment evolves causally as vines wrap bayonets and planks split into soil. The gull's presence and the submerged battlefield both pressure the action. The final image—the glowing grove beneath stars—reconfigures the opening desolation, meeting the 9+ test for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scrapyard and wasteland constrain movement (buried subway car, desert mallow tanks) and supply scent-map resources that alter tactics. Micro-setting (the wax leaf, the corrugated archive hut) charges the closure image when the leaf softens on the threshold. Sensory hierarchy is strong—copper, ozone, lithium—filtered through Scraps's nose, and the "wild hush" acoustic detail recurs with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observation deck, maintenance hatch, and crawlspace are vividly grounded with purposeful detail (frost-rimmed window, emergency sconce, coffin-sized space). The gilded compass rose functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when the needle spins and charging the final image when it blazes. Spatial choreography is clean. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (cold deck plating, whale-song heartbeat). The station's magnetic core flip and time-dilation mechanics are integrated without exposition dump. Strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, bruised sky, and glacier chessboard supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors that pressure the climb and match. The pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting, constraining Vespers's proof of the "wrong hour" and opening the shadow stair—a clear choice-shaping tool. Sensory details (frozen song bells, thawing-lake eyes, auroras like hooked fish) are specific and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog. Spatial choreography remains legible across vertical planes (halfway up, summit, descent). No cap from Q2 orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering gallery functions as both spatial container and active participant, its "stone mouths" shaping the central metaphor and constraining Mara's method of archiving through footsteps. The chessboard's missing pawns concretely mirror the city's evacuated commoners, charging the final image when Mara wraps it to preserve. Spatial choreography remains clear (gallery, lantern circles, squares) and sensory detail is purposefully filtered through Mara's archival attention. The gallery's recurring presence—opening whisper, mid-scene echo, closing satisfaction—supplies the constraint that makes her walking-pattern method legible and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly realized through sensory details (wet paper, thunder, basalt walls, shelves carved into stone) and actively constrains choice: corridors corkscrew, the custodian rearranges sections nightly, the feather navigates via texture. The crow feather functions as micro-setting/tool that enables navigation and charges the final image when used to crack her reflection. Spatial choreography remains clear through nine spirals and the folio discovery. The mountain bookstore collapsing inward provides consequence at closure, and the outside valley dawn grounds the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The time-frozen village (baker mid-loaf, children mid-tag) and platinum labyrinth are vivid and constrain Marek's journey: he must decode the tapestry threads and walk the physical maze to break the enchantment. The "woven hush…like thick felt" and "steel-blue glow of the frozen moment" are specific and reflect the story's arrested quality. The stone chessboard at the labyrinth's center with the fallen king is the pivotal object that enables closure. Minor limit: the village itself remains somewhat generic (baker, weaver's cottage, fountain) and the thunder functions more as atmospheric motif than spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon, spire, and bone towers anchor early and pressure choices throughout: Lira climbs the spire, angles the mirror, hears echoes that force her shift from reciting to listening. The pale spire's crack charges the final image and the feather becomes a portable constraint (she'll paint with it). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("wind sounded like held breath," "silver backing flaked like old skin"), though some metaphors ("needle stitching sky to stone") tilt decorative. Spatial choreography is clear: base → ledge → down → rim.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vividly anchored early and constrains Lira's choices: the rebreather mask dictates her thirteen-second breath cycles, the porthole frames her view of the statue, and the dissolving anchor-chains create the ticking-clock pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—acid hissing, chains fizzing, the charm glinting—and the workshop's mechanical rhythm ("master gear clanked, timing her exhalations") embodies the setting as a lived constraint. The final image of the charm drifting upward while the workshop sinks charges the closure with environmental consequence. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cave network constrains choice by offering the underground beach and bioluminescent plankton that enable the copying work; the shell wedged at high-tide mark charges the final image with the promise of tidal return. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Ren's artist perception: "mineral breath," "walls glazed by centuries of salt sweat," plankton as freckles. The cleft's "mouth-shaped" entrance and the cave's "cathedral veins" avoid overt symbolism by staying anchored in physical constraint and spatial logic. Micro-setting (driftwood, shell, sand) functions as the studio that makes the closure act possible.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt tower, garden, and dawn light provide vivid anchors, and the sensory details (night flowers, salt air, metallic taste of rain) are selective and atmospheric. The vial cork and fountain at closure create a charged micro-setting. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbol rather than constraining choice—the protagonist moves freely through the lighthouse and garden without spatial friction or resource limitation. The professional duties of lighthouse-keeping (lamp mechanics, beacon pulse adjustment) are gestured at but not grounded in plausible procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    The signal station, transmitter dish, and censer foot all constrain choices and charge the final image effectively. The moon-phase mechanics govern the censer foot's weight and the station's power source, shaping the ritual's timing and the protagonist's agency. The dunes reversing, rooftops breaching, and white flowers sprouting at dawn are vivid, purposeful details that reflect the story's thematic concern with backward migration. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout despite the lyric density. The setting is micro and macro simultaneously—concrete objects (dish, phone, maintenance panel) and landscape-scale transformation—without losing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    The hanging orchard functions as more than backdrop: roots "like nooses" create threat, the oldest tree shelters the climactic choice, and the storm's pause after the protagonist drinks demonstrates environmental response to character action. The glass eye's physical properties (warmth, floating, settling where the scar was) constrain and enable the final transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"fruits knocked together like teeth confessing"—and filtered through the forager's perception. The ravine's vertical space (rope ladder, descent, climb) structures the journey and charges the final ascent with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse lamp room are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist "like milk stirred with silver," tide slapping pilings with rhythm gaps). The spiral staircase and balcony provide clear spatial choreography. The release of the Edelweiss into the tide directly enables closure—petals become "tiny rafts" that carry away her memories—so the micro-object functions as setting and constraint. Nautical twilight and the rotating lens shape her investigative method and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming bioluminescent cavern is vivid and the rising creek recurs as spatial pressure. The matrix chip's warmth and the ivy-hidden opening ground the journey. However, the cavern functions more as spectacle than constraint; Elias's final choice is not shaped by environmental particulars—he could step through in any setting. The creek's rise does not alter his tactics on the page, only frames the metaphor of "carrying away the old life."

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto's physical details—basalt steps glowing with "residue of fallen constellations," black glass lined with ember stones, temperature inversion—are vivid and purposeful. The obsidian shard on the dais functions as a tool that reveals the loop, constraining the queen's final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent across the climb and grotto interior. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual and thermal (warmth/frost paradox), with less embodiment of sound or smell under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ember nexus is concretely rendered: "volcanic glass beneath his boots," "glowing fissures that cracked the ground like luminous veins," "obsidian archway." The shell is handled twice with tactile detail and its spiral recurs with charge. When Corin crushes the pocket-sun, the light "spread outward, bathing the ember nexus in gold that made the volcanic glass sing"—the setting responds and amplifies the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cedar smoke, hemlock grave site, blue glass snow, and iron stove sparks are vivid and POV-filtered through her archivist lens. The cabin functions as micro-setting: the stove accepts another log at a pivotal reflection, the door frames her exit into moonlight, the beams "groan" in response. Footprints she has not yet made constrain her perception of time as non-linear. The setting charges the final image (stone monument, cabin lights dimming) but does not tighten a mid-scene choice with physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    The water clock's gurgle and drip-time, the loupe, and the screw's micro-scratches all constrain Mira's interpretive work and charge the final image ("first drop fell with a sound like a wet newborn gasp"). Spatial choreography is clean (workshop, windows, fog). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through her olfactory absence. The body and tool function as micro-setting that directly enables closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock and its mossy underside, the iron kettle's soundless hiss, and the tea-dark lake create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Lina's choices: no railing, trust or terror required, the plume's timing a live clock. The crow-quill's trimmed tip and its hairline fracture function as tool-as-setting, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (northern edge, opposite placement, knee-high rain bounce). The setting actively shapes the final turn: the platform exhales and rises when she releases her brother's name, embedding the environment in the emotional arc. Minor softness: "storm clouds stacked above like bruised shelves" leans decorative in an otherwise purposeful frame.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive as setting constrains choice materially: the exorcist touches metal shelves, and induced currents guide her hand to the exact folder. The perfume bottle placed on the stave aligns "glass and ink vibrated at the same frequency," charging the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"dust motes drifted like slow arpeggios," "air tasted of iron filings"—filtered through the protagonist's musical idiom. The orchard outside provides temporal pressure (tractors idling, chainsaws). Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the final image (lilac blooming in felled orchard) grounds the ending in place.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The temple library supplies vivid images—cracked basalt, flapping pages, spiral floor—but none constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography (seven steps left, three forward, two diagonal) reads as ornamental pattern rather than lived navigation. The dictionary's physical transformation (pages drifting, cover bulging) charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the environment itself remains postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The horizon measurement station and its brass instruments, tide gauge, and hydraulic systems supply concrete sensory anchors that ground the abstract meditation. The mantle clock key recurs with tactile specificity (teeth worn smooth, grows warm, turned counterclockwise) and directly shapes the final action, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that an object constrain choice or charge closure. Fjord, granite cliffs, and broken shale establish locale with economy. The micro-setting (station edge, chronometer housing) channels the climactic reversal, lifting this category despite the impressionistic opening.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    The rainwashed library and subway are anchored early with sensory specificity ("wet stone and old paper," "clover melancholy"). The lantern's cracked mica pane catches light and charges the final image when she scratches a note on it. However, much of the setting remains descriptive backdrop; the library basement and subway don't meaningfully constrain her choices—she could traverse the city by any method. The micro-setting (lantern, pressed clover) does more work than the macro environment, lifting the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subway utility tunnel, phone booth, and glass harmonica disc function as micro-setting that constrains choice throughout. Spatial choreography is coherent (track bed, rusted gate, sodium light through grate). The disc's physical presence (spinning, ringing, "warm as a pulse") directly shapes the protagonist's final choice to hand it over. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("tasted like rusted rain," "darkness that smelled of fresh ink"). The gate's opening and the rail "leading into dark" charge the closure image with constraint and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The jetty is vividly rendered with selective, pressure-driven detail: salt-rimmed planks, barnacles, sunflower petals dried into wood. The setting constrains choice—contractors test equipment, security patrols—and charges the final image when the archivist hides the copper tube before demolition. Body and tool (walnut ink, copper tube, locket) function as micro-setting elements that directly enable the archival act. Spatial choreography is coherent across the jetty, shore road, and apartment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ivy-choked station is vivid and purposeful: the backward-crawling clock, rusted platform, turquoise paint flakes. The moon seeds planted between rails and the resulting ivy trellis spelling Latin departure times charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across beats (platform three, ticket booth wall, carriage window). The setting constrains and shapes the closure: Kit must leave the station for it to remain a site of reciprocity for others.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and specific (leaves above human hearing tasted as citrus, constellations pausing, dark green walls tightening). The platinum ring and cane function as micro-setting tools that constrain perception and action. The clearing inverts sound and the ground receives the ring's languages, directly enabling the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (ear to moss, cane tapping, kneeling, tracing with fingertips). The forest releases him at dawn, marking the exit and charging the final walk with "inner weather."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    Station Lagrange-9, the viewport, comm-garden, and gravitational anomaly provide concrete spatial anchors. The anomaly constrains choice by borrowing station power and slackening gravity during the edit, making the environment a live participant. The pen's meteoric iridium nib and the quantum-buffer log-scroll add tactile specificity. Sensory detail—recycled air, warm soles of boots, anomaly's silver flare—is selective and grounded in Mira's professional attention. Minor gap: the comm-garden as a literal object and the "log-scroll" mechanics remain slightly underspecified, relying on metaphor over clear spatial logic; we never see Mira move through the station or handle seeds beyond the opening mention.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    The luminous harbor is vividly anchored with selective, POV-filtered detail: "moonlight painted silver ladders across the black water," "corrugated iron," "capstan where sailors once wound anchor chain." The vintage camera, the cannery roof, and the capstan all appear in multiple beats and the advisor's movement around the harbor structures his subtractive process. The setting's spatial choreography remains clean and the moonlight motif charges the final image when "the water itself arranged into slow-moving sheet music, crests and troughs forming whole and half notes under the moon." While the harbor does not constrain a choice in the strict sense, it supplies the medium (water, masts, buildings) that vibrates in the climactic note, narrowly reaching the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archive is described (crumbling archway, soot-stained walls, stone) but does not constrain Ember's descent or choices. Spatial choreography is vague—she "descended deeper" and found the tapestry "behind a false wall" without tactile navigation or obstacle. The collapsing archive at the end is asserted ("began to collapse") without sensory specificity or impact on her exit. The tapestry fragment's warmth is the sole detail that recurs with slight charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sound wave garden, auric lagoon, and quartz bough are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (leaves as "pale green speakers," water chiming at "electrolytes," starlight "like liquid metal"). The garden constrains her escape route (following cricket frequency) and the lagoon water actively responds to her drumming, enabling memory release. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (garden → lagoon → return to bough). Minor: the "upside-down tree" and "soap-bubble helmet" visions add color but do not materially alter Mira's choices or tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly anchored with concrete sensory detail (corrugated corridors, rusted walls, harmonic frequencies during the storm) and charged by the geomagnetic interference that disables GPS. Spatial choreography is clean through the seven-corridor star junction. The environment constrains one choice—Mira's reliance on hand-drawn maps and memory—but the constraint is setup rather than a pivot; once inside, the labyrinth becomes stage rather than active pressure. The final chamber and resonating containers charge the ending image, lifting the score into mid-7s despite limited tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt dock, rain-slicked planks, canal water, and salvaged cypress shutters anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. The dental mirror and floating frame constrain the guardian's tactic (angling, bouncing light, weaving patterns). The setting participates in the closure: "the canal kept its new secret, rocking it beneath the pier" charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—sight and touch dominate, filtered through the guardian's silent, patient attention.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("stone walls breathing the cold hush," "reference cards stirred like roosting birds"), and the magnetic grotto functions as a micro-setting that guides Mara's path. The midnight town—shuttered shops, mannequins, synchronized windows—supplies concrete staging for the rebellion. The grotto's "tiny iron trees quivering toward a painted sky" reappears at closure when real and false roots entwine, charging the final image. Spatial choreography across twenty windows remains legible if compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sublittoral fringe is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail—"breathing rocks," "starved lichens," barnacled ladder—and the whale's call vibrates "through sole and soul," constraining Lira's final choice to engage the ocean on embodied terms. The scrimshaw as micro-object charges the closure image when she releases it. Spatial choreography remains clear across the raft assembly, and the setting subtly mirrors the thematic shift from violence to tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    The wind turbines function as persistent constraint and atmosphere generator, shaping both micro-action (shavings snatched, updraft scattering petals) and the closure image (wooden feather lodged in joint, wrapper flag). The farmhouse porch and dried bouquet anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Sensory detail—scrape transmitted via hidden mic, crow's electric-white feather, soil darkening—is selective and purposeful. The turbines' "whoosh now sounded like a distant audience exhaling" charges the final third without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake supply vivid, purposeful anchors; sensory detail (A-flat hum, green glow, hairline fissures) is selective and filtered through the poet's perception. The quartz pillars constrain her method (she must let them "paraphrase themselves") and the ice's density shift charges the final crossing. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ellipse walk and lake traverse, and the setting evolution (ice to mist) tracks causally with her recitation, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard anchors early and recurs as the site of plant arrangements and the final spiral garden, constraining Milo's communication method and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid ("fogged with steam," "ultraviolet," "copper and teal") but tilts heavily visual; other senses are underused. The glassblower's tools (kiln, furnace, welding mask) appear but do not constrain a choice until the collaborative glass-blowing scene, which itself is summarized rather than enacted with tactile pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    The laboratory is described in atmospheric generalities ("cathedral of forgotten frequencies") without spatial anchors or micro-setting constraints that shape choice. The carbide lamp lens recurs but functions as symbolic token rather than tool; its "cracked glass" never alters a tactic. Golden shadows appear throughout but remain decorative metaphor, not environment that pressures decision. The spiral pattern at center is staged but does not constrain the song or the collectors' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory's fantastical elements (curtains of intention, celestial maps tracking souls) are vivid but function as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The tattoo stencil's coordinates "matched perfectly" is told convenience. Spatial choreography across "many chambers" remains generic; no specific room layout alters her movement or decision. The final origami placement uses the stencil itself, a micro-setting moment, but it does not visibly limit options.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is established early and constrains action throughout: rain sounds "like a coin falling into an empty wallet," mist turns the loft into a camera obscura projecting streetlights onto cards, and the drying skylight at dawn marks closure. The measuring tape, floorboards, and ink-stained footprints function as micro-setting that drives the mapping method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the cartomancer's professional eye for geometry and atmosphere-as-barometrics). The crypto-crash backdrop and "scavenged marketplaces" ground the world economically without catalog exposition. One missed opportunity: the reclaimed-oak floor is named but never leveraged for a choice or sensory contrast under her bare feet beyond the foil-fleck data point.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid but generic ("copper tears," "luminous dust") and never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The archive's layout is never mapped; the protagonist moves through "corridors" and finds a "memory chamber" without spatial coherence or consequence. The bronze prism pagoda recurs frequently but remains an ornamental symbol rather than a tool that shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming library above clouds is vivid and atmospheric, with orchid-walls that exhale perfume and release archived dreams. The setting constrains choices minimally—Mira's actions could occur in any archive—but the glass balcony and the drowned world below establish spatial stakes. The river stone functions as micro-setting and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, constraining her final choice to internalize rather than drop it. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's dusk-noticer lens, though the "clouds" and "drowned world" remain abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The misty workshop, cedar table, iron stove, and refrigerated drawer function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable Miren's reconstruction ritual. The chameleon's color shifts (leaf-green to slate, then star-color) are filtered through her perceptual bias and charge the final image when Aster melts into silver darkness. Spatial choreography remains clear across interior and exterior beats. The cedar plaque above the door and the field under stars supply concrete anchors that shape the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower, osage tree, windowsill, and underground clay jar supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain action (the protagonist physically roots through stone, the miracle is trapped underground). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "frosted hourglass," "tannic grooves," "phosphorescent xylem." The coffee rings function as micro-setting, enabling the tunnel action that drives the middle beat. The final image (seed on windowsill replacing hourglass) charges closure by making displacement tangible and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The projection booth is vividly anchored—rusted reel, tiny window framing empty auditorium, ancient mechanisms—and the spatial details (narrow stair, balcony door, velvet seats) guide action. Sensory specificity is strong: "dust floated like slow film frames," "wax that smelled of nitrate film," "hushed thunder outside—storm without rain, like applause trapped behind velvet curtains." The booth's tools (tweezers, crystal sphere, film canister) are handled on the page. The setting charges the final image when "pigeons fluttered like white sprocket holes" and rain drums the marquee, though the metaphoric density occasionally ornamentalizes rather than constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The aurora-lit archway is signaled in the opening line, pressures the protagonist's timeline ("Tonight the archway's curtains…hung low enough"), and charges the final image when it folds into "a single emerald point above her heart." The astronomical instrument functions as micro-setting: its parts (latitude scale, polar axis, counterweights) are handled across multiple beats and reassembled into a body-constellation that enables the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (breath frosting the scale, cheek against frost, ribbons of liquid light), filtered through the protagonist's perceptual priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune supplies the closure arena: phosphorescent poppies, glassy sand, and buried rails anchor spatial logic. The chess clock strapped to the guard's heart and the strongbox half-buried in light constrain the ritual sequence. The final image—clock buried, poppies dimmed, light transferred—charges the ending. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (petals flickering like defective film frames, scorched lock as screaming mouth), filtered through the guard's professional lens. However, the guard's body and tactile interaction remain abstract; no sweat, breath, or physical strain accompanies the ritual, which at this length could deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and abundant ("quartz roots," "mercury brook," "data-loam"), filtered through a consistent surreal-philosophical lens. The mechanical rainforest constrains the philosopher's path (she climbs the kapok elevator, matches the jaguar's breathing) and charges the final image (she becomes a banyan). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the rapid shifts (rainforest → shore → metro illusion → back to rainforest) risk disorientation. The world rules (translocation, gear-driven identity) remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "veiled ridgeway," "twilight mist," and "shoreline" establish a liminal atmosphere, and the ticket punch appears in multiple beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague—the cliff's appearance and the guides' path lack concrete grounding—and sensory detail defaults to stock twilight imagery (amber lanterns, dew, mist). The ticket punch's star stamp charges the final turn when pressed to the hound's forehead, offering micro-setting constraint that elevates the score above ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt fortress, spiral staircase with its pale discoloration, and the falling snow create a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and charges atmosphere. Sensory detail is purposeful: "air tasted of metal and old songs," "meltwater constellations on the stone," "frostbitten hope crystallizing on his lashes." The piano bench bolt functions as tactile anchor across beats. The final image of snow erasing footprints while the boy's knuckles whiten "like sunrise through ice" directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library setting is vivid and purposeful: leaning shelves, balustrades, spiral carrel, and cracked portico create a coherent spatial stage. The iron gall ink pellet, though small, functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the titan's method and charges the final image when it "flew to him, dissolving back into a drop of liquid night." Sensory detail is selective—"rust smell," "parchment breath," "faintly of storms"—and filtered through a consistent elevated register. The "ancient temple library lost in time" and the "pause of shifting constellations" frame the action without becoming tourist catalog, though the animate dust motes and roaring stone lions veer toward ornamental symbolism rather than spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The station on stilts, lagoon, thermocline, and limestone ridge are rendered through vivid, POV-filtered detail (white mantis, green tunnels, ceremonial stairs). The hydrophone and submersible function as micro-setting tools that enable the descent and constrain choice. The final image of the station as "gate left ajar" charges closure by reweighting the sentinel motif established early. Sensory selection reflects urgency underwater while the opening grants breathing room. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ladder to sub to seafloor to pillars.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spaceport is vividly rendered with "cracked ferrocrete," "ruptured fuel line," "broken gantries," and swallows nesting in machinery. The setting provides the opera glasses, the crane, and the shuttle—all essential to the plot. The twin suns and "bruise-colored sky" establish atmosphere, and the hangar's acoustics ("resonator," "wind instrument") enable the climactic hum. Spatial choreography is clean (floor → crane jib → shuttle bridge). However, the stone circle beneath the foundation is introduced late without prior setup, weakening the micro-setting's constraint role. Strong sensory work and causal involvement, but the buried henge feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The volcanic grotto functions as micro-setting with pressure: fifty-two-degree threshold gates the embryo revival, mineral clouds enable epigenetic editing, and the steam/moss physically constrain the guard encounter. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("pumice," "basalt," "thermophilic moss"), avoiding postcard catalogs. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (descent, basin, hanging vine, exit). The setting charges the final image (wax seal from sacred torch, embryo tucked where heartbeat substitutes for ultrasound) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arboretum charges every choice: outer path "where soil is thin," iron railing, dragon's-blood pine all serve as physical anchors for the somatic-mapping ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—eucalyptus, resin, salt—recurring to constrain the grief-management method. The final act (pressing photograph to bark, releasing it seaward) depends on the setting's verticality and the tree's resin properties. Micro-setting (body as landscape: collarbone, wrist, temple) also functions as constraint. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the setting drives the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: sinking nightly, contracting shelves, spilling atlases create spatial pressure that mirrors Elian's descent. The tarot box and mirror function as micro-setting objects that constrain his final choice. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (mildewed breath, salt-stained ledgers, candle "the color of low tide"), filtered through a lyric lens. The environment charges the final image—stepping through into "black water"—meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    The wind-carved sandstone encampment is vivid and purposeful—walls holding heat, corridors as maze—but setting mostly serves as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The ink circle and shadow imagery charge the portal moment, and the drone's ultraviolet light adds tactical texture. Spatial choreography remains coherent. The micro-setting (ink on sandstone) does participate in closure, lifting the score into the mid-6s, but the desert itself never directly alters Kael's tactics or final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cryogenic library under snow is vividly rendered—frost on breath, glass columns humming, narrow maintenance shaft where exhalations melt on live copper—and these details do more than decorate: the shaft's narrowness and the live wires Sera secretly kept powered shape her tactical choice. The recurring snow (opening, dome rupture at the end) charges the final image, and the body-as-setting (thermal sleeve, frosting pod glass) constrains action. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from console to atlas quadrant to hatch to dais. Minor slip: "echoing library" is declared but not demonstrated through sound or resonance in action, and the professional detail of archival work remains generic rather than occupation-specific when it could have deepened her relationship to the texts.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass-domed greenhouse is well-anchored early and constrains choice through its enclosed, liminal space between desert and cultivation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze of sunset," cracked dome filtering light. The setting charges the final image when Mira plants the cutting "in the exact spot" where the airbag fell, converting spatial specificity into emotional resonance. Minor issue: the tower's fall and airbag crash are referenced but remain spatially vague outside the greenhouse perimeter.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized through synesthetic detail (chords blooming underfoot, zigzag sonic vines, emotional colors bleeding from constellations) and constrains Mara's tactics—she must use silence rather than sound to avoid feeding the vines. The rail spike's iron memory and the tideline anchor specificity. However, the garden's mechanics (how driving a spike "splits the sound bed" into "a thirsty artery") remain more poetic assertion than legible physical logic, which slightly weakens the sense that environment dictates choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is vividly rendered ("starlight dripped through the slit roof and pooled on the slate floor") and the clockwork projector constrains the ritual's mechanics. The rosewood nib and its splintering charge the final beats. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (dome, stairs, funicular, loading dock). The clouds and funicular descent provide atmospheric punctuation but do not materially alter Cordelia's choices; the setting functions more as stage than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The laboratory's physical details—drawers that "sighed open," letters with wet ink dated centuries ago, the hologram crib mobile—are vivid and serve dual duty as atmosphere and constraint. The amber with its insect and the brass stylus are handled repeatedly and matter to the closure: she tethers the amber, then the insect dissolves into the lullaby, and the stylus inks the console's "wooden cheek." The "meteor hush" anchors tone and recurs at the retrospective vision and final line, charging the ending. Spatial choreography is clean within the single-room scene. Micro-setting (console, amber, stylus, letters) functions as setting and satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The whispering grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: damp stone, mist, nonexistent voice, and the "emergent hush" all pressure Mira's silence and shape her choice to let patterns "interject for her." The mandala's ground quartz and sand are handled across multiple beats, and the final scattering charges the closure image. Sensory detail (lilac unease as color on skin, scent of rain on hot brick, porcelain snow melting) is vivid and filtered through Mira's artistic perception. The grotto's "softer cavity" left behind is a purposeful spatial legacy that ties setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shattered sky, minaret, and cracked stepping stone are vivid and consistent. The tesserae function as both texture and constraint: the number forty-nine and their placement guide Asha's ritual, charging the final mosaic. Sensory hierarchy (touch over sight) reflects her work and the night setting. However, the plaza's spatial choreography during the closure sequence—how others find the work, how the pattern "spread outward"—remains abstract. The micro-setting (stepping stone) constrains one choice and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate partially.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and layered (velvet curtain, hedge maze, quince/pear orchard, cracked marble stage, night-blooming nicotia). The orchard's sensory details (perfume as violins, fruit glowing like footlights) are filtered through the ghost's synesthetic perception and serve the closure image. The maze "rearranges itself" and the orchard "existed only because enough mourners had remembered it" are purposeful world rules that frame the ghost's access to the past. The tarot coin (micro-setting object) constrains the ritual and charges the final image when pocketed warm. Spatial choreography is clean across alley, maze, and stage.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    The light painting studio is established early with vivid sensory detail (beams of colored light, mirrors, projectors) and serves as the crucible for discovery and later sanctuary. The muscovite geode's physical properties (mica layers, static response) constrain Mira's experimentation and enable the solution. However, the studio's spatial choreography becomes vague during the montage of helping others—we lose the sense of bodies, tools, and proximity that grounded the opening. The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a choice at closure, limiting its integration.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal cave is vividly anchored—salt-curtains, bioluminescent light, tide line, mineral floor—and the setting directly constrains Aera's method (she collects thermal glyphs from the walls). The elm fossil's hover above the tide line and the staff's post-transformation float both charge the final image and impose a spatial logic that matters. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "breath clouding in bioluminescent light," "cheek against the mineral floor now warm as mammal skin." The cave walls' color inversion (ochre/violet draining into the leaf, then re-illuminating cooler) tracks causally and mirrors the thematic shift from borrowed sorrow to spoken witness.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse is vividly rendered—"resinous beams filtered dusk into fossilized honey"—and the buttons themselves function as micro-setting, each one (horn toggles, jet beads, brass disc) carrying sensory and social texture. The spiral on the warehouse floor constrains the protagonist's final stance, literally placing her at its center for the climactic jar-opening. The cliffs frame both arrival and departure, and the monastery tower glints "like a needle," threading the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting actively charges the ending rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Zephyr Bluff is anchored early with mist, cliffside path, frost, and briars; the decommissioned listening station supplies concrete constraints (dead keypad, jump-start trick, wind-turbine trickle, vacuum tubes). The pillbox battery and tarp-strip bandage show micro-setting shaping tactics. The snowdrop blooming through slate charges the final image and ties to the courage motif without forced symbolism. However, the interior station ("mold and salt, consoles draped in ghostly tarps like furniture in an abandoned chapel") leans decorative; no element of the console layout or station geography alters a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog-bound river crossing is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rain gutters ticking, ankle-deep mist, spindrift serenity) and the setting meaningfully constrains the coachman's choice—he must act before the gutters stop or the crossing sinks. The yarn needle and thread function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when the sphere is tucked beneath his tongue. The sandbar rising into a hill that replaces the river provides a clear spatial transformation that mirrors the narrative shift. Spatial choreography is clean: coach to mist-walk to sandbar to meadow. The piece maintains atmospheric coherence (fog, vapor, grayscale) without catalog drift, and the ticking gutters serve as both countdown and tonal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: cracked white hives, wax ghosts, honey-turned-to-ash air, the single thriving apricot tree. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through Lin's potter's perspective ("clay remembers," kiln logic). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, its flaked silvering and sun-pattern etchings constraining Lin's method of navigation and alignment. Spatial choreography is clear across beats (stepping over hives, kneeling beneath the apricot, lifting the glass). The scorched wasteland frames the oasis as an island of potential restoration, and the environment directly enables the closure act (shadow, breeze, dew). Minor issue: the "copper sky" and "chimney smoke" recur as atmospheric anchors but remain somewhat generic; the wasteland itself lacks tactile specificity beyond "scorched."

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fire escape, rooftop garden, harbor, and basement stairwell constrain Mara's choices throughout: the bolted door forces theft of the gauge tooth, the moon provides working light, the descent into mildew-scented darkness guides pacing, and the rooftop parapet becomes the teaching platform. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "diesel and starfish," "salt-stained concrete," lavender as homesick memory. The lockmaster's gauge tooth and watering can function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when the tooth falls into the gutter where nasturtium will root. Minor deduction for occasional postcard framing ("luminous harbor by moonlight") that risks static beauty over pressure, but spatial choreography remains clear and the garden's stolen-inches status shapes every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: salt-crystal volumes, cloud-suspended shelves, and the stone circle beneath the observatory provide resources (indexes, protocol, hum) and pressure (the chorus memory, the sundial gnomon as stylus). The brass sundial is handled twice (perch, rotation to mark decision), and the atomically reflective feathers scatter moonlight to disperse the chorus—environment charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (clouds drifting, bass note older than parchment, warm metal talons), filtered through the gryphon's priorities. Spatial choreography is clean across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and pontoon bridge constrain movement and charge the final image with purposeful detail (moon-white stone, chiming footfalls, breathing walls). The oculus projection and red thread function as micro-setting that enables the protagonist's climactic gesture. Sensory selection is vivid and filtered through the ghostwriter's lens (wet marble, incense burned long ago, copper dusk). The temple's closing petals at the end participate in closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    The radio station functions as micro-setting: burnt solder, vinyl dust, cinder-block texture anchor POV. The emergency generator and transmitter tower constrain Lyra's tactical choices (she must manually patch, time the photocell, trust the antique rig). The astronomical charts function as recurring object-as-setting that shapes decisions (she trusts ink over improvisation). The quad livestream and town loudspeakers extend spatial reach without losing coherence. The final dawn image—"old bone" light over the divided community—charges closure by contrasting the ethereal grit of her night's work.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nexus setting actively constrains: cracked glass roof, three converging rails, timber sleeper all become functional elements (compass drills the sleeper, rails warp into jaws, glass shows the keyhole formation). The compass point—a micro-setting object—anchors the pivotal turn: its transfixed shadow becomes the geometric pivot. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "wet parchment and candle smoke" in the shaft, "slimy bricks" during descent. The missing pane circle at the end charges the final image with precise spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quarry is vividly rendered—"jagged throat," "furrowed hush," mist as guilt—and the kerosene lamp, shale, and ribbon function as tactile anchors throughout. The ribbon's dual weave (synthetic silk / human hair) directly enables the climactic realization, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the quarry rim, easel setup, and walk to the precinct gate.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The weather station setting is vivid and specific: spongey plankwalk, mildew on aluminum walls, barometers screaming, experimental kites. The copper nail functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final beats (rechristened as a stylus, etching coordinates). The dirigible launch and wreck recovery are grounded in spatial detail (nine nautical miles south, restricted test zone, gondola floor), and the sky-as-library image at closure directly engages the setting to reweight memory versus erasure. The shoal where journals were found becomes the wreck site, closing the spatial loop. This meets the 9+ quick test: environment and recurring object constrain choices and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mountain pullout, guardrail, and gorge anchor spatially and the glass flake functions as a micro-object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid ("dusk bled across the valley like a slow photograph developing") and filtered through the fiddler's perceptual lens. However, the pullout does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains a lyric stage rather than a pressure point that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and selective: trumpet vines, peeling posters, rust drip, iron floor. The lion-car interior constrains the ritual (laying bills "across the iron floor") and the fire's respect for "the spiral's edge" charges the closure image. Sensory detail remains purposeful and filtered through Jonah's nostalgic, ritualistic lens. The startup hoodie logo and the circus train's "silence, satisfied" personification nudge toward symbolic convenience, but the environment shapes the final action (stepping off opposite ends) with visible spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The copper-domed observatory, great refractor, and desert overlay are vivid and purposeful. The daylily telegram as micro-setting charges the final image (blooming between pages of starlight). The sensory hierarchy is selective: "star-charts rustled like sleeping birds," "hairline cracks in the metal sealed." Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting subtly guides choice (the telescope as witness-tool, the dome transforming into desert sky). However, the desert temple remains largely abstract; the sandstone pillars and inscriptions are described but do not constrain a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The swirling orchard vortex operates as micro-setting that constrains Briar's path: each floating root bobs under weight, apples frozen mid-rot supply the seed's visual echo, and the mirrored water at the seventh circle forces the confession's medium. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"blood steamed on ice like a war banner," "vines wrapping her arm but stopping at the elbow"—and filtered through Briar's druidic lens (trees as companions, roots as siege towers). Spatial choreography is coherent across the expanding circles. The final image of the lake sealing "its silver eye" charges closure by reconfiguring the vortex from threat to witness, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt glade supplies vivid sensory anchors ("metallic hush," "mirrored blades," "eclipsed covenant") and the maze's breathing walls create tactile pressure. The topiary clipping functions as both tool and constraint, guiding the protagonist and ultimately grafting into flesh, which charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across hedge corridors and the child encounter. The setting decisively shapes the climax: without the glade's sap-and-circuitry infrastructure, the grafting and covenant renewal cannot occur.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard—roots threading skulls, fruit glowing post-ritual—constrains the barter and charges the closure (sprout beneath gatekeeper's skull). Micro-setting details (apple seed in split cranium, bones jutting between roots) recur with evolving significance. Spatial choreography remains clear through corridors, hollow, gate. The orchard's ledger metaphor integrates without becoming static tour.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry office trailer and the water-filled quarry bowl are vivid and specific, charged with Mason's past (the Iron Eden album cover location). The patched microphone and PA system constrain his action—he cannot simply speak his grief; he must physically repair the mic, grounding the epiphany in tactile work. The final image of his voice echoing across the starlit quarry integrates setting, object, and theme without overt symbolism. Minor slip: the foreman's sudden entrance is spatially vague, and the trailer's interior layout (desk, crate, PA unit) is not choreographed for clarity during the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered (iron leaves, Morse-like clicks, swaying planks) and actively constrains Mira's movements: she kneels at the rail joint, etches the magnetic leaf, and the arbor's resonance triggers the mirrored sky. The clouds, seed, and filament are handled with tactile specificity. The final obsidian bloom dropping into the mirrored sky charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate's requirement that setting or recurring object constrain choice or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium is vivid and integrated: seawater laps at marble steps, ankle-deep water soaks shelves, the skylight reveals a smeared sky. Setting details constrain the librarian's actions (she steps into surge, plants the creel in the floor where tiles depict constellations) and the atrium's breathing rhythm mirrors her pistons. The creel—a micro-setting object—charges the closure by sprouting roots that knit the archive to the seabed, ensuring continuity beyond her memory. The setting shapes tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal caves constrain movement (nautilus spiral, narrowing passage) and the pearl's glow illuminates confessions, directly enabling Mara's progression toward the chamber. The crown and mirror function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("air tasted of salt and iron," "walls slick with mineral tears"), filtered through Mara's inspection-trained eye. The caves' spiral architecture and the quartz mirror both reappear at closure, grounding the transformation in setting rather than abstract space.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused station, ivy, rusted platform, underground tunnel, and stream are rendered with specific sensory detail (cracked tile, weeping brick, coal dust smell, mica flecks) and the environment constrains choice—Lila follows sound, pries up planks, descends iron stairs, steps into cold water. The accordion as micro-setting object (patched bellows, broken reeds) charges the final image when water flows through it. The station's spatial choreography is clear across moves. Slight excess: some descriptors ("ivy-choked," "accordion bellows patched with tape") recur without added function.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing library offers vivid texture (phosphorescent tiles, mist, shelves in temporal phases) but remains a backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes a choice. The mother's rose-silk apology is decorative—touched once, bled, then abandoned. Spatial choreography is vague: movement "through propagation delays" and "between shelves" never grounds the reader in a legible map. The watch as micro-setting object is handled but does not constrain tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet observatory is vividly described with sensory specificity (crushed lilac, bruised purple dome), and the ice violin's refractive properties are integrated into multiple beats. The cereus's roots anchor Lira physically at the decision point, demonstrating micro-setting constraint. However, much of the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than shaping tactical choices; the midsummer timeframe and observatory location could be swapped without fundamentally altering Lira's decision logic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, and mirror pool are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (starlight dripping, ice orchids, color-trembling water). However, the environment functions primarily as spectacle; the pool's properties are never tested or resisted, and no spatial constraint shapes a choice. The emerald chip and sable wand appear as props without physical friction—no weight, temperature, or resistance that would anchor them as tools under pressure. The grotto's "threshold of stillness" remains an abstract assertion rather than a felt spatial logic that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The umbral grotto, moon-ash, and vineyard setting are vivid and atmospheric, with selective sensory detail (grape-cooled air, tannin smell, bioluminescent ivy). The hairpin constrains a pivotal choice when stabbed into the cliff to anchor the boy, and the scallop shell fused to the pin charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear through the climb and descent. However, the grotto functions more as symbolic backdrop than active constraint—its "law of the cycle" is declared rather than dramatized through environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse setting constrains the overnight vigil and the observation deck stages the wind-chime work. Sensory details are purposeful: salt breeze, fog pressing glass, dawn's pale thread. The hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting/tool, reappearing to frame the geologist's vision of coral gardens and finally filled with grief at departure, thus charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, sycamore canopy, and pond are vividly named and atmospherically rendered. The stone as micro-setting constrains the teaching ritual and charges the final image when Marcus picks it up. Spatial choreography remains clear (kneeling at pond's edge, cross-legged behind). However, the magnetic grotto "pulling at the iron in her blood" and the platform's physics are asserted without dramatized consequence; they do not alter a choice or tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bone towers, canyon, and dust are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (the towers "hummed," dust "whispered," canyon a "throat of endless echoes"). However, setting remains postcard backdrop—none of these elements constrains a choice or alters Cael's tactics; he simply sings and the environment responds on cue. The micro-setting test (body, tool, or object constraining choice) is unmet: the arrowhead is held and later "merges" but does not shape any on-page decision with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, frost-laced balcony, garden folly columns, and mist stair all constrain Elian's movement and choices—algorithms sealing air into glass forces urgency, the folly's transparency holds "memory of vines," the drifting snow island maroons him. Sensory detail (lilacs and printer toner, cold teaching patience) is filtered through his POV and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Minor gap: the factory cities below arrive late and feel postcard rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The submerged galleon *Mercy's Log* provides vivid spatial detail (broken ribs, bolted books, iron safe) and air-pocket choreography that Jin navigates cautiously. The bioluminescent plankton and glass shell are tactile anchors. The drowned library constrains Jin's breathing and choice of route, and the final image ties plankton trail to altered lamplight, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ambered observatory deck constrains Lira's isolation and supplies the coins, spiral grooves, and chrysalis wrapping that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "burnt umber to molten gold," "cold brass rail," "frozen starlight." The contracted universe as setting pressure is consistent and shapes the stakes. Micro-setting (the body as antenna, the spiral on the deck) directly affects the climactic choice to swallow the coins.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory supplies concrete anchors (quartz dust, rusted seams, cooling metal) and the atlas page constrains multiple choices (he spreads it, traces a tentacle leaving frost, tears it into paper souls). The copper pooling around boots and reflecting the brother's face charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy is present (dusk as liquid copper, starlight dripping) though some details veer toward decorative lyricism without adding spatial constraint. The micro-setting—atlas page as physical object—successfully charges the final image when torn and released.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sapphire viaduct's arches and the dry seabed anchor the opening; dawn light striking the bell is purposeful and returns at closure. The bell's rust and the transparent minnows charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear in the single location, and the viaduct's hum and the rising water constrain Kael's decision to stay. The years-long span lacks environmental evolution detail (weather, decay, seasonal change), but the core setting elements—viaduct, bell, drip—drive the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ridgeway, silt-choked lounge, and resurfacing rooftops are vivid and selective, filtered through Marisol's professional lens (souvenir divers, attic peaks). The sapphire bottle and art-deco sign function as charged objects that constrain her choice to tear the label rather than preserve it. Spatial choreography is clean (descent, window entry, hallway trail, ridge return). The wind chime bookends the piece and charges the final image by returning restrung, a micro-setting element that reweights her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hidden orchard supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: spiral trees gripping mica, quince fruit smelling of "winter apples and distant thunder," the waterfall's kaleidoscopic spray. Sensory selection is strong and POV-filtered (alchemist notices mica flash, metallic taste, hush). The frozen dew crystal's location—wedged between mica and bark—constrains the search and shapes the ritual circle, directly affecting the climactic choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (three spirals north, two roots east). The orchard functions as more than backdrop; it guides action and charges the final image when she steps back through the waterfall.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal arbor and vertical staging (highest bough, glider's level, descent branch-by-branch) constrain movement and choice throughout; the parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, its tactile detail (scratches, false catch, snap) charging multiple beats and the final handoff. Sensory selection reflects urgency: pulse as "soundless echo," breath clouds, moon-reflection mask. One cap: the "above the clouds" detail remains atmospheric rather than materially affecting a choice (no wind, no altitude consequence), and the arbor's specifics (leaf/wind rhythm cataloging) are asserted more than demonstrated in action. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting earns its place but does not reach indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating rock dojo, rewritten Pacific, and bamboo halls supply vivid anchors. The brain jar appears in multiple beats and the nutrient fluid's glow charges the ritual. Spatial choreography remains clear (kneeling opposite, blade between, joined hands), and the crèche grounds the ending. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice—characters could conduct the ritual anywhere—so the setting functions as atmosphere rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The echo-chamber tunnel constrains and charges the entire climax: its concrete acoustics enable the lullaby layering and the giggle's multiplication, and Ellery physically presses his palms to the wall to feel vibration travel "through stone into his bones." The pull-cord handle and hourglass function as micro-setting anchors that bookend the piece. Spatial choreography remains clean (garage → street → tunnel → home). Minor gap: the suburban houses and porch lights are gestured at but remain generic; one specific sensory anchor (dog breed, streetlight hum) would have lifted the neighborhood into lived particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen garden operates as micro-setting throughout: rosemary brittle as parchment, ice reflecting the moon as illuminated initial, the boundary breathing with tidal light. These details are filtered through the guardian's bibliographic lens and constrain her approach—she must wait for the veil to thin rather than force entry. The pendant's temperature shifts (warm, then cooling to "acceptance") function as environmental feedback that guides her final choice to leave it behind. Spatial choreography remains clean across the approach, the threshold negotiation, and the return with mist filling her tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember nexus and its six glassy fissures are spatially clear and materially specific. The crozier's physical transformation (petrified bloom, translucent with crimson lightning, silver leaves) is vivid. The nexus constrains the ritual by providing "the hottest vein" and seals at the end with glassy seeds, lightly charging closure. Sensory detail is selective (myrrh/ozone, chiming leaves) but some descriptions float without POV filter—"frozen lightning" and "cold petals on his lungs" read more authorial than character-perceived.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned radio tower city and gorge are vivid and coherent throughout, with sensory specificity (rusted iron, bloated moon, girders creaking). The setting pressures the protagonist's work—lunar perigee tugs the structure, antennas hum with grammar, the tower stops swaying at the climax—demonstrating environment-as-constraint. Spatial choreography is clear: catwalk, maintenance hatch, transmitter room, descent. However, the micro-setting (the tuning coil, the fragment) doesn't demonstrably alter a tactical choice; the interpreter's actions feel preordained rather than forced by environmental limits or tool constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spectral grotto—phosphorescent barnacles, knitting stalactites, two skies stitched by auroral thread—constrains Arden's steering choices and charges the closure when it parts to reveal the merged sky. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (chrome radio ice-cold, coffee machine gurgling, glass dust settling like frost), filtered through Arden's urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear: ferry rail flickering starboard/portside, passengers on benches, Arden at helm then bow. The grotto functions as micro-setting that alters tactics (steering via barnacle patterns) and directly shapes the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor slip: the dock and open water at the end lack the same textural density, softening the landing slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    The gallery's impossible geometry (Möbius corridors, paintings with tracking eyes, windows appearing at dawn) provides vivid sensory texture and constrains movement conceptually, but spatial choreography remains vague—where exactly does she stand when weaving, and how do walls "erupt in slow motion" without altering her position? The sinew thread catches on "corners that shouldn't exist," a purposeful constraint, and the final image of breathing walls returns with modest thematic weight. However, the body never uses a specific architectural feature to solve a problem or alter tactics, keeping the setting largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The benthic city is vividly rendered through coral towers, bioluminescent plankton, shell and basalt amphitheater, and the sealed surface hatch. Spatial choreography is clear: class in amphitheater, ascent to spire, return swim. The chain link functions as micro-setting, constraining the lesson and charging the final exchange. The leviathan alien craft's passage illustrates edge geometry in action, confirming method and deepening atmosphere. Sensory selection is purposeful—cold water, blue glow, crushed shell—and filtered through the instructor's grief and professional focus. The spire and sealed sky charge the ending image, meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: vines mimicking heart valves, condensation recording heartbeats in rust, sodium-orange glow. The koi pond's low wall constrains Mira's choice during confrontation, and the hearing aid functions as micro-setting, shaping her access to the dead. Spatial choreography remains clear across the conservatory, archive, and atrium. Some descriptions (orchid rot, spectral ribbons) lean decorative without altering tactics, but the setting charges the final image of mist burning off at sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The facility's physical constraints drive the narrative: rusted bulkhead, tidal groans, narrowing corridor that becomes "a throat of stone," volcanic glass that scrapes her knees. Micro-setting operates through the gold fleck as tactile anchor, transitioning from solid to liquid thread. The undersea cables function as both physical infrastructure and conduit for the signal-entity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through descent, cable vault, and return ascent. The "moonlit deck" and "waves licked her boots" ground the ending moment. The environment directly constrains Mara's choices (crawling through narrowing stone) and the tidal timeframe charges the final image ("the moment between inflow and outflow when the world holds its breath").

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal observatory's dome, ink-stained chart table, and porcelain shard constrain choices and charge the closure: the protagonist kneels at the table to defragment via ink, opens the dome hatch to descend, and presses the shard to chest in the final image. Snow taps "stay, stay, stay" in Morse, creating situational pressure against departure. The valley's "quiet certificate of continued existence" and library annex ground the clerk encounter spatially. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"cold air razors my new lungs," "tears freezing on her lashes like tiny observatory domes"—and the opal-lit starlight bookends the piece. The mechanical tick inside ribs and wet footprints "that match no living pair of shoes" function as micro-setting that externalizes the digital-ghost state.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and tunnel of echoes constrain the protagonist's method (she must enter the resonant space to translate texture into sound) and charge the final image (her statue conducts the choirs, the diamond beats inside stone). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "air felt textured, like running one's tongue over unglazed pottery," "crack shaped like a heron's wing." The pouch, cloth of crow feathers, and skull's dome function as micro-setting that shapes her ritual. The environment is indispensable to both tactic and closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underground garden is vividly rendered with moon-white mandrake, frost-kissed henbane, and glass ceiling fog, and the herbalist's note provides concrete social texture. The flint arrowhead and cordless phone function as micro-setting elements that constrain early action (Mara crouches, records, presses flint to soil) and charge the final image when she becomes "arrowhead heart ticking like a metronome." However, spatial choreography wobbles—Mara moves from catacombs to rooftop via "spiral staircase of living vines" without clear intermediate geography, and the mandrakes "blooming through pavement" at the end contradicts the underground setting established earlier. Sensory detail is strong but occasionally generic ("dawn bled pale green").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky-bridge, orchard rows, and "glass parted like water" create vivid spatial anchors. The locust shell's veins matching bridge cables and the "blossoms became tiny lanterns" charging the exit path demonstrate setting-as-constraint that shapes Calla's final move. Sensory selection is poetic and consistent, though some details (bronze guardians, moon-gray towers) serve mood more than choice-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade, maintenance tunnel, and rusted mailbox are vividly rendered and constrain Riven's path: the drone cannot follow into the tunnel, the arcade houses the one responsive console, and the mailbox's lock requires the key. Sensory detail is purposeful—"ozone and old tickets," "neon veins flickering," "violet against the glass"—and filtered through a world where promises are contraband. Micro-setting (the coin-return slot, the high-score table door) drives tactical choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations, and the environment evolves causally (rain short-circuits the drone, letters lift). The setting does more than one job: it pressures, symbolizes, and delivers resources that shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting detail is vivid and purposeful: the overturned car with vines, the shallow pool mirroring sky, and the rusted train carriages all charge the final image and constrain the carpenter's movement. The micro-setting (the pool as a stage for the halo fragment) directly enables the climactic moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the circus-train environment recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test partially but not fully—no single environmental constraint forces a tactical choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Hyperbolic geometry shelves that "curved away…like the inside of a seashell" and "angled away from each other at 179 degrees, then 181, then beyond what Euclid would allow" vividly anchor the scientific poetry library's surreal architecture. The scarf functions as micro-setting, its warmth guiding navigation and its tattered silk glowing at the center. However, the environment remains largely postcard description; the curved space enables Ms. Penumbra's dimensional passage but does not constrain a choice—she moves through freely without obstacle, loss, or tactical adjustment. The final image reuses "adjusted her tattered silk scarf," charging the object but not the spatial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering archipelago, coral shelves, and sand ridge shaped like an open book supply vivid micro-settings that charge individual beats. The palette and camera function as setting-scale tools that constrain Mireya's method. However, spatial choreography across islands remains impressionistic—causeway, easternmost islet, and library positions are not anchored clearly enough to track movement—and the "movable horizon" metaphor, while striking, does not materially alter her tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "ruined arcade" supply vivid mood but remain postcard detail; neither constrains a choice. The ivy-shaped-like-keys and ear-shaped keyhole are inventive but function as symbolic waypoints rather than tactical obstacles. Spatial choreography across the spiral corridor and mirror is legible, and the recurring starlight anchors the lyric frame, but setting does not pressure the protagonist's moves—she walks unimpeded through each threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks constrains movement (she must navigate ship ribs, the fairy ring center) and charges the closure (she exits through the galleon gatepost without looking back). Micro-setting details—salt-crystal leaves, upside-down peach roots, corroded sextant—recur and reweight at key beats. Sensory selection (cider and rust, accordion chord sigh) reflects POV priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    The forgotten library is vividly rendered with specific details: warped doorway, afternoon shadow caught in glass, shelves like breathing ribs. The ghost swing and shard-mirror coat constrain Lira's perception and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The setting actively pressures the protagonist's choices and supplies the teacup, page, and shadow as tactile anchors for the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall veil, and living-willow loom are vivid and sensory, filtering through Arin's pruner's attention. The loom itself constrains his method (weaving shoots, notching seeds) and charges the closure when it collapses after fulfilling purpose. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves. No occupational depth penalty applies at this length when the craft detail (pruning, grafting) is purposefully integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary's crystalline walls refracting starlight into spectral colors and the net's tactile knots create vivid, purpose-driven anchors. Sensory selection—"sigh that tasted of salt," "phosphorescence in the net's fibers"—is filtered through Elian's restorer POV and accumulates symbolic charge. The sanctuary's altered time ("sharing a secret could stretch for hours or collapse into moments") subtly pressures the unraveling work. The tapestry needle and net function as micro-setting that constrains choices and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-scoured vault, henge lintel shadow, torn map, and chapel threshold work as micro-settings that constrain Elara's interpretive moves and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: rain "hissing," "one disciplined beam of stormlight," the stone's pulse. The torn parchment aligning with the lintel's shadow anchors the conceptual geography. The fresco vault's peeling layers and the chapel's stone bench supply tactile grounding that shapes Elara's understanding at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken library with barnacle-crusted threshold, flooded shelves of logarithm tables, and lectern establishes vivid spatial grounding. The snow globe as micro-setting object constrains the release ritual and charges the final image when Mara tips it to let brine in. Sensory detail—"voice bubbling through the rebreather," "silver balloon of breath"—is selective and filtered through the underwater pressure. The setting's 1914 origin directly ties to Mara's buried cargo and shapes the closure choice, elevating it beyond postcard description to a constraint that matters.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "misty courtyard above clouds" anchors atmosphere and the bolt plate functions as micro-setting (opened, used as palette, emptied). The courtyard stones "remembering every foot" and the mist "leaning closer" are vivid but never constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is loose—cloud ladders "materialize where her footsteps predicted them" implies magic without prior world rules. The final on-page moment (child looking at wall) shifts setting abruptly with no transition, breaking continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire is vividly anchored with frost-lensed floors, cold iron corridors, and a broken glass dome through which snow drifts. Sensory detail is purposeful: engine-oil and bergamot, humid apricot air, melted ice. The sub-basement hothouse—warm, iron-barred, skylight-lit—directly contrasts the spire's cold and constrains Lira's final choice by offering a hidden refuge that validates the captain's wager. The goggles function as micro-setting, translating dimness into scattered light that charges the ending image. Spatial choreography across ten floors, five, two, and sub-basement remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky gondola is vividly particular (wicker floor, fraying cable, zero-g dust) and constrains choice—Mara must work within the failing structure. The telescope's hidden chamber and memory kites ground the metaphysical premise in tactile objects. Sensory details (burnt coffee taste, hot tarmac smell) are filtered through the cloud-emotion taxonomy, making setting inseparable from the concept. The final image of dusty starlight on her skin charges the ending. Minor slip: spatial choreography of stepping out "not falling but floating" introduces mild ambiguity about the gondola's physics.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tree-trunk library constrains her final act—curved walls guide the brushstrokes, root vibrations alter her pace—and the coin's indentations directly shape the painting's mechanics (notch distances translate to millimeters, depth determines saturation). The knothole window, candle flame, and hollowed book safe all return with functional weight. The library's imminent demolition charges the final image; without this specific setting's erasure, the act loses urgency. Micro-setting (coin, brush, wall texture) drives the craft action at every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The antique airship is vividly particular: "brass ribs creaking like an old librarian," "copper pipes sweated pale steam," "moonlight fell through grates in silver ladders." Spatial choreography is clean across chart-room, cargo deck, and engine galley. The hopscotch board and its chalk arrows become a micro-setting that charges Lira's discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("flour-fine dust," "shadows pooled like spilled ink"). The airship itself pressures the plot—failing lights threaten to strand *Aurelia*—and the cargo-deck patterns directly enable the climactic solution. The starling murmurations outside function as both atmosphere and thematic mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library, auroras through vaulted glass, crystal floors, and undulating mirrored panels create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that supports the liminal tone. The hall of mirrors directly constrains Rowan's choice: he must align the flawed key with its reflection to heal it, making setting a tactical necessity. The final workshop—filled with "driftwood nostalgia," cedar shards, moon-dials—charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Rowan's locksmith focus (frost beading on pins, the "low tidal note" hum). No spatial incoherence or token catalogs.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock arches, gravity-defying apple trees, and twin suns create a vivid, science-fantasy setting that directly constrains the harvest stakes (arches tilting, anti-grav seeds dying). Micro-setting detail—the watering bell's bronze rim "warm from the last human hand," chalk-dusted path, dew freezing into letters—charges tactile presence and anchors Mara's method. The nebula of respite functions both as atmospheric texture and as a conceptual constraint (slowing time for the grieving, binding Mara's spirit). Spatial choreography of the harvest (human ropes swaying, grandmothers anchoring, toddlers passing fruit) is clear and purposeful. The butterfly garden and sidewalk serve as recurring anchors that tie opening to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse is vividly anchored: "nested patterns of salt-stained iron," spiral stairs, cracked lenses. The pane of hush—"a fist-sized square of night so matte it drank the orange afterglow"—functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when she presses her forehead to it. The puppet head's tactile presence (mahogany cheek, cloudy marble eye, splintered forehead) and the unseen sea's "slow, deliberate rhythm" all constrain and color the protagonist's choices, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting elements—cliff, labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost, cursed orchard—constrain Mara's choices throughout: she cannot enter the labyrinth (razor feathers), must work from the rim, and races the frost-clock. The handprint trail is a micro-setting solution that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (frost-brittle grass, brass wings clicking, sap-formed faces). The mechanical birds' lens-eye and gear-song create tangible threat. The environment drives tactics and the final image (crystal fossils, folded wings) reconfigures the opening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The braided ravine constrains and charges every major choice: it teaches the lattice insight ("where two filaments touched, a third arose"), provides the chrysalis husks, and becomes the installation site that reweights separation into connection. Micro-setting—shale, islands, confluence—guides spatial choreography clearly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("sun-warmed boulder," "river foam patterns," "glowing shells"). The final image of sculptures pulsing "like a colony of bioluminescent insects" fuses environment and closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass orchard library, cloudborne atrium, obsidian floor, and crystal fruit are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (chiming syllables, brass doors exhaling, swirling sea below cracking into spiral notebooks). The setting actively constrains: the vendor aligns her table with floor cracks that "followed an algorithm of absence," the building tilts when books shift weight after the librarian gains memory, and shelves rearrange to close aisles. These details charge the final image where the vendor's outline becomes a door onto "a shore of white space where no library, no orchard, no clouds existed yet," directly tying environment to closure. Micro-setting elements (scale pans vibrating, ledger pages as mirrors) also enable key transactions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The desert fortress after rain, coral pavilion, and tidal pool formations all constrain Marisol's journey and charge the closure: she must descend ("found the entrance at the fortress's heart"), the coral's bioluminescence shifts color as her memories interact with it, and the courtyard sand "began to shift...turning grief into something that could hold life again." Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("the air tasted of brine and old grief"). Spatial choreography tracks clearly from courtyard to spiral staircase to pavilion floor to dawn exit.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    The astronomical clock tower and its interior star map are vivid and purposeful, anchoring Mireya's descent and ascent. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (spiral catwalk, maintenance alcove, observation balcony), and the speaking tube supplies a functional constraint. However, the grain elevator remains distant and abstract—its "wooden throat" and "cedar ribs" are lyric gestures without tactile use. The cuckoo clock weight (lead pine cone, copper wire, chain) constrains one beat and charges the final mechanical sigh, meeting the micro-setting test for 9+ eligibility at the lower threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit canyon functions as an active constraint: moonlight angle calibrates the mirror, quartz veins hold entangled memories, and the moon's shift collapses the attempt. Sensory selection is purposeful—lunar silver, cold light, red grit—and filtered through Mara's engineer lens. The broken periscope mirror and the canyon's fracture-state pressure her choice and charge the final image when new seams crack open. Spatial choreography (rim, lip, chasm below) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly realized through ultraviolet veins, upward-dripping water, and threshold-effect patches where gravity vectors fray. Spatial choreography is coherent: Ilyra drift-walks the ceiling-tunnel, counts heartbeats, and navigates the indigo spectral band. The grotto directly constrains her choices—she must map dormant kernels to avoid incineration and exit before the inversion ends or be crushed. The micro-setting (her body navigating gravity's midpoint fraying) functions as both obstacle and resource, charging the final image when the grotto seals behind her.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The siskin alder grove, porcelain insulator, and dulcimer carved from the same grove constrain Ilay's method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "needles shiver, sap rises," "moss brightens from dusted gray to living jade." The insulator's weight "no more than a robin's egg" and the crack "shaped exactly like the siskin's wing" are specific and purposeful. Micro-setting (wood, wire, insulator) alters tactics and the ending's resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and purposeful (compass spin, iron in blood, electromagnetic hum), and the worry stone's dent provides tactile anchor. However, the nexus doesn't constrain a choice—it's backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure that alters tactics. The "three short hums, one long" pattern suggests specificity but leads nowhere causally. Twilight and "invisible geometries" remain atmospheric without shaping the tutor's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop is sensuously rendered ("sawdust and gunpowder waiting for celebration") and the skylight-constellations anchor cosmic witness. Micro-setting via the cracked crystal radio constrains her method and the brass clasp's warming ("expanding") charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mirelle's priorities (textures translated to memories, sound-focused). The fireworks' mute arrival as "only colored light" in the final third demonstrates environment serving thematic pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rope bridge, platform, living trunk with scarred bark, and spider-silk all constrain Myrrh's graft technique; the highest boughs' cultural rule (wind-spirits trade wisdom for fragrance) shapes her greeting ritual. The seed's materiality (veins aligned with doodled bloom, figure-eight knot allowing sway) directly affects outcome. Sensory hierarchy filters through olfactory bias (wildflower, carrion, almond-gum, bruised banana). The micro-setting of bark and silk charges the closure when the notebook is left on the highest bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock arches, inverted gravity, luminous fruit, and water-flow navigation create a vivid, coherent world. Sensory detail is purposeful: "mossy bark," "silver threads of water climbing the arches," "leaves that now served as stepping-stones in the sky." The arrow tip constrains choice (she must press it into the hollow) and the setting charges the final image (boughs bending, fruit ripening). Spatial choreography remains clear through the ascent and inversion. The micro-setting (the hollow in the apex arch) drives the climactic beat, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "canyon of steel," "ribbon of powdered paint," "hexagonal plaza," fused glass circle. Sensory filtering reflects Mara's professional attention (vectors, wind speed, fatigue fractures), and the environment actively constrains her path (dead-ends, leaning stacks). The glass hums, the patch twitches on its surface, and the spiral realignment at closure transforms spatial access—setting charges the final image. Minor register drift (e.g., "fossilized lung exhaling") occasionally pulls away from Mara's technical voice, but the port remains a functional actor throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice cavern supplies vivid particulars: "frozen eelgrass" piano strings, the Echoless Vein as aurora trap, "acoustic amber." Synesthetic color (violet footfalls, crimson ice-song) permeates every beat and charges the final image when the aurora is "released back to the sky." The glacier and sculptor's chisel frame the descent and ascent, lending spatial and thematic bookends. While the environment is rich, it does not meaningfully constrain a choice—Elian walks through obstacles that yield obligingly—keeping this shy of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thunder-echo range is rendered with vivid, selective detail: "avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush drank light the way dry earth drinks blood," salt-smooth driftwood as sea-memory. The environment actively constrains action—the violet seam, the shifting markers, the spiral's spatial logic all shape Kaelen's descent and final choice. The flute's placement "across the driftwood spiral" is a tactile, charged moment that ties setting to closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (twilight thickening, heartbeat as intrusion) and the body-as-setting (lungs "like catacombs") qualifies as micro-setting under the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The topaz workshop is visually distinct (translucent dome, flywheel, cedar drawer of names), and the halo fragment constrains the climax choice by forcing Quince to reverse the press. Spatial choreography remains clear (balcony, platen, cliff path). However, sensory detail skews heavily visual and metaphorical rather than tactile; we never feel the press's weight or ink texture under stress. The setting charges the final image (restored sky) but does not meaningfully alter tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and recurrs across beats, shaping the final image when Elias "walks forward" into transformation. The pendant's dragonfly wings and the ridge's narrowing path offer spatial constraint. Sensory detail is strong (green/violet light, thick-as-honey air) and filtered through Elias's courier perspective. However, the physical mechanics of the transformation are vague—does he dissolve, ascend, or continue walking—capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quartz arbor, frost patterns, and the car interior are vivid and selective, filtering through Elian's grief-charged perception. The prism's use constrains his ritual and the frost "braille" charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (arbor edge → car window → dashboard → path out). One minor slip: "silicon heart" for quartz reads as a slight factual stumble (quartz is crystalline silica, not silicon), but does not break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard setting ("fruit trees leaned into one another, their branches stitched by decades of moss") is vivid and selective. The loom and bamboo grove constrain the spinner's world and charge the final image: "golden beads of fresh sap, each one holding a single strand of her quiet gold thread" ties closure directly to setting. Spatial choreography is clear (loom, packed-earth floor, trees, portal between "stake and sky"). The setting subtly guides the ending—her silent weaving rewinds the orchard's clock, trees grow younger—so environment affects outcome. Minor: occupational detail (loom mechanics) remains gestural; deeper specificity of spinning technique would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard planet and floating arches are vivid and consistent, with azure moonlight and star-fruit trees recurring across beats. Spatial choreography is coherent (mine shafts, forge, arches). The magician's silk touching stone at the arch charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses are absent. The silk's physical properties (how it "strengthens beams," lowers arches) are asserted without tactile or mechanical specificity, reducing plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay constrains movement and supplies the locker discovery; micro-setting (green shard, copper wire, locker) charges multiple beats and the final pocket gesture. Spatial choreography across parallel bays remains legible despite mosaic structure. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (dust tasting of rust, scent of grease/ozone/lilac, vacuum silence). The zero-g locker beat and the bay's "exhaling" final image both constrain and elevate closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lantern room constrains choice: cracked panes, pooled shadows, brass rail, Fresnel lens, catwalk rust all serve as tactile anchors for the stone messages and charge the final image when the room "remained black, yet inside it the stacked stones and bottled glass held a memory of radiance." The sea glass functions as micro-setting, its hue shifts ("tonight it glowed like dawn trapped under skin") marking emotional pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: skiff to iron ring, spiral stairs, lantern room threshold, descent, backward row. The pink granite stone from the widow's cove and the black ballast stone ground the world in plausible maritime detail without excess exposition. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's priorities—salt-ghost, wet iron and old hymns, the click overhead—filtered through his watchfulness rather than a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and lens function as micro-setting that constrains choice: Lirael must "press the wick against the lens" to thin the membrane, and the wick's consumption charts the course. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the metaphorical frame (salt air, porcelain echo, granite groaning). Spatial choreography tracks across the spiral climb, lantern room, and the prow position. The post-newsprint ocean and canvas beyond the rim anchor the altered world without catalog tourism. The ending grounds her on "dew that had never known ink," a tactile particular that charges the closure image and satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating rock tea house, silk tethers, valley-mist, and the morpho wing supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Hoshiko's dye-master idiom (indigo holding sky and ocean, cochineal beetles). The teahouse setting constrains her location and provides the window/sun-trail mechanics, charging one beat when she aligns the wing with morning sun to project ghost-images. However, the environment does not narrow a later choice or alter the closure image; it remains atmospheric rather than a micro-setting that shapes the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit tower setting pressures action throughout: moonlight heals Mara's thumbnail and later refracts through the sextant's cracks to manifest spectral trees, directly enabling the transformation. Spatial choreography is precise (parapet, spiral stairs, corridor one floor below) and sensory detail—rain hissing, wind holding its breath—modulates with scene pressure. The tower's stones "drinking moonlight" and old mortar sealing cracks charge the final image of the cedar rooted in parapet stones, making the environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with concrete, selective detail: trees growing from alembics, roots in quicksilver, pomegranate fruits that chime. Sensory specificity (phosphor smear "like remembered joy," tarry vines, tin foil scales) filters through the keeper's crisis perception. The mica window constrains her choice (she presses it to the pane, it fractures under attack, she drives shards into her ribs) and the final image of glitter falling to sprout new trees charges closure. The micro-setting of body and tool successfully substitutes for broader spatial choreography at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The secret society library is vividly rendered with specific sensory details (chill marble, chained grimoires, ember-red chandeliers, mirrored circulation desk). The setting constrains Elara's choice by triggering the nightly purge and providing the invitation as a conduit for her transformation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The library's atmosphere charges the final image of her becoming the "hush," meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The palace courtyard and tea house supply vivid, specific anchors—cracked marble, paper lanterns, mosaic gods—that recur and charge the closure image. The bread itself functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and reweighted at the end. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (flour ghosts, tea-steam sighs). The courtyard constrains Mila's final choice to remain and cultivate, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting pressure on closure, though the choice itself feels more thematic acceptance than hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library, quartz hush, and copper fittings "warm to the touch" create vivid, POV-filtered sensory grounding. The magic lantern slide's hairline fracture and the tuning fork carved from glacier ice function as micro-setting objects that constrain the measurement process and charge the final shattering beat. The tree trunk at the end provides a physical anchor for the data transfer, altering tactics from preservation-in-archive to biological dispersal. Spatial choreography (spiraling brass railing, projection alcove, descent through cloud layer) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pier market is sensory-specific (barnacled pilings, lanterns on rusted chains, crates of contraband) and filtered through the narrator's criminal heritage. Micro-setting: the fob itself functions as charged object—its tail digs half-moons, its soundless ticking grows louder, and tide licking crates adds urgency. The phonograph horn "so close to my chest" constrains the recording and charges the final act. Minor: "comforting unease of the market" tells tone rather than showing through contradictory sensory cues. Spatial choreography remains clear across the wait and dawn handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    Lavender bluff and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors. The forests' "elections" create atmospheric specificity but remain decorative—they do not constrain the protagonist's choices or alter her path. The compass ring's physical properties (warming, glowing, cooling) track across beats and participate in the ending, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the bluff itself functions primarily as backdrop; the protagonist could converge with the weather-woman in any elevated location without structural change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal cave is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rose light, iron and pennies taste, quartz and gypsum textures) and directly constrains the climactic choice: crystals grow along her drawn lines, encrusting pigment and turning memory into geology. The underground setting functions as both literal space and metaphorical crucible. Spatial choreography is generally clear (mine shaft, ledge, wall), though the carousel and maintenance hatch references at the opening create a brief geography puzzle before the cave becomes the dominant location.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse setting with toxic sky, filtration veils, air-purifying vines, and pneumatic postal roots is vivid and specific. The Fern Cathedral's collapsed fronds and silver-barred moonlight charge the revelation scene, and the vines lifting at honesty directly constrains the conceptual stakes. Spatial choreography (studio → levels of bamboo/glow-moss → cathedral nave → altar) remains clear. The toxic sky and dry oasis frame urgency without becoming postcard; the environment's false-breath economy pressures every social interaction and pays off when vines respond to candor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bluff setting is anchored early (basalt stair, cloudless hush, high altitude) and the iceberg fragment functions as a concrete object that constrains the sculpture's mechanics and refracts light during the comet's pass. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"ice sweating cold diamonds," "green nucleus," "ribbons of unseen hues"—filtered through the tuner's perceptual priorities. The kinetic sculpture's physical structure (cantilevered ribs, counterweights, bearings) shapes the tuner's calibration work and charges the final image when she leaves it to the mountain wind, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and appearing in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm provides vivid spatial grounding: transparent ceiling showing magnetic shift, corridors, nursery section, roses blooming "in impossible colors." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—petals vibrating with magnetic realignment, flames writing names across the shrinking sky. The dome's edges folding inward "like petals closing at dusk" integrates setting into the closure image effectively. However, the farm functions more as symbolic backdrop than active constraint; no choice hinges on a specific feature of the environment (door, tool, spatial limit) until the android plants itself at center. The "strangely organic" box serves as micro-setting/object anchor more successfully than the farm itself.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (rose-gold mosaics, mint tea, fountain hush) that remains purposeful rather than catalog. The borescope becomes a micro-tool constraining choice (Mira tries mechanical intervention before yielding to presence), and the iron mailbox anchors spatial choreography across beats. The final image integrates setting (courtyard "felt larger") with the conceptual closure, charging the space with the story's thematic shift. Diction is consistently filtered through Mira's curatorial lens ("dust between her ribs," "desert cold teach her"), and the dawn-to-dusk-to-dawn cycle provides rhythmic structure. No major slips in spatial tracking or world consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken lab, spider, and dice constrain Mara's choices concretely: the web sets the clock, the dice direct her to the vortex, the spherical archive's pressure valve creates the dry chamber. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("ghost-thrum of old power," "bioluminescent ink that pulsed slower than breath"), filtered through Mara's dancer's perception. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the service-shaft descent and spherical archive's exact layout remain slightly abstract. The setting charges the final image: Mara rises with the bubble, the lab releases its air, and the moonlit surface becomes the stage for her encoded lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt crystal chamber functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: gravity pockets force "strange arcs," the chamber's mist and crystals crack to release memories. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Miren's professional lens (lantern pole, tide codes). The whale's carcass and the dock pier are anchored with concrete specifics—steam, iron railing, wooden planks—that shape her movements. The environment charges the final image: lanterns casting her sister's silhouette, the dispersing dust.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal brook is vividly rendered with selective detail—moonlight glazing water, cold gripping ankles, reeds and wind—and it constrains the summoner's ritual by providing the medium for the cranes. The micro-setting (water, paper, body) charges the final image when the crane lifts into dawn. Sensory selection reflects the summoner's priorities (silence, flow, reflections), and spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not guide a choice under pressure in the middle, but it anchors both the opening ritual and the closure reprise, pushing into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop garden, gargoyle, and desk seal constrain the narrator's final choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (rosemary, meteor shower as dactyls, steam spelling "stay"), filtered through the narrator's emerging role as linguist. Spatial choreography is clean across the fire escape, roof, and Mrs. Chen's door. The micro-setting (seal pressed to gargoyle, thermos labeled "sugar") functions as constraint and metaphor without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The velvet garden is richly textured with indigo hedges, silver foxglove, and the mirror-smooth pond, each detail filtered through Mara's perception and childhood associations. The setting directly constrains action: the gate positioned by the shell's prediction, the pond as the literal transfer medium, the garden's recursive transformation into archive. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (path to gate to tunnel to pond). The micro-setting of the shell pressed to pond rim and Mara's palms to ground charges the closure by making memory transfer tactile and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The marble sanctuary and aurora provide consistent atmosphere, and the heritage rose thorn is handled in multiple beats. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: the sanctuary's physical properties don't pressure Mara's choices, and the stalactite dripping serves as ornamental time-marker. The final blood-writing on marble offers mild textural charge but doesn't meaningfully alter tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    The canyon, nexus, and moths supply vivid spatial grounding: "corkscrew cavern," "transparent moths wove strands of sound into luminous threads," "switchback trail" all anchor movement. The seashell constrains the quest (coordinates, used to complete the cocoon cadence) and charges the final image (fused whole, warm as heartbeat). Sensory detail is selective and layered—scent of wet copper, glyphs, breathing gallery—though POV filtering is light; Lira's professional lens as "echo singer" shapes what she notices, yet the narration sometimes drifts into neutral catalog. The nexus functions as micro-setting that alters tactics (she must descend, follow the shell's hush), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clean. A few descriptions ("raw slit in the plateau") feel ornamental rather than pressure-driven, and the "universe hums its secret song" frame recurs without evolving to constrain a choice, keeping the score just above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glacier-shrine setting is vivid and specific (candles burning cold, ice walls, ballroom ghosts in rime), and the original snow globe encased in unfrozen water at the heart constrains the quest spatially. However, spatial choreography breaks: the submerged tent, shrine location, corridor to the ship's heart, and surface return are never coherently mapped, creating impossible distances. The setting does charge the final image (meltwater footprints, snow-placed globe), lifting the score into mid-6s despite the logistical gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering parapet after rain is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (slick stone, warm beneath chill, settling whisper) filtered through the philosopher's professional attention to nets and knots. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, constraining her spiral walk and charging the final image when its inscription mirrors her path. Firefly season provides atmospheric cohesion. The setting enables discovery and pressures the protagonist's attention, though it does not force a choice between incompatible options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wasteland orchard is specific and purposeful: hexagonal scars on apples mirror the letter fragments, creating a micro-world that constrains Marisol's method of discovery. The stillpoint functions as both spatial constraint (temperature drop, Geiger silence) and tool that enables her hummed access. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"angry cicada" clicks, "ghost tides" of dust, temperature plunge—and the final image of browning fruit charges the closure. The environment doesn't just backdrop; it actively teaches the tessellation pattern that guides reassembly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit observatory is vivid and purposeful: clouds pressing "like curious children," lightning stuttering, the cracked mainframe all constrain Elara's options and charge the atmosphere. The rusted dial, cold receiver, and cobalt portico function as micro-setting elements that Elara handles across beats. The final image—frequencies carrying her essence downward to a girl in a basement—repurposes the vertical geography (above clouds / below) to charge closure. Sensory selection reflects urgency (oil, stardust, static) without catalog drift, and the setting shapes the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "feral loft beneath the dunes" is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: "half-buried ship's ribs," "kelp-stitched blankets," "salt-bleached arches." The space recurs as both shelter and cathedral, filtering perception through Posy's scavenger-poet lens. The shelves of jars and the driftwood altar are micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-driven: "apricot salt," "rose-gold" dunes, "the soft collapse of a dune, sighing."

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: ice pans knocking like organ pipes, pilings humming, slabs tilting like altars. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mireya's professional lens (frequencies, resonance, vibration). The key and Echo function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice—she must match glacier memory vibrationally or lose the town. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, ice below, shadows sliding closer). The recurring whale-bone object charges the final image when wrapped in her coat. Environmental pressure (calving ice) forces the third-path decision, elevating this to strong integration.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic viaduct, and ice as "unwritten page" are vivid and purposeful. The viaduct's hum and polarity shifts constrain Elian's choices (when to kneel, when to press the compass); the ice's thickness matters for the pouch placement. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's professional lens (polarity like breath, moon ricochets). The compass on ice and the viaduct's spark-sheet charge the final image. Micro-setting (slate, compass, ice) functions as setting and pressures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subway tunnel is vivid and purposeful: rusted ladder, amber reach of lantern light, maintenance alcove at 400 meters, tally marks carved in concrete. The lantern's warmth against Mara's palm grounds her in sensory immediacy, and the confined space mirrors psychological entrapment. The drought's brittle aftermath charges the setting with recent trauma. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment constrains movement (descent, counting steps, kneeling to examine marks). The tunnel functions as confession site and pressure vessel, though occupational detail about transit engineering remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair shop is rendered with vivid particulars—brass gears' "vibrant hush," stained skylight, glass dome with slow-constellation dust motes, rows of mandolines and serinettes. The walnut-sized clockwork heart and hair-thin replacement spring function as micro-setting that enables the repair choice and charges the closure when "the shop filled with a fragile lullaby, each note a drop of light piercing cloud." Spatial choreography is clean (counter, loupe, glass dome, shelf metronomes, door). The storm exterior brackets the scene purposefully, teaching the light-through-clouds image that Rowan described and Emil repeats, paying off in the silver-dawn slit at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, kaleidoscope, and arrow tip are vivid and purpose-driven. The acid spray peels paint, the cathedral-sized buoy's whale-gears constrain Juniper's climb, and the arrow tip's glass-on-metal strike is specific. However, spatial choreography inside the workshop remains vague (floorboards, navigation desk, but no clear layout under pressure), and the transition from glider to buoy spire lacks tactile detail. The kaleidoscope and arrow tip charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate, but the workshop interior does not constrain a mid-story choice, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The server farm's "rows of crystal blocks" that "hum different notes" and Block 73 "glowing warmer" create a tactile, purposeful setting that charges the final image (the empty rectangular hole singing back at 73 BPM). The patch object—woven triangle, scorched edge, tiny speaker—is handled twice (taped under desk, dissolved into skin) and its chord drives the middle investigation. Spatial choreography (archive desk → midnight tube → polar cap farm → Block 73) tracks cleanly. The social network archive and neural implant anchor the world's digital-memory logic without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse orchard, shifting ice floes, and vintage mirrors create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Mara's tactics (mirrors as "only reliable window," ice clock ticking toward dawn). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens (peacekeeper duty, border-keeping). The memory-harbor's foggy pier and crate-market offer atmospheric specificity, though the transition lacks spatial grounding—how Mara moves through the doorway and navigates the market remains abstract. The final image (sphere on bough, locked ice) charges the ending, pushing the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid in scattered images (grinding floes, plates of sea groaning, crack of ice), and the parasol tip's physical interaction (tapped twice, planted upright) does constrain one choice—the boy's decision not to board. However, spatial choreography blurs: the listening post tent, the gangway queue, and the line of passengers are not stably mapped, and the story never clarifies whether the boy and Mara are standing on ice or dock when they "trawl the line." The harbor master and loudspeaker setup anchor early but fade without consequence. The environment charges the final image but does not systematically shape tactics across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber pavilion and vineyard terraces are rendered with vivid, selective detail (saffron curtains, crushed leaves releasing scent, coppered vines). Spatial choreography is coherent across Marco's walk from hilltop to pavilion. The setting charges the final image: the pavilion as a space of memory and decision, the vineyard as both livelihood and metaphor. This meets the 9+ gate requirement (setting constrains choice), but sensory specificity occasionally tips into ornamental lyricism that slows rather than sharpens the present stake.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The kinetic parapet and murmuring pavilion are vividly described and recur across beats, grounding the ritual spatially. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the thrumming synchronized with heartbeat, columns leaning toward center). The parapet's response to the walker's presence constrains his movements and charges the final touch, qualifying as micro-setting that alters tactics. The setting participates in closure when the walker touches the parapet "one final time," anchoring the clearing's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender field and factory ruins supply vivid, purposeful detail that constrains the archivist's ritual and charges the final image. Sensory selection is strong—"iron and honey," "diesel remembered"—and filtered through the archivist's perceptive calm. Spatial choreography is clear; the corkboard, photos, and field are handled in tactile, lived-in ways. The setting drives the closure image (dove wings spanning factory to field) and anchors the concept throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library at dawn is vividly rendered ("spines of books that had grown brittle," "dust motes in a sunbeam," "slants through high windows") and the crystal as micro-setting object constrains Elara's testimony action. The falling book (*Botanical Studies*) and pressed snowdrop subtly charge the "growth" theme. However, the setting functions more as atmosphere than tactical constraint; Elara's choices are not altered by spatial limits or resource scarcity. The final beat (crystal on desk, dictionary open) reweights prior material enough to edge into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered through multi-sensory detail: crushed VHS cases underfoot, the scent of magnetic tape decay, metallic fog taste. The driftwood markers and cassette recorder constrain the prophet's search pattern and deliver the climactic sound, making the setting functional rather than decorative. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the spiral arrangement, and the environment directly charges the final image when the prophet marks the fog statue with chalk, knowing it will fade—setting detail becomes thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lunar observatory setting is vividly rendered with specific tools (telescope, Hasselblad, spectrographs) that anchor the world. The clock hand and camera constrain Mira's final action—sealing the hand in the film bay and photographing the station's dissolution. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's expertise. The micro-setting (camera, film bay, airlock) charges the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cloud-level hospice with glass floor, twinkling city lights, and drifting cumulus cities creates a vivid, uncanny micro-world. Sensory details are purposeful: bleach and resignation, petrichor, citrus sanitizer, the hum of wind on the skybridge. Spatial choreography is clean (room → corridor → skybridge). The skybridge's exact midpoint constrains Mara's final gesture, charging the closure image. However, the "radiant haven above the clouds" leans decorative; the clinical setting does not meaningfully limit her ritual choices or force workarounds.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating observatory, orrery floor, and automaton are vividly rendered and constrain Lyra's choices: she must align celestial rings and physically engage the key. The sundial casting moonshadows charges the closure image with purposeful impossibility. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through scholarly attention—brass, glass, mirrors—though the piece leans visual and neglects sound, touch, and temperature during high-pressure beats. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret garden, hedge maze, marble bench, white briar path, and vertebra sundial are vivid and purposeful; the garden "rewove itself into a clearer labyrinth" after Elara's choice, constraining her path and charging the closure. Sensory detail (bruised mint, iron, chalk and thunder, dew-drinking cloak) is selective and anchored in POV. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bench to sundial to dawn exit. The micro-setting (the tooth, the vertebra dial) functions as constraint and closure charge, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with calcite veins, mist, emerald gloom, and the drip that matches Lira's heartbeat. The micro-setting (grotto wall, fissure overhead, the single drop) directly enables the pearl's condensation and charges the final image when the wall becomes a mirror. Sensory selection reflects urgency; mist coiling tighter as the glass lifts signals escalating pressure. The body (knees on slick stone, palm to damp wall, tongs carved from driftwood) and the sea glass function as micro-setting, constraining choice and anchoring the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moss-overtaken data center constrains movement and charges the final image: the upright server blade becomes the burial site, and the cracked skylight delivers the ant-shadow that closes the piece. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (spores clinging to skin, honeyed glow, dew-dark hoodie). Spatial choreography remains clear across aisles and racks. The micro-setting (pendant, server, soil) functions as setting at this length and directly shapes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The feral nexus functions as micro-setting: mist tasting of "salt and wet paper," fog curling into "quotation marks around her ankles," and the shell accumulating weight constrain Mara's choices and charge the final lighthouse image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through a writer's perception (marginalia, proofs, pages). Spatial choreography is clean across beats. The setting reappears in the ending ("street that smelled of salt and wet paper"), anchoring closure without becoming a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The arbor, moss-covered branch, and dawn light are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (orange light "bleeding through," bioluminescent runes). The vine tendril's transformation and the feather as tool shape the ritual action, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear (perched, descended), and the environment constrains the one-hour bloom window. However, the verdant arbor feels more like a magical stage than a lived-in space that pressures Elara's tactics; it enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subarctic crater and withered orchard supply vivid, purposeful detail: frost circles, apple skeletons, half-collapsed scarecrow, ice-half-buried plate. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling under scarecrow, lifting plate, pressing to vial, placing on scarecrow's chest, sitting beneath). Sensory selection—frost, starlight glow, copper chill, branch creaks, snowflakes on eyelashes—is filtered through the alchemist's ritualistic attention and supports tone. The orchard constrains his ritual (he must work in silence to avoid igniting flash-paper) and charges the closure (trees become drums, crater a gramophone). Meets the 9+ gate: environment constrains choice (silence requirement) and charges the final image (orchard as living score).

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The marble cavern functions as both backdrop and constraint: reflections delay by a heartbeat, light angles sketch memories, and the stone veins nest echoes. The timer mechanism is handled in multiple beats (setting it on the plinth, dismantling, reassembling in reverse), and its scalloped metal—percussion craters—directly informs the solution. The cellar at the end charges the closure image (wonder stored, locked away). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not pressure a choice in the middle third as strongly as it frames and resolves, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (shingled tiles, metallic sigh, cracked glass chimney) and the environment directly constrains choice: the flame must stay lit or the walls will "cool and seize." The kerosene burner functions as micro-setting, returning at closure when she leaves it behind as "a small sun." Spatial choreography is coherent (pool, floor, walls, roof shaft). One minor slip: "boundary-lessly trapped" is asserted rather than shown through failed exit attempts, and the grotto's recursive reflections are more atmospherically claimed than spatially navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (sawdust, thunder, steam, wet asphalt), and the workbench, carving blank, and cage latch function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's choices—she must work with what's present. The kettle and skylight recur to frame the temporal window and charge the final image (her face reflected in rain-beaded glass). However, the loft itself remains somewhat static; it doesn't evolve causally or pressure a key turn, serving more as atmospheric container than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kinetic lagoon, cloudwater, obsidian mare, and mirrored walkway are vivid and purposeful. The mare's "empty cartridge" eyes and the cloudwater that "thickens into silver glass" anchor the negotiation scene and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's haunted perception. The setting supplies resources (the wheel clicks release slides, cloudwater freezes mid-ripple) that shape the encounter. Spatial choreography remains clear across the carousel-to-mare-to-bench sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terminal is vividly rendered (rust as Martian vermillion, frozen valves in attitudes of prayer) and the sextant shard constrains Alya's method (alignment with pictograph, measurement of flow). The glycol redirection depends on spatial layout; the canal, cooling tower, and fountain are causally linked. Sensory detail is filtered through engineering perspective (pressure × area, hydraulic arteries). The sextant charges the final image as portable meridian, satisfying the 9+ gate partially but not earning full 9-band due to minor decorative passages early.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal forecourt constrains movement (the bead of water rolling into gloom, kneeling, placing the clock) and charges the closure (gears fusing to crystal). Sensory detail is purposeful: petrichor, wet slate, moss and iron all anchor the POV's nostalgic filter. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The observatory dome and mountain descent provide coherent pressure on Arlen's solitary ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The barge canal, fog, lanterns, and half-submerged bunker are vivid and purposeful. The sundial's gnomon with shell-fragment marks and the wax-sealed crate supply tactile, constraint-driven detail. Spatial choreography is clean: bow, deck, reedy cut all track. The canal as "a scar trying to heal" charges the final image without becoming heavy-handed. Micro-setting (the sundial, the crate) effectively stands in for broader geography at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Golden dock under snow, fog, fulgurite beads, and the harbor create vivid sensory grounding filtered through Ari's professional lens (seed collector, rope translator). The final planting directly uses the dock's grain as medium—micro-setting constrains the defiant act and charges the closure image when roots thread salt-soaked wood. Spatial choreography (pier's lip, skiff below, harbormaster advancing) tracks clearly. Some sensory detail tilts decorative ("harbor moons," "oceanic hush") rather than pressure-serving, and fog's tactical role (erasure during escape) feels convenient rather than earned constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shadowed garden in autumn is anchored early with selective detail (bare branches, dried fountain, fallen leaves in patterns), and the autumn motif recurs at closure to charge the final image. The physical act of kneeling and winding thread grounds the ritual in space. However, the garden does not meaningfully constrain a choice—she could perform this work anywhere—and the "portals" through which she sees clients are visual metaphor rather than setting-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites, the corroded gears, the music-box necropolis, and the cavern mouth all supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the prince's POV. The setting constrains choice (he must descend rope ladders to retrieve music-box pins) and charges the final image (palace chains snap, edifice plunges). Sensory selection is dense and lyric ("quill still holding the memory of sky in hollow graphite"), and the mechanical-world decay mirrors the prince's thematic goal. Spatial choreography (upside-down prince, workbench, descent, return) remains coherent across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    The obsidian lagoon, kelp-drift clouds, and salt pines are vividly anchored and filtered through Mara's professional and emotional lens. The lagoon water is poured into the trench, and the coin is tied to bark—both acts that constrain choice and charge the ending. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara kneels, pours, traces her scar, walks the dune ridge. The setting drives the ritual and shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains provides a charged micro-setting: dry basins, water turned to glass/mirrors, stone mouths whispering secrets. Each fountain (First Lies, Last Goodbyes, Unkept Promises, Forgiveness) is named and given distinct properties (coins, salt-and-iron kisses, faces of promise-breakers, mirrors of possibility) that reflect the memory type released. The geese paused mid-flight and the "defiant hush" recur to frame pressure. The final fountain's mirrors showing "not reflections but possibilities" directly enable the full opening of the box, and the setting's cumulative particulars (dry → glass → mirrors → steam) charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nebula garden constrains every choice: petals part to reveal the beacon, pollen "glittered like crushed diamonds" grounds the walk, and the vacuum requires sonar rather than speech. The gear's tactile warmth and vibrating teeth charge the final act. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all pressure the closure image. Sensory hierarchy—hydrogen blossoms, crystalline paths, soft flameless glow—filters through Kael's professional exile perspective without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse is vividly anchored—glass panes, cracked terracotta, rusted watering cans, oak through the ceiling—and sensory detail (glowing poetry, warm ribbon) supports the lyric atmosphere. The setting does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; the carver moves through it as a witness, and the greenhouse functions as backdrop to revelation rather than obstacle or resource. Spatial choreography remains clear and detail is filtered through the carver's meditative POV, lifting the score within the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower constrain the protagonist's actions throughout: the pendulum's pause is the window for his choice, the tower door must be opened, and the escapement wheel receives the wood dust. The micro-setting (brass pendulum, access panel, mainspring) shapes the tactics of lashing and winding. The final image—obsidian ridge "glowing like a blade turned away from flesh," wet furrows reflecting sky—charges the closure by visually reconfiguring the field's status. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "salt air corrodes certainty," "hissed against the tidal obsidian ridge," "searing reverie of salt and machine oil." The body (fingertips, arms burning) and tool (fishhook, rake handle) function as micro-setting that pressure choices. Slight deduction for one stock phrase: "black glass hissing like hot iron" leans toward generic simile without strong POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cobalt silo, tapestry, and spiral coin constrain Mercy's literal path and charge the final image. Micro-setting—ladder, drawer, iron rungs—guides the descent with tactile specificity. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "starlight drips," "scent of preserved apples," "velveteen gloom." The chess-clock motif and celestial backdrop create atmospheric pressure without tourism. No cap from Q2 orientation penalty applies here; setting work is strong enough to mitigate some narrative fog.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("breath crystallizing," "low frequency that made her teeth ache"). The spire's spiral staircase and the lake's "hairline crack shaped like a question mark" charge the final image. However, spatial choreography weakens when the cartographer "stepped off the spire's edge, not falling but folding"—the physics of this moment is metaphorical rather than embodied, breaking the established material logic.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember alcove, mist, and rosin-inked parchment constrain Mila's tactics: she hides in a space the Ministry sweeps weekly, uses ambient glow to work in darkness, and weaponizes dust as a medium. The shortwave dial's green phosphor and the concert hall's "cracked seats" anchor spatial choreography. The solstice timing and the Ministry's "calibrated routine silence" provide a concrete window that shapes the final act. Minor issue: "mist tasting of iron" recurs without evolving, and the city streets at the end lack the sensory specificity of the alcove, flattening the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The vanishing point gallery functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: Elena positions herself at the convergence where "all stories converge and dissolve," making spatial geometry inseparable from thematic closure. The rocking chair's runners against hardwood, the track lighting creating halo effects on porcelain shards, and the powder catching light "like the mica in sidewalk concrete" are filtered through Elena's artist's eye. The automatic lighting shift at evening creates a temporal anchor and visual transformation that makes the spiral "appear to move." Setting details constrain Elena's careful angle calculations and sight-line measurements, demonstrating how space shapes her installation choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunken city, sewer conduits, sedimentary strata, and burial sump are vividly rendered and constrain Caldera's method (descent equals time, water-worn ledgers). The cog's moonbeam reflection and the femur-stylus creation anchor micro-setting choices that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Caldera's philosophical lens (abrasive calm, silt-blinded eyes). Spatial choreography remains legible across the dive sequence and surfacing beneath the belfry.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet library is vividly anchored with crimson drapes, cedar and candle smoke, mahogany table, and stained glass depicting clasped hands. The rosette—mulberry wood, lattice, soundhole—functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining Mara's ritual and charging the final image when it crumbles. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (saffron, iron, river water from book-spines; moonlight falling through glass), and the environment subtly guides her choices (placing the rosette beneath the beam, kneeling to listen). The library's physical logic remains stable, and spatial choreography is clear across all moves, earning solid high-7 placement.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted greenhouse constrains multiple choices: Marisol must wait for the celestial alignment threading light "into a single silver needle," the corroded ribs and broken panes filter light into "molten lattice," and rust flakes provide fertile soil mixed with ash. The micro-setting (her body, the trowel, the plate) charges the final image when vines transform copper bones and translucent leaves replace glass. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the environment evolves causally as the seed grows.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning tower, copper cones, glass booth, and melted wax frames are vivid and purpose-driven; the summit platform with "copper cones bristled like petrified sunflowers" charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy matches POV (ozone, cooling metal, sulfur) and the viewport glimpse of melted hexagons reweights Mara's resolve. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (booth → stairs → sealed hive chamber → summit → descent). The tower constrains her ascent (forbidden maintenance stairs) and the copper rods at the summit enable the final lightning strike, meeting the 9+ quick test for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quiet bay, net-drying shack, and crawlspace are vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "sodium glow thinning against the dawn like memory against bone," "wallpaper hung in petrified waves," "floorboards had curled into the shape of a spiral." The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining her sensory anchor and charging the final ritual. The Forsythe place's motionless curtains and swallowing windows pressure her investigation. Spatial choreography—tide line, sill, crawlspace descent—tracks cleanly. The setting's salt-and-cedar vocabulary remains consistent and purposeful, and the final image of houses standing "a fraction straighter" grounds the thematic resolution in physical change.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater garden setting constrains every choice: depth limits light ("bruised glow"), salt erosion matters (chisel marks, sugar mortar), buoyancy affects movement ("glided"). The ampoule itself functions as micro-setting object that charges the closure—its foxglove stain, violet film, and warmth are tracked across beats and its breaking through the keystone's "eroded seam" is the pivotal physical act. Spatial choreography is clean: statues positioned in garden, arch location established, narrator's path traced through sea-grass. Sensory hierarchy reflects the telepathic POV: taste and touch of emotions dominate over visual. The garden's transformation at closure (corals of ambiguity, anemones of doubt) evolves causally from the memory release and directly enables the final invitation to divers.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The infinite staircase constrains every choice: Elara climbs because motion defines her, the blood sigma marks previously unmarked stone, and step −1 is the site of the final act. The chipped die's asymmetry and the stone's texture anchor micro-setting as crucible. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: cool stone, velvet-heavy air, warmth through the ripple all escalate toward closure. The staircase's perpetual hum and the dice's "uneven clatter" are filtered through mathematician POV without postcard listing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop greenhouse supplies concrete sensory anchors—peat, saffron, marigold scent, cracked mirror, moon through glass—that shape Mira's ritual. The calligrapher's brush and indigo brew function as tools with tactile presence. Spatial choreography remains clear across fire escape, potting bench, north window, and wall. The brush's glow and orchids opening out of season charge the final third, and the smog-choked city contrasts the lace-silvered ivy, raising the setting's pressure on the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto city setting constrains choices throughout: limestone alcoves filled with refugees, spiral walkways past exhibits, the waterfall's roar becoming a lullaby in the deepest chamber. The makeshift kitchen transformation and the education center commandeering show environment under pressure. Micro-setting details (candlelight bread-baking, opera glasses, dough) charge the final image where Aurelia shapes bread. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical city traversal. The setting functions as more than backdrop; it enables the community's adaptive response and shapes Aurelia's final choice to join them.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Basalt steps, tide-pools, murals, and gears provide vivid anchors, but orientation debt (applied in Q2) caps this category at 7.0. The lighthouse interior (rusted yoyo, hollow throat, levitating bricks) constrains one key choice (the yoyo throw) and charges the final image (empty lighthouse, swaying string). Sensory detail is often atmospheric rather than filtered through urgent POV priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tower sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funhouse is vividly rendered through selective, character-filtered detail: "candied apples and wet copper," "mildewed velvet," "strobing glow." The setting constrains movement (tilted maze, photo booth at the heart) and supplies the mirrors and booth that enable the protagonist's confrontation. Spatial choreography is clean, and the final collapse of mirrors into salt that dissolves under calliope music charges the closure image. The micro-setting (body, clasp, booth) functions as crucible. Strong atmosphere sustained across beats with purposeful sensory selection.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating orchard, Doldrum Wall mirror, and blue hour are vivid and purposeful. The raft's planks, mast, barrels, and peach tree constrain the prophet's actions (he strikes them, rigs them) and charge the final image when the crown spins and children dance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (he hears more than he sees). Spatial choreography is clean: prow, glade, rails, mast ladder. The setting functions as instrument and pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtle-shell city is not mere backdrop: Grand Akmon's tremor travels up her spine and triggers atlas consultation; the turtles' simultaneous course change is the story's pivot; their subsonic understanding closes the piece. The reed whistle, spiral-shell atlas chambers, and the crack in the air all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the cartographer's professional lens (comparing tremor rhythm to pattern languages, tasting iron in harmonics). The micro-setting—her body on warm carapace, the bridge between two shells—grounds every beat and makes spatial choreography legible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy-punched skylights, rusted rails, nettles) and the rosebush functions as both timekeeper and motif. Spatial choreography is clean through the semaphore climb and freight-tunnel exit. The setting constrains one choice (climbing to evade the watchman) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the professional detail (historian's archive work) remains abstract and untested by tactile constraints, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered (slick granite, rusted chandelier chains, Corinthian columns, porous stone) and the water lapping her ankles constrains movement. The descending ladder, wet marble steps, and spatial choreography remain coherent throughout. The central dome's "circular void where the keystone should have been" directly enables the climactic inscription and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional attention (hydraulic lime, steel spatula) and her emotional state (censers that "forgot their prayers").

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The flooded library constrains Mara's investigation: rising water forces touch-reading, darkness requires lantern extinction to see phosphorescence, bronze drawers and marble floors anchor spatial choreography. Micro-setting (the stamp pressed to water surface) charges the climactic revelation. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately—lantern light, cold seawater, fingertip braille—and the blackout's reclaimed stillness becomes tactile pressure. The glyph's street-grid revelation depends on the flooded environment and phosphorescent plankton, making setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating stones, tea garden, and basilica are vivid and purposeful: hovering stones require the maker to "descend while ascending," tea leaves chime and exhale dream fragments, and the basilica's cold starlight charges the threshold crossing. The maker's craft knowledge (gem-polishing method, lantern-maker's knees) filters perception and constrains her ritual choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical and architectural transitions. The micro-setting of the moonstone and the maker's hands anchors the final image, where scent shifts from kerosene to tea, constraining and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory is grounded with sensory particulars—helium sacs hissing, transparent floor, circuit breakers cooling—and the setting constrains his actions (he uses the telescope, breaks circuit breakers to alter wind patterns). The geode as micro-setting object charges the closure image when its dust patterns form wedding toasts. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from maintenance shafts to railing, and the desert below supplies the tactical map for his hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ancient observatory is vivid in the opening ("sandstone walls glowed amber," "broken astrolabe," "spiral stairs") and the dusk timing creates atmospheric pressure. The matrix chip catches light and casts "star-shadows across the ancient stones," a concrete micro-setting detail that charges the pivotal beat. However, the observatory's spatial layout (colonnades, columns, dome) remains loosely choreographed—Mara lands the drone "on a nearby column" and descends stairs without clear positional logic—and the setting does not constrain the lever-pull choice or alter Mara's options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt terrace, driftwood shore, and watch hand create a tight spatial container. The grandfather's carvings—mermaids, ships-as-whales, featureless children—accumulate senory weight and constrain Elias's path by offering the carved honest face as mirror and proof. Micro-setting (kelp tangle, terrace steps, his pocket) grounds each beat. The carved face charges the final image by serving as the second heart "that had learned to beat true."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-worn parapet in mist is established early and pressures every choice: wind carries sound across water, stone bites skin, fog erases horizon until "only the parapet existed." The drawer pull's corroded brass and the tarred dock-rope are handled objects that constrain tactics (protocol forbids metal chains; the rope's knots represent grievances cast into the void). The final image—stones holding warmth of gloved hands—charges closure by making the setting a vessel for transformation rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal setting constrains choices effectively: utility poles structure the navigation attempt, fog erases visual guides forcing reliance on wire-hum, shipping channel marks the boundary decision. The kayak and drysuit function as micro-setting that charges key moments (compass gash, water baptism). Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered ("sodium glare," "bioluminescence," wire hum). The poles as surrogate constellation framework gates the entire journey and appears in the final boundary image, directly shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake constrains the peak choice: wading in triggers memory return, and the water's glow becomes a literal vehicle for empathy transfer. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("cold fire," "silence felt wet"), filtered through the seeker's urgency. The baseball's orbital motion and the lake's reflective properties charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across ward, drains, and shore. Minor: the storm drains and arterial labyrinth receive brief mention but do not materially alter tactics en route.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight constrains the ritual space and the oldest apple tree's roots (drinking from forgetting) charge the conjuration site. The moon-moths, lullaby foxes, three-headed hare, and blossoms opening backward create vivid micro-setting that pressures the ritual and witness the transformation. Sensory details (ghost pepper sting, saffron-honey gold, feather branding lip) are filtered through grief and conjuration urgency, and the final blooming-without-consumption image reweights the grove's function at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The midnight glade, silver moss, and cloudbound setting are vivid and sensorially distinct, filtered through the cartomancer's grief-laden perception (moonlight "tasted of sugared milk gone cold"). The saucer crack functions as micro-setting, constraining the card-reading ritual and later detaching to strike her chest—a purposeful object-as-setting move that charges the closure. Spatial choreography (climbing, kneeling, landing in backyard) remains coherent across the descent. The glade's transformation from above-clouds to inside-cloud to internalized space is a strong atmospheric arc that supports the thematic reconfiguration without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    The recycled spaceship hull and gravity spinner supply vivid, purpose-driven details that anchor the world. Photographs as material objects (stitched into a sail with hair monofilament) demonstrate micro-setting constraint. However, spatial choreography inside the ship remains vague and the "bruise in space" functions as pure metaphor rather than navigable environment. The ending garden-transformation is asserted, not shown through causal environmental change.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The black sand beach and volcanic setting are vivid and specific, anchoring action early. The obsidian cave and fire-resistant orchids constrain movement and charge the final image (seedlings sprouting as footprints). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though some descriptions ("ribbon of lava hissed," "viscous glow that tasted of salt") lean ornamental. The environment actively shapes the path and closure, meeting the 9+ test's requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The luminous fort at twilight is vividly anchored: cold torches, bruised violet sky, gear-driven lanterns dark. The blackout functions as a live constraint, guarding conspirators while endangering the garrison. Spatial choreography remains clear across postern gate, chain-room, and inner keep. The bronze quill holder as micro-setting object constrains and enables—graphite picks the lock, threaded base bleeds aether—charging the closure sequence. Sensory hierarchy reflects Garnet's priorities (touch of iron, smell of sealing wax), though some details lean decorative ("murdered torch bracket," "startled swans") rather than choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tidal bluff and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors, and the painted rocks function as micro-setting objects across multiple beats. However, spatial choreography falters: Elias stands on "wet stone" that "should have sent him sliding" yet remains "perfectly still"—the frictionless world's physical logic is declared but never constrains a choice or alters a tactic on the page. The rocks' placement at "1.618 times the distance" nods to golden ratio but does not pressure the outcome; the sequence could be any pattern without changing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stormlit observatory is rendered with vivid specificity—lightning, reversed waterfalls, dome ringing like a bell—and the darkroom timer, petri dish, and chemical tray function as micro-setting elements that constrain Mara's ritual. The storm itself pressures the action (overexposing the second sheet, charging the catwalk scene) and the final image of the empty petri dish with a star-shaped stain charges closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency in the darkroom beats, though the metaphorical density occasionally drifts toward postcard lyricism rather than choice-driven particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)

The broken anniversary clock functions as micro-setting, handled twice (struck against the rail, ticking in her arms at closure) and charging the final image. Yet spatial choreography falters in the middle: the hatch behind plywood, the shaft widening into a greenhouse "between cumulus pillows," and the boundary between viewer and vista dissolve without clear cues for how the pianist moves or where she stands relative to the projectionist. The arbor's "cloud-roots tugging the greenhouse downward" and fog pouring through film perforations are evocative but do not constrain a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ridge as dragon's back, vanilla lattice dream-bower, and orchid fibers all constrain Calyx's choices and charge the ending; the monsoon's arrival enforces urgency and the physical act of braiding fibers into the earthly echo of the fissure. Sensory selection—"storm-cooled air," "coppery ink," "luminous doubt"—is filtered through Calyx's professional lens (reality-checker) and advances pressure. Spatial choreography within the dream-sequence is impressionistic but remains legible. The setting's transformation from literal ridge to dragon-scale metaphor to woven-doubt artifact is purposeful and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)

The rain, wind, and tides are woven through perception and action rather than cataloged.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the floating observatory and geode constraining choices (e.g., smashing circuit breakers alters wind patterns). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, charging the final image with the desert's embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient observatory constrains choices and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "sandstone walls glowed amber" and "broken astrolabe." Setting is woven into action, influencing Mara's descent and the pilgrim's actions. Micro-setting elements like the drone and matrix chip are integral to tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting constrains choices—the driftwood carvings lead to Elias's realization—and the cobalt terrace charges the final image with atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting constrains choices and charges the final image—the parapet and mist erase horizons, forcing intimacy and altering tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's bias, with weather affecting action. The micro-setting of the drawer pull and rope functions as environment, deepening the closure. Specificity avoids cliché, though minor repetition in mist description.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting constrains choices and charges the final image: utility poles guide navigation, the kayak and compass micro-settings alter tactics (e.g., compass gash, wake impact). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, with vivid imagery like "blinking sentinels" and "fractured sky" reinforcing internal states without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly and economically rendered—rotting orchids, warped aluminum, skeletal frame, water sluicing over her gloves—and always filtered through Mara’s scientific sensibility. The environment is not merely decorative: it supplies the butterfly dust, embodies decay/growth, and its ongoing collapse charges the final image and her thematic realization. Weather and flood history meaningfully inflect her choices (coming here for silence after the flood, ignoring yet another storm) and anchor the tone. This is near exemplary; the only reason not to go higher is that the physical precariousness of the structure never quite forces a tactical change on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is outstanding: the “quiet canyon under stars,” frost, ash ring, kiln, bus, and new studio are sensorially rich and tightly filtered through her artisan’s eye. Environment constrains tactics (she reads “patterns in morning frost” and wheel tracks, drops glass beads in canyon cracks) and charges the final images (sunlight igniting beads, the kiln-like hum of bus tires). Recurring objects (glass shards, frost, charcoal) evolve meaningfully to support the thematic pivot. A hairline restraint in descriptive density at a couple of moments could sharpen urgency, but the atmosphere is fully integrated with character and arc.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The winterglass conservatory, frost, and silent-aurora world are described with striking specificity and are constantly in play. Environment and tools (scanner, forks, ice dome) actively constrain and enable choices—for example, the lack of sound forces heat-mapping and thermal notation, and the thawing frost literally registers the “performance.” World rules about impossible silence and thermal echoes are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. The final image of frost thawing “in perfect fifths” and color burned into ice is a setting-charged culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly particular and consistently filtered through the undertaker’s sensibility: the underwater city library as “dome cracked open like a skull,” shelves as “processional candles,” and silt that “had once been reading tables.” Environment shapes choices—he follows the lens’s glow, navigates the barnacled boulevards, and uses books as both catalog and combustible offering. The lens and library physically and symbolically constrain what he can do and charge the final image of the column of stillness and skyward signals. The world’s rules (cold fire feeding on memory, catalog octopus, cracked lens) remain coherent within the story’s surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, valley, abandoned rail spur, and wild sage create a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and politically charged. Setting elements meaningfully constrain tactics (night runs, hidden arbor, rail spur drop point) and charge the final image (ridge, sage, bell at dawn). Details like “terra-cotta flakes glinting like dried blood” and “candles were forbidden but breathing continued” are specific, not generic. World rules around sanctions, checkpoints, and forbidden light stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight viaduct, wisteria, and river fog are not postcard backdrops but active agents: scent thickens with the breathing, arches become thresholds, and the camera projects the flowering gorge into a literal door. The environment constrains and enables choice—without the blooms and foggy lucidity, there is no door, no orchard, no charged return to the viaduct. The final image of petals falling “slower, as if the air itself had become considerate” shows the setting reweighted by their inner shift. Density skirts excess at times, but the world remains coherent and tactically relevant throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The living bridge garden, hedges, and hourglass hawthorn are gorgeously concrete and continuously integrated into action rather than postcard description. Environment and recurring objects (bridge, halo fragment, tree) directly constrain choice and charge the final image. The temporal geometry of the maze and the celluloid rings make the world’s rules feel coherent and lived-in within the lyrical frame. Minor restraint on description in places could sharpen impact further, but the setting already performs structural work at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The carnival is not just decorative; its concrete features (cracked mirrors, prize netting, Tilt-A-Whirl booth, cellophane feathers, parade float chains) directly constrain options and enable key tactics (spooking guards, tangling them, hiding the vault). The setting’s decayed whimsy underlines the thematic contrast between hollow “prizes” and real sustenance, and the environment evolves with events (wall collapse, dust, sunlight, sirens). The micro-setting of the redemption center and Tilt-A-Whirl operator booth functions as tool and crucible, culminating in a final image of seeds and arrow that only works in this world. A touch of description is arguably luxuriant, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: rusted keels, sunken lifeboat hulls, aurora, and the greenhouse form a coherent, tactile environment that shapes both the magic system (orchard drinking memories) and the ritual at the forge. World rules—memory as fuel, roots feeding on stories, the forge transmuting absences—are learned through action rather than exposition. The environment meaningfully charges the final images (buds opening with a fragrance that “sounded…like forgiveness”) and underpins theme rather than sitting as ornament. Spatial and sensory choreography remain clear despite the density of imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Emerald Station, marigolds, and the interplay of sunset/moonlight/dawn create a tactile, coherent micro-world that’s strongly filtered through the thief’s sensibility. The station is not just decorative: the coordinates in the ring, the specific bench, the south exit, and the evolving flower codes all tie the environment to both plot and closure. The marigold stall and petals literally articulate the final injunction (“go home, memory is enough”), which charges the last image. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, it meaningfully shapes how information is exchanged and how fate and memory are staged.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned control room and thawing weather station are exquisitely specific and fully integrated into action (fuel from the chair, tape as structural reinforcement, dripping ice and cornice collapse shaping mood and stakes). Sensory detail (cardamom, metallic melt, magnetic tape like snakeskins) feels filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a glassblower rather than touristic description. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain choices and charge the final image of the dome sitting on the console as a “lighthouse.” The setting’s shift from frozen to thawing directly parallels and supports the heart-change at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “rusted library under the stars” is vivid and consistently exploited—iron stacks, drainage alcove, projector, and perforated roof all shape tactics and imagery. The environment constrains the shell’s hiding place and enables the critical move of projecting his raw fear onto the ceiling. Details feel filtered through a stunt-world eye (shelves like a “prop ship,” stars like “unpaid extras”), deepening mood without becoming a static backdrop. The setting charges the final image of stars and trembling footage but stops just short of a 9-band leap in sheer environmental inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, the parapet, the salt-slick stone, and the last star form a vivid, lived-in environment filtered tightly through the oracle’s sensibility. Setting isn’t decorative: the fort’s history (soldiers fleeing, stones groaning, corridors rearranging) and the weather (lightning without thunder) directly shape the metaphysics of the hush and her mapping. The last-star sky and the dissolving fort constrain options and charge the final image of her stepping into her outline as the only remaining fixed point. Environmental details evolve with events (fort dissolving, storm yielding to endless night), reinforcing both mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight, frost, and dead fountain are vivid and recurring, and the transparent ice violin strongly anchors the atmosphere and final image. Setting is not mere backdrop: the cold, repetition, and abandonment echo the mechanized, constrained existence and charge the closing sense of “eternal cleaning routine” against endless tomorrows. Weather and environment subtly shape tone rather than concrete tactics, but in this lyric mode that’s appropriate. The world-building of the Second Chance Program is sketched efficiently and consistently, though it stays more conceptual than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” and dust-filled projection booth are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through Mira’s attention. Setting is not mere backdrop: the rain-streaked pillars serving as a projection surface and the dawn “unbuttoning the sky” at the end charge the final images. The obsolete projector and missing lens function as concrete anchors tying environment to conflict and theme. While the physical space does not heavily constrain physical options, it meaningfully shapes atmosphere and the mode of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden maze, moving hedges, hidden grove, and apple tree are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action, not postcarded; the setting literally rearranges itself to shape her path and options. The Ministry/luck-tech frame is efficiently sketched, letting the organic maze rule-set dominate the atmosphere. Environmental elements—the fountain, arbor, impossible apple, clearing with the glove—directly charge the final images and the theme of reciprocal knowing. A slight restraint from the very top band comes from the world’s larger rules remaining suggestive rather than fully felt as constraints beyond this contained moment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: the xenobiology station, violet cloud-sea, moth-bats, and nexus all shape what is possible and how she thinks. Environmental elements directly constrain choices (the lever, aviary, and nexus mechanics) and deeply charge the final image (twilight corridor, wings at rest, mechanically warm lungs). World rules are conveyed through action and perception rather than exposition dumps. A slight expansion of how the broader station ecosystem depends on her could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The flooded opera house, lantern light, and underwater costume archive are vivid and specific, and the environment repeatedly shapes action (wading, submerged staircases, hidden doors, water-parting, ghostly ripples). The water and damage motif also literally alters the program’s content and charges the final image of “water-soluble ink” transforming into something new. Spatial choreography—pit, aisle, staircase, basement, chamber—remains coherent and supports the descent structure. This rich atmosphere is one of the piece’s strongest assets and does more than postcard work.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain weather station is vividly rendered through specific tools (anemometer, barograph, rain gauge, logbook) and sensory detail, all filtered through the oracle’s mind. Environment constrains and charges choices: she uses the station quilt, the logbook, and finally the rain gauge as a burial vessel, so the setting isn’t mere backdrop. Weather and aurora are not generic; they actively mirror and modulate the pressure of the swallowed truth and the release. This is richly atmospheric without drifting into unanchored description.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned train tunnel and overlying factory are vividly, economically rendered—dripping water, culvert whisper, mineral stink, rusted rail—and always filtered through Mara’s fixations. The beaded valve wheel and ladder function as environmental constraints that shape what she can do and how she can leave. Setting details evolve with the action (finding, rolling, opening, and leaving the wheel spinning) and the final image is inseparable from place: a gyroscope in the tunnel measuring “new equilibrium.” World rules remain consistent and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The overgrown library, river, mirror-water, roots, and catacombs are richly realized and tightly integrated into action (shelves moving, scrolls regenerating, the mirror bearing her weight, the library as literal “refuge”). Environmental details consistently filter through the keeper’s purpose and the story’s tone, and setting explicitly constrains possibilities (the library’s refusal to remember, the regenerating/erasing chronicle). The recurrence of obsidian, water, roots, and parchment charges the final image, though there’s a mild risk of sensory overload from density rather than perfectly economical selection.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: Sage Ridge, the Listening Stone, silver sage, and eclipse light are all sensorially rendered and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment and objects aren’t just decorative; the ridge’s elevation, the ancestral offerings, and the stone as ritual locus directly shape how she can act and what the children experience. The recurring curl and stone charge the final moments with lived history and continuity. It’s rich, specific, and integrated enough to approach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The reclaimed silo library is vivid, tactile, and integral: spiral walkways, grain hoppers, concrete bays, and card catalogs all shape her movements and options. Setting details are filtered through her sensibility (“air tasted of cooled ember and graphite,” “bronze quiet”) and evolve with the action as the building physically realigns. The final image—dragons transferred into the curvature of the silo, shelves vibrating like uncurling wings—depends entirely on this specific environment. The setting is not backdrop but the primary crucible in which the story’s metaphysics and emotional stakes unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse and rocky island are richly rendered and integral: the lamp doubles as enlarger, the rock as lithophone, the isolation as both prison and launch pad. Environmental specifics actively constrain choices (night skiff, exposure by lamp, dependence on tide and moonlight), and the recurring stone/light images charge the final chord of “key of salt and departure.” Details like the Fresnel lens, chipped mugs, and combers “like negatives developing” are precise and purposeful, not decorative. It stops short of 9-band only because weather/sea never quite force a tactical adaptation beyond mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary on a fold in space, dimensional anchor, and “unraveled stillness” form a strikingly concrete yet uncanny environment that is consistently used rather than merely described. Setting elements directly constrain and channel action (echoes as tools, silence as ornament, the anchor groaning under “simultaneous truths,” the priest becoming the still point). The recurring objects (loop pedal, palette, anchor) all return to charge the final image with cost and consequence. Sensory detail leans heavily auditory and conceptual by design, but it aligns with the piece’s stakes and remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and nautilus are exquisitely realized and tightly integrated into action (stairs printing ghosts, spire as organ pipe, lake as soundboard). Setting is never postcard; environment literally constrains and enables her method of mapping and composing, and the final image of bubbles thawing into music is charged and memorable. World rules (mirroring, resonance, sound as frost) are consistent within the piece’s fabulist logic and learned through use, not exposition. Minor deduction only because the lushness sometimes edges toward aesthetic excess rather than pure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing viaduct, inverted rain, neon-bred algae, and sideways-time weather are vivid and tightly integrated into both mood and mechanics (fractures hanging in air, droplets as frozen seconds cutting him). Setting evolves with the plot—the viaduct forking, the arches inscribed with “a different name for the same sin,” and finally returning to ordinariness—which charges the final image. The environment does shape options (paths, fractures, the rail he smashes the tablet on) but mostly as a lyric crucible rather than a tactical maze. It’s richly specific and purposeful, just shy of using environment as a hard constraint on choice at every major turn.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drum maker’s cavern, hides, cedar dust, frost, and phonograph create a vivid, coherent micro-world that is consistently filtered through Mara’s tactile orientation. Setting is not decorative: the workshop’s tools and surfaces (bench, floor, drumhead, cabinet) are how she “hears” and thus how the story’s emotional core is delivered. The environment evolves toward the cavern mouth and falling snow, which charges the “seasons turning again” realization with concrete atmosphere. The recurring objects (needle, drum) double as setting elements that constrain how she can experience sound and therefore grief.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtyard, cloister, shaft, and phosphorescent lichen are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail that aligns with Elara’s professional gaze. Environment constrains and enables choices: the quiet courtyard allows off-grid calibration and the pigeon’s arrival; the hidden shaft provides the literal “lateral” escape; the underground lichen-map embodies the rogue zone’s shifting truth. Weather and atmosphere—dusk, rain, earth’s “breathing”—are thematically woven into the final image. Setting stops just short of absolute top-tier because the physical danger of the follower in that space remains mostly atmospheric rather than concretely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The greenhouse and desmellified city are vividly and economically drawn, with world rules (olfactory collapse, engineered fungi, UV panels) learned through action rather than exposition. Setting is not backdrop: the greenhouse uniquely allows scent to exist, constraining his options and making this place the only arena where his grief experiment can happen. Recurring objects-as-setting (orchids, panels, vials, lanterns) all charge the final images and his new vocation. The atmosphere maintains a compelling balance of the clinical and sacred, turning environment into active thematic machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta grotto and clay hills are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with stakes—finger-grooves in clay, residual energy presence, and starlight all mirror and contain the tension around choice. The rope as an object-as-setting element (coiled on the ground, then worn as a belt) directly charges the final image and the narrator’s tactics for understanding time. Environmental details are consistently filtered through the poet’s sensibility without devolving into a tourist catalog. The only ceiling here is that the physical constraints of the grotto don’t significantly alter available options beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: ash-slick mud, sunken orchard, shipwreck ring, and the coppery post-burn sky all filter through Mara’s sensory and professional biases. Environment constrains and enables action—the shipwrecks provide rigging wire and the drowned bell, the greenhouse glass shapes acoustics, and the burned orchard contextualizes the single scorched seed. World rules feel consistent in their surrealism, and the setting evolves with the scene (from hush and ruin to breathing, humming space). The final image of the seedling and humming bowl depends entirely on the specific greenhouse-shipwreck ecology, not a generic ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber grotto and its resin, static, and dusk light are vivid, sensorial, and tightly woven to the emotional atmosphere. The environment evolves meaningfully—from luminous, secretive space to darkened stone and the hum of the earth—and those shifts mirror Lira’s internal thaw. The grotto doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does charge the final image and the whole emotional field. World rules around scent and static feel consistent and organically revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the breezy library with “card catalog drawers like gull wings,” the derelict Wharf of the Lanterns, and the research vessel all feel lived-in and particular. Environmental details consistently mirror and deepen the emotional stakes—stars and constellations ceiling over her private rituals, the obsolete wharf echoing outdated but persistent forms of care. The library and wharf do guide action (place of encounter, place of delivery) but more as mood-charged stages than hard constraints. Still, recurring objects-as-setting (ledger, locket, lantern) strongly charge the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystalline orchard and crater are vividly evoked—moonstone paths, sapphire fruit, chiming branches—and details are filtered through Lira’s sensory and emotional priorities. Environment isn’t just postcard: the arbor’s warmth and naming-etches govern ritual, the gentled gravity and luminous trunks shape how seekers move and perceive, and the final flare and light-webs explicitly charge the closing image. World rules (breath-glyphs, persistent tags, tonal shifts with time) feel consistent and understood through action rather than exposition. A slightly heavier tie between physical constraints and tactical choices could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop canal system, iron aviary, living wisteria, and giant beneath the city form a distinct, immersive setting filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Details like water flowing backward, clocks reconsidering their chimes, and blossoms “reimbursing seconds” feel purposeful and tied to the time-bending premise. The environment guides her path (upstream walk, forked canal, canal-edge doorway) and subtly mirrors the temporal distortions. It’s more atmospheric than constraining at moments, but world rules remain consistent and vivid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cavern orchard is vivid, strange, and consistently leveraged: the stalactites’ dripping (and prior silence) define the stakes, the mosaic stone and calcite tree provide the physical grammar of the ritual, and moonlight is literally refracted into meaning. The environment doesn’t sit as backdrop; it actively constrains tactics and powers the solution, then charges the final image when the dripping resumes. Details like “fruit of crystal and calcite,” “turquoise chips,” and “liquid starlight” are specific yet never feel like a catalog. Spatial relations (stone, tree, stalactite) remain coherent throughout the transformations.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shadowed library, crawlspace, pipe chases, and flickering emergency lights are not just decorative; they dictate what Elias can and cannot do and make the tape fragments plausible and charged. The environment shapes tactics (sliding reels through knotholes, caching in unused pipes) and underwrites the premise that stories must be physically “cached” in darkness. The final image—the girl reading above “where a man once lived”—is inseparable from the architectural and atmospheric setup. Setting, object, and body are tightly woven in a way that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse/nursery and storm are richly textured and clearly filtered through a botanist’s eye (“sap moving through spring wood,” “mossy trellis,” “automatic sprinkler system”) and they actively shape what is possible—her rooting, the trellis catching her, the storm as communicative field. The linden leaves and silver veins function as recurring environmental objects that decisively charge the final images of the transformed nursery. Setting and weather are not mere backdrop; they constrain and enable the metamorphosis and later the mode of access for visitors. A slight tendency toward lush ornament in the aftermath paragraphs keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island, causeway, half-drowned monastery, and rain-tracked basalt are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s eye as an artist. Setting is not postcard garnish: tide and causeway frame her window of access, rainwater literally feeds her pigments, and the monastery’s water-damaged frescoes embody the “tidal artifact” theme. The amber brooch and later vial of spring water act as charged objects that bind environment to history and to closure. World rules around the water wars and the island’s spring feel internally consistent and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered through concrete, sensuous detail—the chiming limestone, the still lake that “seemed a hole in the world,” luminous water absorbed into music—and it consistently shapes what is possible. The environment is not just backdrop but mechanism: it records footsteps, rewrites memory, seals bargains, and finally disappears, making exit and return non-trivial. The later park setting is sketched economically yet effectively contrasts diesel, baking bread, and hopscotch galaxies with the subterranean cave, extending the “setting” into his body via the scar. The only limit is that the external world remains lightly sketched; almost all atmospheric depth is concentrated in the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—the “ivory harbor after rain” and the bell tower drunk on storm water immediately define tone and world. Environmental elements repeatedly charge meaning: the harbor as blank page, the customs ledger, the “Possible Music” room, and the cliff cemetery each modulate how absence and return are felt. Weather and water subtly pressure choices, especially in the fear-of-water thread and the final act of sounding over the harbor. The recurring harbor margin at the end turns the environment into a charged frame for the new note.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the cedar-smelling mist and rail yard to the starlit tunnel that becomes the “vault” and finally the observatory roof, each stage mirroring his internal passage. Environmental elements meaningfully constrain choice—the tunnel mouth and glowing tracks are not just pretty but physically and symbolically channel him toward confrontation. The recurring object-as-setting of the phantom punch and the cracks in the pavement deeply charge the final images. Occasionally the density of imagery borders on ornamental, but it rarely loses spatial or emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the open tower “like a tuning fork,” the coastal cliffs, migrating whales, and the astrolabe all shape the story’s sensory world and its metaphors. Environmental specifics (starlight as catalyst, whale song below, salt mist on glasses, jasmine from Nur’s memory) are filtered through Mara’s concerns and echo the theme. The tower and shoreline tangibly charge the final images—the humming stones, the tide pool receiving the tile, the calf breaching against parchment-sky—so the place is inseparable from the closure. It slightly favors atmosphere over hard constraints on tactics, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prismatic escondite, Möbius corridors, and solar storm are vividly rendered and integral: the storm enables the mutiny and the door’s emergence, while the station’s dimensionality and anchors directly shape what’s possible. Environmental details like magnetic moans, vermilion walls, and melting timepieces feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The amulet and door operate as charged objects embedded in the setting, not detachable props. Only occasional density of imagery risks veering toward decorative, but clarity and functional constraint are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prep room is vividly evoked—formaldehyde and lilacs, bone saw, eyelid weights—and consistently filtered through Cassidy’s sensibility. The setting reinforces theme (death, legacy, bureaucratic “granite” vs liquefaction) and charges images like Julian’s smirk erased by death. While the room doesn’t strictly constrain tactics (they could almost meet elsewhere), the corpse and tools materially intensify the moral calculus. The recurring focus on objects-as-setting (ink pot, stainless steel, caskets) gives the environment real texture and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exquisitely particular and integrated: the bonsai labyrinth, volcanic soil, copper wire, and blessed lamp all evolve with the action, culminating in the trees breaking their miniature constraints. Environment genuinely constrains and enables choices—the rearranging paths, the lamp at the heart, and the mountaintop isolation shape what Aurelia can do and understand. The final images (trees grown, lamp dimmed, town below) are inseparable from the thematic turn about history and longing. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the lushness edges toward saturation, occasionally prioritizing texture over immediate situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The port’s shipping-container labyrinth is rendered with tactile, multi-sensory precision—sodium light, salt shadow, groaning metal, fog, drones—and never feels like static backdrop. Environment constrains and enables action: the stacked aisles provide concealment, echo chambers for the recordings, and literal surfaces for her counter-labels, culminating in the final tagged container that radiates phantom sounds. World rules around the poison shipments and bureaucratic erasure are consistent and learned through concrete detail rather than exposition dumps. The setting decisively charges the last image, where the label on a single container stands against the city’s systemic forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory on the cliff isn’t just décor; the broken telescope, plaster constellations, and glass “that once measured starlight” entwine setting with his measurement-obsession and the theme of failed knowing. The seashell, half-finished cello, and later galaxy of paint flakes act as micro-settings/objects that constrain what he can do (he must use this specific instrument-shell apparatus) and charge the final image. The cliff reappears in the vision of “every culture…standing on the same cliff,” directly tying environment to the universality question. Weather and nightfall (“stars clicked into place like punctuation marks”) modulate mood and the sense of a closing window.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly and economically rendered—calliope, pontoons, shipping-container dorms, drowned coast—and these details feel lived rather than touristic. Environment meaningfully shapes choices: the floating, lashed-together nature of the city makes “scuttling the raft” a live option, and reconfiguring the layout becomes their primary tactic. The recurring foundation stone chip ties setting into Lina’s body and into the final image. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in early lines nudges this just shy of the very top tier but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lunar summit is rendered with precise, purposeful detail—vitrified regolith, terminator wind, Earthrise light—always filtered through the inspector’s professional and emotional lens. Setting directly constrains choices: vacuum “wind” timing the chemical blush, UV bleaching dictating the photographic window, the abandoned Tycho station and sparse infrastructure heightening isolation and futility. Tools and objects (hourglass grain, wristpad, antique camera, basalt shard) function as micro-settings, shaping tactics and charging the final image. The worldbuilding feels lived-in and consistent, with no white-room moments or decorative scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mist-coated depot, boilers, glass drippers, kiln, and rain barrel are sensually and functionally integrated, with environment consistently filtered through a blind artisan’s non-visual priorities. Setting elements actively constrain tactics: she uses boiler hiss as metronome, drippers for diagnosis, the barrel to retrain the drone’s sensors. World rules feel coherent and specific without infodumping, and the sea/harbor context naturally enables the ship deadline. One small limitation is that the “rail depot” aspect is more atmospheric than structurally necessary; the shop’s micro-ecosystem does more heavy lifting than the broader transport hub.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and constantly doing work: the rusted outpost, frozen “shattered mirror” lake, and throat-like shaft all feel both concrete and thematically apt. Environment constrains choice (the cold, the tripod and rope, the isolation) and charges the climax and ending—the refrozen lake and lone frost spiral are inseparable from the story’s meaning. The underground estuary with multilingual carvings and bioluminescent microorganisms is memorably realized and integrated with Maren’s linguistic/mapmaker lens. This world feels fully committed to its own rules without over-explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically fused to the action: cobblestones, bell towers, the archway keystone, and even bellflowers are all used as functional extensions of the town’s “bones.” The environment directly constrains choices (he must walk the square; he must strike the keystone; the ground carries memory), and the final image is inseparable from place. Details are sensorially rich without losing spatial coherence. The only reason this doesn’t push into a higher band is that a few images (“moonlight tastes on the tongue of a sleepwalker”) lean more toward decorative lyricism than pressure-bearing setting.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater temple is vivid and coherently realized—cracked lapis tiles, coral-grown organ, whale-rider murals—and its architecture directly shapes tactics (flooded nave, last air pocket, sanctuary deeper in). Environmental rules (sound swallowed by water and hush, stone tendrils gripping the mast, organ pipes clogged) are consistent and govern what is possible. The vial-as-micro-setting and copper coil as tool further charge the final image when lilac bubbles and perfumed broadcasts recur. The setting is inseparable from both the conflict and the closure, not a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are richly textured and absolutely integral: the reef of cracked boats, the lantern room, and the impossible staircases all constrain and channel action. Environmental specifics (rusted rails, Fresnel lens, salt-bitten hinges, straw mattress-manuscript) are not decorative; they directly host the decisive acts (reading, fitting the lattice, projecting the beam). The building’s rule—sustaining impossibilities—remains internally consistent and explains the hovering and time-bent architecture without exposition dumps. Setting also charges the final image as the lattice rotates, grinding lies into beams while the reef accepts the tide “like a final absolution.”

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly specific—copper pipes, silver pomegranates, humming quartz—and its rules are consistent and discovered through action. Crucially, the setting functions as a crucible: its endless night, steam-fed trees, and fruit-as-currency directly shape what the characters can do and how the debt is paid. The withering of the trees and dissolution of the glass at the climax reweight prior images rather than serving as mere spectacle. The final dawn and the seed ready for an ordinary, season-bound tree sharply charge the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The red canyon labyrinth, emptied harbor, and returning tide are vividly realized and tightly integrated into action—the canyon “stitching him forward,” walls shifting, stairs rebuilding, the loom sinking under the sea. Environmental constraints and affordances (spirals, switchbacks, ledge, dry basin) shape his path and the final bridge image. Sensory detail (orchid scent, moonlight like spilled milk, moth-wing fabrics) is lush yet purposeful, mirroring the story’s themes of ruin and renewal. The setting also charges the closure: the restored water, orchid-bearing waves, and canyon as keeper of a secret give the final image weight.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and functionally integrated: roots threading bones, fossilized petals underfoot, iron gates, and the tomb-as-root-cellar all shape what she can do and how. Setting directly constrains action—the moving roots create a literal path to the first prayer house, and the sundial base interacting with sun and ruins is what enables the climactic rebuilding. Sensory detail (myrrh-scented air, oxidized-copper eyes, bell metal) is rich yet mostly purposeful, with the orchard and chapel floor charging the final image. World rules for this enchanted, post-colonial landscape remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the golden arcade, neon from the 2080s, glass roof, chalked spiral—filtered consistently through her perception. Environment and objects (postal slot, drone, clipboard, chalk) meaningfully charge the action and final images, not just decorate them. The arcade and its light actively shape tone and mood, supporting the “futuristic nostalgia” and the sense of ritual. The erasure of the chalk spiral at the end functions as a physical reconfiguration of the inner map the story has built.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn chill, stained glass, and candle-lit dome are richly specific and consistently filtered through her occupational eye. Crucially, setting isn’t ornamental: the candle’s optics enable the reveal, the observatory’s projection system scales her embroidery into a weapon, and the autumn dawn/coup deadline presses time. The recurring candle and dome directly charge the final image of her trimming the wick and starting a new chart. This is vivid, economical worldbuilding that constrains and empowers choices.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth, salt-black water, and singing spirits are not backdrop; they constrain movement, frame the ritual, and shift in response to choices (water closing like skin, spirits quieting for the hush). The shard and the house-rainspout in the final image charge the setting with emotional and thematic weight. Environmental rules (moonlight, water, condensation) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. The last return to the house-that-might-be-every-house elegantly fuses micro-setting and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: the mist-clad atrium, glass roof, banana leaves, and dripping twilight all filter through the translator’s sensibility. The brain coral functions as a micro-setting, its physical grooves mirroring mental “gyres” and literally aligning with the cast spiral at the end. Environmental elements (droplets as failed syllables, footsteps as “percussion of peace”) charge the final images without feeling like mere ornament. The hospital’s functional constraints are lightly sketched, but the mood and symbolic geography are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ruined orchard district and persistent fog are richly specific and fully integrated into the premise—fog as both physical constraint and medium for light and ghosts. The cider house, “plaster still smelled faintly of fermented stars,” becomes a literal tool: a living wall that constrains her tactic and enables closure. Environmental details evolve with action (fog folding into a dome of faces; mural as “private dawn”) and charge the final image, where the outside remains pewter while the interior glows. Setting is inseparable from both method and meaning here.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, tuned basalt slabs, silver spoon, and visible echoes are richly imagined and fully integrated into action, not just backdrop. The environment actively shapes events—the stones refuse her song, the nickel uses a sounding stone, echoes become ribbons that move her, and the grass “recording” her question charges the final image. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through use, making the surreal space legible. This is an exemplary, economical use of setting that mirrors and channels the thematic concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse and broader surveillance city are vividly and economically rendered—orchid bees, passionvine, drones, moonlit soil, ventilation systems—and almost every detail serves atmosphere and tactic. Setting repeatedly constrains or enables choice: the need to kneel among plants, the pot placement, the greenhouse vents distributing coded pollen, the drone and satellite pass dictating timing. World rules (thought tax, Form 1099-IDEA, warp seeds) are consistent and taught through action and metaphor rather than exposition dumps. The final image of gardens spelling “Resist” uses the environment as living text, charging the theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nautilus cathedral and its apex chamber are richly imagined and integral: the spiral, limestone, dew, and “hollow pearl” aren’t backdrop but the mechanism that captures centuries of insomnia and enables the photosynthesis metaphor. Environmental specificity (cracks like ammonites, bioluminescent throat) is consistently filtered through Zale’s sensibility and charges the final image. The setting itself constrains action: he must climb, ensconce himself, and physically embed the postcard in the shell to trigger change. It stops just short of 9+ because the outside world remains more gestural than embodied, though it’s sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is richly particular (opal library above clouds, museum of extinct feelings, tear-cities, apology-gardens) and always filtered through function: bulbs as storage, the chandelier as gatekeeper, the vertical drop that sends the tube down to the child. Environmental rules are learned through action (bulbs inhaling light, demanding payment) rather than exposition, and those rules shape what is possible. The space is coherent and tactile despite its surrealism, and the recurring objects-as-setting (tube, chandelier, bulbs, railing) charge the final images. The world feels large but never touristic; every strange detail is in service to mood, stakes, or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The extinct language archive is vivid and specific—dust that “tasted of iron and regret,” shelves that breathe, a hidden mural—and these details both reflect and shape the conflict. The environment actively resists her (snuffing candles, gusts of dust) and then transforms into an ally, and the glass ink well as a tool-object decisively charges the final image once left behind. World rules (prismatic vows, chorales as chords) feel internally consistent in a mythic mode without deadening exposition. A touch more indication of the surrounding city’s physicality before the final diffusion of the hum could make the external stakes even more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    The amphitheater within the breathing volcano is richly realized and functionally integral: its acoustics enable the lullaby’s transformation of discord into harmony, and the “breathing” mountain directly informs the compromise rhythm. Details like vine-choked steps, basalt benches, copper-tinted mortar, and moonlight “dappled resolve” are specific and consistently filtered through Mireya’s technical and emotional lens. The setting doesn’t just decorate; it constrains what’s possible and charges the final image of the river and the volcano’s sigh. The environment’s rules stay coherent and are learned through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The attic, skylight, dust motes, and bookshop are sensuously rendered and tightly filtered through Mirela’s perceptions as a balance-trainee and archivist. Environmental specifics (loft between chimney stacks, nests lined with rejected libretti, the hollow under the windowsill) are not postcard details; they constrain what she can do and charge the final image of the dust “chord.” The setting’s rules and textures remain consistent and become inseparable from the story’s emotional logic. The attic as micro-world is what makes the closure image work.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is richly particular: the drifting prism terrace, creaking house, scarred oak table, weather-coded growth rings and mazes form a coherent, tactile world. Environment directly shapes action and meaning—the terrace’s westward drift and literal edge provide the physical condition for her final step, and the table grain is the investigative tool. World rules around wind, corn, and time-warping mazes are fantastical yet internally consistent for this lyric mode. A slight bias toward visual/symbolic description over other senses keeps this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater research facility and drowned city are vividly, specifically rendered—moon-pipes, thermocline-powered projectors, bioluminescent copepods, and barnacled opera houses all feel integral rather than decorative. Environment meaningfully shapes options: limited unflooded corridors, moon-pipe access, and the thermocline power source allow the ritual’s form while the auto-ascending sub frames what’s possible in time. Setting details consistently mirror and deepen the emotional and thematic stakes without lapsing into catalog. A slight density of imagery flirts with overload but remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The iridescent cave/geode and its crater glass are richly specific and tightly integrated with action: surfaces literalize emotion, skylight admits the bird, the cave flexes and then seals, and the ground outside softens to accept the new path. Setting rules are consistent and learned through use (transliteration, seeds blooming memories, cave exhalation) rather than exposition. Environment actively shapes options—this kind of path-making is only possible here—and charges the final image of Lira leaving as the geode becomes “just another crystal memory.” Description is lush yet functional; this is near–publish-ready atmospheric craft.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal arcade is vividly and economically rendered—waves under corroded steel, salt haze and neon puddles, soapy water turning the deck into a “private cosmos.” Environment continually shapes action: the grating, bucket, and water create literal slip-and-chaos, while the starry, tide-timed pier frames Cipher’s quasi-cosmic experiment. Recurring objects (bishop, slot machine, coins) feel physically rooted and charge the final image of the arcade as a living chessboard. Setting is not just backdrop but the medium in which the story’s core metaphor and tactics unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight garden, moss, dry fountain, and starfield are not mere wallpaper—they’re actively entwined with theme and action (memory scent, forbidden night-bloom, stars rearranging as a signature). The moonstone dust and her own body function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices, especially as dust is consumed to finish the stanza. Environmental details are lush, sensorial, and filtered through her tide-dancer sensibility rather than catalogued. The setting’s constraint is mostly atmospheric rather than logistical, but it still powerfully charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: Pearl Bay’s hush, kelp and rust smell, condensation drip, and harbor windows all feed the ritual, not just the wallpaper. The environment and objects (pier post, pond, lighthouse glass, town windows) recur and culminate in the final image where the prism’s light repairs cracks across the harbor. Dawn and water are not mere scenery; they condition the ritual’s form and the story’s temporal pressure. This is close to top-tier micro-setting work, though a touch more constraint—where the bay physically limits or complicates her choices—would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge, burn-scented pines, granite “altar,” and valley are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through a firefighter’s lived familiarity with fire and terrain. The setting does more than decorate: the ridge is the trauma site, the granite dish focuses the ritual, and the moonlight literally projects the cracked pattern and spiral outward. Environment charges the final image (signal over the valley; ash teaching the pines a new dialect) without ever feeling like a generic backdrop. It could constrain physical options a touch more concretely, but as a micro-ritual landscape it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tide-polished grotto, shells, kelp, and sea-cliff village are vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated with the action, not mere backdrop. Environmental details actively shape what’s possible (the sea as source of “decorations,” polished stone floor, tide she walks into) and clearly charge the final image. World rules—involving balloons, gauges, and parallel grottoes—stay internally consistent and are learned through Mira’s ritual. The setting’s texture and atmosphere are strong enough to carry a high-level speculative venue.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly realized and functionally integral: the ivy-clogged university wing, the moss “lung,” the maintenance hatch, and especially the negative-lined tunnel all constrain movement and meaning. Environmental logic (the building as camera, storms as flash, dripping corridors as trays) elegantly fuses worldbuilding with theme and the final image. Details remain specific and biased through Mira’s acoustic/professional lens rather than generic ruin porn. This is publication-grade atmosphere with real narrative work behind the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting work is lush, specific, and integrated: the prism parapet, abandoned bell tower, and cracked mirrors are not just backdrop but the literal arena of trial. Weather and architecture affect image and concept (rain + parapet = split spectrums citizens can later step into), and the bell tower’s echoing terrace frames the temporal stakes and final image. World rules around mirrors, parapets, and bell-bells stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The environment mostly charges theme and image rather than physically constraining tactics, which keeps it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace, obsidian and silver under aligning moons, is vivid and specific, with the celestial clock and star of redemption giving the scene both atmosphere and ritual constraint. Setting is tightly integrated: the terrace becomes a conduit, its veins pulsing and reflecting the war, and its crumbling at dawn marks the cost and completion of the ritual. Objects-as-setting—the clipboard, lily, feather, scale—are spatially and symbolically coherent, always in relation to the altar. The only limit here is that the environment pressures meaning more than it constrains tactical options in a concrete, resistant way.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The salt flat and bruised sky are not just beautifully rendered; they rigidly constrain what can happen and charge the final image (footprints filling with rain, salt dissolving the map). Environmental details evolve causally with the action—cracks mapped then filled, storm electricity funneled through underground crystals to the egg, rain erasing everything—so the world actively participates in the ritual. Sensory specificity is rich but purposeful, with smell (“vanished reeds and river mint”) and sound (thunder as wings) deepening atmosphere and theme. The setting is inseparable from the story’s logic; relocate it and the narrative collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is lushly specific and integral: the silver courtyard, snow, prism sanctuary, mercury-weeping statues, and mosaics all contribute to atmosphere and thematic charge. Environmental changes track causally with her actions (snow hissing away as knots are undone, sanctuary collapsing after its purpose is fulfilled). The setting does more than decorate; it encodes history (predecessors in tiles, hollow statues) and charges the final image of a transformed courtyard filled with lanterns and light. At times the density of imagery borders on excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and specific—“rusted geodesic shell,” broken panels, humming ghost receivers—and those details are filtered through Lucien’s artistic, reflective eye. The setting meaningfully charges the story’s logic: the receivers and satellites resonate with broadcast/ethics, and the dome becomes his first gallery and transmission point for his manifesto. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does conceptually shape what he does with his insight (writing on the dome for satellites to read). This is rich, economical worldbuilding that serves theme and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto above the clouds, dissolving cloud-soil, lightning-scarred log, and verdant ferns are vivid, sensorial, and tightly filtered through Elara’s task-focused perception. Environment is not mere backdrop: its transient rooting concretizes the theme of temporary permanence and constrains the memorial to be ephemeral, charging both her choices and the final image. The setting evolves with action (butterflies arrive, structure lifts, cloud-soil reknits), and the climb/descent bookend the emotional arc. This world’s esoteric rules feel internally coherent and lived-in without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are not postcard backdrops; they actively shape stakes (the glacier erasing the town, the aurora as the “lantern” and medium through which voices manifest). Environmental specifics—the black-ice pylons, frozen ropes, skylight, and glacial wind—are tightly integrated with both the ritual mechanics and the final image of names traveling south in meltwater. The setting materially constrains choices (this has to be done here, now, before further melting) and charges the last paragraphs. Sensory detail is lush but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated, with details like “ceiling tiles sagging in calculated arcs” and the cracked-lens floor doing double duty as environment and symbolic mechanism. Setting actively shapes options—the bunker’s architecture “negotiating its own escape,” the lens collecting lightning, metal liquefying into soil. The closing images of a seed-like bunker and a clearing where rain falls upward show the environment transformed by the story’s events. This is exemplary world-building for the length, only narrowly shy of a 9 because spatial stakes never quite constrain a concrete tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Babylonian palace is rendered with economical, specific detail—cedar doors, lapis lions, clerestory starlight—that feels both sensory and conceptually apt. Setting consistently shapes options: the abandoned palace, sealed sanctum, and pre-conquest window enable his clandestine act. The recurring lapis and brick imagery directly charge the final image of “lapis light ripple across bricks.” World rules (ancient mechanisms, magic-math interface) stay coherent within the piece’s mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The soundless sanctuary and its melting, reforming reality are imaginatively wrought and tightly integrated with the emotional arc. Environmental rules (walls breathing, objects reappearing, shifting from stone to silk, ceiling to sky, floor to lake) consistently mirror the loosening of resentment and directly generate the central crisis when the sanctuary “demands balance.” The music box also operates as a micro-setting/object that constrains choice, especially once the pin snaps further and silence becomes part of the stakes. A hair more tactile, grounded sensory detail could deepen embodiment, but the atmosphere already powerfully shapes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard district, fog, frost, and glass mountains are vivid and specific, with sensory detail integrated into action (breath condensing into petals, frost on rusted gears, sapling with mirror leaves). Setting is not mere backdrop: the orchard is the birthplace of her mirrors, the fog is what must be “silvered,” and the environment literally transforms at closure. The recurring objects—the sextant, mirrors, frost—charge the final image and reconfigure meaning. A tiny fraction of images verge on decorative repetition, but overall the environment constrains and completes the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral-orchard is richly rendered (“figs… drip from rafters,” “branches wove tracery finer than any mason’s dream”) and continuously interacts with action—climbing scaffolds, grafting beams, sleeping under the graft, petals snowing through the nave. Environment constrains and enables choices (needing to climb high, using corbels and rafters as living scaffolding) and directly charges the final image of the older mender beneath the grafted beam. The setting’s logic (fruit bearing scrolls of vows, pollen-infused ribbon scenting the city) remains consistent within the piece’s fabulist rules. A few fewer decorative flourishes would make the functional constraints of the space stand out even more.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard, asteroid, and bathroom pod are not mere backdrop but active machinery: the trees’ telepathy, the bathroom’s plumbing/xylem, and the orchard as nonlinear family archive all constrain options and drive choices. Setting details are consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility (“starlight-laden petals that chimed like tuning forks,” “zero-g roses”) and evolve as stakes rise (fruit becoming galaxy-fruit with black-hole seeds). The final images—pistachio shell in the spine of the sky, new asteroid-orchard—are inseparable from place. At this length, the integration of environment with theme and plot is unusually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally textured and integral: the labyrinthine bookstore, glossary-staircase, root-walls, and mountain all constrain movement and define how problems are solved. World rules (books as sentences, roots spelling warnings, diary-blooms pointing to gaps) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. Environmental elements directly shape tactics (following the clematis, descending the glossary, dealing with the crystal paragraph) and charge the final images of the diary on a root-desk and the humming corridors. The atmosphere is not decorative; it is the operating system of the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are extraordinarily vivid—calliope, roulette table, mirror-maze, carousel roof, all filtered through her haunted agenda. Environment is not mere backdrop: the maze structures her search, the ship’s sinking forces her to stay or flee, and the fog-book redefines the world at closure. Recurring objects (emerald card, carousel, lilies) charge the final image with concrete, spatial consequence. The specificity and integration are at a level ready for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly and efficiently realized: brass plate in stone, spiral stair, gears “taller than confessionals,” oxidized flakes of time, and the ceremonial rope all feel tactile and charged. Setting is not ornamental; the frozen hands, the janitor’s diary lore, and the gear shivers all directly mediate what’s possible and how Elara acts. The final callbacks—the tower ticking on, the chancellor’s rope braid—prove that environment and object-as-setting are doing thematic work as well as atmospheric. It stops just short of a 9-band only because the physical constraints never seriously limit her options; they mostly aestheticize the ritual rather than oppose it.

    The harmonic caves are powerfully realized and rule-bound: sound animates and endangers, stalactites “chime if you breathe too hard,” and the Abyssal Gate’s ancient frequency shields them. Environmental constraints (silence as survival, brittle ice futures, the Mirror Pool’s unbroken surface) directly dictate tactics and possibilities. Recurring objects-as-setting—the echo chamber stone, ripple-mark maps, lichen light—are woven into navigation, divination, and the final ritual, charging the last image. World rules remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition, with only occasional risk of sensory overload from density of invented detail.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the glass humming pavilion, post-collapse coast, vine-choked malls, and desert under specific constellations all feel concrete and lived-in. Environmental features routinely shape action—the tower’s architecture, the desert and Joshua tree, and the absence of ships all matter to what she can do and why the rekindling is symbolic rather than practical. Recurring objects-as-setting (the prism, the lighthouse lens, the shard of hush) charge the final image of her as a living prism. The atmosphere consistently mirrors and amplifies the emotional stakes without slipping into generic apocalypse scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and specific, from “stormlit observatory above clouds” to the whispering crystal tiles and lightning statues whose shadows she measures. Environment and objects actively constrain and enable choices: the solidifying fog offers a lethal/preserving option, the forecourt records memory, and the observatory’s altitude makes the potential fall and “mold” tangible. These elements recur and evolve, culminating in the final image of the translucent figure on the forecourt absorbing dawn. The world’s rules (solid fog, archival thunder, memory-crystal) stay internally consistent and are learned through her actions rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: the blooming fortress, corked sky, dry moat, spiral stair of constellations, and the governor’s black-sand hourglass all shape mood and choices. World rules (sealed stars, confiscated flames) constrain tactics and force Luma into creative workarounds like trading for the rag knot. Recurring objects—the fortress, the battlements, the sky, the hourglass—return at the end with reweighted meaning, charging the final images. The environment is never postcard-only; it actively participates in both the problem and its solution.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto, tidal pool, and cicada work as fully integrated micro-setting: limestone “ribs,” starlit basin, and receding tide shape mood and literally constrain options (this must happen in the tide’s low, in seclusion, before dawn). Environmental details evolve with the emotional arc—the pool empties, then refills; constellations shift; dawn color arrives exactly as they reach the rim. The recurring pool/tide imagery charges the final image of the tide reclaiming the basin and erasing footprints, making the environment inseparable from closure. Sensory specificity is high and always filtered through the chronicler’s professional eye.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The xenial trellis, inverted sky, root-garden, and bunker form a vivid, coherent environment that shapes what Lira can do—climb, trade, store silences in the doll, then leave it “wedged between two vines.” Setting is always filtered through her body and fear (lungs, hair tugged toward earth, narrow rail), which tightens atmosphere. The inverted-gravity hour and above-the-clouds liminality charge the final image of returning below with “stretched sky in every breath.” The one constraint keeping this just shy of 9+ is that the physical geography of the trellis doesn’t force a hard tactical choice beyond the single-rail passage, where the pressure is mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drifting prism terrace, cloud-sea, carbon silk cable, and storm glass are vivid, specific, and integrated into action (boarding tied to hexagon crystals, motion to prisms, teaching to the vial). Environmental elements actively constrain choices: no boarding without hexagons, noise monitored by a physical device, and wind and train whistles intruding at key moments. The final images—storm glass as a “private constellation” and the cloud-sea making the sky into a “breathing corridor”—recharge earlier details with thematic weight. It stops just shy of perfection only because we rarely see setting materially complicate tactics beyond these elegant rules.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are the piece’s standout strength: the decaying palace, layered murals, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and bioluminescent orchard are vivid, specific, and integrated into action. World rules—magic/tech fusion, neural implants, quantum keys, genetically modified fruit—feel internally consistent and are learned through her interaction with them. Environmental details (ruby flakes in the wall and doorframe, the spiral of light through rock, the throne of solid ruby) directly frame the central choice and charge the final image. This is publishable-level worldbuilding and tone control.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight is vivid and integrated: collapsed roof, burned stones, and shadows all echo the piece’s threshold/death imagery. The sanctuary functions as a micro-setting that constrains the story’s possibilities (this is the refuge and the crossing site) rather than a postcard backdrop. The doorknocker and scorched circle deepen this sense of a consecrated tool-space. The final image of the ring reflecting “starlight like frozen tears” recharges the setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is richly specific and inextricable from the plot: copper spores, quartz tiles, drip lines, and root-mesh all dictate how Lira moves and what’s possible. The submarine bolt, irrigation pipes, and root-cave pressure literally constrain the key choice, and the setting reconfigures in the aftermath (mushrooms dimming, then settling into “ordinary nightlights for tomatoes”). World rules around intention-harvesting and light-harvesting are consistently implied rather than explained. One could argue for even more use of environmental resistance during the ritual, but as-is the setting is deeply integrated and tonally precise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sepia reading room, brass gramophone, atlases, and tasseled lamps create a rich, coherent micro-world whose objects directly constrain and charge choices (finding and turning the crank, binding the wound with a map page, the open door at the end). Sensory detail is consistently filtered through Arin’s guilt-haunted perspective, with dust as “powdered light” and golden shadows echoing the dynasty’s tarnished glory. The setting evolves with the action (dust spirals, gramophone emptied, statues outside altered), and the recurring objects charge the final image. The only restraint is a slight tendency toward decorative layering of atmosphere beyond what the scene strictly needs.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse/orchard environment is vivid, strange, and consistently exploited: upside-down trees, silver sap, and mercury sky are not just decoration but define what can happen and charge the final vigil image. World rules (gravity-reversing sap, clockwork seeds, endless night) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. The setting constrains the story to this ritual space and shapes the protagonist’s options, especially the eternal, night-bound guardianship. Occasionally the descriptive density risks overload, but clarity and atmospheric control are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The foster care file room is rendered with dense, purposeful sensory detail—mildew, cardboard boxes, fluorescent hum, dust as “forgotten skin and stories”—all filtered through Rowan’s history. Environment isn’t just backdrop; the room’s dust literally becomes her interpretive medium, and the institutional archive enables her critical choice with Marcus’s folder. The final contrast between the sealed, breathing dark of the file room and the snow-lit city street charges the thematic movement from stasis to tentative forward motion. Setting feels indispensable to both the premise and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    The auric lagoon, boardwalk, puddles, and booth are not postcard backdrops; they actively shape tactics (hiding at the lagoon, using reflections as a map, timing drones by stars, broadcasting “uphill” through copper). Recurring images (starlight on water, puddle waveforms, auric glow) accumulate and decisively charge the final image of the city seeing a new “map” in reflection. World rules—archived calls, drones, emergency tower—are consistent and legible without exposition bloat. The setting feels both concrete and mythic, strongly supporting atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto, fog, dewdrops, and prism atrium are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: acoustics, moisture, and light literally shape how the music and prophecy interact. Environmental evolution (sun rising, dew increasing, glass chiming then dimming) tracks the story’s escalation and resolution. The final image of dewdrops on the saxophone’s bell and the multiple reflected faces charges the ending with conceptual and emotional weight. This is near top-tier atmospheric work; only minor restraint in metaphor density keeps it from feeling utterly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mireya’s work and ritual; details like silver-barked trees, catwalks, peat-smelling mulch, and pollen spirals create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting rules (floating grove, rising leaves, mirrored arbor) remain stable and are learned through action rather than exposition. Crucially, the environment constrains and charges choices: the arbor’s disequilibrium motivates the monument-building, and the final image of twin arbors reweights the whole piece. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual detail over tactile constraint is the only thing keeping this from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting work is outstanding and integral: the Thames-side cellar, the subterranean waterfall, and the neglected greenhouse are not just atmospheric but dictate options (the hatch, the ledge, the pool, the leaf spirals). The environment and recurring objects (water, clocks, leaves, compass) directly constrain and enable choices—the descent, the plunge, leaving the artifacts behind—and then charge the final images (leaf compass on flagstones, city’s clocks stopping, distant roar under ivy). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with timeworker attention to mechanisms and water, avoiding generic description. The world’s rules stay consistent in their magical realism and are learned through Elias’s actions rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rain-washed foundry and its tools are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action: gutters of silver, rust scraped from molds, the still-warm anvil, and cannon history all feed the motifs of weight, rupture, and re-forging. Environment and object-as-setting (foundry, coin, alembic) directly constrain what she can attempt and charge the final image of the cooling, gold-veined walls. The return to the foundry at the end (“coinless yet resonant”) makes the place itself a kind of ledger of her choice. Description is dense but not touristic; almost every detail carries thematic or tactical work.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: Echo Gorge, the river stones, the misaligned harp, and the hidden sunrise are all concretely rendered and filtered through Elara’s work and aim. The environment constrains tactics (she must follow the echo downstream, climb the boulder, use the harp and tooth together) and then literally reconfigures at closure (“Echo Gorge exhaled”). Specific sensory touches—mist, frost-warped strings, “smelled of pine and birthday cake”—heighten atmosphere without losing coherence. The gorge and its rules feel both mythic and internally consistent, charging the final image rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered and always filtered through altered perception—“ultraviolet sap,” leaves as a polygraph hum—which anchors both world and mood. The environment is not just backdrop: it administers penance, provides the “equations” (claw marks, hum), and literally dims at the end when the “ledger” is balanced. The pewter strap functions as micro-setting/object-as-world, constraining the body and then charging the final image as discarded “trash.” A minor ceiling: spatial choreography remains intentionally diffuse (lyric), so the forest works more as charged atmosphere than as a topographically constraining space.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alchemist’s market above rooftops, the rope bridges, and the tide-gnawed cliff are vivid and sensorially rich (“air tastes of copper and salt”), with details consistently filtered through the translator’s lived familiarity. Setting isn’t mere backdrop—it’s structurally embedded (the swaying catwalk becomes the cliff; the market folding into fog at the end) and tonally mirrors the liminal work of translation. The recurring object-as-setting (lighthouse lens) and environmental elements (bridges, beams, lantern spiral) charge the final images, even if they don’t constrain logistics in a survival sense. World rules feel internally consistent without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and specific—peeling posters, roll-top desk, sagging acoustic tiles—and the environment is actively used (desk as ladder, tiles hiding stubs, ticket window moonlight). Recurring objects-as-setting (mainspring barrel, fluorescent buzz, ticket stubs) constrain options and heavily charge the final images. The circus context flavors the ghosts and her profession in a distinctive way rather than feeling pasted on. A tiny amount of atmospheric description feels luxuriant rather than strictly necessary, holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are exquisitely specific and constantly active—frost as code, crystal fruit chiming, cloud-vellum, navigation orrery warping. Environment constrains and shapes choices (the floating deck, fragile glass, the step onto cloud, the library folding into a sigil) and directly charges the final image. World rules remain consistent within the negotiated-reality frame. The only reason this does not score higher is that some details, while gorgeous, flirt with excess ornament rather than always tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The baroque asteroid pleasure-palace, visible time, and mirrored halls are vividly rendered and integral to action: the environment directly dictates the survival tactic of covering mirrors and the availability of velvet drapes and broken instruments as tools. World rules (visible time as storm, silica lattices storing anthems) remain consistent and are learned through her interactions rather than exposition. Setting mirrors and deepens theme—the ornate ruin of an empire, time as weather, and the palace as a cradle for an impossible new civilization. The final image of a civilization budding inside the asteroid completes a strong environment-as-fate arc.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined—the copper-and-rust chamber, the frozen Grand Orrery, the black diamond sky, and the color-notes all feel specific and atmospheric. Crucially, world rules like the covenant of rust and the lie-snuffing chamber constrain his tactics and charge the final images of reclaimed light and the paper bird. The environment consistently filters through Elias’s craft-focused perception, integrating tools, sound, and light. It’s lavish but purposeful, and setting meaningfully shapes what is possible at every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptional: factory town, cliffs, neon graffiti, spiral reef stairs, and the lagoon all feel tactile and specific while staying firmly in Ivy’s sensory/emotional filter. Environment and recurring objects genuinely constrain action—the storm-drain, rock door, staircase, and lagoon each gate the next choice, and the final image of the town “forever on the verge of rain” recharges the opening atmosphere. The lagoon’s rules (silence as tribute; translation not drowning) are learned through action rather than exposition, which keeps the world legible. Density is high but never confuses spatial or causal relations.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is richly realized and integral: the storm, tide-wet stone, and “ancient basalt throat” of the arch are not backdrop but active forces that power the slide, constrain movement, and define the magic’s logic. The arch as ledger and its miniature echo explicitly charge the final image, while weather (lightning, foam, wind) shapes what’s possible in scene. Sensory detail—salt-gray wood, shipwreck-and-pine-pitch smell, turbine-hum—filters consistently through Maela’s priorities as a sailor-sculptor. Environment and recurring objects (arch, slide, driftwood) clearly constrain choice and reweight the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The amber pavilion, etched-glass postcards, snow, melting earth, and moonflowers are not backdrop but the story’s operating system, and they directly charge the final image. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables her tactics: she must endure cold, watch snow erase the garden, arrange fallen branches, and use the pavilion’s panes as her cathedral glass. The closing image—pavilion as living postcard, glass “singing with indigo vines,” travelers entering a “quiet cathedral”—is fully inseparable from these specifics. This is a case where setting and recurring objects decisively carry both arc and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and specific—the erg, obsidian lagoon, and Biblioteca Volante are sensorially vivid and filtered through a working archivist’s eye. Environment and objects materially shape choices: the lagoon’s surface as interface, sand as shackle, zeppelin as both access point and broadcast platform. The final image of names spoken “above the obsidian lagoon” recharges the opening landscape with thematic weight. A minor check is that weather and physical hardship remain largely aesthetic rather than strongly constraining tactics beyond the initial descent.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and integral: bone-lantern ribs, shredded ledgers in the well, abandoned telegraph office, and flagpole all shape what the protagonist can do and how (kites, scrolls, rituals). Environment and recurring objects (lanterns, well, bottle) directly constrain choices and charge the final images of ash-ink and a buried witness. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sulfur with brine, “no chimney smokes”), aligned with an alchemist’s eye. There’s almost no dead, postcard description; nearly every environmental element is doing thematic and tactical work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse orchard, rooftop, fog, and specific trees (quince, medlar, Judean date palm) are vivid and consistently filtered through Ambrose’s professional and emotional lens, with objects (wax, ledger, trees) actively participating in the story’s metaphysics. The environment shapes and charges choices: the basin enables the immersion and memory, the trees echo oaths back at him, and the rooftop’s liminal position over the city tightens the sense of him as its acoustic conscience. The final transmutation of orchard and tools into “soft velvet disquiet” directly ties the setting to closure. The only small limiter is that physical constraints of the rooftop never meaningfully impede or redirect his tactics beyond serving as a symbolic arena.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound atrium, frost, fountain, and starlight are richly specific and consistently filtered through her gardener’s eye, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. Environment and recurring objects (atrium dome, fountain vortex, acorn cap) actively constrain choices by making this the one controlled microclimate where time and seeds intersect. The world’s rules—glaciers, reversed water, frost retreating—stay coherent and evolve with her actions. The setting also charges the final image (the dome dimming like a grounded star and the crunch of “borrowed time” underfoot), giving it strong micro-setting closure power.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain sanctuary, clouds, barometer, bell, and siren are not mere backdrop; they actively shape options and meaning. Weather and altitude drive the microclimate stakes and make her measurements and solitude plausible, while the architecture (balcony, belfry, rope) constrains how she can act. Recurring objects—the rope, bell, barometer, glue—accrue charge and culminate in the final quiet stone-bound after-ring. The physical environment is consistently filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lens, giving it both specificity and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vividly realized and integral: the “shooting star tracking station,” brass instruments, dome, and telescope all shape what he can do and how he changes (his job, his ritual, his final act of leaving lenses open). The yellow lantern glass functions as both object and micro-setting, constraining perception and enabling the key vision sequence. Environmental details mirror and deepen interior states without feeling ornamental (dust motes as miniature galaxies, the hush of the overlooked era). The final afterimages on glass surfaces show setting directly charging the last image and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland are vividly specific and tightly woven into every paragraph, with bees/smoke/honeycomb motifs inflecting perception and action. Setting constrains choice—Alden’s duty is inseparable from this place, and he literally sets the box in the largest hive shell to complete the final image. The environment’s transformation at the end (scent of blooming clover, lantern-like box) charges closure with a felt shift from sterility to tentative renewal. Details feel selected through Alden’s beekeeper-framed gaze rather than as a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and purpose-driven: the emerald silo, the rusted loading gauge, dust motes as ex-digits, green wheat like an “unabridged novel,” and the tarpaulin aisles all carry the time-theme without feeling decorative. Environment shapes action—the climb to the silo rim for a numeral-less noon, the time capsule fixed at its base, and the garage sale in its shadow. Recurring objects (urn fragment, tags, silo) directly charge the final beats and his realization. Sensory range (taste of time as iron, tactile ladder rungs) is strong and tightly filtered through his temporal obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lagoon shore, tide, storm, and scattered debris are vividly rendered and tightly fused with the emotional arc. Environment actively shapes choices: his daily return, fragment-harvesting, drawing in wet sand, and the inevitability of the tide’s erasure. Recurring objects-as-setting (feather, zither, kite, shells) decisively charge the final images, especially the tide erasing “Incomplete is the only doorway beauty knows how to use.” The weathered, post-storm atmosphere supports the wounded-horizon theme without feeling like mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are extraordinarily vivid and specific—granite that “breathe[s] like a slow lung,” pillars “seeded by ancients who sang calcium into lattice,” copper-veined oaks, chamomile borders, bats and foxes sharing the space. Crucially, setting isn’t postcard decoration: stone pillars “listen” and approve conductivity, the orchard’s architecture dictates how prayer and treaty are encoded, and the environment’s responsiveness (weeping pillars, humming circuits) is what allows the treaty to exist. The final image—orchard broadcasting at the cadence of a human heart, fox kits chasing harmless blue fire—relies entirely on the established setting logic. A slight density of imagery verging on lushness in places is the only thing keeping this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exquisitely realized: rainwashed tower, moss-softened earth, overgrown sculpture path, and the convergence chamber all feel tactile and lived in. Environmental details are POV-filtered and purposeful—the tower’s field draws the amber, the staircase runoff affects movement, the collapse shapes her exit. The recurring sculptures and the shard-in-soil finale show the environment and object working together to charge the ending image. It narrowly misses a higher band only because the physical setting’s constraints remain mostly supportive rather than oppositional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is richly imagined and omnipresent: dead reef, blooming jetty, flower-drunk sand, and iron-bleeding battlefield all shape what is possible and necessary for the coachman. Environment directly constrains choices (he must work at the bloodiest acre beneath the moon’s reflection, on a jetty already turning to soil) and charges the final image as land and sea dissolve into a continuous garden. Details are selective yet dense, filtered through the coachman’s task and lore rather than tourist listing. The recurring jetty/garden imagery powerfully anchors the closing reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The scrapyard wasteland, the archive, and the buried subway car are vividly rendered and constantly filtered through scent, metal, and ruin, creating a thick, coherent atmosphere. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables choices: the existence of the Edison player, the cracked flats, and the buried infrastructure all shape tactics and discovery. The preserved orchards—accessible only via leaf and smell—function as a micro-setting that directly charges the final image when the wind’s scent changes. World rules feel consistent for this poetic post-war environment, and the final sensory shift (gunpowder to orchard smoke) is a strong setting-based closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observation deck, shutdown station, relativistically smeared starfield, and coffin-sized crawlspace are vivid and purposeful, consistently filtered through Kael’s grief and profession as a navigator. Setting elements constrain and enable key actions: the sealed deck makes his presence illicit, the maintenance hatch and crawlspace provide the literal portal, and the out-of-phase station defines the pocket of grief. The gilded compass rose functions as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image (pinned jacket, spinning needle). A touch more tactile engagement with the physical difficulty or danger of entering the crawlspace would push this to an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky, glacier chessboard, and cloud-top desert are not just pretty; they constrain action (dangerous climb/descend, wind pressure, verticality) and enable the final magical mechanics (shadow stairs, falling upward). Details are selective and purposeful, with the environment evolving—spire shudders, collapses into memory-keeping snow—which charges the ending. The sundial-as-micro-setting and the sky’s wrongness both explicitly shape choices and the story’s cosmology. A touch less baroque ornamentation in places might sharpen rather than dim the already-strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the whispering gallery’s acoustics literally speak, the stopped clocks and interregnum infuse atmosphere, and the chessboard is both environment and charged tool. Sensory details (“air that tasted like iron and lilac”) and selective palace history are tightly filtered through Mara’s archivist gaze. The space constrains tactics—her use of shadow and pattern, the patrol’s entrance path, the gallery’s “stone mouths” that will carry names forward. The final image of the gallery rehearsing future whispers shows environment actively charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain-long labyrinthine bookstore is not just pretty dressing; its spirals, stone shelves, and stormy atmosphere actively shape tactics and danger (navigation via feather, the custodian’s rearranging reality, lightning stored between pages). Sensory detail is rich and precise across senses—“wet paper and thunder that refused to break,” “storm-cloud suede,” “ink-black wind”—and always filtered through the seer’s world-view. Environmental rules stay consistent: books can store weather and talents, the custodian can rearrange sections, and the mountain can collapse inward. The final image of her descending from the ruined mountain, thunder now internal, is charged by everything the setting has done to constrain and test her.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and weaver’s cottage are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Marek’s chess-trained attention. Setting is not postcard: the enchantment literally constrains options, the labyrinth mirrors his mental loops, and the stone board at the center charges the final act. Environmental elements evolve with the arc—the hush, the unborn thunder, the eventual resumption of motion—so atmosphere and world rules directly support the thematic and structural turns. The specificity and integration are at a publish-now level.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon, bone towers, and spire are richly imagined and always filtered through Lira’s artistic sensibility, so setting and psyche feel fused. Environment is not mere backdrop: echoes, bone resonance, and mist shapes directly enable her tactic (refracting sound/light) and charge the final image (quieted towers, humming spire, doubled shadow). The recurring objects—the mirror shard, feather, and split spire—constrain what’s possible and carry clear emotional and thematic weight. A slight check is that the broader world (capital, palace burning, priests’ order) stays sketchier and purely referential compared to the canyon’s fully realized specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The acid sea, anchor-chains, and cramped workshop are vivid and specific, and they actively constrain options (corrosion, hissing chains, limited air). The porthole view and statue’s proximity structure what Lira can attempt, and the environment reacts to her choice (acid recoiling from healed marble, chains snapping). The charm and statue function as charged micro-settings that dominate the final image. Description is consistently purposeful, though nearly every line is “turned up,” which edges toward excess at times.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting work is exceptional and fully integrated: the harbor town, industrial smells, and the cave’s “cathedral veins” are all filtered through Ren’s painterly eye and emotional state. The coastal cave network is not postcard scenery; it literally enables the preservation tactic (bioluminescent light to paint by, fissure to stash the shell) and separates the hidden eternity from surface erasure. Recurring environmental elements—salt, tides, demolition machinery—are reweighted in the final contrast between the forgetting coast and the remembered quay below. The physical world constrains and channels choices at every stage, charging the final image of plankton illuminating unseen art.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, cobalt glass, dawn light, salt air, and night garden are all richly sensory and tightly integrated with her tactics: she waits for temperature and scent conditions, opens windows, uses the tower’s height and materials as part of the ritual. Setting details (night-blooming flowers, approaching rain, fountain) are filtered through her obsession with vibration and purification, and they charge the final images of the cork and ripples. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it structures what is possible and when, especially the heat wave’s suppression of “subtle” signals. This is publication-level atmospheric integration.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The starlit signal station, dunes, and half-drowned town are vividly rendered and consistently filter through her grief-saturated perception. Setting is not ornamental: the failed hydraulics, moon-driven dish, and spatial relationship to the receding ocean literally constrain tactics and enable the reverse migration. The censer foot functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges multiple beats and the final image of flowers under the station. World rules (moon-phase current, dish azimuth, dunes reversing) stay consistent and learnable through action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine are vivid, sensorial and tightly integrated into action—roots as nooses, fruits knocking like teeth, the mud and film literally climbing her body. Environment constrains and shapes choices (rope ladder descent, kneeling under creaking roots, the branch fall that spills the mixture). Recurring objects—the orchard, ravine, storms—directly charge the final image when the narrator carries the ravine inside and plans to return. World rules are consistent enough for the lyric mode, with setting always experienced through her professional and emotional biases.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, opal dock, mist, and sea are not just decorative; they concretely shape perception (limited visibility, sound-based awareness, gaps) and thus Maris’s investigative method and options. The Edelweiss and the lamp room function as micro-settings that constrain choices and charge the ending image, especially when the dock becomes a “closed eye” mirroring the resolved pattern. Sensory detail is lush yet pointed, consistently filtered through a keeper’s trained attention to light, sound, and absence. The environment’s liminal, maritime quality is inseparable from both the logic and the mood of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story offers vivid, economical settings—from the dusty back room and flooded streets to the limestone cliffs and bioluminescent cavern—filtered through Elias’s relation to maps and margins. The stone doorway with the shifting symbol and the fungi-lit cavern strongly shape the atmosphere of threshold and otherworldliness. Environment modestly constrains action (the hidden cliff opening; downward passage; central doorway as focal point) and charges the final image. Some details (e.g., the fungi) are more scenic than functional, but they still support tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt/ember grotto, basalt steps, and bleeding starlight are vividly rendered and consistently filter through her urgency, never reading like neutral backdrop. Environment materially constrains choices: there is only the climb, the mouth-like grotto, the shard, and crown—no other exits or tools—so the place is the crucible. The final image of a hidden crown burning above the clouds and warming summers retrofits the setting into an active, ongoing mechanism, not just a stage. World rules (memory as starlight, the sky tearing) remain internally consistent and are learned through her actions rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ember nexus, volcanic glass, obsidian archway, and glowing fissures create a vivid, coherent micro-setting that feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the story’s molten emotional stakes. Details are filtered through Corin’s sensibility (heat, light, glass) and return meaningfully when the crushed pocket-sun makes the volcanic glass “sing” and stretches their shadows. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it decisively charges the final image and the sense of presence. A slight pullback from maximalist description in a few lines could sharpen, rather than dilute, the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally textured and integral: cedar smoke, iron stove, birch bark, grave between hemlocks, and blue-glass moonlight all filter through her sensibility. Environment continually shapes the beat—the stove sparks as failed comforting words, wind as a page turning, snow as erasure, and the stone pinning the scroll as a miniature monument. The mountain is not mere backdrop but an active, indifferent presence whose “want” (its minerals back) reframes her work and the final image. One could argue for even more tactile interaction with the physical cabin under pressure, but what’s here already constrains and charges choices meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The water clock repair shop and morning fog are richly realized and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility, with tools and atmosphere mirroring her inner state without feeling mechanical. The water clock and screw function as micro-setting elements that directly charge the final image (the drop as newborn gasp, the screw as keepsake). Environmental details evolve with the emotional arc—the fogged-in workshop as diaphragm, then the lifting fog revealing “ordinary miracles.” Very slight risk of over-dense imagery, but it does not obscure spatial or situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock tea platform, the bottomless lake, the rail-less edge, and the storm are not decorative; they all directly echo and constrain Lina’s choices and fears. The kettle’s behavior creates the temporal constraint, the missing railing concretizes the danger linking past and present, and the rain/typhoon modulate pressure and then release. These same elements are recharged at the end (rock rising, storm “listening,” soaked-but-unbloodied mats) to signal reconfigured stakes. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sheet music archive and endangered orchard are vividly realized and constantly active in the story—the humming fluorescents, labeled “Orchard Suite,” and tractors at the property line all shape mood and action. Environment constrains and enables choices (induced currents through shelves, the archive recording her spoken apology) and charges the final images (tree falling on a low E, the out-of-season lilac). Sensory detail is rich and purposeful, especially in sound and smell, without feeling like a generic backdrop. At times the density of imagery skirts the edge of overrichness but never sacrifices clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient temple library is richly realized and never merely decorative—the shelves, spiral, basalt column, marble floor, and light-without-shadows all actively mediate what can happen. The environment literally shapes the conflict: the rearranging dictionary, bowing shelves, and gyroscopic spiral constrain motion and make her tactics (step-counting, placing the dictionary at the axis) meaningful. Setting and concept are fused, especially in the final image where the library shelves itself inside her. A trace of abstraction remains—sensory detail leans heavily on metaphysical imagery over tactile or bodily anchors—but clarity and atmosphere hold.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fjord, brass instruments, hydraulic systems, and horizon station are vivid and specific, and the setting feels lived-in rather than generic. Crucially, environment and tools constrain choice: the water-driven network and primary chronometer are what he can act upon, and their reversal physically enacts the conceptual turn about time. The dissolution of the station into a “watercolor wash” charges the final image and reweights earlier atmospheric details. Sensory focus is mostly visual but is purposeful given the horizon-measurement frame.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly realized—spores, sapphire glow, shelves, ladders—and consistently shapes tactics (laser tests, following folds, the spiral nexus). Environmental features constrain movement and possibility: permeable “solid” barriers and breathing cavern passages are what make duplication and merging possible. Sensory details (cool, ionized air; bird-note leaking down) are selective and thematically charged without feeling touristic. The world rules remain coherent, though the science/fantasy boundary is deliberately soft.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are vividly particular: “rainwashed library at midsummer,” “wet stone and old paper,” and “clover melancholy” all build a distinctive, coherent mood. The lantern and the library operate as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices—the basement archives enable the diary discovery; the returns desk and unlit candle shape the final image. Environmental motifs (rain, subway, clover, mica light) return at the end in reweighted form, especially the clover shifting from clinging scent to guidance. The world feels small in scope but very lived-in and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway utility tunnel, underground booth, rusted gate, and single rail into “dark that smelled of fresh ink” are concrete, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through the operator’s sensibility. Setting is not backdrop: the underground isolation and the obsolete infrastructure directly shape his life, the relationship, and the pivotal walk to the gate. The glass booth, the grate with sodium light, and the track bed all recur and constrain his options at key beats. Environment and recurring objects charge the final images of him abandoning the booth and walking the tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The jetty is richly rendered—barnacles, covenant stones, gulls, engines—and these details are filtered through her archivist eye so they never feel like neutral scenery. The environment meaningfully shapes action: the rotting planks, storm-damaged pilings, and looming demolition justify the urgent nocturnal documentation. The apartment and piano at the end function as micro-setting that reweights the earlier jetty imagery via absence (no locket, but music and the empty strap). The only limit keeping this from the very top band is that the final image leans more on object/emotional resonance than on the physical environment pressing choice in that last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station and ivy are deeply integrated: the stopped clock, backward-ticking dawns, ivy-braided trellises, and turquoise paint all shape the atmosphere and the magical logic. The setting isn’t just decorative; its disused status and frozen time justify Kit’s off-grid existence and make the later reopening a meaningful threshold. Environmental evolution (ivy spelling Latin departure times, canopy of mirrors, leaves “waving” goodbye) charges the final image and reflects the thematic arc around loneliness and departure. It could push even higher if one or two concrete physical constraints of the space affected on-page tactics, rather than primarily symbolic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ultrasonic forest, moss, stillpoint clearing, and sky of pausing constellations are vividly specific and consistently filtered through his unusual sensory palette (sound/taste/touch rather than sight). Environment is not decorative: the forest “tightening its dark green walls” and then “releasing him at its edge” materially frames his passage and mirrors his inner constriction/release. The platinum ring and cane function as micro-setting objects that constrain how he navigates and how the final image charges. World rules are stable within the piece’s surreal logic, with no jarring inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station, viewport, comm-garden, anomaly, and quantum log-scroll are vivid and filtered through Mira’s professional attention, never reading as white-room. Environment materially shapes choices: the anomaly warps causality, powers the rewriting, and relaxes only after her intervention. The pen and gravity both charge the final images (cooling relic, stuttering corridor, warmth in her boots). World rules, while fantastical, remain internally consistent across the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The luminous harbor is vividly and economically realized—moonlight, capstan, cannery roof, water becoming “slow-moving sheet music”—and the environment is inseparable from the story’s effect. Setting actively charges the climax (buildings vibrating, masts ringing, water into notation) and the closing image (camera on the harbormaster’s shelf, harbor listening). Details feel filtered through a consistent, slightly mythic sensibility, never like a tourist catalogue. This comes very close to exemplary; the only small gap is that the physical environment constrains few concrete choices rather than primarily serving as resonant stage and instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archive is sensorially alive—“soot-stained walls,” “lavender and sulfur,” and the warm tapestry-in-the-dark give the setting distinct texture that matches the premise. The environment is well integrated with the thematic machinery (ashes, burning history, hidden vaults) and supports the atmosphere. Still, the archive rarely constrains Ember’s choices or tactics; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than active pressure. That keeps the setting vivid but slightly under-leveraged in terms of narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid, original, and inextricable from events: the sound wave garden and auric lagoon don’t just decorate the piece, they shape what Mira can attempt and how. Environmental rules (leaves as speakers, water that dissolves identity, seedpods of ghost lullabies) are consistently applied through action rather than exposition. The garden and lagoon concretely constrain choices at climax and charge the final image of her perched as conductor over an “auroral veil.” Sensory specificity—particularly auditory and luminous details—supports tone and theme without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The port-city container labyrinth, violet aurora, and metallic acoustics are specific and vivid, and they’re filtered through Mira’s professional eye, which keeps them from feeling touristic. The environment is not decorative: the metal corridors conduct whispers, the storm interferes with GPS but amplifies sound, and the star-shaped junction physically focuses the climax. The chamber of keys and coins extends the setting into a secret sub-layer that directly charges the final image. This is an example where environment and recurring objects genuinely constrain choice and define the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and indispensable: the cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, canal depths, and harbor fog aren’t postcard garnish but the very medium she works with. The canal and darkness literally and thematically constrain action—her tools and tactics (floating shutters, fishing line, starlight angles) all depend on this watery, reflective environment. Recurring objects (dock, canal, mirror, shutters) charge the final images, especially the idea of stars “swim[ming] home beneath the hulls.” Sensory detail leans visual and tactile but the selective focus fits the hushed, high-attention mood.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt library in mist, the shoebox grotto, and the glowing window constellations are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard; it actively shapes tactics (library as clandestine venue, mist and curfew as cover, shop windows as communication medium). The recurring objects (grotto, sapling, boards) charge the final image so that the space of the town feels newly alive. World rules are consistent within the magical-real frame, with environment and hour (“after curfew,” “amplified quiet”) constraining what’s possible.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The marine setting is richly specific and consistently functional: the sublittoral fringe, breathing rocks, barnacled ladder, and drifting timbers all shape what Lira can do and where the ritual can happen. Environmental conditions (tide height, island physically detaching) directly drive the stakes and the necessity of forming a raft-city. The scrimshaw as a recurring object-microsetting charges the final image when returned to the sea. Atmosphere and world rules (weapons to coral, islands lifting) feel cohesive and learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid and functional: turbines are not just backdrop but active agents (snatching shavings, generating hush, providing the joint where the feather lodges), and the farmhouse porch with wired bouquet is a lived-in performance space. Environmental rules (silence ordinance, monitored spectrum, wind behavior) feel consistent and shape choices. The final images—planted stems, turbine whoosh as audience exhale, wrapper on the fence—are inseparable from this landscape. This is a textbook case of environment charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt atrium, humming quartz pillars, frozen lake, and lantern-moths form an integrated, dynamic environment that constantly interacts with the action. Setting isn’t postcard-like; quartz music, the ice’s fissures, and the lake’s thawing directly mediate the paraphrasing of law and the danger of entrapment. The final images—lake rehearsing its first wave, pillars dreaming of new throats—charge the environment with ongoing consequence. The story’s world rules, though fantastical, feel internally consistent and are learned through her embodied engagement rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard, furnace, greenhouse, phoenix ash, and spiral garden are vividly rendered and consistently used as pressure-bearing environments and tools. Objects-as-setting (reed tongue, marble eye, glass shards, dying plants) meaningfully constrain choices and charge the final image of the spiral garden. World rules (phoenix ash, glass rain) feel internally consistent in a mythic register and are learned through action, not exposition. This setting is inseparable from the story’s logic and theme; only the absence of any hard physical constraint on immediate tactics keeps it from the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and specific, with programmed pilgrimage routes, silent machinery, and “golden shadows” creating a strong atmosphere. The recurring carbide lamp lens functions as a charged micro-setting object that constrains and reweights the final image. Environmental details consistently reinforce the thematic concerns of guidance, memory, and transformation, not just decorate them. The one gap at elite level is that the physical environment rarely limits or complicates choices; it mostly mirrors and amplifies them.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, curtains of intention, and celestial mechanisms form a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Details like water “extracted from the curtains of intention” and star-tracking orreries are filtered through her craft-minded gaze and directly enable her final act. The setting meaningfully charges the ending image—the glowing curtains and constellation of paper figures reconfigure the space as a guide for future souls. A slight excess of conceptual nouns over tactile sensation is the only thing keeping this from an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skylight loft, rain, reclaimed floorboards, and camera obscura effect are richly rendered and tightly integrated with the ritual and theme. Weather matters: rain is both soundscape (coins into an empty wallet) and confidant, thunder actively modifies her measuring tactics, and the drying skylight at dawn signals the end of the session. The environment charges the final image—the loft as a secret mapping chamber beneath an unaware city—and the ink footprints as a “ghost protocol” feel organically born from the space. At times sensory richness approaches saturation, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lost civilization archive is vividly and consistently rendered, with strong, specific surreal details (“air tasted of copper tears and forgotten lullabies,” “screaming equations that begged to be human again”). The environment and key objects (the pagoda, nostalgic dust, the veil) meaningfully constrain choices and charge the final images: defensive algorithms force her pattern-avoidance, the exit-door’s rule shapes her movement, and the pagoda-as-compass closes the piece. World rules remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. A few images lean on familiar lyric shorthand, but overall the setting is distinctive, purposeful, and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming library above the clouds, orchid-shelves, and riverbank below are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s dusk-obsessed perception. Setting is not postcard: the balcony offers the choice to drop the stone, the vault physically houses memory and her final act, and the dream-market world constrains what “shareable” means. The orchids, pollen-dreams, and clouds charge the thematic question of what can be archived versus what must remain lived. Environment and recurring objects directly charge the final image of the drifting library and the absent stone.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop, mist, stars, cedar table, iron stove, ring dish, and plaque are all concretely rendered and woven into action rather than sitting as backdrop. Environmental specifics (cold room, fog-wet hair, refrigerated drawer) are filtered through Miren’s sensory and professional lens, creating a strong, oppressive atmosphere. Objects-as-setting (cage, plaque, tail tips, cedar strip) clearly charge the final image: the empty cage in the field and the plaque over the door reweight the meaning of her space. The setting doesn’t tightly constrain her options, but it deeply colors the stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory tower, courtyard soil, and “meteor hush” atmosphere are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the narrator’s perception. Setting objects (hourglass, coffee rings, seed, osage) aren’t just decorative—they structure the action and decisively charge the ending image. The world’s rules (serum, miracle displaced into soil, plant telepathy) are fantastical but internally consistent and learned through action rather than infodump. A slight risk of over-lush description in less pivotal lines is the only thing keeping this just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Orion Palace and its projection booth are richly realized and tightly integrated with action: the booth window, rusted reel, projector, balcony, and marquee rain all participate in turning points and closure. Setting is filtered through Mara’s sensibility (“dust floated like slow film frames”), and the environment directly constrains what’s possible—this story could not be lifted out of a vintage cinema without breaking. Recurring objects (film strip, screen, seats, cigarette case, marquee) charge the final images rather than functioning as postcard description. It’s just shy of a 9-band because, while beautifully textured, the environment shapes options more atmospherically than through concrete logistical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tundra, aurora-lit archway, and brass instrument are vividly particular and inseparable from the action—the cold, weight, and light all constrain what she can do and power the transformation. Details like “breath frosting the latitude scale” and the aurora “ribboning through the open skeleton of the telescope” integrate setting with character and climax. The archway and circle of dark glass explicitly charge the final image and the story’s ongoing myth. Occasionally the density of imagery risks tipping from environment into sheer ornament, but it rarely stalls or confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated: burned forest, vanished rails, glowing dune, phosphorescent poppies, and the chess clock all interlock as lived constraints and charged objects. The dune and blooms don’t just decorate; they conduct and store light, form the children, and then darken when that energy transfers, directly charging the final image. World rules (divergent archives, probability-cloud children, rails as “memory only”) remain internally consistent within the surreal logic. This is high-level environmental craft, only held shy of a perfect score by the relentless visual emphasis over other sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mechanical rainforest is richly particular—solar-panel leaves, gear-toothed parrots, mercury brook—and always filtered through her perceptual logic. Crucially, the environment constrains her fate: she can return to the metro or root herself here, and the final image of the copper banyan humming with miracles charges both her decision and the setting. Recurring environmental details (banyan 3/4 cadence, steam spelling miracles, data-loam) evolve meaningfully as she becomes part of them. Density is high but controlled; the world never collapses into a mere catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shoreline, mist, lanterns, and veiled ridgeway form a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and mythic rather than generic. Setting is tightly braided with function: the shifting ridgeway and dark waters mirror and embody the liminal work these characters do, and the ridgeway literally “untangles” at the climax. Tools and objects (lanterns, tickets, punches) are rooted in this world and recur meaningfully. A bit more tactile interaction with terrain under stress could have heightened constraint, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and spiral staircase are vividly realized and filtered through the bellhop’s sensorium (“air tasted of metal and old songs,” “meltwater constellations”). Environment and micro-setting (the staircase discoloration, the infirmary, the bolt as handled object) are not mere backdrop but carriers of lineage and constraint, culminating in the snow that will “someday bury them all.” The final images of snow erasing footprints and the imagined note from the rolling bolt are inseparable from the thematic question. World rules (silence decree, siege aftermath, nerve regeneration) feel internally consistent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient temple library is richly realized and consistently used: balustrades, gutters of folios, stone lions, and dust all matter to how the titan moves and executes his plan. The setting constrains tactics (messages in margins, pellet hidden in a codex, guards at the portico) and charges the final image of shelves bowing and dust coronets. World rules (constellation pauses, glamour, rune in ink) are internally consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition. Occasionally the atmosphere edges toward decorative lushness, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“white mantis above the lagoon,” dead reefs like “broken teeth,” the carved limestone ridge and stone pillars—and consistently filtered through Mira’s expert, grieving gaze. Environmental elements meaningfully constrain options: the isolated station enables her solitary rituals and equipment access, the underwater ruins structure her physical route, and ocean conditions (tide, thermocline, depth) shape action sequences. The final image of the station as “a gate left ajar” explicitly reweights the setting into a thematic object. Sensory detail leans visual and textural but is so purposefully selected that the absence of, say, strong smell/taste never feels like a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and specifically rendered: cracked ferrocrete, twin suns, swallows in gantries, and the transplanted stone circle all feel integrated rather than decorative. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain choices—the crane, roof hatch, ignition sigil, and the bay’s acoustics directly shape her tactics. World rules (ancient stones humming under a spaceport) remain internally consistent within a fabulist frame and are learned through action rather than exposition. The final images of the shuttle rising from this exact bay and the stones’ hum fading into cosmic background strongly charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    The volcanic hot springs and reconstruction valley are vivid and functional: temperature thresholds, mineral clouds, pumice, and grotto architecture all materially constrain tactics and make the ritual possible. Environmental details are POV-filtered and timely (stairs the volcano carved; moss, ferns, algae as collaborators) rather than touristic. The setting directly charges the final image: the embryo’s revival depends on that precise 52-degree water, and the valley’s plants later “remember” and conspire. World rules (hot springs, reconstruction, genetic priests) feel internally consistent and learned through action, not dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The arboretum on the cliff, abandoned lighthouse, and violent sea are rendered with precise, sensorial detail that is always filtered through grief (“sound like tearing paper,” waves that “detonate against basalt”). Setting is not postcard scenery: the cliff’s danger, the roots gripping stone, and the dragon’s-blood pine all constrain gesture and enable the living memorial. The environment directly charges the final image—the narrator’s new “lighthouse” is literally the mapped body and the resin-sealed tree facing the sea. Weather and terrain acoustics (wind, waves) modulate pressure and tone through the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse-library is richly and precisely realized—salt-stained ledgers, worm-gnawed atlases, warped instruments—and its physical changes (shelves leaning inward, sinking each night, cracking walls) actively pressure Elian’s choices. The setting is not backdrop: the collapsing structure, stairwell spirals, and mirror at the foundation all constrain and shape the narrative’s path and the final image. Environmental logic is internally consistent within the surreal frame, and recurring objects (tarot box, mirror, staircase, sea) charge the closure. A minor ding comes from occasional density where description verges on decorative flourish rather than additional pressure, but the space remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The wind-carved encampment, sandstone warmth, eclipse-light, and ink fractals create a vivid, specific environment that feels tactile and lived-in. Setting is not just decorative: the maze-like corridors, the ancient well, and the sandstone ground for the ink all practically enable the tracking and the portal. Recurring objects (ink, drone, encampment) charge the final image of him stepping into the ink on stone, leaving the encampment “holding the memory” of those drops. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is that the eclipse and wind are atmospheric more than constraining forces on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The snow-buried, echoing cryogenic library is vividly realized through sound, temperature, and tactility (“exhalations became falling snow that melted on live copper”). Setting meaningfully constrains options: isolation, cold, buried access, and hidden maintenance shafts make the dormant network tactic feel inevitable. Environmental details evolve (ruptured seams, snowfall inside, emergency lights as aurora) and charge the final image of the library as “cradle under snow.” It falls just shy of a 9 because the library’s physical vulnerability to the incoming crowd is more implied than concretely staged as a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the cracked glass dome, desert roses, obsidian tower, and airship wreckage all shape both mood and action. Environmental specifics directly inform her tactics—grafting hardy desert roses, working within a damaged greenhouse, planting in blood-enriched soil. The recurring objects (roses, dome, sand, scrap) strongly charge the final image of the new rose taking root at the crash site. This is rich atmospheric work that feels lived-in rather than touristic, and the environment clearly underwrites the story’s thematic concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sound wave garden and its rules (steps blooming into chords, sonic vines, vibrations channeled into a spike) are vivid, specific, and consistently exploited to shape tactics and outcome. The garden is not backdrop: its acoustic physics make Mara’s silence and the spike strategy meaningful constraints. Environmental evolution—constellations descending, stellar weight relieved, fresh constellations assembling—tracks the story’s emotional turns. The recurring object-as-setting of the rail line/spike further charges the final image, grounding the lyricism in a concrete tool.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory above the clouds, with its slit roof and clockwork projector, is not decorative: it literally allows writing on the sky and makes the “orbit” of regret concrete and alterable. Environmental details (gears like “old editors arguing deadlines,” starlight pooling on slate) are filtered through Cordelia’s press-oriented sensibility and reinforce theme. The setting constrains choices—this specific apparatus is required for the experiment—and charges the final images (sky’s new orbit, descent through clouds, presses below “like forgiving hearts”). The recurring small-object “micro-setting” of the nib and the observatory together clearly meet the 9+ gate by decisively shaping action and the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly specific and integrated: the lab, antique-furniture console, amber, holographic mobile, and letters all work as lived-in tools rather than ornament. Environmental elements directly shape action (menus, tethering, paper-chain restraint). “Meteor hush,” glass chambers, and nursery pine sawdust unify atmosphere with the emotional arc. The world’s rules are surreal but internally consistent and learned through her interaction rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering grotto, mist, plaza stones, and tile flake are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the character’s actions; setting is never mere backdrop. Environment actively shapes tactics: she can only access the emergent hush during the unlearning in this grotto, and the acoustics/stone/mist condition what she can hear and do. The later plaza scene reuses stone and public traffic to extend the grotto’s logic into the ordinary world. Sensory specificity (rain on hot brick, porcelain snow, lilac-tinted mist) is precise and filtered consistently through Mira’s artistic sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ancient plaza, shattered sky, minaret base, and cracked stepping stone are not wallpaper but tools and constraints that determine how she works and what she can build. Details like the Merciful Judge constellation fractured into “outstretched arms” elegantly echo the thematic turn without feeling forced. The environment evolves in consequence—the plaza later becoming a communal mosaic of healing charges the final image. This is very close to top-tier; a touch more sensory range beyond the visual could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—the hedge maze, mystic orchard, cracked marble stage, and sensory-laden theater details form a coherent, lived-in world. Environment and objects don’t just decorate; the maze, orchard, trees, and coin actively gate access, shape the ritual, and charge the final image of him pocketing thimble and coin. Sensory detail is varied (sound, scent, texture, even synesthetic taste) and always filtered through the ghost’s theatrical, time-haunted perception. A hair more interaction with physical constraint (e.g., spatial difficulty or risk in the maze) could deepen the sense of external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The light painting studio, the muscovite geode, and the projected patterns are concrete, vividly rendered, and consistently filtered through Mira’s technical/artistic gaze. The environment is not mere backdrop: the mirrors, projectors, and frequencies are the actual means by which she experiments and builds shields, and the studio’s evolution into a “sanctuary” charges the final image. World details about the telepathy recall are more expository than experiential but still sufficiently grounded. The piece could edge higher if physical constraints of the space or tools more directly boxed or redirected her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coastal cave network, salt-curtains, bioluminescent light, and rising oceans are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Aera’s sensory and professional lens. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it stores residual emotions, shapes her method, and literally becomes the medium for her recorded voice at the end. The elm fossil and the staff function as charged micro-settings that anchor the final image. That said, the cave mostly frames and receives the transformation rather than constraining her physical options or tactics in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    The amber warehouse, canyon, and monastery tower are richly sensory and tightly integrated with theme: amber, buttons, and sand all embody preservation vs. change. The warehouse is not just backdrop; it supplies the buttons, shapes the silence, and becomes a hearth for undone stories, directly charging the final image. Environmental details (resinous beams, fossilized honey light, iron-and-sage wind) are filtered through her task and worldview rather than touristic listing. The setting’s constraints and affordances—storage of loss, echo behavior, visible cliffs—directly govern what’s possible for her method and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zephyr Bluff, the mist, accumulated snow, and the buried listening station are vividly realized and consistently filtered through a field operative’s eye. Environment and objects actively constrain tactics: the cliff path, hidden hatch, dead keypad, and wind-turbine trickle all shape how he can act, while snow both stores the cipher and charges the final “snowdrop” image. Weather and season influence both action (melting snow threatening to erase codes) and theme (tilt toward spring, unused courage). The final images—snowdrop, silver dust, commuters at the base—are inseparable from this specific setting.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog-bound river, ticking rain gutters, invisible ferry-plank, and emergent sandbar are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with action. The environment is not decorative: the fog, river, and gutters literally create the constraint (cross now or lose the crossing) and then reconfigure into the hill that frames the ending. The setting details are sensorial, specific, and consistently filtered through the story’s mythic-lyric register. A fractional drop from a 9+ is only because the lush description sometimes prioritizes texture over the character’s bodily experience in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The oasis, kilns, hives, and scorched wasteland are not just backdrop; they dictate the ritual’s form and the stakes (reviving bees, preserving a fragile pocket of life). The apricot tree and clay hive clearly function as micro-settings/objects that constrain choices and charge the final image. Environmental logic stays consistent (smoke flattening, heat, ash, residual soot) and is threaded through action rather than static description. The world feels singular and tactile, with the setting crucial to how kindness and memory are physically enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, roof garden, and stairwell are rendered with lush, specific detail that always passes through Mara’s sensibility, preventing “tourist catalog” description. Environment actively shapes tactics: the locked iron door, the fire escape, the darkness of the stairwell, and the availability of moonlight all constrain what she can do and how. Recurring objects—the rosebush, the petal, the watering can, the lavender, the tooth—double as micro-settings that charge the final images. On the margins, the density of imagery approaches saturation, but it rarely feels unmoored from concrete space.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal library above clouds, brass sundial, salt-crystal volumes, and stone circle are vivid, coherent, and deeply integrated into action rather than postcarded. Setting repeatedly shapes choices—the sundial as perch and decision-marker, the stone circle as pressure source, and the highest shelf/blank codex as the alternative path. World rules (tidal reshelving, reincarnation memory, atomically reflective feathers) stay consistent and charge the final images (page as tiny moon, moonlight in her fissures). Environment clearly constrains and charges the final stance, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are richly realized and constantly in play: the petal bridge, oculus, breathing stone, and tilting pond all shape the ritual and her movement. Environmental details aren’t postcard; they constrain and charge choices (crossing the chime-bridge, kneeling in the light, the doves’ escape path, the temple closing behind her). The final images—the pond copper at dusk, temple sealing, bench on the bank, and distant thrush—reprice the whole experience through setting. Description is dense but purposeful, fully integrated with action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—from “cinder-block building that smelled of burnt solder and decades of vinyl dust” to sodium lights “the color of dried blood”—and always filtered through Lyra’s professional and emotional lens. Environment materially constrains action: the antique tower, generator, ionospheric skip, moon position, and photocell all shape what’s possible and when. The station and town reappear at closure (her palm on the transmitter; bone-colored dawn over the quad) to charge the final image with a sense of fragile, place-bound reprieve. Density is high but purposeful; there’s almost no white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the “shadowed nexus under starlight” with cracked glass, converging rails, and tunnels directly shapes the method of accessing the key (the pivot circle, the bowing rails, the descending shaft). Environmental details evolve with events—the glass roof displaying a keyhole of stars, then a missing pane mirroring the compass circle, and the lavender-grown rails in the mirror vision. The world’s rules (spatial mutiny, echo-organ, mirrors) stay consistent within its magical logic and are always filtered through Arin’s perception and fear. The environment also charges the final image in a way that would be weakened by any substitute setting.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quarry and mist are vivid, textured, and filtered through Juniper’s guilt and method: the “quarry’s jagged throat,” the mist soaking the page, the cliffs that “lean closer to watch.” Setting is not postcard; it shapes mood and meaning, especially in the final image of the quarry “exhal[ing]” and its shadows rearranging like shoulders relaxing, which charges the sense of long-held tension released. Objects-as-setting (lamp, ribbon, easel, shale) are tactically used, not just described. The only limit is that the physical danger of the quarry doesn’t materially constrain her tactics; it’s more atmospheric than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    The weather station, perpetual rain, jet stream anomaly, and corrosion/verdigris palette are richly specific and consistently filtered through Mara’s map- and archive-centric sensibility. Environment and tools constrain options (the wreck in a restricted test zone, the holotable overlay, the dirigible launch window at dawn), and weather is not just backdrop but pressure and motif. The recurring copper patina and mildew textures culminate in the final image of refracted coordinates across purposeful rain, charging the setting with thematic weight. It feels like a single, coherent, lived-in world whose rules and textures matter to the story’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain pullout, guardrail, gorge, and scaffold-wrap environment are richly particular and tightly bound to action: wind and tarps generate both music and divination, and the guardrail’s shadow literally becomes the doorway. The recurring objects (violin, case, glass flake, tarps) strongly charge the final image. Setting is always filtered through her musician/bridge-builder sensibility rather than reading like neutral description. A touch fewer metaphors per paragraph would sharpen rather than dilute the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid, specific, and tonally apt—trumpet vines on brass railings, peeling posters like “dying fireworks,” and the lion-car all feel lived-in rather than decorative. The setting isn’t just backdrop; it frames Jonah’s ritual space, carries the performance motif, and charges the final image of the train “satisfied that another performance had ended.” The environment lightly constrains action (the lion-car as the locus of fire and ritual, opposite ends to depart from) and strongly shapes mood. A slight limitation is that the train’s physical constraints don’t significantly alter tactical options beyond symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly and economically used: the copper-domed observatory, the great refractor, SS Lacertae, and the desert temple all intertwine, with the dome transforming into desert sky without losing spatial clarity. The environment and tools (telescope, star-diaries, dome) aren’t just backdrop; they enable the witnessing, channel the daylily’s light-drinking, and are themselves healed, charging the final image of the observatory as a site of transformed grief. The micro-setting of the daylily-pressed telegram functions as a recurring object that shapes choices and the last beat. Weather/time (midnight, pre-dawn) reinforce the tone without slipping into cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cursed lake and swirling orchard vortex are vivid, specific, and constantly in play: the floating roots dictate how she moves, the mirrored water enforces where the confession must land, and the vortex’s direction shift embodies the narrative’s before/after. Details like “leafless apple trees…like old siege towers” and “apples frozen mid-rot” are not decorative; they deepen both mood and stakes. The environment literally constrains her tactics and charges the final image of being carried outward on reversed circles.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cobalt glade, mirrored grass, breathing maze, and skeletal fireflies are all specific, sensorial, and filtered through the narrator’s visionary bias; they define the story’s reality rather than sitting as backdrop. Environment and recurring objects directly constrain choice (the glade calling through scars, the maze as literal path to the choice, the cobalt leaf on the cracked sidewalk embodying balance at the climax). World rules—organic/technological hybridity, scar-linked communication, city vs soil covenant—are taught through action rather than exposition dumps and remain consistent. The final images of sidewalks cracking for glades and hedge-scars on dreamers pay off the setting motifs with conceptual and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, tactile, and conceptually coherent, with roots through bones and skull-crowned trees both atmospheric and functional. Setting constrains choice (this is the only “market,” candles drowning in wax push them out, the ledger in roots and bone makes cost inescapable) and charges the final image. Objects-as-setting (tarot card, apples, skulls) evolve meaningfully, culminating in the star-shaped sprout humming with the lost memory. A tiny potential to go even further would be to let physical constraints (tight passages, unstable ground) interact once more directly with a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quarry office trailer and surrounding valley are concrete, sensorially vivid, and strongly filtered through Mason’s audio-centric perception. Environmental features (the PA system, the bowl of the quarry, the starlit water) directly constrain and enable the key act of broadcasting his voice and receiving the echo. The final image of his words rolling over the quarry and reflecting in the water is charged by all the prior scene-setting. Setting is integrated with theme without tipping into heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic arbor, iron leaves, and mirrored sky are vividly rendered and integral: the setting isn’t backdrop but the mechanism by which language, spirit, and physics of transition manifest. Environmental features directly constrain and enable action—the magnetic joints receive the seed, the leaves provide the “Morse” sentence, the hourglass sky frames the symmetry insight, and the new plank is the literalized closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“iron filings that stuck like frost,” “clouds vibrating into concentric circles”), and world rules feel internally consistent. The environment’s pressure and strangeness charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integral: the tidal atrium, moon-pulled water, brass-and-bamboo machinery, and bleeding-ink books are all used as tools and constraints rather than backdrop. Environment constantly shapes action—the tide lapping the steps, the moon altering the net, the atrium becoming physically and magically rooted to the seabed. The final images (water holding “a sky that had forgotten to end,” fish made from ink, the creel glimmering) clearly reweight earlier details, charging the closure. A slight risk is density: there is a near-constant stream of rich description, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystal caves are richly sensory and fully integrated with character and theme: “tasted of salt and iron,” “mineral tears,” and the humming throat image all do double duty as worldbuilding and emotional mirror. Environment is not backdrop but actor—the cave responds to the pearl, bears confessions, and ultimately incorporates Mara, directly charging the final image. Spatial progression (entrance, nautilus corridor, chamber) is clear and purposeful. The only arguable restraint on an even higher score is the near-constant lyric elevation, which slightly blurs moment-to-moment physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly evoked—the ivy-choked, decaying station and the wet, coal-dust-smelling undercroft feel tactile and psychologically attuned to her inner state. Environmental details (the lavatory, graffiti, loose plank, iron stairs, rusted spur, underground stream) don’t just decorate; they literally channel her path and constrain choices. The recurring objects-as-setting (accordion, map, ivy, rail) directly charge the final images of departure and subterranean persistence. A slight check on perfection is that the atmospheric density is uniformly high, occasionally risking over-texturing in quieter beats.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glowing library in mist is vivid, coherent, and filtered through the character’s constraints (paper dissolves, only thought survives; shelves phase in and out; gravity will invert). Environmental rules shape tactics—she builds a memory palace instead of writing, navigates temporal shelves, and is pulled toward the heart by the weight of the watch. The final image of the library rearranging into her open mouth, new books bound in veil-silk and watch-gold, shows the setting actively charging closure. A touch more non-visual sensory work (sound, texture, bodily disorientation) under peak pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory and its velvet, bruised-purple dome are not just décor; they structure the action (central dais, cracking dome, real starlight entering) and inflect the tone of trespass and sacrilege. Time and environment—midsummer hinge, slipping moon, the indoor stars—are tightly bound to the magic’s rules and the decision window. Objects as micro-setting (ice violin, coffee saucer, cereus) constrain choices and heavily charge the final images. A touch less ornamental lushness in early sentences might sharpen how quickly the setting’s rules emerge, but its integration with stakes and closure is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, mirror pool, and ice orchids are vividly specific and integral: this is not a white room but a functioning liminal environment. The grotto-as-threshold and the pool as medium directly constrain options and enable the final transformation; she cannot make this trade anywhere else. Environmental details (aurora condensation feeding the pool, starlit stalactites) recur and evolve, charging the final constellation/lantern imagery. The slight risk of sensory overload is mitigated by strong POV-filtering through her professional and grief-obsessed eye.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    The world is vividly and economically realized: moon-ash tree, umbral grotto, cloudwater basin, bioluminescent ivy, and vineyards all feel specific and sensorial (tannin, grape-cooled air, hush). Setting consistently pressures choice: the climb, the cliff where the pin must be driven, the above-the-weather isolation, and the final return down into the valley wound. The recurring vineyard imagery (juice, wine, tannin, soil) concretely mirrors the transformation of sorrow into sustenance. The umbral grotto and valley are inseparable from the story’s stakes and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, sea breeze, dawn light, and wind chimes are richly specific and filtered through Mira’s sensibility, avoiding generic atmospheric filler. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it shapes the method (wind chimes as cipher), the metaphors (certainty as a coat in the wind), and the closing image (loose sail, beam in dust motes). The hollow mirror shard and lighthouse beam both charge the final image with a strong sense of place and moral exposure. One could argue the physical setting constrains options only softly, but thematically it’s tightly woven into every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the sycamore canopy, floating rock, magnetic grotto, and starlight all create a distinct, atmospheric locus that’s more than postcard. The magnetism hums in her blood and deepens at the climax, and the platform/grotto system is tied to temporal anomalies, so environment and world rules are meaningfully fused. The stone and pond operate as a micro-setting charged into the final image. This feels specific and necessary rather than generic SF dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon, bone towers, layered dust, and flock of birds are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Cael’s ritualistic attention. Setting is not just backdrop: the towers resonate with his song, the echoes define the stakes, and the final image depends on this environment’s properties. The “centuries of layered dust” and hum of the bone towers subtly embody his people’s history and the waiting of the canyon for someone like him. The only modest limit is that the environment constrains choices more symbolically than through hard logistics.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, algorithmic auroras, barcoded snow, and transparent garden folly are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elian’s sensibility. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables action: the mist stair versus the spire’s attempt to “seal the air into glass,” the altitude that strands him, drones that can’t see him without quantified light. Details like lilac-and-printer-toner scent unify the magical and automated registers, reinforcing atmosphere and theme. The setting remains dynamic rather than postcard-like, evolving with each choice and charging the final image of a “garden folly of warmth adrift above the clouds.”

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific, from the “meteor hush” harbor to the drowned library of the *Mercy’s Log* with air pockets and bolted shelves. Environmental constraints (breathing air pockets, moving carefully so as not to collapse the archive) shape Jin’s actions. Recurring objects—the lamps, lanterns, plankton, and ship—charge the final image of singing, multicolored pier lights. This is rich, immersive atmosphere with purposeful detail, though not quite transcendent enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “ambered observatory deck” with fossilized starlight, brass rail, and molten-gold panes is vivid and specific, and it functions as more than backdrop. The lack of a sky/telescope directly forces Lira into her listening-based method, and the amber panels actively respond to and then encapsulate her, charging the final chrysalis image. Environmental details recur and evolve with the ritual rather than sitting static. At times the density of description verges on ornamental, but the setting consistently constrains and colors choices.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory and its tools (shattered lenses, dome, roof seams, wax cylinders, atlas platform) are deeply integrated into both mood and mechanism. Setting details are never postcard; the place actively generates and channels the magic (“Through scattered light the observatory woke,” the roof splitting to pour in copper dusk, the dome as projection surface). The final image of him stepping into the “ragged sky” from the ruined observatory is charged by everything we’ve learned about this environment. World rules are consistent enough to feel intuitive within this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, dry seabed, and rusting bell form a vivid, specific physical frame that recurs and meaningfully evolves (white dry bed → ankle-deep water → full ocean and whales). Setting is not postcard-like; dawn light striking the bell and the viaduct arches humming directly affect action and ritual. The final image—Kael’s bones under the viaduct, the epitaph drip, and the ocean “listening”—is deeply charged by this environment, which now encodes the world’s new rules. World physics (oceans vanished overnight, rust-into-fish) are consistently handled as plausible within the story’s magic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically fused to the story: the drained reservoir, the slime-slick descent, the Sapphire Swan’s drowned art deco, and the moss-and-pine night air all feel lived and tactile. The resurfacing town meaningfully constrains action (necessitating patrols, revealing ruins piecemeal) and charges the final image of Hallows Wake “breathing above water” as a living text. The recurring micro-settings—the ridgeway, the lounge, the levee office—frame the emotional journey without white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly specific and fully integrated: the kaleidoscopic waterfall, mica-rooted trees, and hidden orchard all shape the action and symbolism rather than serving as mere backdrop. Environmental elements constrain and enable choices (passing through the waterfall, following spiraled trees and roots, working with mica and quince as anchors). The orchard and waterfall also charge the final image—the quince setting a single fruit, the memory of the crystal carried out into the “cracked plaza.” World rules are consistently fantastical, learned through her interaction with place rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “nocturnal arbor above the clouds” and skybound network create a distinctive, tactile micro-world filtered through her professional gaze. Environmental details (height, branches, canopy, clouds, glider altitude) consistently shape her tactics and options. The parachute buckle functions almost as a micro-setting, constraining choices and charging the final image. A hair shy of 9+ only because the physical choreography of moving from tree to “glider’s level” remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock dojo, rewritten Pacific, and history-rewrite ambiance are vivid, distinctive, and thematically apt, and the dojo’s dissolution at the end nicely charges the closure image. Setting is integrated rather than postcard: the sky monastery, the crèche, and the jar as a ritual object all feel lived-in within this surreal logic. However, the physical environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way beyond the abstract rewriting and ritual rules; the dojo could almost be swapped for another mystical site without altering most beat-level choices. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but not yet at the “environment as inescapable pressure” level.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mill, glass-floored chamber, storm, and brook are intensely specific and integrated: the only untouched soil patch under glass constrains where the seed can be planted, and the brook’s reversed flow becomes the key mechanic for solving the first riddle. Environmental changes (timbers shifting, doors realigning, walls breathing) both mirror and enact the story’s central transformation, so setting is inseparable from plot. World rules stay internally consistent within the surreal logic, and the final image of the backward-flowing brook as “quiet ally” elegantly charges the closing tone. Description is lush but functional, with setting actively shaping choices and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated: the tunnel as “concrete throat” that echoes and reshapes sound is both atmospheric and functionally indispensable to how Quinn’s laughter is “restored.” The hourglass and blower function as micro-settings/objects that constrain behavior and charge the final image (blower set beside the empty hourglass, cord like a pendulum). Environmental details consistently mirror and pressure the internal state without feeling like rote symbolism. Spatial and sensory choreography (echoes, porch lights, dog bark, concrete vibration) is clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen garden in mist is exquisitely rendered and omnipresent, with details like rosemary “brittle as old parchment,” suspended breath/commas, and ice-filled pawprints doing double duty as worldbuilding and metaphor. Environment concretely constrains action (frozen match, suspended exhale, rearranging labyrinth, icy threshold) and charges the final image of her return to “shelves of frost and silence.” The boundary, garden layout, and weather are not mere backdrop but the actual arena in which her nightly negotiation occurs. This density and functional integration elevate the atmosphere to world-defining rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and fully integrated: the ember nexus, glassy fissures, twilight, and molten/icy textures all constrain the ritual and charge the final sealing image. Objects-as-setting (crozier, goggles, fissures) clearly shape choices and closure; the nexus literally absorbs the ground lenses and closes. Sensory detail is dense but purposeful, with smell (“myrrh and ozone”), texture (frost, glass, ash), and light working in concert. At times the imagery verges on ornate, but it rarely feels like postcard description; it is structurally enmeshed with the magic system and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the rusted catwalks, cantilevered towers over a gorge, and low-slung moon all shape tone and charge the final image of the city balanced between “moon-pull and earth-anchor.” Objects and environment (tower city, transmitter room, gorge, perigee) meaningfully inflect what’s possible and what the silence means. Details are filtered through her technician-mystic sensibility rather than reading like a neutral tour. A hair’s breadth of restraint—fewer ornate metaphors—might sharpen rather than further decorate an already rich atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and integral: the spectral grotto, phosphorescent barnacles, and sideways clocks create a distinctive physical and metaphysical stage. Environment directly constrains action (grotto closing, special tide window, barnacles as navigational code) rather than serving as mere backdrop. Details are economical yet vivid (“moon dripped like melting silver,” “starlight thinned to a wire”) and consistently filtered through Arden’s ferry-worker sensibility. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the ferry’s mundane commuter life is implied more than grounded in concrete, workaday specifics before the surrealism takes over.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly and consistently rendered—Möbius corridors, predatory paintings, breathing walls—and the impossible geometry interacts directly with her thread, mapping, and the neural-network reveal. Setting is not just backdrop: the gallery’s living architecture becomes the externalization of collective consciousness and charges the final image of walls “breathing with the rhythm of human hearts.” The sensory palette leans visual and conceptual but is purposeful (“tasted like nostalgia,” “smelled like the moment before awakening”) and in character. The environment shapes meaning more than tactical choice, but it is integral to the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The benthic city is vivid and specific—coral-wrapped towers, bioluminescent plankton, abyssal alien craft, cracked lighthouse—and all of this is filtered through the instructor’s professional gaze. Environment constrains options (sealed surface, underwater light distortion) and thematically mirrors the story’s exile and wariness. The recurring tool/object-as-setting (the chain link) concretely charges the final image through its physical absence. World rules (folded starlight, sonic murals) stay coherent and are implied through action rather than dumpy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is richly particular and always in play: mist, atrium, koi pond, rust, and orchids are not mere backdrop but shape movement (service corridor, broken scanner, pond as threat) and tone. The recurring mist and atrium imagery culminate in the final sunrise “final exposure,” directly charging the last image and tying to the photographic motif. Environmental details are filtered through Mira’s professional and moral lens (vines mimicking heart valves, condensation “recording” heartbeats), giving the world a distinct lived logic. Spatial choreography remains clear even in the climax with Hask by the pond and sirens approaching.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid, tactile, and constantly in play: rusted bulkhead, narrowing corridor, “throat of stone,” basalt, brine-thickened air, and tide-timed facility all constrain what Mara can do and heighten her phobia. The undersea infrastructure and trench-bound signal are learned through action and discovery rather than exposition, and the environment literally folds and reknits via phase transitions. The final images (moonlit deck, peak tide, facility dimming “content to sink again”) are charged by everything we’ve seen of the place as both tomb and conduit. The consistency of world rules—especially around the cables and gold illuminant—is a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The opal observatory under snow, the frosted dome, and the library annex are richly specific and filtered through the narrator’s eerie half-mechanical awareness. Setting and weather are more than postcard—they shape tone (isolation, liminality) and small choices (snow erasing footprints, dome hatch, spiral stairs), and recur in the charged final image of the observatory glinting behind him. Some details are primarily atmospheric rather than constraining tactics, but they’re so thematically consonant they feel earned, not decorative. The observatory and snow world subtly mirror the piece’s limbo between life and death.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The canyon, bone towers, and tunnel of echoes are extraordinarily vivid and sensorially rich, with strong non-visual textures (mud, clay, reeds, bone resonance) woven through action. Setting isn’t backdrop: the bone flutes, echo tunnel, and canyon acoustics directly enable and constrain the protagonist’s method and shape the final image of a speaking landscape. World rules (how echoes and bones function) feel internally consistent in a mythic register. The environment decisively charges the ending, where future travelers access language through walls and statue.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underground herbalist garden, catacombs, glass ceiling, frost, and rooftop cityscape are richly realized and tightly integrated with action (vines as staircase, mandrakes singing, garden blooming through pavement). Setting is filtered through Mara’s sensibility and the scientific/occult blend, avoiding white-room syndrome and building a sustained, eerie atmosphere. Environmental features constrain and enable choices (she ignores the herbalist’s warning to flee; the live vines physically provide ascent). Recurring physical motifs (frost, spirals, plants, glass) charge the final images and reinforce theme.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The enchanted orchard, sky-bridge, and gear-limbed statues are vividly specific and deeply integrated into action—the bridge’s sway, the patrols, and the glass plank’s parting all constrain what Calla can do. World rules (music and heartbeat as code for living machines, gravity-reversing blossoms) stay consistent enough to feel like a coherent system. The setting charges the final images: statues rooting into trees, the bridge dissolving into dawn, and the orchard blooming outward against the iron cities. Description occasionally skirts density but remains purposeful and anchored in Calla’s task-focused perception.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt arcade, neon, cabinets, tunnel, and rusted mailbox are all specific, sensorial, and consistently filtered through Riven’s perception, giving the world a tactile, lived-in strangeness. Setting actively constrains and enables action: the arcade hides him from the drone, the “Promise Keeper” cabinet is a portal, the maintenance door and tunnel offer a route the drone cannot follow, and the mailbox at the fence is the literal hinge of the story. Environmental changes (arcade dimming to indigo, bottle light regrowing, rain short-circuiting drones) evolve causally with events and charge the final images. The world’s rules (letters as contraband, drones patrolling, promises classified) are learned through action rather than exposition, supporting both tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned circus train is rendered with rich, selective detail—rusted ribs, torn velvet, warped mirror corridor, overturned car with a sky-pool—and every major turn is anchored to a physical space. Environment consistently constrains and channels action: the wrong turn through the mirror car, the need to step onto the water, the horses responding from elsewhere, the rails at the end shimmering with notes. The final images (train glowing like a halo, musical tracks stretching toward towns) are inseparable from this setting and reweight everything behind them. Description is lush but purposeful, filtering through the carpenter’s craft-and-silence preoccupations rather than reading like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scientific poetry library and its hyperbolic geometry are richly and specifically rendered—“books curved away from her like the inside of a seashell,” negative curvature between shelves, quantum lullabies, stellar sonnets. Setting and object (the scarf) are not just backdrop; the geometry literally shapes how stories exist and how she navigates them, and it charges the final image of a library humming with fresh narratives. Spatial logic and ambiance remain consistent and legible. The environment actively encodes the story’s rules about narrative space, which is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering archipelago, coral shelves, causeway, sand-ridge “book,” and movable horizon are not mere decorations—they actively frame what is possible and necessary. The environment dictates the sunrise-photography tactic, the risk of trading a memory, and the final housing of the image in the coral shelves. Sensory specificity is rich but purposeful (tide tongues, basalt runes, compressed starlight) and always filtered through Mireya’s task. The closing image of the altered library and paper boat mobile is charged by all the prior environmental rules, so setting directly powers the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nexus, ruined arcade, starfield, and spiral corridor of starlight are vivid and specific, and they consistently mirror and pressure the internal journey. Setting elements actively constrain choices: seven gates mirror the seven knots/years; Vega’s position dictates which gate; the ear-shaped keyhole requires a confession rather than a metal key; the mirror of night air is the only place the idea can be confronted. The recurring use of Vega and the nexus at the end charges the final image without feeling like mere backdrop. This is rich, purposeful worldbuilding at an elite-venue level, just shy of utterly transformative innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks, upside-down peach trees, and salt-crystal leaves is vivid, specific, and filtered through Mara’s folklorist gaze. Setting is not postcard-static: ship ribs, fairy rings, and the sextant all shape what she can discover and do, and the environment literally responds (planks shifting, constellations reforming) to her climactic act. Sensory detail (taste of “cider and rust,” accordion sighs) is purposeful and thematically charged rather than ornamental. The world’s rules are consistently strange-but-legible, with no jarring breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    The forgotten library is vividly realized and never static: warped doorway, captive three o’clock, ghost-swing, breathing shelves, and the final exhalation all feel tactile and thematically keyed to memory and resilience. Setting constantly interacts with action—the shadow is handled, the cup is oriented to light, the shelves respond physically to Lira’s ritual, and the library’s state is the core external stake. Recurring objects (shadow, teacup, shards) charge the final image where the afternoon is freed and the leaves form an unbroken circle. Environment is not mere backdrop; it constrains options and underwrites the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the verdant parapet, waterfall-veil, and mist’s reach are not mere backdrop but functional constraints enabling color to “bleed between worlds” and making the loom’s placement matter. Environmental details (city across the gorge, bridge, parapet) evolve into structural components that govern who can be touched by wonder and how. The world’s rules—color as essence, veil as threshold—are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. At the end, the rooted-yet-dreaming sapling on the parapet powerfully charges the final image, tying environment to theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism sanctuary, crystalline walls, and starlight refracted as “war paint” offer vivid, specific anchoring that’s strongly filtered through Elian’s perception. Setting details are not postcard-like; the sanctuary’s masks, the net, and the changing light all interact with the ritual and mood, culminating in starlight fading to dawn as a charged temporal and emotional shift. The environment meaningfully charges the final images (masks beginning to sing; light through brokenness) without feeling overexplained. A slight abundance of visual over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rain-scoured vault, henge, fresco layers, and the disciplined beam of stormlight create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is inseparable from the story’s meaning. Environmental specifics repeatedly constrain and charge choices: the rain threatens the work, ruins the projectors, keeps the chapel veiled, and functions as the centuries-long “keeper” of the vault’s secret. The peeling fresco revealing prior “maps” of faith and the map tear aligning with the henge shadow tightly bind setting to theme. This richness stops just shy of over-elaboration and remains under control.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken ship library is vivid, specific, and integral: pressure, saltwater, decaying books, and depth all shape what’s possible and charge images like the hollowed atlas and dissolving notebook. The setting is not mere backdrop; dissolution and unreadness mirror her struggle with unprocessed history and make the act of leaving her notes to rot thematically loaded. The recurring lectern, shelves, and gauges also provide a clear spatial grammar while supporting mood. A slight restraint in descriptive density in one or two sentences could increase sharpness, but environment already meaningfully constrains and charges choices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, threaded with marble balustrades, stormlight, and ozone, is vivid and integral rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes the premise: being “between lightning and thunder” and above the city underwrites the temporal and emotional liminality that the story is about. Tools and objects (the copper bolt plate, balustrades as graffiti canvas, cloud ladders) are spatially clear and recur to charge the final images. Weather and altitude aren’t just backdrop; they define what’s possible and what’s at stake thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire, brass elevator, frost, observatory, and hothouse are vividly drawn and consistently refracted through Lira’s perceptions (laundry vs longing; ash as “bulb in her chest”), with a strong sensory palette beyond the purely visual. Environment constrains and shapes choice: the vertical architecture and frozen world make the hidden warm hothouse and apricot tree feel earned, and the goggles materially alter what can be perceived/decoded. The setting’s rules (cold above, heat below, maintenance shafts) stay coherent and pay off thematically at the end as she literally chooses “roots and branches alike.” The recurring objects (goggles, diary, seed, elevator) charge the final image rather than functioning as static decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and specific—the sky gondola, single remaining cable, zero-g dust “like miniature galaxies,” and city lights as “match heads” all feel lived-in and tonally unified. Environmental constraints (altitude, cable fray, confined wicker gondola) meaningfully shape options and tension. The brass telescope and filament function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image of the falling “star.” A minor limitation is that the physical mechanics of the gondola’s support and movement are more poetic than technical, which may slightly undercut realism expectations at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tree-trunk library and its living shelves, roots, and knotholes are vividly realized and consistently filtered through her artist’s gaze. Environment constrains choices: the curved inner wall dictates how she paints the sky; roots vibrate with demolition, shaking her candle and tempo; the book-safe geometry matters to the coin’s hiding place. Setting actively charges the final image—the idea that the tree may outlast the building and hold her sky as a secret archive. Detail density is high but remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The antique airship, cloud-sea, cargo deck grates, engine galley, and starlings are vivid, specific, and always doing work rather than serving as wallpaper. Setting details constrain and enable action: the dimming running-lamps create the crisis; the cargo deck hopscotch grid becomes the decoding site; the engine galley’s light-feed makes stories a literal fuel. World rules (light-feed, hydrogen cells, cloud-sea) remain coherent and are revealed through use, not exposition dumps. The final after-image of dawn over the cloud-sea and relit Aurelia elegantly fuses environment with emotional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen library above the clouds, the hall of mirrors, and the mentor’s workshop are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action: ice floors affect his movement, mirrors enable the key’s repair, the workshop’s clocks literally teach him a new cadence. Environmental details are consistently filtered through his locksmith’s sensibility (keyholes, gears, clocks) rather than as neutral spectacle. The final image—windows open to a cloud-sea sunrise, overlapping ticks syncing with his pulse—charges the ending with both spatial and emotional reconfiguration. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in a few spots keeps this just shy of a 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly imagined and integrated: sideways apple trees on floating arches, anti-grav seeds dying, the nebula’s emotional influence, and ladders and “arch wind” all materially shape what can and must be done. Environmental constraints (tilting arches, heights, needing chains of people) directly govern tactics in the harvest sequence. Recurring micro-settings—the sidewalk, the butterfly garden, the bell—charge the final images with accumulated meaning. This is near exemplary; a hair more emphasis on physical risk in the high-above-clouds work could push it into truly breathtaking territory.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lighthouse, pane, stairs, sea, and dusk are not decorative; they constrain and charge choices (isolated summit, spiral descent, sea as unseen audience, first star after reprieve). Recurring objects—the pane, puppet head, and staircase—anchor both the metaphysics and the emotional arc, culminating in the final images of the puppet’s descent and the star. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her task and history. The setting’s physical and metaphysical aspects stay internally consistent while carrying the thematic load.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, frost, and orchard are vividly rendered and consistently govern what Mara can and cannot do. Environment and objects (stones that trigger birds, the cliff edge, frost, the orchard’s pull) directly constrain choices and shape tactics. Sensory detail (frost-brittle grass, sap with faces, birds’ brass wings) is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The final image—handprints sealed in frost, birds folding wings, orchard stirring—charges the setting with lasting emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The braided ravine is vivid, sensorial, and thematically charged, from the sun-warmed boulder and divided streams to the later islands bearing the sculptures. Setting is not backdrop but a governing metaphor and constraint: its braids teach the polymer architecture and dictate where the installations are placed. The lab is sketched economically yet precisely enough to ground the resin work and the 440 Hz detail. A marginal limitation is that the environment rarely exerts concrete physical pressure on Mara’s choices beyond symbolism; the pressure is primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are richly imagined and tightly integrated: crystal fruit, obsidian floor, clouds writing dedications—all recur and matter to how events unfold. Setting isn’t postcard; it constrains and charges choices (the building literally tilts as memories shift; the library as “seed crystal” is inseparable from the plot and theme). Environmental details evolve causally (moonlight refracting through fruit to project prologues), and the final imagined “shore of white space” is a meaningful spatial endpoint. This is near top-band work; only a slight overabundance of images in the middle edges toward ornamental at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, sensorial, and integral: glassed sand, weeping parapets, and the icebound coral pavilion all shape meaning rather than functioning as backdrop. Environmental details are consistently filtered through her gustatory/memory bias, which deepens both world and character. The subterranean pavilion and fortress above directly constrain what can happen and charge the final images (melting remorse into groundwater; “sturdy brittle song”). The only restraint is that physical constraints don’t meaningfully alter tactical options beyond the descent itself, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astronomical clock tower, the distant grain elevator, and the starlit fields are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with action; tools like the speaking tube and the cuckoo weight materially shape what Mireya can do. Environmental specifics (star map murals, brass planetary rings, copper arteries) are not postcard garnish—they define the story’s magic system and its constraints. Setting directly charges the final image: the tower/elevator duet and wheat prisms make landscape itself a participant in the resolution. This is near top-tier atmospheric integration with no orientation issues.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit canyon is vivid, specific, and integrated with the action—its quartz veins hold the dreams, its depth answers her gesture with rising shards, and the rail and old ore carts hint at history. The moon’s movement and angle of light directly constrain what’s possible, turning the environment into an active pressure rather than backdrop. The helmet, periscope glass, and quartz all function as micro-setting objects that shape risk and choice. The final image of the canyon “sleeping” yet newly cracked reinforces setting as a living archive that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto, inversion physics, ultraviolet quartz, and upward-falling droplets are vivid and tightly woven into action, not just description. Setting directly constrains tactics (indigo band sliding, threshold patches where pebbles arc back, timing her run as gravity jitters). The environment’s rules stay consistent and clearly learned through Ilyra’s practiced navigation. The final sealing of the serpentine grotto meaningfully charges the closure image, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The siskin alder grove, fallen statue, and telegraph remnants are rendered with precise, multi-sensory specificity that’s always filtered through Ilay’s sonic/artistic priorities. Environment and object-as-setting (insulators, cracks, roots) directly constrain and enable her tactics: she literally reads the sculpture’s weather-cracks as a score and uses grove-grown alder and reclaimed wire as instruments. The setting evolves with events—the moss brightens, sap rises, cracks widen—so atmosphere isn’t static décor but active participant. The final image of grove, statue, insulator, and hedgehog all faintly transformed is deeply charged by the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magnetic nexus at twilight, electromagnetic hum, purple sky, and basalt stone all create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong specificity. Details are filtered through his chess-tutor lens (“invisible geometries,” “crystalline beauty,” “larger boards”), which roots worldbuilding in character. The setting meaningfully charges the experience—it’s a liminal, rule-bending place that justifies his heightened realization and frames the story’s metaphysics. It could constrain concrete choices more directly, but as a micro-setting for a conceptual reconfiguration, it is richly realized and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The workshop under stars, the gunpowder-for-fireworks, and the skylight-pressed constellations are vivid and tightly integrated with the theme of weaponized vs. celebratory noise. Setting details (broken music boxes, crystal radio, sawdust/gunpowder) are not decorative; they shape how she accesses different silences and frame the final contrast between outside explosions and interior muteness. The environment directly charges the last image—silent fireworks through the workshop and the open doors as a “lighthouse.” A slight risk of sensory overload in places is the only limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    The treetop village, rope bridges, highest boughs, and reversing tide are not just decorative; they dictate what is possible (needing a calm-yet-moving graft site, climbing into thinner, twig-like paths) and charge the final images of descent and tide. Sensory detail, especially olfactory, is rich and POV-filtered (“wildflower scent,” “almond gum,” “sweet death”), with the environment mirroring the thematic question of motion vs stillness. World rules (wind-spirits trading wisdom for fragrance, ceremonial graft sites) remain consistent and are learned via action. The village setting and objects (seed, paper, silk) are so tightly woven into the ritual that the story would collapse without them.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, inverted rivers, and humming leaves are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Aera’s pilot/grower sensibility. Setting is not decorative: gravity inversion, water flows, and the arch hollow all physically constrain and enable her tactics. The Silent Core’s atmosphere (“whirling silence,” echo pulses) directly shapes the tone and final image of the orchards answering in blossom. This is immersive and purposeful worldbuilding, just shy of transcendent only because it occasionally leans more into beauty than into concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    The port and container labyrinth are rendered with tactile specificity—the “canyons of steel,” fused glass circle, shifting stacks—and always through Mara’s professionalized gaze. Crucially, the environment constrains and then enables choices: wind channels dictate her path, the labyrinth focuses vectors to the plaza, then physically realigns into a spiral that guides her outward and will later guide responders. The recurring glass/metal/wind imagery culminates in the final vision of fractures forecasting future failures. Setting is not backdrop but the active medium of the story’s premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, Echoless Vein, auroras, and sculpted hush are richly specific and constantly active: they guide his movement, dictate tactics (walking through aurora, using synesthetic perception), and shape the climax (bells refracting through carved silence). Environmental logic stays consistent within its fantastical rules, and the setting meaningfully charges the final image of emerging at dawn as the auroras are released. A slight excess of decorative description in places edges toward atmosphere for its own sake, which is the main check on scoring even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, driftwood, and violet seam are vivid and tightly integrated: the silence dictates tactics (markers, listening through the flute), and the range feels like an active interlocutor. The setting rules (quiet, ash-wind, Barren) remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. The final image of the flute vanishing into the quiet and the scattered driftwood retrofits the environment as the true “keeper,” directly charging the ending. Details feel specific and lived-in rather than postcard-fantastical.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    The topaz workshop, cliffside dome, breathing press, and star-subtracted sky are vividly and economically rendered, always filtered through Quince’s technical and quasi-mathematical sensibility. Setting and tools aren’t backdrop: the letterpress’s reversibility and the halo fragment’s physical behavior directly constrain his available tactics and define the resolution image (reversing the press, carrying the cracked fragment away). Environmental details evolve with the action—the dome shimmering as stars vanish, then stitching new constellations—as an extension of the story’s stakes. The final image of him leaving the locked dome with the broken halo in his pocket is both spatially clear and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and mountain villages are vivid and consistently threaded, with the sky’s “liquid” quality and the ridge as a “seam” strongly supporting the myth/reality boundary. Setting is filtered through Elias’s sensibility and the relic-work, which keeps it from feeling like postcard description. The aurora and ridgeway clearly charge the final image and conceptual frame, even if they don’t impose tight physical constraints on choice. World rules (fade, relics, sympathetic vibration) are implied through action with no confusing breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quartz arbor in mist, frost on the car window, and the mineral “breath” create a vivid, coherent environment that shapes the ritual’s mechanics (sound-dampening hush, freezing mist, singing trees). The setting is not postcard-only—it constrains time (temperature drop, frost growth) and participates in the climax (mist mirrors, quartz chime, path revealed). The final image of the arbor “no longer ominous but merely mineral” charges the thematic shift. A minor quibble is that the real-world logistics of an abandoned car in a quartz grove are left poetic rather than realistic, but this suits the piece’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard and bamboo grove are richly evoked through smell (cider rot), texture (moss-stitched branches), and tools (loom, puzzle pieces), and they are not decorative: the orchard literally rewinds under the loom’s influence, and the sap becomes an ongoing consequence of her choice. The environment constrains what can happen (isolated grove, forgotten orchard) and charges the final image of sap beads threaded with quiet gold. A very slight risk of over-dense description is offset by strong integration with action. The setting feels both mythic and concretely lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: floating rock arches, twin moons, orchard rows, and abandoned mine shafts all shape what is possible and what must be built. The arches’ defiance of gravity directly generates the problem and the eventual solution, while the mine shafts and farm tools supply the material and metaphorical rubble. Atmosphere and worldbuilding are tightly tied to theme—gravity versus defiance, rubble versus resilience—without feeling like a mere tour. Environmental logic remains consistent and the final images of grounded arches and azure-lit orchard feel earned and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and its parallel variants are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through her sensory-professional bias (temperature, vibration, scent). The environment directly constrains choices—the shard pulls her along decks and thresholds, the zero-g bay forces bracing boots, the specific locker in this bay anchors the emotional climax. The recurring bay at dawn, “exhaling” into the shape of a question, clearly charges the final image. There is rich atmosphere without sliding into static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, cliff, and lantern room are vividly particular—“glass lenses hung like frozen tears,” “wet iron and old hymns”—and always filtered through Elias’s working familiarity. Setting is not decorative: the tower’s breath, the catwalk, the brass rail, and the skiff’s launch all constrain what he can do and how he communicates. The sea glass and stones function as micro-setting objects that decisively charge the final image. Environmental detail is dense yet purposeful, with no white-room moments or tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The emerald lighthouse and post-newsprint sea are vividly realized and deeply entwined with the story’s mechanics: the lens, sail of ink, and ocean of silence all constrain what is possible. The environment evolves meaningfully (fixed tower → moving ship → dissolved beacon), and the final white canvas and presses of light reconfigure the setting into theme. Details like “granite blocks… glided like ships” and “constellations into foam” feel specific and earned rather than generic surrealism. A hair short of the very top tier only because sensory range skews heavily visual and conceptual, with less tactile or bodily grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock tea house, cloud forest, pigments, and valley-mist are vividly and economically realized, with details like silk tethers, paper walls, and jasmine-thunderstorm tea integrated into action rather than static description. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical choices, but it does charge the final descent and Hoshiko’s new role: being “valley-mist” rather than the voice gains weight because the setting has been so concretely established. World rules feel internally consistent for its lyrical-fantastical register.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stormlit tower, moon-drinking stones, parapet, and labyrinth below are vivid and integrated into the action rather than scenic wallpaper. Moonlight is not just pretty light but a functional world rule that heals mortar, thumbnails, and ultimately the sextant, directly charging the final image of the cedar on the parapet. Spatial and atmospheric choreography (spiral stairs, corridor below, hedges outside) is clear and supports mood and magic. The setting feels singular, and the environment meaningfully constrains how sorrow can be worked on.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard, mirror greenhouse, quicksilver roots, and woven dawns are richly concrete and tightly integrated with action; the environment is not backdrop but mechanism for change. The mica, trees, glass, and tarry vines all affect options and tactics, especially in the self-wounding beat and in the final image of ordinary trees sprouting from mica dust. World rules (songs weave dawns; mirrors echo but don’t reflect each other’s light) are consistent and dramatized rather than explained. The density of baroque imagery occasionally risks over-saturation, but spatial and conceptual orientation remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    The secret society library beneath a metro station is vividly realized through tactile details—chill marble, chained grimoires, ember-red chandeliers—and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception. Setting isn’t decorative: the nightly purge, mirrored desk, and the library itself directly constrain options and shape the outcome (she literally becomes part of the environment). The ending image of the hidden library accessed only by those with “a mistake heavy enough” shows the place holding thematic and plot weight. Specificity is high without lapsing into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    The city, Rue des Aubes, the gutted bakery, and especially the overgrown palace courtyard and tea house are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Mila’s noticing mind. Setting repeatedly constrains and charges choices: vanished shops and “Remodeling” signs define the threat, asphalt scars dictate where they plant, and the palace mosaics literally “uncloak” history at the climax. The recurring physicality of bread, soil, vines, and herbs grounds the more abstract stakes. A minor limitation is that the broader city’s social texture remains a bit impressionistic, though commuters and guilds provide a hint of lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen library above the clouds, quartz hush, brass railing, and frost behave as an integrated, rule-bound environment rather than backdrop. Temperature and altitude literally constrain the mercury tablet’s legibility and shape the logic of the ending (data must enter a living tree because warmth would erase it). Details are vivid and POV-filtered (breath as tiny alphabets, spectral layers like jellyfish), with no white-room moments. The final tree scene reweights both settings by linking upper stacks’ data with the lower world’s oblivious life.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pirate market under the pier is vividly rendered through tactile, purposeful detail—tide licking crates, barnacled pilings, swinging lanterns, gulls above—always filtered through the narrator’s emotional stakes. Environment and objects do real work: the tide’s rise and the approach of sunrise structure time and pressure, while the pier’s underbelly and contraband ambiance reflect the moral gray of her choice. The phonograph and jars of feelings function as a micro-setting that directly shape the action and thematic charge of the ending. A minor check is that physical constraints (like the pier beginning to sink) stay mostly atmospheric rather than forcing concrete tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: lavender bluff, aurora, and forest “elections” all shape the atmosphere and conceptual stakes. The environment isn’t just backdrop; the bluff’s eastern slope and the aurora “touching earth” focalize the convergence point, and the forests’ political ecology mirrors the human election of stance. Sensory detail (smell of pine and decision, taste of ozone and lavender) is rich and POV-filtered through her synesthetic talent. The recurring bluff/aurora/forest triad also charges the final descent and the aurora’s dimming, giving the last images real environmental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and specific—rose light, quartz and gypsum, iron-tasting air—and its properties meaningfully constrain and charge events (crystals grow along her lines, the portrait literally becomes geology, the rose beam pierces the festival). The abandoned amusement park and lantern festival aboveground are sketched efficiently yet give the final beam-to-lantern moment real spatial and emotional resonance. The environment functions as both external cathedral and internal echo chamber for exile and memory, not mere backdrop. A slight overabundance of descriptive flourishes in early lines edges toward luxuriant but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, filtration veils, and air-purifying vines are richly particular and integrated into character perception and action. Environmental rules (vines reacting to honesty, curfew, decommissioned Fern Cathedral full of undelivered letters) materially shape what Aurelia can do. The final image—opaque sky, reflective glass, vines lifting at truth—charges the setting with thematic weight. The world feels coherent and specific without resorting to expository dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bluff above the clouds, basalt stairs, thin air, glacier ice, and kinetic sculpture form a richly specific and coherent environment. Setting continually constrains and animates action: the altitude and exposure enable comet contact, the wind becomes a player in the music, and the long ascent encodes the thirty-year cost. Details are always filtered through her craft-focus (frequencies, metals, micro-oscillations) rather than as touristic catalog. The final image—bluff whispering, symphony orbiting—shows the environment charging and carrying the story’s meaning beyond her.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert rose farm, glass dome, and shifting magnetic north are vivid, specific, and integral to plot mechanics (ignition pattern, firewall, miniaturization zone). Setting constraints (the dome, burn routes, timing, oils) drive what can and must happen, not just background mood. Recurring environmental images—the impossible-colored roses, their ignition, the folding dome—directly charge the final image of the single desert rose. World rules are consistent and legible despite their strangeness, with no expository drag.

    The courtyard, desert dawn, fountain, and thrift-shop interior are richly evoked and always filtered through Mira’s sensibility, never as generic backdrop. Setting meaningfully constrains action—the sealed mailbox, the unused post, the courtyard as gathering bowl for rumor and silence—and directly charges the final image (a courtyard “larger,” tuned to hold unsaid things). Recurring objects-as-setting (mailbox, locket, borescope, velvet cushion) structure the story’s spatial and emotional logic. The environment’s mood shifts with time of day in ways that parallel the arc from restless mystery to spent, charged calm.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken lab, cracked plexiglass dome, and spherical archive are vivid, tactile, and constantly interacted with (water pressure, airlocks, service shaft, buoy). Environment constrains choices and techniques—she must move as a dancer in water, trust the dice, and respect the time limit implied by the spider’s web and sputtering pressure valve. The final images (silver sigh of released air, moonlit waves, constellation-like code) are charged directly by the setting. A tiny step down from perfection comes from the fact that some striking details (e.g., rusted weather vane) read more as atmosphere than as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integral—the salt crystal chamber, fluctuating gravity, and harbor all shape both what can happen and how it feels (“her steps into strange arcs”). The environment is not a postcard; it directly conditions action (gravity pockets, the preserved shadow, crystals cracking) and mirrors the thematic work around memory and weight. Recurring objects-as-setting (lantern pole, pressed flowers, whale body, salt crystals) all return at the end with charged meaning, especially the lanterns and gravity as reframed “gentler” forces. The final images of altered gravity and the city inhaling flower dust are deeply anchored in prior environmental logic, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The brook and nocturnal haven are vividly rendered and consistently functional: the water accepts offerings, mirrors generate cranes, and the flow shapes his path and the final images. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—moonlight, reeds, frog throats—always filtered through his ritual focus on silence and code. The setting constrains action (he steps into the cold water, follows the brook downstream) and charges the final cadence as the brook “sang without code.” This is a strong case of environment as both stage and active participant in the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The rooftop garden, fire escape, gargoyle, and meteor shower are not decorative; they shape meaning and constraints (the building’s “crown” weight, the gargoyle as mouthpiece, the fire escape as social conduit). The seal and owl function as charged tools, linking hand, stone, and voice; the meteor shower becoming Latin hexameter literalizes the story’s linguistic conceit. Setting details are tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (architectural memory, tea, jasmine-scented sugar), creating a strong atmospheric through-line. The final images—the rooftop conjugated in present continuous, steam spelling “stay”—are inseparable from the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden, foxglove tunnel, and pond are not mere backdrop; they are the mechanism for accessing, replaying, and redistributing the quarantined memory. Physical features (gate, blossoms, soil) constrain the ritual and then become the public interface (“anyone who pressed an ear to its blooms”). The setting’s mood—bruise, funeral clothes, grayscale—tracks the emotional arc and charges the final transformation into a public archive. A touch less ornamental flourish in places might free more room for how the space tactically shapes options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marble sanctuary under the aurora is vivid and specific—stalactites, dripping water, cold stone—and consistently filtered through Mara’s history with the place. The setting isn’t just decorative; it’s the crucible where childhood refuge, the sister’s death, and the present ritual converge, so its emotional topography directly shapes the meaning of her actions. Recurring environmental details (aurora shifting from pearl twilight toward dawn, stalactite drips marking time) effectively mirror her internal transition. While the space doesn’t impose concrete physical constraints, it strongly charges the final images and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, and breathing echo gallery are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lira’s auditory/mystic sensibility. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables choice: the vanished river informs the song, the canyon walls transform her voice, and the shell-guided tunnels and moth-woven gallery structure the journey. The environment directly charges the final image—the canyon now holds history without trapping her, and open sky receives her new song. This is excellent atmospheric and functional worldbuilding, just shy of transcendent only because the physical peril of the environment remains mostly notional rather than actively dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting work is superb: glacier, wreck, shrine, and ice corridors are sensorially specific and filtered through Marrow’s watery, liminal sensibility. Environment and objects (glacier pressure, air pockets, snow globes) actively shape what is possible, including the crack that opens the path and the closing windows at the end. The recurring snow globe/shrine miniatures charge the final images, and weather/light (“borrowed starlight,” crevasse-blue) tonally fuse with theme. The world’s rules feel consistent and are learned through her exploration rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated: the “whispering parapet after rain,” harbor, fireflies, and moonlit puddles all filter through her craft-minded gaze. Environmental details constrain action (slick stone stairs, lack of lamp, moon paths for navigation) and charge the final images (fireflies’ light stored in nets, stones whispering in the language of contraction and release). The bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting object whose carved spiral literally maps the path she walked. Atmosphere, physical environment, and object recur to shape both tactics and theme at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The wasteland orchard is strikingly specific (chrome “Paradise” gate half-melted, radioactive dust, hex-scarred apples) and consistently filters through Marisol’s perceptions and tools (Geiger counter, lead-lined gloves). Setting meaningfully constrains choice: radiation defines the stillpoint as a safe pocket, and the orchard’s properties (hexagonal scars, glassy roots) literally encode the method to find and deploy the diamond. The environment directly charges the final image: apples browning faster once truth is broadcast gives the world a responsive moral ecology. One small limiter is that sensory spread leans heavily visual/metaphoric; a touch more tactile constraint under pressure could make it even more immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vivid and sensorial—the static, dome windows, storm flashes—all firmly filtered through Elara’s work with the machines. The environment meaningfully colors her isolation and charges the climax (the storm peaking as she hits the key, lightning strobing her workspace), though it rarely constrains what she can actually do. The cobalt portico and basement-radio counterpoint extend setting into a symbolically charged network. Strong atmosphere and specificity, with slightly more mood than tactical pressure keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The half-buried ship hull, dunes, and “feral loft beneath the dunes” are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail and a strong POV filter. Setting is not just pretty: the ribs as a cathedral, the driftwood altar, and the dunes’ “wistful” air all directly charge the ritual and the final projected letters on the curved ceiling. The micro-setting of jars on shelves and the hatch where the child arrives gives spatial coherence and supports the closing image of shared listening. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it richly shapes tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drift-ice marina isn’t just scenic; its soundscape is literally the consciousness she must negotiate with, and the ice’s calving physically raises the stakes as she plays. Tools and objects (the crypt keeper’s key, the Echo, the lighthouse pigments in her coat) are spatially and thematically integrated, constraining tactics and charging the final images. Sensory detail is dense yet purposeful, with sound and temperature dominating in ways that fit the premise and Mireya’s profession. The environment meaningfully shapes choices and closure, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are not backdrop; they dictate method (tracking reflected moon paths), risk (walking to the lake’s center), and the revolution’s mechanism (field buckling, blue sparks). Physical rules feel consistent: ice as “unwritten page,” viaduct as “half bridge, half antenna,” and the magnetic pull on the iron in his blood all interlock. The final images—the compass abandoned on the ice, blue “reverse snowfall,” dawn over a changed coast—are charged directly by these environmental features. World detail is rich but always filtered through Elian’s professional gaze, avoiding tourist-catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly evoked (“like a throat,” rusted ladder, damp chill) and consistently integrated with Mara’s perceptions. The environment organically yields key discoveries (tally marks, hidden box) and thus shapes the plot, not just the mood. The lantern functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and ties to historical escape. Weather/drought context is sketched rather than deeply inhabited, but at this length it’s an effective, economical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shop is richly rendered—the brass gears, skylight, glass dome, and storm outside are vivid, selective, and thematically charged rather than decorative. The environment isn’t just backdrop: it provides the tools and context for the repair and the mailing of the evidence, and the final image of the music spilling onto the waking street clearly charges the ending. Weather and light (storm, lightning, silver dawn) evolve with the emotional arc, echoing Rowan’s definition of innocence without feeling schematic. Detail level is high but generally filtered through Emil’s stake-focused perception, not a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The acid sea, the dangling gears, the undercarriage workshop, and the buoy-cathedral are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Juniper’s mechanical-lyric sensibility. Environment and tools actively constrain and shape action: the acid sea makes descent dangerous, the buoy’s architecture dictates her climb, and the bell’s missing clapper demands an inventive solution. The recurring apparatuses (Algorithm, kaleidoscope, arrow tip, bell) function as micro-settings that charge the final image and are not mere wallpaper. Description is dense but purposeful, supporting both mood and mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The social network archive, the polar server farm, and the crystal blocks are concrete, atmospheric, and tightly integrated with theme. Environment actively constrains and enables choices: sealed folders, biometric firewalls, decommissioned ice-buried servers, and humming crystal blocks all force specific tactics and shape the bargain. Recurring objects (the patch, Block 73) reappear with reweighted meaning at the end, especially the empty Block 73 “the size of a mother’s embrace.” The worldbuilding is economical yet distinctive, never lapsing into white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse orchard, shifting ice floes, and mirror-studded apple trees are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s task and temperament, not just postcard description. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain tactics—the mirrors as the only reliable window and portal, the precarious perch and dawn ice contributing subtle pressure, the sphere as a literal and thematic beacon. The closing image of ripe apples instead of salt and the ice locking as “the sea itself paused to listen” powerfully recharges earlier sensory details. A slight reason this doesn’t push into 9+ is that the physical danger of the ice deadline stays mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina, mercy ship, and floes are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action: the cracked ice, groaning plates, and horn all constrain movement and choice at key beats. The heirloom parasol tip functions as a micro-setting tool that literally plants into the ice and charges the final image, making environment and object inseparable. World rules around euthanasia tourism and ice-locked elders are sketched with just enough specificity to feel lived-in and thematically apt without devolving into exposition. A slight tempering factor is that some atmospheric description leans more toward lyric flourish than pressure-bearing detail, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The vineyard, pavilion, and station are vividly rendered and tightly woven into Marco’s perceptions and choices, with autumn and the amber light mirroring end-of-season / late-life stakes. Recurring elements—the pavilion, bus, vines, saffron light—return to charge the final image rather than serving as postcard scenery. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, it strongly shapes emotional options and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly evoked and strongly filtered through the walker’s attention to sound and subtle movement. Setting is not decorative: the parapet’s mechanisms and the pavilion’s acoustics actively shape the ritual and then charge the final heartbeat image. World rules (whispers of past seekers, conjured clearings as distortions in understanding) feel internally consistent and distinct. A touch more sensory variety beyond sound and motion could push this higher, but as-is it’s rich and functionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are richly, specifically rendered (“air smelled of iron and honey”), and almost every beat is filtered through their textures. The environment is not just decorative; the factory ghosts, lavender, vines, and rust/honey scent all actively frame what kind of healing is possible and charge the final communal exhale. Objects-as-setting (map case, corkboard, key, photographs) are well integrated into the spatial logic of the field and ruins. The only reason this doesn’t push into 9+ is that the setting shapes mood and meaning more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The shadowed library at dawn is vividly rendered and integrated—dust motes, brittle books, high windows, and the fallen chandelier all contribute to mood and theme. Setting details like the biography section, philosophy stacks, and upper gallery are used to stage the disembodied sounds and the falling book, not just decorate. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain her physical options, but it does tightly frame the metaphysical stakes of memory and language. The final image of the crystal beside the last dictionary effectively charges the space as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, coherent, and thoroughly integrated: the fog sculptures, crushed VHS, landfill shrine, and shoreline driftwood all feel of a piece and mirror the themes of decay and impermanence. Sensory detail (magnetic tape smell, metallic taste of fog) is well-chosen and filtered through his obsessions. The garden and its materials meaningfully shape tactics (driftwood markers, chalk on junk and fog) and charge the final image; it falls just short of higher marks only because the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lunar observatory is rendered with vivid, selective specificity (cracked glass, frozen spectrographs, Hasselblad, prism-like corridors) and is inseparable from the story’s mechanics and theme. The environment actively constrains and channels choice: the quake-prone foundations, telescopes, darkroom logic, and emergency shuttle all shape what Mira can do and what it costs. The final images—the observatory folding into a single frame, the “silver afterimage” on film—are charged directly by the setting’s tools and architecture. World rules are consistently strange-but-legible, so the surreal leaf and sound feel earned rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    The above-the-clouds hospice, glass floors, and drifting “cumulus cities” are vivid and thematically apt, creating a literal liminal space between life (city) and death (clouds) that charges every choice. Setting is persistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility—sounds becoming notes, smells becoming “hope”—and the skybridge midpoint concretely shapes the final understanding of being between “ward and world.” Environmental and micro-setting details (monitor, IV, shard placement, lamp dimming) are integrated into action rather than bolted on. The final image of her holding the reunited vinyl to her chest is inseparable from the physical space and its vertigo.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and structurally necessary: the floating observatory, orrery of rings, Möbius night, sundial casting moonshadows, and drifting isle all directly enable the mechanics of “closing loops” and replaying time. Environmental details are filtered through Lyra’s scholarly, ritualistic interaction with instruments rather than tourist cataloging, and those tools constrain her options. The world rules about spoons bending reality and shadowless noons are strange but internally consistent and re-evoked in the sky and at the global restoration beat. The observatory’s continuing existence as a drifting “tiny star” also charges the final image and her ongoing guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The secret garden, hedge maze, briar path, bone sundial, and pear trees are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the emotional arc. Environment actively shapes her options—the garden literally opens a new path and the sundial freezes the hour of her error, constraining where and when the confrontation occurs. Recurring environmental elements (hedges, pears, maze-light) charge the final image of villagers gossiping and children playing, giving the world a lived-in continuity. The setting’s rules—organic, eerie, but consistent—quietly underpin the story’s logic without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The serpentine grotto and its mist are vividly, economically rendered and deeply integrated: the wall’s “calcite veins,” the mist’s reaction to the ritual, and the dripping water all directly shape the magic and final transformation. Setting is always filtered through Lira’s sensibility as a star watcher and tide-aware child, avoiding tourist-catalog description. Environmental elements constrain and enable choice: the grotto as hidden lab, the wall as mirror, the ancient seawater drop as catalytic. The recurring objects (sea glass, grotto wall, mist) clearly charge the final images and the sense of a secret kept by the place.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The moss-eaten data center is vividly realized and inextricable from theme: dead servers turned garden mirror voices turned compost for healing. Environment directly shapes the ritual (USB burial under a lichen-flowering server, icicle pattern pressed into soil) and charges the final image. Details are selective and consistent (coolant pipes, thawing icicles, cracked skylight) and always filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The world feels both concrete and mythic without slipping into generic ruin-porn.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: the “feral nexus” with mist like marginalia and fog as quotation marks is both atmospheric and functional as a machine for abandoned hopes. Environmental details aren’t postcard extras; the tidal channels, fog, and shell-lighthouse actively mediate how hopes appear and how Mara can interact with them. The city return and windowsill lighthouse give a grounded counterpoint to the liminal nexus, charging the final image. A minor check is that the physical constraints of the nexus seldom limit her tactics beyond being a summoning ground, but at this length it’s sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The verdant arbor, moss-covered branches, bioluminescent vine, harvest moon, and hollowed-oak workshop are evoked with high specificity and a coherent sensory palette. Setting consistently shapes action: the height in the tree, the wind through leaves amplifying her song, and dawn’s exact angle of light on the bloom all constrain timing and tactics. World rules (mnemonic pollen, lunar cycles, plant–human language) are taught through interaction rather than inert exposition. The final image of new tendrils spiraling toward the golden ratio elegantly uses environment to charge the sense of ongoing cost and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The withered subarctic orchard and crater are vividly realized, with details like “apple skeletons” and “snowflakes pausing mid-air” doing double duty as mood and world rule. Environment meaningfully constrains action: the cold, ice, and flash-paper’s volatility demand extreme care and silence, and the orchard itself becomes an active participant in the climax, exhaling and turning into a “living score.” The starlight vial and copper plate function as micro-settings/tools that quite literally charge the final image. A few lush descriptions are there more for texture than pressure, but they rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    The marble cavern, with its reflective veins and echo behavior, is vivid and absolutely integral to the story’s logic and climax (harvesting echoes, delayed reflections as “an archive of stray moments”). Setting details are tightly filtered through Ansel’s attention and profession, e.g., using reflections, cracks, and stone plinths as functional tools. The environment directly shapes the method (studying reflection angles, measuring delays) and the final image (echoes choosing to stay, nesting in stone). The cellar and village above reprise and extend the setting logic, charging the ending without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bronze grotto, “shingled hush,” and kerosene burner are not just decorative; they dictate tactics and constraints (she must keep the flame alive, work within the echoing, edge-less space, and use the tiles and symmetry to trigger the calcification). Environmental details evolve with events—the hush tightens, the tiles ring, the walls peel back—making the setting an active participant in the conflict. The final image of the sealed grotto and the burner left as a small sun shows the environment and object still shaping future choices. Sensory specificity is rich yet coherent to the character’s ritualized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft and the circus objects (latch, cage, ring, jars, kettle) are vividly rendered and always filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a performer-turned-widow. Setting is not backdrop: the skylight, the view of the empty ring, and the workbench tools all constrain what she can do to process grief and directly charge the final image. Weather and environment evolve (storm to drip of gutters) in parallel with her internal movement. The micro-setting of the loft as a private “tent” after the audience leaves is thematically and structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: the kinetic lagoon, upside-down constellations, mirrored walkway, and obsidian mare all both characterize the world and mediate the negotiation. Environmental features constrain and enable action—the cloudwater becoming “silver glass” is literally the recording medium for their non-progress, and the frozen ripple creates the charged stillness for realization. Details are always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (hissing cloudwater as his name backwards, constellations for fish to dream of flying), preventing museum-tour description. The final image of the carousel resuming over a dissolving bench in the lagoon’s world feels inseparable from this specific environment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: the abandoned spaceport’s gates, canals, pumps, brass birds, and fountain are both atmosphere and machinery. Environmental constraints directly shape action—her work depends on these exact hydraulic and architectural remnants, and the final images (birds patrolling, equations fluttering, pre-dawn exit) are inseparable from this place. Textures like “Martian vermillion” rust and ghostly carnival traces deepen mood without feeling like a static tour. A slight risk of sensory overload remains but does not harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and consistently realized—the crystal forecourt, ruined observatory, glacial altitude, and petrichor are all worked through multiple senses and integrated into Arlen’s perception. Environment meaningfully charges the final image (brass gears fused to crystal, apprentices mythologizing the site) and functions as a quasi-sacred space that legitimizes his ritual. While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain tactical options, it strongly frames the emotional and thematic stakes and transforms the clock into an “offering.” Density occasionally borders on lush excess but remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight barge canal, fog, rusted freighter, and reedy cut are all sharply rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, creating a coherent, atmospheric world. Setting is not postcard-detail; it constrains choices (the canal’s hidden cut, the half-submerged bunker) and directly enables the core discovery. The war-scarred landscape and the canal-as-scar metaphorically echo the thematic work without feeling over-declared. The sundial also functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image when she leaves it behind.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The harbor—golden dock, snow, fog, tide, fulgurite-glazed rope—saturates the piece and is always doing work: it shapes Ari’s tactics, enables her escape, and literally hosts the seed. Environmental specificity is high and POV-filtered; sea-real, tool-specific language (marline, crown-in-reverse, fulgurite) feels lived-in rather than touristic. Weather and physical materials constrain choice and charge the final image of the green shoot and new glassy fibers. The world rules regarding rope-encoding and lightning-glass remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shadowed autumn garden is vivid and used purposefully: light through bare branches, leaves forming words, and deepening shadows becoming portals all participate in the story’s mechanics, not just its mood. The environment actively responds to her actions and charges the final image of the garden continuing its work after she leaves. The recurring objects (garden, ships, fountain, carpet-thread) function as a micro-ecosystem that constrains options to this liminal space. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual might have pushed it even higher, but what’s here is tightly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and thematically fused: the suspended palace, rusted gears, music-box necropolis, and punched-in sky all serve the beauty-vs-mechanism tension. Environmental details constrain and charge events—the hanging chains, swaying palace, stalactites, and rusted machinery all matter to mood and final cost (the chains snapping, the plunge). Details are filtered through the prince’s sensibility, avoiding generic steampunk tourism. The one drawback is density; the sheer lushness occasionally edges toward saturation, though clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian lagoon, dunes, and migrating clouds are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s fire-trained perception (“cloud shadows slid across the dunes like slow bruises”). Setting is not wallpaper: the lagoon provides water for the graft, its “kelp-drift peace” actively absorbs and cools her internal heat, and it explicitly “keeps their secrets” in the final line. Environmental detail escalates in meaning, from surface beauty to a kind of witness/partner in her ritual. The piece leverages a small, focused landscape to full thematic and emotional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” is vivid and thematically loaded: dry basins, glass water, mirrored possibilities—all filtered through Mara’s perception. Each fountain’s specific nature (First Lies, Last Goodbyes, Unkept Promises, Forgiveness) shapes which memory surfaces and how she must engage, so environment meaningfully structures the journey. The paused geese and dry city reappear at the end to charge the final image of a transformed hush. A touch more non-visual sensory texture could push this into even higher territory, but the setting is already a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nebula garden is richly evoked—ionized gas petals, hydrogen blossoms, crystalline paths, pollen like crushed diamonds—and consistently filtered through Kael’s exile/root metaphor. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (petals pausing, then glowing with cool light), and the garden-as-organism acts as a responsive medium for the sonar and the transformation. However, the setting rarely constrains tactical options in a concrete way; it functions more as a resonant, beautifully particularized atmosphere and symbolic field than as a hard limiter on what Kael can do.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse, storms, glass, terracotta, and the oak piercing the ceiling are vivid and thematically charged, not mere backdrop. The environment meaningfully shapes what can happen—hidden headstones wrapped in roots, chrysalises on watering cans, and the contained-yet-porous space make the chrysalis scene and the unplaced graves possible. Detail selection generally feels filtered through the carver’s sensibility (stone, tools, inscriptions) and the grief-poetry motif. A minor limitation is occasional piling of images without new functional work, but the setting clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with stakes—the sea’s erosion, the sacrificed field, and the tower’s foundation all constrain choice. Details like “black glass hissing like hot iron” and “iron bones already blush with orange grief” are sensory, purposeful, and character-filtered. Environment directly shapes the outcome: if not for the ridge and tower’s placement atop his brother’s field, the ethical calculus would be entirely different. The final image of the ridge “like a blade turned away from flesh” closes the thematic and spatial loop with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, tapestry, and root cellar are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Mercy’s sensibility, giving the piece a rich, atmospheric specificity. Setting repeatedly constrains and channels action: the abandoned missile shaft becomes a greenhouse and secret chamber; the tapestry’s placement and construction dictate how she can access the hidden drawer; the graves and lamb statue determine where she digs. Environmental and object details (the sovereign, spiral, seedlings, seed packets) all recur with reweighted meaning at the end. A slight paring-back of decorative modifiers in a few lines could further heighten the sense that every detail is doing indispensable work.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.1)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered and integral: they are not just backdrop but the physicalization of constraint and blankness, shaping what she can do and how. Environmental details (the humming spire, the perfect unmarred ice, breath crystallizing) are filtered through her task and charge the final images of the hairline crack and monument-like spire. The kingfisher quill functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains her choices by exacting bodily and mnemonic cost. World rules around the lake rewriting itself and the dawn fracture remain consistent and support the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned concert hall, ember alcove, mist, and green dial form a richly textured, coherent micro-world whose rules (silence, secrecy, outlawed narrative) stay consistent and are learned through action. The environment meaningfully constrains choices—she must work at night, hide in the acoustic ruins, rig stands as antennae—and charges the final images of mist carrying chords and the radio’s afterglow as a “tiny green planet.” Sensory detail is dense yet purposeful, especially around dust, rosin, and mist, which all later matter to the climax. A slight tendency toward lushness in every line keeps this just below the very top tier, but clarity is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “vanishing point gallery,” the converging walls, the track lighting, and the central rocking chair create an unusually vivid and conceptually integrated environment. Spatial logic (entrance sightline, vanishing point, expanding spiral) directly shapes Elena’s tactics and the final image, not just mood. Recurring objects—the chair, mask, powder—function as micro-settings that constrain what she can do and how we read it. The setting’s perspective logic charging the ending keeps this near the top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken city, sewer conduits, strata of pottery, and burial sump are vividly particular and always filtered through Caldera’s sense of time and narrative, which keeps description purposeful. The environment constrains what she can do—crawl, dive, pry tablets, wedge the lead sheet—and the rising boats and slime-slick stair tangibly shape the final image. The recurring cog and bones-as-tools function as micro-setting elements that charge both the middle (the writing) and ending (cog pocketed as she speaks). It stops just shy of 9-band only because we rarely feel immediate physical risk from the environment; the pressure remains primarily conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The velvet library is richly and economically realized—cedar and candle smoke, crimson drapes, mahogany tables—and every detail serves atmosphere and theme rather than cataloging. The setting is not just backdrop; its rules (one visitor on the equinox, the “unbinding of the ear”) constrain what can happen and when, and the rosette as a tool-as-setting literally shapes how sound and silence operate. The environment charges the final image (circle of untouched dust, peculiar silence under the moonlit window) with clear, felt significance. Description borders on luxuriant but remains under control and always filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a music worker in a city allergic to harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rusted greenhouse is exquisitely realized and fully integrated: rust flakes, cracked panes, and ghost-orchid roots all interweave with Marisol’s senses and actions. The environment actively shapes possibilities (alignment light through broken glass, the abandoned lot, the transformation of rust to copper and glass to leaves) and charges the final image of officers leaving “with plum-colored seeds.” World rules feel consistent and are learned through interaction rather than exposition. The setting does thematic work without feeling like clumsy symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lightning collection tower, the glass-walled booth, the dead hive, and the “nectar dusk” sky are all concretely rendered and tightly interwoven with the action. Environment constrains tactics (no elevators, maintenance stairs, sealed hive chamber) and directly shapes the climax (copper rods, cones, afterthought bolt). Recurring objects—coins, hive, matchbox, lacquer box—are embedded in the setting and power the final image of the tollgate transformed. The atmosphere sustains a charged, slightly uncanny industrial-lyric tone that deepens rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bay, tide line cottages, dune grass, and the net-drying shack are rendered with precise, atmospheric detail that feels deeply filtered through Elara’s notice-driven perception. Recurring environmental elements (streetlights, windows, curtains, tide) are reweighted at the end—curtains “breathing with the tide,” streetlights nodding—so the setting actively charges closure. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical options, it is inseparable from the story’s logic of slow coastal change and creeping normality. The piece achieves a rich sense of place without lapsing into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater city garden is vividly realized and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“grief of barnacles,” “heartbeat of silt”), avoiding postcard description. Environment directly constrains choice: the structural weakness of the keystone arch, thirty fathoms down, is the necessary vessel for releasing the memory. The setting continuously mirrors and pressures the thematic stakes—submerged, preserved certainties vs. living ambiguity. This integration is excellent and charges the final image of the “gate” being open beneath oblivious ships.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite staircase is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: humming steps, blood-marked risers, and a rippling wall all directly shape her choices and the final image. The environment both embodies and enforces “boundless confinement,” constraining her to climb and making the slowing stairs a real threat to her existence as a climber. World rules (perpetual motion, time that “refused to accumulate”) stay internally consistent even as they are bent by her math/blood interventions. The setting’s specificity and evolution under pressure (steps shiver, slow, convulse, then fold) do substantial thematic and structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are richly, specifically rendered and deeply fused to theme: the greenhouse becomes a literal/metaphoric lung countering the city’s toxic air. Details are consistently POV-filtered (turmeric to “coax pigment into dreaming,” moon silvering panes, saffron quiet) and setting evolves with action as the mural coats the glass and blocks the city. Environment constrains options—the rooftop isolation, the glass, the air being “for lungs”—and decisively charges the final image of smog parting when people exhale grateful syllables. A demanding edit might trim a couple of lush descriptive flourishes for even tighter momentum, but the atmospheric integration is publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto city, waterfall, limestone alcoves, and improvised kitchen are vivid and integrated into action rather than feeling like a “tour.” The environment constrains choices (ice bridges melting, isolation from the world above) and charges the ending contrast between indifferent waterfall and warm communal ovens. Sensory detail (stalagmites like frozen waterfalls of memory, bread by candlelight, rosewater in the dream) supports tone and theme. The setting feels idiosyncratic and necessary to this story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, basalt steps, low tide, and internal gearwork are not decorative; they directly constrain tactics and make his reverse-engineering solution plausible (he needs the tower’s reversed gears, height, and mechanisms). The hunger stone and yoyo function as micro-setting tools whose physical properties literally channel and exhaust “latent radiance,” charging the final image of the cracked rock on the bench. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, and world-rules are consistent within the fable-surreal frame. Environment and object-setting together clearly charge the ending, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned funhouse is not just atmospheric; it dictates the entire encounter structure (clown mouth, warped corridors, cursed booth, mirror gauntlet) and constrains how she can confront fear. Details like “candied apples and wet copper,” twitching photo strips, and the mildewed curtain feel deeply filtered through her psyche, merging external rot with internal trauma. The space actively produces options and portals (photo-to-corridor, mirror panels) that could not be transplanted to another setting without breaking the story. The final exhalation of “cotton-candy rot” and the ticket booth where she leaves the clasp charge the last image with the setting’s history and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and specific—the lashed cedar raft, glass buoys, cloud-lyre, and mirror-flat Doldrum Wall all feel concrete and strange in a consistent way. Crucially, environment constrains and drives action: the lack of wind and the “Sea’s Locked Jaw” force the prophet toward sound-based tactics, and the orchard body literally becomes the instrument. Weather and sea-state are not postcard backdrops; they define the central problem and shape the solution. This is worldbuilding that is both lush and functional, though at times the density of imagery flirts with sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly specific and integral: the turtle-shell city, bone-white walls, rusted gate, Crack, and metal watchers all shape options and fear. Environmental constraints directly drive plot—the city’s mobility atop turtles enables course changes and the existential risk of tumbling into the abyss. Recurring objects (spiral-shell atlas, carapace, crack/Crack) charge the final image and the new chart. Details feel filtered through a working cartographer’s eye, never like a tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The disused ivy-choked station, rusted rails, and the rosebush are vividly rendered and constantly re-engaged rather than backdrop; they frame action (hidden tile, semaphore, tunnel) and mood. Environment constrains tactics—she uses the semaphore arm and freight tunnel and must time herself to the watchman’s patrol—while the rosebush and ivy entwine with the thematic “editing” of history. The final image of the petal-less bush and tightening ivy carries real conceptual weight. Rich sensory specificity is well chosen and not merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The submerged pavilion, canal, and drawbridge are vividly and economically evoked; details like rusted chandelier chains, rotted mortar, and lake-grass are specific and sensorial. Environment genuinely constrains action (timed low-water exposure, wading depth, fissures reachable only now) and charges the ending image of future scholars coring stone. The setting is always filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lens, avoiding tourist-catalog description. It very nearly reaches exemplary, but a touch less ornamental lushness and a bit more use-as-obstacle would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underwater library is vividly realized through specific, purposeful details (algae tubes, flooded atrium, kelp forests, bronze drawers bolted to marble), and these aren’t mere backdrop: water, blackout, pumps, and phosphorescent plankton all constrain or enable key moves. The environment directly shapes tactics (she comes during blackout, works as water rises, uses absolute dark and plankton to read the stamp) and charges the final images of surfacing into a city that “pretend[s] it had never fallen.” World rules—pressure doors, dying grid, algae lighting—are consistent and learned through action. Setting and object interlock at the climax when the glyph mirrors the original street grid, binding space, history, and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exquisitely specific and always doing work: levitating stones, tea bushes of distilled sleep, and the glass basilica all shape what is possible and how grief is processed. Environmental rules (recorded dawn, oneiric engines, ascending-descending stairs) are consistent and reappear at the end, reweighted by the cranes becoming lanterns for others. Sensory variety is rich (smell of kerosene, lavender/antiseptic, bergamot and bandages; sound of chiming leaves; tactile moonstone polishing) and all filtered through her craft-conscious gaze. The world feels both strange and functionally complete without lapsing into encyclopedic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory, transparent floor, helium sacs, and desert below are vivid and functionally integrated, most crucially in the ending where the height and telescope alignment make his fall an actionable perturbation. The geode and telescope operate as charged micro-setting objects that focus both perception and choice. A touch more sensory breadth beyond visual and abstracted “desert wind” could deepen atmosphere, but what’s here is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ancient observatory at dusk, broken dome, and crumbling astrolabe are vivid and consistently threaded through action and image, not just static description. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: stars seen through the ruined dome shift from distant astronomy to personal waypoints, aligning setting with thematic closure. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain tactics (they could arguably have met elsewhere), the observatory’s history of “star-watching secrets” tightly fuses with the chip’s celestial logic. Detail selection remains purposeful and filtered through Mara’s mission rather than reading like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood forest are vivid, integrated images that feel filtered through Elias’s sensibility and history. Environmental details (erosion of the carvings, the cobalt-to-black sky, the brass watch hand) mirror the story’s concerns with time, memory, and erosion of lies without feeling like blunt symbols. The setting isn’t just decorative: the shore ties to his grandfather and honest craft, the terrace physically and visually bridges him to his mother, and both recur in the final image. This charged use of place and object gives the ending real atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    The parapet, mist, bay, and weather are richly specific and consistently filtered through Kael’s professional and emotional lens (e.g., no chains on the parapet because metal would “sing of captivity”). Environment shapes options—neutrality protocols, the fog that erases flags and swallows the rope, the moonlight that slicks blades and later slips away, expanding the parapet into “room for possibilities.” The antique drawer pull functions as a micro-setting object whose history constrains Kael and then charges Seris’s future. The final images of mist lifting and coastlines no longer aiming cannons are inseparable from the thematic and emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, precise, and constantly functional: salt wind, launch ramp sodium glare, fog, pole lights, and the shipping channel all shape her tactics and options. The sea and the astronomical compass act as charged objects constraining and reframing choices, especially at the final pole where she pauses under the red beacon. Environmental elements evolve with the journey (fog erasing poles, bioluminescent dolphins arriving) and mirror her shifting inner map without feeling like pasted-on symbolism. The coastal nightscape feels tactile and indispensable to both conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is intensely specific and integrated: the ward with pastel-speaking nurses and backward clocks, the storm drains as “city’s arterial storm drains,” and especially the underground bioluminescent lake all mirror and pressure his inner journey. The lake is not postcard description; its physical rules (glow entering his body, water orbiting the baseball) actively structure the bargain and transformation. The recurring baseball functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains and charges crucial choices. World rules feel consistent within the surreal frame, teaching themselves through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard under permanent moon, the river of forgetting under the apple tree, and the moon-lit blossoms are not just pretty—they’re the physical grammar of the magic and the grief. The roots and their water enable the summoning of the sister’s shadow and receive the final planting of the altered fortune, charging the last image. Sensory detail is rich and selective (spice, ash, petals) and always filtered through the narrator’s emotional focus. The environment consistently constrains and enables choices rather than functioning as a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and idiosyncratic—silver moss where starlight cannot reach, a cloud that is both cathedral and interior grief-space—and consistently filtered through her sensibility. Environment and objects aren’t postcard decoration: the high altitude where “minutes fell upward,” the inside-of-a-cloud cathedral, and the saucer itself all materially shape what can happen. The world’s rules (time condensing into clouds, cracks as doorways) stay internally consistent and evolve with each turn. The final internalization of the glade as “inside her” charges the closing image and makes the micro-setting function as a lasting psychological landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The recycled spaceship, gravity spinner, and “bruise in space” are not just decorative; they directly shape tactics and possibilities (joy-driven propulsion, ship as coffin-turned-seed). Details like hull plates “stitched together from the ribs of a dozen dead cruisers” charge both atmosphere and theme. The final image of the hull blooming with vines of light roots setting and lantern-functioning is a setting-driven closure. World rules around emotion-powered gravity and the locked dimension feel internally consistent within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and active: the black sand, twin moons, active lava, glass cave, and orchids all shape the action and symbolism rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental dynamics directly affect choices (the eruption forcing the detour, the mountain “rearranging,” lava cooling into a staircase). Sensory detail is rich and varied, though it occasionally skirts saturation. The final image of glowing footprints and orchids growing from each step neatly ties environment to ongoing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The luminous fort, blackout, aether generator, and sky-barges are vividly evoked and consistently integrated into action and choice—especially the blackout both endangering and protecting them and the chain-room anchors shaping tactics. Objects-as-setting (bronze quill holder, half-painted sundial) are woven into the environment rather than feeling ornamental. Weather/light (bruised-violet sky, murdered torches, dawn gold) track the arc from suppression to liberation and charge the final image of an “unlocked” fort. The world feels fully implied without infodump, with only minor room to tighten sensory variety beyond the visual and mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless world are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through action (wet stone that doesn’t make him slip, eels leaving water, aurora mirrored by star dust). Setting and recurring objects (rocks, pouch, bluff edge, tide line) strongly charge the final images even if they rarely constrain tactical choice in a hard way. World rules (no friction, collapsed stars, vanished magnetism) are strange but internally stable within this mythic mode. The environment reads as integral to the story’s mood and imagery rather than as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit observatory, darkroom, catwalk, and cloud deck are vividly rendered and always doing double duty as both environment and pressure: weather affects action (rain flung upward, lightning overexposure), and the tools (telescope, timer, petri dish) literally channel her rebellion. Sensory detail is specific and POV-filtered (“rain upward in reversed waterfalls,” the solution smelling of “rain on hot pavement”), and the dome’s behavior (“breathe like a sleeping animal”) anchors the lyricism. Crucially, the setting constrains tactics: she chooses starlight and static because of telescopes and altitude, not as arbitrary metaphor. The final image of the timer restarting under thunder depends on this environment, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are not decorative; the glass roof and water’s reflection literally complete the code at dusk, making environment integral to the climax. Spatial relations are clear (atrium → sundial → brook → Council doors), and the brook’s “reversing” at dusk is both a plot device and an atmospheric touch. The floating needle card and the brook carrying it away give the final image strong locational charge. A bit more non-visual sensory texture could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is purposeful and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rusted desert library is not just atmospheric; its buckled roof, potbellied stove, warped shelves, and roof holes actively shape action and image (the spiral nest, green flames, voices braiding up to the moon). The setting constrains tactics (they can hide in this forgotten, jurisdiction-less pocket; the stove becomes the chosen method for transforming old selves and verdicts into fuel). Recurring environmental elements—the moon, rust, iron, desert wind—charge the final image of a space “too bright for iron walls to hold,” grounding theme in concrete architecture. Every major beat is intertwined with the place’s materiality, rather than floating in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and specific: the empty station, the clacking board, the ozone-scented shaft, the tidal arbor, and the filmic platform all feel distinct yet of a piece. Environment and recurring objects (especially the clock, the departure board, and the tidal arbor’s descent spilling fog through the film) actively shape options and the final reconfiguration, rather than serving as wallpaper. The world’s rules—film as traversable loop, sky-garden as liminal access—stay internally consistent and are learned through action. The final image of the clock on the bench, chime freed, depends on all this prior environmental work to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, sensorial, and specific—orchids, vanilla tendrils, basalt, monsoon—and consistently filtered through Calyx’s quasi-empirical attention. Crucially, environment isn’t just decorative: the ridge’s erosion, the dream-bower architecture, and the incoming monsoon all constrain what actions are possible and when. The dragon-back geography inside the dream cleverly mirrors the outer world’s geology and the layered memories, reinforcing both stakes and theme. A hair’s breadth more tactile interaction with the physical ridge in the waking world (beyond opening/closing images) would push it to absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The breezy islet after rain, black sand, salt-slick driftwood, wet cedar, and distant diesel create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly tied to memory and forgiveness. The environment is not just decorative: the isolated islet becomes the site where regret is ritualized and literally rooted in the bonsai that remains there. Recurring objects—the compass, lace, bonsai—are spatially clear and deeply charge the final image of teal needles in salt air. It stops just short of perfection because the physical setting rarely constrains options; it mainly mirrors and amplifies interior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Atmosphere is palpable, utilizing specific sensory details ("tasted of rotting orchids," "humidity... guilty conscience") that reinforce the theme of decay. The setting actively constrains the character, forcing her to work by headlamp when the lights fail, integrating the environment into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory anchoring in the "kiln’s last exhale" and "schist still warm." However, the descriptive density sometimes overwhelms the spatial reality, turning the environment into a series of similes ("sky became a blade," "shadow shaped like a wing") rather than a tangible place to navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is a vivid, constraining setting that actively shapes the plot; the frost and silence are palpable opponents turned into tools. The sensory translation of sound to heat is handled with specific, grounded imagery (e.g., the heat-map flaring crimson). The environment feels integral to the epiphany rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional, with specific details like "pages of compacted salt" and "barnacled marble" that actively constrain the protagonist's choices (e.g., needing to burn the salt-pages). The underwater library feels lived-in and governs the logic of the story, charging the final image with significant atmospheric power.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric, with strong sensory details like the "terra-cotta flakes" and "muffled clapper." However, the description occasionally leans into overwrought territory ("open mouth that had forgotten speech"), which distances the reader from the physical reality of the ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct setting is atmospheric and distinct, with the camera obscura providing a strong anchoring device for the surreal elements. However, the sensory descriptions occasionally drift into purple prose ("tasted purple," "scent... felt drinkable") that distracts from the concrete reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but the primary antagonist and mechanism of the plot; the "hyperbolic arrays" and "asymptotic hedges" justify the time dilation perfectly. Sensory details are vivid and specific (chalk, lilies, sap), grounding the abstract concept of "texture of time" in tactile reality. The environment actively constrains the character's movement and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, integrating the carnival setting (cellophane feathers, mirror wall, Tilt-A-Whirl) directly into the plot's tools and atmosphere. The setting effectively pressures the action, though the "mirror wall reflecting truth" borders on heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional; the "sunken orchard" rooted in "lifeboats" is not just atmospheric but thematic, physically constraining the action and charging the final realization. The imagery creates a specific, tactile world that elevates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, effectively blending noir elements with magical realism ("scent of iron and marigolds," "emerald tiles"). The setting feels lived-in and specific, though the description occasionally veers into purple prose ("tears reflecting the moon like spilled mercury").

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the thawing station providing both the physical materials and the central metaphor. Details like the "drip-lines" and "rusted panels" ground the abstract emotional work in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the "rusted library" functioning as a prop graveyard is vivid, atmospheric, and thematically resonant. Details like "skylight clogged with constellations" and the "iron film cases" effectively ground the surreal elements in a tangible, decaying physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is active and distinct, acting as a participant rather than a backdrop; the stones groan and the ridge shifts. The sensory details ("taste of iron," "pebbles that looked like eyes") are vivid and constrain the mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory details like the "frost-rimed gravel" and "pale rainbows" effectively establish a cold, ethereal atmosphere. The setting is vivid, though it functions largely as a static stage for the violin interaction rather than a dynamic environment that complicates the character's physical tasks.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric details like "dust floated like plankton" and the "wet stone" effectively ground the scene in a tangible reality. The setting actively supports the mood, though specific descriptors like "crystal whispering" lean toward the ornamental rather than the structural. The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The garden is atmospheric and active, functioning effectively as a second character that shapes the protagonist's movement. Specific details like the "cracked marbles" and "spider silk" ground the fantasy, though the descriptive reliance on "withered" becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "violet cloud-sea" and "patient spider" imagery establishing a cohesive, melancholic atmosphere. The aviary and the nexus are not just backdrops but active constraints that shape the protagonist's realization and final choice. The sensory details ("chilled honey," "subsonic hum") are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The flooded opera house is atmospheric and vivid, providing a strong grounding for the surreal elements. Specific details like the "splintered podium" and "floating bolts of silk" effectively establish the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The weather station is masterfully integrated, functioning not just as a backdrop but as an extension of the oracle's sensorium (instruments reading "heaviness"). The botanical illustration’s transformation into a topographic map bridges the micro-prop and macro-setting with exceptional dexterity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is visceral and active; the "mineral stink," "damp wool," and "slow Morse" of the dripping water create a tangible atmosphere. The valve wheel functions as a brilliant micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ standard.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Surreal, atmospheric imagery ("shelves folding into wings," "mirror-water") successfully anchors the abstract concept of an erasing library; the setting acts effectively as a consuming pressure on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and anchors the ritual effectively ("Listening Stone," "silver sage"), though the sensory details occasionally lean toward the decorative rather than strictly constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional; the "reclaimed concrete" and "grain hopper" are not just backdrop but active constraints that shape the protagonist’s movement and the final image. The verticality of the silo integrates perfectly with the plot of climbing to find the diaries, and the physical transformation of the walls at the end cements the setting's role as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral to the plot, particularly the use of the Fresnel lens as an enlarger/exposure tool, which is a brilliant synthesis of place and spycraft. Atmospheric details like the "granite spine" and "salt wind" effectively ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specifically rendered ("vaulted ribs," "ultraviolet"), establishing a consistent gothic-weird tone. The "dimensional anchor" concept grounds the abstract action in a physical space, though it leans slightly on jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent—vivid, specific, and functionally integrated into the plot; the glass spire and frozen lake act as the instrument and score, not just a backdrop. The interaction between the character and the environment (scratching the glass, the lake reflecting) is tactile and imaginative.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but acts as a dynamic antagonist; the "temporal papercuts" from the sideways rain actively constrain the protagonist’s movement. The vivid, surreal imagery—falling upward rain, glowing runes—is strictly functional, forcing Kael to navigate the environment tactically rather than just observing it.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cavern setting is vivid and specific, utilizing the protagonist's sensory hierarchy (vibration, touch) effectively. The environment actively constrains and informs the interaction, particularly the use of the floor and drumhead to communicate.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmosphere is generally strong, with grounding details like "wet limestone" and "pigeon feathers" creating a distinct texture. However, the forced insertion of the prompt phrase "layered tranquility" briefly disrupts the sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, using the "olfactory collapse" to create meaningful constraints on the character's behavior. While evocative, some descriptions like "cathedral of invisible colors" lean slightly towards ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sensory work is excellent; the contrast between the tactile "clay walls" and "frayed rope" against the weightless energy beings effectively grounds the central conflict. The grotto functions as both a physical space and a thematic crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is masterfully integrated, functioning as both instrument and antagonist; specific details like "charred mango pits" and "ash-slick mud" ground the surrealism. The environment actively constrains Mara's tactics (using the shipwreck wire, tuning to the drip), charging the final image with exceptional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "amber grotto" and "static" are not just backdrops but active elements that enforce the atmosphere of preserved tension. The sensory details ("fossilized sap," "copper light") effectively mirror the thematic concern of preservation vs. feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is rendered with high-definition sensory specificity that supports the mood; the "salt wind" flapping catalog drawers and the "reflective patches" scattering starlight are vivid and immersive. The atmosphere successfully blends the bureaucratic grit of the wharf with a lyrical, almost magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "cavern orchard" with crystal fruit provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that grounds the magical elements. However, the specific imagery of an "integral sign cradling a heart" disrupts the immersion with an overly literal, almost graphical symbol that clashes with the organic petrification motif.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like "dried blood" oxide and "lavender water" are vivid and specific. However, the repetitive use of the prompt phrase "sapphire hush" (three times) flattens the atmosphere into a checklist artifact rather than an organic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, integrating the "open tower," the "astrolabe," and the sensory details of the "whale migration" effectively. The environment exerts pressure on the character (wind, cold, sound) and grounds the magical elements in concrete physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)

The sensory details are specific and support the tone, though occasionally the descriptions feel slightly ornamental rather than strictly functional.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as both atmosphere and antagonist/protagonist. The "raft city" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("painted prows," "popcorn smoke," "forgotten ferries") that actively constrain and enable the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "catacomb orchard" and shadow-rebuilding church are imaginative, high-concept settings that anchor the surreal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmospheric details like "lavender shadows" and "honeyed beams" effectively ground the futuristic setting and mirror the protagonist's melancholic state.

However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for the action rather than a source of constraints that force tactical improvisation or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The nautilus cathedral is a masterclass in functional setting; specific details like the dew-bead planetarium and the "bioluminescent throat" actively constrain the protagonist’s interaction with memory and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and actively constrains the plot; the dying bulbs and the mechanics of the library drive the urgency. However, the description occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("fossilized sighs"), which threatens to ornament rather than ground the scene.

    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "vine-choked steps" and the "breathing" volcano create a vivid, atmospheric container for the action. The sensory details are specific and grounded (basalt, copper hue), though the "dappled resolve" phrasing is slightly abstract for a physical description.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    The attic setting is atmospheric ("yellowed sonatas," "dust motes"), but it functions primarily as a backdrop for description rather than a source of constraint or tools. The environment does not pressure the character's choices in a dramatized timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is evocative and specific; the "drifting prism terrace" and "weather code hidden in growth rings" provide excellent grounding for the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the thermocline-powered ghost and moon-pipes are not just backdrop but the mechanics of the climax. Specificity is high and sensory details are purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative ("iridescent cave," "singing floor"), creating a strong, surreal atmosphere. However, the description leans heavily on the visual and abstract ("walls flexing like lungs") at the expense of tactile grounding, making the environment feel like a floating stage for metaphors rather than a physical space with constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is visceral and active, with the arcade’s corroded textures and neon reflections grounding the action effectively. The environment is not just scenery but a physical toolkit that constrains and enables the "accident."

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is lush and consistent, establishing a vivid fable-like tone. Specific details like the "moonstone cabochon dust" and "night-blooming datura" ground the magical realism, though the setting functions more as a stage for the dance than a source of complex physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong atmospheric grounding with specific sensory details ("kelp and rust," "black mirror of the pond"). The setting actively facilitates the magical mechanic, though the "prism atrium" phrasing slightly disrupts the physical logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and functional, particularly the "shallow dish of granite" which acts as a necessary constraint for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is masterfully integrated, with ivy and dampness functioning as mechanical parts of the "camera" concept. Only the Q2 cap prevents a higher score for this exceptional synthesis of place and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "prism parapet" and "foxed" mirrors are not just backdrop but integral tools that constrain the action. The atmosphere is consistent, though occasional abstract descriptions like "taller than grief" blur the sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details are vivid but lean heavily on high-fantasy staples (obsidian, silver veins, violet skies) without distinct, grounding particulars. The setting functions largely as an atmospheric backdrop that facilitates the magic, rather than a constraint that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)

The setting serves as a beautiful backdrop but rarely exerts pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "ashen charcoal sanctuary" provides a moody backdrop, but descriptors often tilt into purple prose ("starlight... like frozen tears") rather than grounding the reader in sensory specifics. The setting functions largely as a static stage; while the "scorched circle" is a nice detail, the environment doesn't actively constrain the characters' choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is the mechanical engine of the resolution; the root-cave and fungal network actively constrain and enable the climax rather than serving as backdrop. Specificity (42 hertz, copper spores) creates a vivid, cohesive physical reality that grounds the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "sepia reading room" is vividly realized with consistent atmospheric details like "leather-bound spines" and "dust... like powdered light."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric ("brass teeth," "brown with age"), establishing a strong aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is evocative, with strong visual anchors like the silver-barked trees and the gray vault.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the "throat of stone" and "sour chords" establishing a vivid, specific mood. The harp and tooth serve as effective micro-settings that ground the magic. However, some imagery ("ribs of dawn") strains for effect without adding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is atmospheric, with strong sensory details like "copper and salt" and the swaying catwalks. The constraint of the painting as a portal is well-integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is treated as an active participant—the stone door "exhales," the compass "dissolves," and the rain falls upward.

The "fossil confetti" and "neon graffiti" create a striking, layered texture.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The imagery is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "copper ribs," "soft as sifted ash," and "diluted indigo." The pavilion is atmospheric, though the location remains somewhat floating and disconnected from a tangible world (a "white room" effect common in fables).

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, effectively blending industrial decay with organic sensory details (copper, ozone, apple trees). However, the repetition of the phrase "wild hush" (four times) dulls the specific texture of the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active antagonist; the acid sea and snapping chains function as a "doomsday clock" that forces the protagonist's hand. The specific details—from the master gear timing her breaths to the fizzing iron—are integrated directly into the tactical choices of the scene. This is a model of how to make setting inextricably linked to plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    Descriptions rely on stock fantasy phrases ("dusty back room," "impossible colors," "otherworldly glow") that flatten the atmosphere. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist's choices or tactics. The transition from the realistic shop to the magical cavern is jarringly standard.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details are vivid, particularly the sensory paradox of heat and frost within the grotto. However, the spatial relationship between the "cobalt grotto" and the "ember grotto" is slightly ambiguous—whether they are nested or distinct locations creates momentary friction in visualizing the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "ember nexus" is established with evocative sensory details like "volcanic glass" and "glowing fissures." While the setting provides a vivid backdrop, it functions more as atmospheric staging than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    While there are brief sensory details (lavender and sulfur), the setting is largely generic ("crumbling archway," "soot-stained walls") and functions as a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "timeless observatory" is a vivid, imaginative setting that successfully grounds the abstract premise.

    The setting is excellent, with sensory details like "dust motes floated like slow constellations" and "velvet offcuts" grounding the atmosphere. The repair shop feels lived-in and functions well as a crucible for the scene. The "lightning forked" moment adds dramatic pressure, though the pathetic fallacy is slightly standard.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, blending the mechanical ("gears the size of whales") with the corrosive ("acid spray," "pink peels"). The environment actively constrains the characters—the acid sea necessitates the glider, and the rusted buoy shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with evocative details like "crystal blocks" and the scorched patch. However, the atmosphere relies partly on standard cyberpunk tropes (neon, static, dying hard drives) rather than strictly unique sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the lighthouse orchard with mirrors on trees above ice floes is vivid, specific, and functionally integrated into the magic system. The atmosphere successfully balances the surreal with the physical danger of the cracking ice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively using the &quot;drift-ice marina&quot; to mirror internal states. Details like the &quot;plates of sea that groaned&quot; establish a strong, sensory world, though some descriptions lean toward the abstractly poetic over the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is evocative and anchors the mood well; the "amber pavilion" and "coppered vines" create a specific, sensory-rich atmosphere. The physical details of the crushed leaves and the station lights ground the abstraction of the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "kinetic parapet" and "murmuring pavilion" create a distinct, atmospheric setting. The interplay between the shifting stones and the desert environment effectively grounds the abstract magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, successfully grounding the magical realism in the physical textures of rust, lavender, and honey. The setting actively participates in the ritual, though the descriptions occasionally verge on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting establishes a consistent atmosphere with "dust motes" and "shadows," but relies on generic library tropes that do not constrain the character's choices. The "last dictionary" provides backdrop but doesn't exert immediate physical or social pressure. Specificity improves with the "pressed snowdrop," but the environment is largely a passive container for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "crushed VHS cases" and "fog sculptures" create a tactile, surreal environment that directly constrains the character's movement. The sensory details—the scent of oxide, the metallic taste of fog—effectively ground the abstract concept.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The surreal conceit of an observatory above clouds on the moon is vivid and thematically integrated, serving the metaphor of the station as a camera. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, forcing the final escape.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    The "cloud-level" setting is not just scenery; it actively charges the metaphors ("scattered embers," "cumulus cities") and the final image of the lightning bolt. The sensory details ("smelled of bleach and resignation," "warm plastic") are visceral and tightly woven into the therapeutic method.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the observatory’s brass rings and the "spoon-smeared" sky are not just backdrop but the active tools used to resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("bruised mint and iron," "sundial carved from a vertebra"). The environment actively participates in the story, reacting to the protagonist’s choices and grounding the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is active and distinct, with the grotto’s "calcite veins" and mist responding to the protagonist’s actions. Sensory details are vivid ("salt-sweet breath," "emerald gloom"), though occasionally adjective-heavy. The environment participates in the ritual rather than just hosting it, which is a strong feature.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vividly realized with strong sensory details ("moss-covered USB," "emerald carpets"), creating a coherent atmospheric container. However, the description occasionally drifts into ornamentation ("jeans-torn knees of urban explorers") that slows momentum rather than constraining the characters' choices or raising the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "feral nexus" is an evocative, constraint-driven setting that actively pressures the protagonist. The sensory details are vivid ("mist tasted of salt and wet paper"), though the density of meta-fictional imagery is extremely high.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on lush, static description ("moss-covered," "verdant arbor") that slows momentum. While the environment is established, it functions more as a stage set than a source of constraints or tools that Elara must actively navigate during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is not just backdrop but an active constraint; the subarctic cold and the need for silence directly pressure the alchemist's choices (preventing combustion). The imagery of "boots pressing frost into perfect circles" grounds the magical premise in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmospheric and functional; the cavern’s specific properties (mirror-like marble, time delays) are not just set dressing but the tools Ansel uses to solve the plot. Sensory details are vivid and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exceptional; the "bronze grotto" acts as an antagonist, with the cooling metal and recursive reflections actively constraining the protagonist's choices. The environment physically manifests the theme (recursion/trapping) and the final image of the solidified light charges the setting with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory specificity is a strength; tools like the "chisel ground from an old tent stake" and smells of "sawdust and thunder" organically merge the setting with the character's past. The loft serves as a functional crucible for the internal work.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but an active tool; the cloudwater screen and obsidian mare are essential to the narrative mechanics. Sensory details are vivid and specific ("smells of salt and burnt sugar," "silver glass"), grounding the surrealism in tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    Setting details are vivid but often obscured by overwrought descriptions ("Möbius confession," "rust landscaped") that prioritize sound over sense. The atmosphere is established, though the spatial geography of the repairs becomes vague under the weight of metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, functioning effectively as a pressure cooker for Arlen’s decision. Descriptions like "flagstones jeweled" and "dome lay cracked like a skull" establish a strong mood, though the imagery occasionally drifts into decorative excess that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the fulgurite rope serving as an excellent micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's physical actions. The sensory details ("creaked like whale-bone," "melted silica") effectively ground the mythic tone in physical reality. The environment actively shapes the mood and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting functions adequately as a mood piece but relies on generic genre markers ("shadowed garden," "pale fingers," "bare branches") rather than singular, textured observation. The environment serves as a passive container for the ritual rather than an active force that constrains the traveler's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and structurally integral; the suspended nature of the palace directly enables the "fall" ending. Details like "wept rust" and the "punched-in sky" successfully establish a cohesive, atmospheric world.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and central to the ritual, but the descriptions often veer into purple prose ("clouds... drifted like kelp," "obsidian lagoon"). The reliance on heavy metaphorical filtering distances the reader from the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central image of the paused geese and frozen wings is vivid and effectively anchors the atmosphere. However, the allegorical naming convention ("Fountain of First Lies," "Fountain of Last Goodbyes") reduces the setting to generic abstraction, missing the opportunity for specific, lived-in sensory details that would ground the magic in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "nebula garden" is established with vivid, inventive sensory details like "ionized gas petals" and "hydrogen blossoms." The setting successfully constraints the action and serves as a physical manifestation of the central conflict (roots vs. light).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "thundering calm" of the greenhouse effectively grounding the magical elements. Specific details like the poem-wrapped chrysalises and the oak tree piercing the glass create a strong, memorable sense of place that supports the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is an active antagonist; the "obsidian ridge" narrowing each year creates a ticking clock independent of the tower’s gears. The integration of mechanical specificity with the surreal landscape grounds the high-concept premise in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's standout feature; the juxtaposition of a municipal cemetery with a glass-roofed missile silo is inventive and vividly rendered. Specific details like the "marble lamb" and "cobalt silo" ground the magical realism effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with "nectar dusk" and the copper tower creating a specific, cohesive atmosphere. The physical verticality of the tower effectively constrains the action, forcing the protagonist’s ascent and isolating the climax. The imagery is rich, though occasionally borders on density fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, acting almost as a character itself. Sensory details like "shingles bleaching from cedar" and "salt and cedar blood" effectively ground the magical elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is essential rather than ornamental; the orchard’s composition (cedar, bamboo) provides the specific tools used to solve the climax. Atmospheric details like the "salt-curled parchment" and "turquoise" flash grounded the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the shell-atlas, turtle tremors, and oxidized watchers constrain the method of inquiry and the final navigational pivot. The environment actively shapes the climax rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct ("sandstone walls," "amber light") but remains a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. While the imagery is consistent, the environment does not force the characters to alter their tactics or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "cobalt terrace" and "eroded sculptures" effectively mirroring the themes of memory and loss. However, the world logic wavers with the "prophetic" driftwood carving, which clashes with the otherwise grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset; the mist, salt, and "bruised dawn" create a palpable, pressure-filled container for the action. The setting actively constrains the characters (wind erasing sound, mist hiding armies), integrating perfectly with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The image of navigating by utility poles ("prayers offered by electricians") is strong and specific. However, the setting is frequently obscured by relentless metaphorical overwriting; the physical reality of the cold water and the kayak often dissolves into similes before it can establish a tactile ground.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory detail is evocative and tightly integrated, with the "ribs of dead cruisers" and "engine shrine" grounding the metaphysical stakes in physical reality. The environment actively participates in the plot mechanics, particularly how the ship's buoyancy responds to the protagonist's emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.0)
    Visuals are vivid (obsidian, glass cave), but the setting operates on dream logic where physical rules bend for the protagonist's safety. Sensory details frequently lapse into abstraction ("smelled of... forgotten promises"), weakening the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the blackout and moonlight are not just atmospheric but create the constraints for the lock-picking sequence. The "Ministry of Ink" and "sky-barges" offer vivid, consistent world-building that grounds the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details—the aurora, the pulsing star dust, the mathematical spirals—are vivid and establish a strong, dreamlike tone. However, the inconsistent application of the world's primary rule (the loss of friction) undermines the setting's credibility, oscillating between magical stasis and physical slipperiness without a coherent governing logic.

The environment meaningfully shapes tactics, from hiding the coffee tin to using the warped books as fuel.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting shifts from the gritty station to the surreal tidal arbor are vivid and distinct. The environment actively shapes the plot, particularly how the film world functions as a literalization of her memory, though the adjective density occasionally borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting acts as both the stakes and the antagonist; the "dragon's back" metaphor in the dream sequence effectively physicalizes the abstract concept of collective memory. Sensory details like "darkness that tasted of orchids and iron" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that constrains the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse as micro-setting constrains every move—humidity “like a guilty conscience,” pane giving way, cold water sluicing across gloves. The portable synchrotron “no larger than a lunchbox” functions as second setting, its glow the only light at climax. Weather and tool together charge the final image where Mara chooses to “watch the storm arrive, minute by minute.” One hairline slip: galvanized steel taste is dropped once and never re-weights.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frost, schist warmth, glass beads, and canyon walls actively constrain tactics: frost reveals timing, beads mark a reversible trail, obsidian pays passage. Sensory economy is POV-filtered (“air so cold it rang,” “kiln’s last exhale”) and never stalls momentum. The final image of desert flats and blank bus sign mirrors her internal blank slate, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conservatory’s frost, glass dust, and residual thermal ghosts constrain movement and supply the literal canvas for Mara’s notation. Body-as-setting counts: numb palms, fogged breath, and knee-bruises from striking forks limit how long she can play. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bench → stage → dome tracked without drift. The tuning-fork case evolves from flotation device to painter’s box, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The broken lens and coral desk function as micro-setting: they physically constrain action—he must fit the shard, fold boats, accept the tentacle. Barnacled marble boulevards and salt corridors are sensuous, specific, and mirrored in the “interval between heartbeats” internal state. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder descent, northeast aisle, brass octopus tether. Weather is the water itself, pressing every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Terra-cotta arbor, rattling cart wheels, sage scent through broken tiles—details are filtered through Mara’s vendor-strategy gaze, never touristic. The ridge silhouette engraved on the bell fuses setting and tool, constraining the exodus spiral countdown. Spatial choreography is clean: alley loops, doorway drops, ridge climb track without drift. Environment silently governs tactics—no speech could travel farther than sage-scented dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Twilight viaduct, wisteria-choked arches, and drinkable purple air are micro-setting that directly constrains the breathing ritual and final door. River-fog functions as both mood and conceptual solvent for unused love. Camera-obscura’s ground-glass becomes a portable staging ground—setting-as-tool that charges the closing image when it vanishes. Spatial choreography (para­pet, arch, orchard beyond) tracks cleanly; no landmark overkill.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The living bridge garden is not backdrop but instrument: hyperbolic yew vectors force her backward gait, hawthorn hourglass literally pinches time’s flow. Micro-setting of the halo pressed to bark becomes the final scalpel that rewrites the garden’s anatomy. Spatial choreography is immaculate—footprints fill with past selves, planks curl like burning film—each image tracks. Environment constrains the final choice: root-for-veins price is impossible without the vegetal architecture already grown.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is the crucible: cracked mirror wall, buckled door, netting of stuffed dragons—every carnival relic is weaponized to impede the guards or guide her hand. The Tilt-A-Whirl hatch and dry soil beneath are not backdrop but the tactical objective whose texture she presses seeds into with reverence. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: first groan of concrete, cellophane flash, dust rolling like brass music—perception narrows to immediacies. Spatial choreography tracks clean from mirror wall to netting tangle to operator booth; no impossible positions or floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forge’s lavender coals and the lifeboat-hulls-as-planters constrain Mara’s tactical choice—she must press flesh to iron to complete the imprint—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: sound-color synesthesia filters every descriptor, no tourist catalog. Micro-setting (obsidian flake cooling at her feet) literalizes the cost and is handled on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Emerald tiles, marigold scent, and the bench-by-platform layout remain coherent and constrain movement. The flower stall as cipher-generator is a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays filtered through the thief’s professional eye (coded petals, clinking jar). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the kneel-handoff-projection sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The console room’s metallic hiss and sliding ice function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice—fuel harvested from chair, glass curved against iron struts. Cardamom scent and mercury vapors are filtered through Mara’s glassblower bias (smell = batch ingredient, metallic = colorant). Final image marries environment and body: silver puddles reflect a sky “free of winter’s clamp,” literalizing the thaw as both weather and heart. Setting charges closure without ever describing walls.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted library’s iron-shelf vertebrae and perforated skylight actively guide choices—row numbering points to the drainage alcove; the roof holes become literal apertures for the climactic projection. Micro-setting (the child’s cast as palimpsest) functions as map and mirror, constraining decryption tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Leo notices rain-smudged autographs and dry-ballpoint indentations because stunt-work survival once depended on such details. Only minor slip: “studio backlot” appears once without earlier geographic cue, a hairline orientation jolt.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a micro-instrument: the fort’s stones groan under absent banners, the flaking booklet sheds gold continents, the last star’s tear stains skin with extinct-sun temperature—each detail constrains the next mark she can make. Spatial choreography is flawless: parapet → crenels → stairwell echo → door recursion. Weather never arrives, caught in amber, which becomes the world-rule; this taught pattern pays off when the fort liquefies into rumor. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and mineral, mirroring her fossilization lesson. Environment directly supplies the ink (ambered hush) and the paper (blankness beneath scripture), charging the final threshold image.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen courtyard functions as both crucible and clock: frost crunches under wheels, steam spirals mark elapsed time, the violin’s ice strings literally constrain the only possible music. Micro-setting—violin as “transparent,” “ice crystal,” “stone bench”—is re-accessed each loop, letting tiny variations accumulate. Final image of mop-traced pathways shows environment being rewritten by attention. Slight over-reliance on visual; a single auditory or haptic spike earlier could have tightened the sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is immediately anchored and re-enters the final sweep, charging the “resonant hush.” The missing lens micro-setting constrains action twice—search, then projection—earning the high-band gate. Sensory selection stays urgent: wet-stone smell, dust like plankton, rag-wrapped glass. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden is not backdrop but active agent—hedges part, tree bows, glove waits—constraining every choice. Micro-setting (the cracked marbles, spider-silk cloth) functions as tactile maps of memory; their warmth after touching the apple charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and taste, mirroring Elara’s vocation. Spatial choreography is flawless: maze walls track cleanly, distance collapses only when the garden wills it. One hairline slip: “impossible apple” is slightly generic; a cultivar name or scent note would have nailed 9.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the floating opera program and violin case act as tactile pivots that constrain choices (pages warp → new images → next descent). Lantern shimmer on black water mirrors his flickering self-definition; debris choreography stays trackable. Sensory economy favors sound and touch—splinters, lapping water, “jellyfish” silk—rather than panoramic visuals. Final image—stage edge at dawn—re-charges all prior flooded spaces with new acoustic possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s tools—barograph hairline, anemometer cups clacking like rosary—constrain her tactics: she reads margins others discard. Body-as-setting functions when cold “occupies margins between organs,” guiding her final stance. The blanked illustration charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate. Only the torn silhouette remains, making the setting irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel is never catalogued; instead its damp breath, rail temperature, and hatch draft guide Mara’s bodily decisions—she steadies on the rail, presses ear to rim, climbs toward dawn. The beaded wheel itself functions as micro-setting: its glinting “rosary” nipples cue her mother’s faith, while its hidden chamber literally contains the stakes. Spatial choreography is pristine—wheel half-buried, lifted, rolled, then left upright spinning—every object state alters tactics and is trackable. Environment constrains the final image: only this rusted culvert could let her abandon proof yet leave it gyroscopically balancing in the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    The library is not backdrop but agent: shelves fold into cranes, catalog drawers sigh, parchment regenerates into blankness. Micro-setting objects—origami swan, obsidian-scaled book—force the final choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys keeper’s vocation: ink scent, moss-laced parchment, candlelight shafts that never reach floor. Spatial choreography is crisp; the circular reading pit and mirror-water constrain the exact step that costs her corporeal form.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sage Ridge is rendered with chiaroscuro specificity—silver sage, warmed slab, ant-frozen trails—each detail filtering through Elara’s tuner-ear. The ridge itself breathes with her, a micro-setting that literally supplies the Listening Stone as instrument and conduit; removing it collapses the ritual. Eclipse mechanics are compressed yet accurate, and the children’s valley is sketched only where it refracts back up the slope. One hairline slip: “dreaming roots” stays poetic but never constrains tactics, so capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reclaimed silo library is more than postcard: its conveyor-spiral, hopper, and bare concrete bay dictate her physical path and final ritual; the dragons imprint the curvature of the silo itself, making the setting an active vessel that re-centers the world. Sensory selection favors cooled ember, graphite dust, copper glow—details filtered through her archivist hungers. Micro-setting (the blank concrete stretch) becomes the necessary canvas for closure; without it the transfer could not occur. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lighthouse, rocky spine, and hollow bolt function as micro-setting that constrains tactics (exposure by beam, smuggling inside bolt). Final image—“submerged spine of the island hummed”—recharges prior lithophone motif. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV priorities: Chen notices tide-strike pitches, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary’s echo-physics is vividly particular: stone ribs flexing like whale bones, null-air pockets, ultraviolet silence that tints absence. These micro-setting details directly constrain tactics—sound subtraction becomes weaponized space—so the environment charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single scene; no impossible positions or prop drift. The fold-in-space rule is consistent and learned through action, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell are not backdrop but instrument: the spire becomes an organ pipe, the lake a soundboard, the shell a baton—environment literally constrains the symphony she conducts. Sensory hierarchy obeys her composer-perceiver bias: sound and refraction dominate, smell (ink/yeast) arrives as Proustian trigger. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her climb, etch, kneel, raise hands without drift. Micro-setting qualifies: the shell’s fractured edge is the stylus that scores glass and rewrites her temporal exile.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The glowing viaduct, neon-algae bones, and gravity-reversed rain are not backdrop but tactical terrain: the upward rain cuts Kael’s coat into leaking yesterdays, the cobalt glow provides the only light by which to read the runes, and the final ordinary down-fall marks the price paid. The tablet itself becomes micro-setting when its crumbling edge slices Kael’s palm, forcing the decision to smash it. Spatial choreography is flawless across the seventeen shrinking arches. 9+ gate passed: the viaduct’s inverted gravity literally shapes the smash-or-don’t-smash choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cedar-dust motes, goatskin lakes, and pedal-lathe hush are filtered through Mara’s vibration-seeking POV; the brass phonograph’s “broken wing” and the jagged spark of the snapped needle constrain her crafting choice. Micro-setting (the needle itself) charges the final image when its worn smoothness hangs against her sternum. Cold season seeps through stone fissures, guiding her underground quest; weather stays causal, never postcard. Spatial choreography is immaculate—bodies, bench, turntable, drum frame track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard, shaft, and ghost-grid zone are anchored by 120 words and re-employed: gargoyle eye opens the shaft, lichen map redraws stakes, rain finally falls ungauged—charging the closure. Sensory triage matches Elara’s instrument bias—sound of boots, smell of wet limestone, pulse of lichen—rather than tourist catalog. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: ultraviolet panels click on schedule, engineered fungi digest scent, and the orchid itself grafts new metallic notes onto Lira’s perfume—each detail constrains or enables Elian’s grieving ritual. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the vial moves from coat pocket to railing to root with no ghosted positions. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elian notices iron, meteor dust, the salt of a neck after dancing—never a tourist catalog. The final image of “crystal shadows of fragrance” recharges every prior glow.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Terra-cotta grotto, clay finger impressions, starlight color of dried blood—details are selective, sensory, filtered through poet-perception. The rope functions as micro-setting: its braid pattern, county-jail origin, and frayed strands constrain tactical choice and return charged in the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the grotto chambers and the exit onto the road. Environment never stalls momentum; each descriptor is knotted to action or decision pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse–shipwreck microcosm is tactile, olfactory, sonic; condensation pings off broken panes and ship bells answer as percussion. Every descriptive swipe either limits movement (ash-slick footing) or gifts material (frayed rigging wire becomes bridge). The seedling unfurling against copper dawn is the charged final image that reweights all prior ruin. Only the durian/orchid name-drops feel slightly tourist-catalogue, not choice-shaping, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is never postcard; it constrains choice—fossilized sap pool forces chemist to station himself, resin air slows Lira’s breath, cooling stone hastens her kneel. Static electricity is treated as environmental physics, not ornament, guiding the spark of recognition. Micro-setting inside her coat—hidden vials—functions as portable geography that ruptures mid-transformation. Final palm-to-ground tactile beat recharges the grotto’s copper light into stone-cold indifference, anchoring cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Salt wind flapped the card catalog drawers like gull wings” fuses body, tool, and atmosphere; the derelict Wharf of the Lanterns (existing only on obsolete charts) literally constrains where they can moor and forces the hand-off to an NGO vessel. Micro-setting (reflective patches scattering starlight, lantern-beam as baton) charges the final image and links to Lyra overhead, sustaining spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Obsidian arbor’s warmth at altitude and mercury that stays wet for days are concrete, rule-setting details; the orchard’s tonal shift from dusk-minor to major key mirrors Lira’s internal re-keying. Micro-setting—the arbor surface etched with names—literally receives her breath-glyph, binding body, tool, and final image. Spatial track clean: lip → threshold → moonstone paths → crystal trunk wider than a house. No orientation drift; sensory hierarchy skews to touch and sound, apt for a sculptor.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rooftop canal, living wisteria bridge, iron aviary of clock-hands: every landmark either funnels physical movement or supplies the mechanism for time-repayment. Infinity pendant and limestone lip serve as micro-settings that gate the decisive trade. Spatial choreography stays continuous; no floating rooms or white-space.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cavern orchard is immediate and tactile—calcite fruit chiming under boots—while the mosaic stepping-stone operates as micro-setting that literally opens the plot; the brass astrolabe’s dent “where grief had pressed” is the charged object that seeds the final image. Spatial tracking stays clean from orchard floor to forked trunk to stalactite target.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Library is rendered as a vertical stack of micro-terrains: copper pipes that once carried steam now carry breath, biography aisles that double as acoustic funnels. The ferromagnetic flake itself becomes a tactile setting shard—its oxide “dried-blood” surface lets us feel the room’s humidity and history in one touch. Spatial choreography is flawless; every reel’s journey (pipe chase → knothole → floor gap) is trackable in 3-D. Light is used as topography: sapphire emergency glow = ceiling plane; candle = table plane; darkness = crawl-space plane, all intersecting at the moment of visibility. The environment literally channels sound upward, forcing the final choice to surface.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse is tactile and selective: water pooling in ancient trellis crevices, leaves curling inward, storm patterns mirrored in silver veins. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s scientific lens—she notices pH meters before her own pulse—so description never feels touristic. The mossy trellis recurs as both anchor and final architecture, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (her scarring skin) literally constrains the metamorphosis, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Basalt causeway, half-drowned monastery, and salt-stained frescoes are filtered through sleepless painter’s eye—color values shift with tide and exhaustion. Rain trails function as tactile pathfinding device, guiding feet and decision alike. Brooch acts as micro-setting: amber depths constrain attention and later warm against skin to cue buried spirals. Spatial choreography survives the tidal flux; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cave is not backdrop but antagonist: every footstep is a note in an ever-thickening score, and the lake that drinks light to return music directly enables the memory-expansion beat. The vanished entrance in the final image is a literal constraint that charges the pilgrim’s burden. Micro-setting (the treble-clef scar) re-weights the body itself as setting.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivory harbor’s rain-slick cobblestones, ozone gutters, and cliff cemetery fog act as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply emotional palette; the trumpet itself becomes portable setting/tool hybrid. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: salt crust, wet hemp, weathered copper—every detail either impedes or enables the next beat. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → kiosk → conservatory gate → cemetery → pier-end; no impossible positions or floating rooms. Environment is not backdrop but mnemonic surface—every surface records what was removed—charging the final sonic image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Starlit vault, cedar mist, and punch-as-tool constrain every step; the final blank canvas flips the tunnel into observatory roof—setting reconfigures meaning. Micro-setting (punch, cracks, vaulted mist) doubles as pressure device. One minor over-label: “starlit vault” used three times without new angle.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is micro-scaled to body, tile, notebook, astrolabe—each object constrains choice. Tower walls turn “porous,” a literal pressure valve that lets salt air rewrite her glasses; this environmental breach charges the final image. Whale breaths supply time-metered diegetic music, merging with parchment “crests” to make setting co-author of score. Only omit: astronomic specificity (which constellation?) could have tightened one more turn.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escondite folds act as both macro-environment and micro-setting: walls “remember every footstep,” floor curls into Möbius strip, constraining Vey’s path toward the door. Solar ions braid through lattice, turning corridors choral—weather literally guides choice by anchoring mutiny timing. Body-as-setting appears when magnetic field hooks “iron boredom in his blood,” fusing interior geography to station architecture. Final wooden door charges the image of unruled darkness, reprising the “simple” threshold that infinity fears.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prep room is not backdrop but tool: formaldehyde+lilac scent narrows Cassidy’s gut, the bone saw foreshadows amputation of memory, fluorescent flicker externalizes the policy breach. Stainless-steel counter and eyelid-weight drawers supply tactile resources that constrain how she handles the ink. Spatial choreography is clean; the ink pot never drifts off-stage.

Zeppelin altitude and dune-sheet sigh are economical yet specific, anchoring the erg as both tomb and pulpit. Beach debris—urchin spines, kelp spiral—functions as micro-setting that encodes memory, directly shaping the parley mechanics. Missing the 9-band because the floating library itself is only glimpsed, never allowed to exert spatial pressure on the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The paper-lantern ribs, shredded ledgers, and salt wind are not backdrop but tooling: the alchemist folds newspapers into kite-bones, mixes ashes with seawater for ink, uses copper wire from dead telegraph lines. These micro-objects constrain every tactical choice; removing them collapses the ritual. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—he smells sulfur brine, ignores visual skylines, notices tide only when ash needs wetting. Spatial choreography is flawless: rooftop → well → flagpole → dunes, each location recycled with altered state (lantern aloft, ledger soaked, bottle buried).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound atrium is not mere backdrop; its frost geometry, starlight, and reversing fountain constrain every gesture.

Living stone pillars that weep scented resin charge the final image as they vibrate like struck bells. Micro-setting supremacy: orchard breathes as single lung, redefining “temple” as synapse.</answer>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interspecies treaty before death—tightens through each conductive graft; bats roosting and fox kits returning embody narrowing options that must satisfy non-human judges. Mara’s agency is continuous: every copper wrap is a deliberate bid for recognition, not symbolic wish. Six-month countdown stays implicit, but “final renovation” header and ladder descent for last time make temporal cost legible. Visible price: her name/pulse sacrificed to orchard’s perpetual 24-beat rhythm—human heart cedes authority.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</question><comment>Theme emerges from circuitry, not sermon: interspecies respect is soldered in sap and ore, never articulated as homily. Diary page becoming conductor literalizes memory transmuted into shared infrastructure—wisdom as electrical protocol. Final blue sparks smelling of chamomile reprice the premise: paradise is not tended but rewired, relinquished. Reader left sensing treaty encoded in heartbeat, not moral—resonance without dictum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering gallery is not a postcard; its acoustics literally guide choice—stone throats soften consonants, forcing Mara to keep walking sentences aloud. The missing-pawn chessboard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final decision: only hierarchies remain, so the archive must be the board itself. Light is used surgically ("lantern glow" vs "nomadic penumbra") rather than painted across every surface. Sensory hierarchy narrows to taste and sound under crisis, matching the POV’s危机-trained alertness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but actor: shelves slide, thunder hoarded between pages finally ruptures. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she reads spines by crow-feel, not sight.

    The loft, skylight, and measuring tape function as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move—grid lines dictate where she steps. Rain droplets become barometric data, streetlights project upside-down tickers; environment is inseparable from method. No spatial drift; body, cards, tape, and footprints track cleanly. Tool-as-setting easily passes the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lost civilization archive is evoked through taste (copper tears), sound (screaming equations), and haptic detail (bronze facets pulse), all filtered through the historian’s biased attention. The archive’s defensive algorithms and memory chambers constrain her movement, forcing the “avoiding patterns” tactic; the pagoda’s multiplying reflections charge the final locket image. Spatial choreography is coherent across the single continuous scene. Environment, body, and tool (veil, pagoda) triple-function as setting, qualifying for 9+ gate; slight shortfall is the abstracted garden flashback that momentarily floats outside POV-filter.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass balcony, orchid-walls exhaling perfume, and the stone-as-planet micro-setting constrain every choice; the library’s archived-dream pollen literally forces Mira’s final stance. Spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene. Weather is absent, but the “rain that will never fall again” is evoked as lost possibility—an economical, POV-filtered detail that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Misty workshop under stars functions as micro-setting that constrains ritual: the iron stove, cedar table, refrigerated drawer supply the only possible sequence of purge-and-rebuild. Tail-tip circle acts as object-as-setting, charging the final plaque. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Weather (fog, night chill) mirrors internal dulling then clearing. 9+ gate met: cedar plaque reconfigured from setting object to ethical compass.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower room’s frost, stone, and coffee rings function as micro-setting that literally softens under palm to admit the downward root journey—environment directly constrains the climactic choice. Sensory hierarchy favors taste and touch (iron, lilac, loam) over visual catalog, mirroring medical aftermath and vegetal invasion. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hourglass displaced by seed on sill, meteor hush thickens into ordinary morning, no floating props. The osage sapling’s single green seed on the sill charges the final image, reweighting the entire spiral.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—trade fresh loss to release the buried miracle—tightens when the xylem demands “fresh loss” and the protagonist slices the scar, paying blood syllables. Escalation is textural: each brown coffee ring becomes a vertebra, the tunnel deepens, the miracle swells until the red-sand hourglass flips—visible price alters temporal axis. Agency is renunciation rather than conquest; the seed-ingestion endures cost rather than solving it. No coincidence resolves tension; the buried light is freed only by her offered wound.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Projection booth micro-setting actively constrains action—sprockets thread Mara’s fingers, balcony door yields only after the film strip is scratched. Selective sensory hierarchy (nitrate scent, velvet nap, monochrome beam) mirrors emotional narrowing. The orb and cigarette case function as extensions of the booth, charging the final image. Environment is not backdrop but surgical tool.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    The brass equatorial mount functions as micro-setting: every screw and frost-rimed latitude scale constrains her dismantling choices and ultimately becomes the constellation that receives her dissolved body. Aurora-lit snow refuses to adhere to the dark-glass circle—an environmental echo of the rewritten creative law. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she reads meteors like Braille, tastes scissors’ metallic sting, priorities filtered through an astronomer-artist’s synesthesia.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Chess clock, scorched strongbox, and phosphorescent poppies recur as micro-settings that constrain choice: clock planted face-down becomes the pivot on which time splits. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—guard notices weight of phantom boxcars, not tourist visuals. Spatial choreography is immaculate: upslope pull, kneel, plant, step back. Final image of lantern-children marching along horizon recharges every prior glow mention with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Mechanical rainforest is evoked through selective, pressure-driven detail: quartz roots underfoot, mercury brook reflecting splintered selves, binary banyan steam—each constrains movement or perception. Body-as-setting (pocketed gear warm as sparrow) charges the final renunciation. Spatial choreography survives the spiral-kapok ascent without drift. One minor weather cliché (“silver gear” moon) does not scar closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    The veiled ridgeway is rendered through mist, dew, lantern pools and shifting footprints; these tactile specifics guide the search and mirror the hound’s disorientation. The shoreline lullaby tone infuses environment, anchoring cause in atmosphere rather than exposition. Micro-setting (ticket punch, stamp) constrains the final beat; spatial choreography stays clean despite one impossible “edge of a cliff that shouldn’t exist” that is deliberately dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt walls, meltwater constellations, and bolt’s iron memory act as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the ending image. Selective sensory filters—metallic air, frost-lashed lashes—mirror the bellhop’s narrowed life. Spatial choreography stays clean: staircase, ward, courtyard track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.5)
    The library is not backdrop but hydraulic system: spines crack, gutters press pellets, dust motes rise into a coronet that dissolves—every surface exerts choice-pressure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (the titan smells rust where pages forget meaning). The iron pellet functions as micro-setting; its mite-size and iron-gall chemistry constrain how it can be hidden and later weaponized. Final image of shelves “an inch closer to earth” is a physical echo of the cosmological rebalancing, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lagoon, submersible, carved limestone ridge—each is sketched with sensory economy; seafloor “shaved clean of life” both mirrors Mira’s desolation and physically guides her to the slot. The station itself functions as micro-setting: its stilts, ladder, and hatch constrain her solitude and later enable the dive. Salty atlas fragment and sonar-capped pillars carry the final image; without them the reef-reveal stalls. One minor slack: “projected light—an entire ecosystem reassembled” could use a concrete sensory pin prior to the hologram fade.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Repair bay acts as textured crucible: cracked ferrocrete, ruptured fuel line, rusted sigil each enable her next move. The vintage opera glasses recur as micro-setting, constraining perception and finally focusing sunlight to spark ignition. Twin suns’ razor-margin light is tracked across every surface, tightening time. Spatial choreography is immaculate—crane jib, hatch, launch pad angles stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Volcanic basalt grotto, 52-degree mineral swirl, and thermophilic moss bloom are not backdrop but tactical engine: temperature threshold enables the rewrite, pollen disables the guard. Body-as-setting—her cane of bombing debris, blouse heartbeat-vial—constrains climb and concealment. Sensory hierarchy (heat before sight, chlorophyll before sound) mirrors POV’s vegetal telepathy. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from lantern-lit parade to submerged basin and back, no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dragon’s-blood pine resin that seals the photo is the micro-setting that literally bonds memory to living tissue, constraining the final choice to remain on the cliff. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: salt-eucalyp-tears layered in three-second anchors mirror the narrowing of breath under grief. Weather and tide are not backdrop but countdown—the wind “tearing paper” cues the moment the photo is surrendered. One minor over-lyric—“ancient patience” skirts cliché—else everything is tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse-library merges micro-setting tools: cracked mirror shard count equals tarot fragments, binding body, object, and architecture. Negative-space portrait reframes sensory hierarchy—visual artist forced to feel salt, mildew, stone. Spatial choreography survives collapse sequence; no impossible positions. Environment directly constrains final choice—only the drowning can open the painted door—earning 9-scope but caps at 8.8 because sea-welcoming beat is slightly under-detailed.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sandstone corridors, eclipse warmth, and drone-wing wind are tactile and selective, filtering through Kael’s tracker gaze. The ink fractals and hourglass symbol serve as micro-setting that directly shapes the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment constrains—ink dries faster in drone-wind, forcing quicker decisions—meeting the 9+ gate requirement even if not yet at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass columns, falling snow, and hissing copper shaft are tactile constraint machines, not décor. Snow melting on live copper supplies both sensory immediacy and a literal short-circuit clock. The atlas-quadrant hatch orients spatial choreography; every meter crawled costs skin and time. Final red-blue-white aurora reconfigures the same snow as public spotlight—setting becomes the scandal’s projector.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cracked dome, warm sand, torn canvas, and rose canes cohere as micro-setting that constrains every action; the greenhouse becomes a crucible where destruction is metabolized. Sensory hierarchy follows Mira’s gardener bias—scent, soil temperature, petal hue—never tourist catalog. Final image of canvas weave in burnished-copper petal could not occur without this exact glass-enclosed desert pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The garden, spike, and constellations are not backdrop but tactical instruments: sonic vines recoil, spike splits sound bed, stars drain into fissure. Every descriptor is filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias—sound melts at knees, iron remembers marriage of force and stillness—so setting constrains her moves and charges the final image. Sensory economy is severe (no tourist catalog), yet lavender reeds, indigo longing, and warm iron create vivid specificity. Meets 9+ gate: environment directly shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.1)
    The copper dome, slit roof, and clockwork projector are not backdrop but instruments: mirror angles rewrite microfiche below, slate floor catches starlight to become parchment. The observatory’s acoustic echo is a tactile pressure that softens after the crack, making the final descent audibly lighter. Micro-setting supremacy: the antique stylus slot accepts only her grandfather’s nib, a dimensional constraint that decides tactics. No slips; world rules consistent; the sky itself is the palimpsest.

Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, rake, sprinkle, fling—no impossible positions. Environmental rules remain consistent: the hush thickens as material is added, then disperses when the mandala is scattered.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shattered sky and heat-fractured Merciful Judge mosaic are not backdrop but constraint: the cracked star-pattern literally guides finger placement, determining the final image. Micro-setting (tessera in pouch, stepping stone under knee) supplants broad vista, fitting 700-word scope. Sensory hierarchy—glass edges, starlight temperature, dawn pallor—mirrors internal cooling of judgment. Spatial choreography is flawless: circumference walk → center crouch → vanished footprints toward gate. Slight reserve: “ancient plaza” remains generic; one concrete civic relic (a fire-scarred hydria, a broken astrolabe) would have nudged 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tarot coin and orchard function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: only the coin can “ring” time, only the orchard can amplify echoes. Sensory hierarchy is ghost-specific (scent = sound, color = emotion), anchoring POV. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from curtain to maze to stage-within-garden. One minor slip: “minutes fracture into colored ribbons” is read as metaphor, yet later treated as literal traversal—clarity recovers in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The light-painting studio is evoked through selective sensory detail—colored beams, mirror angles, projector hum—integrated into action as Mira adjusts hardware. Micro-setting (the geode’s mica layers, the static pop) functions as tool and constraint, directly enabling the resonance breakthrough. Exterior world is skimmed, but the basement’s spatial choreography stays coherent and the final image returns to that circumscribed space, charging it with new social weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cave acts as both micro-setting and constraint: wet stone, salt-curtains, and tide-line dictate how Aera kneels, where the leaf hovers, and where the final path is carved. Tool-as-setting (the staff) is charged by the closing image when it floats, literalizing the new emotional topology. Sensory economy is tight—turquoise hush, ochre/violet glow—mirroring internal heat inversion. No credibility errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The warehouse’s fossilized-honey beams and resinous dusk function as a micro-setting that constrains acoustics and makes the silence swallow footfalls; buttons laid on a pine plank become the floor’s new constellation. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral circles track generations, gaps mark lessons, boots crunch specific plastics and nacre at the center. Weather is internalized—the “dawn’s first blade” ignites amber walls—charging the final image. Only the “cliffs” remain a gestural backdrop rather than a tactical obstacle, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bluff, mist, salt-mold station, and snowdrop function as micro-settings that constrain movement and charge the final image. Wind-turbine trickle and frostbitten briars actively gate access. Environmental details evolve with action; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fog-bound crossing is not backdrop but infrastructure: it mirrors sky, re-inks itself, and physically dissolves once the promise is paid. Micro-setting objects—the seat varnish, the yarn needle, the droplet—constrain every tactical move. Spatial choreography is immaculate: boots vanish in mist, the invisible plank is walked, the sandbar rises only when the thread tautens. The final meadow’s blankness is the ultimate charged environment, wiping the palimpsest clean.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The apricot tree’s cupped-leaf angle and the lantern-glass “continents that no longer existed” are irreplaceable micro-settings that constrain the final transfer of kindness.

Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—honey-turned-ash taste, phototropic leaf warmth—never tourist catalog. Environment directly enables the closing covenant, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor moonlight functions as both blade and lamp, constraining Mara’s stealth path up the fire escape and later illuminating the boy’s face; the rusted railing, paint-bucket soil, and gutter-bound brass shard are micro-settings that charge the closure image where nasturtium will root in stolen inches.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal library is not backdrop but breathing antagonist: rising shelves dictate when she can move, cloud-pages offer writable territory only if she dares tear them. The brass sundial rotates under her talons, becoming stylus and clock, literally rewriting possibility. Sensory hierarchy is avian—wind feathered, salt tasted as archive, moonlight doubled in metallic plumage. One minor spatial drift: “between the horn of a crescent moon and the horizon’s ink” floats untethered to altitude, but the final shelf-landing re-anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lotus temple is not backdrop but actor: petals flex, marble warms, the oculus projects a vein-searching thread that literally snares her twig. Micro-setting inside her coat pocket—twig helix cradling “someone else’s future”—constrains her choice to surrender it. Weather (post-cloud-burst) licenses the prismatic light that becomes the story’s language. Spatial choreography is vivid yet weightless: floating pontoon, circling doves, paper airplanes threading the oculus. Final image of moonlit water answering back makes the environment speak, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cinder-block station smelling of “burnt solder and decades of vinyl dust” is tactile and instrumental: the antique tower becomes the weapon, the warped glacier record the chaos-carrier. Moonlight braided with generator exhaust charges the final image. Micro-detail—SWR needle kissing red, capacitors whining—grounds the speculative tech. Setting constrains every tactical move; no haziness.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked glass roof and rusted rails are lived-in: Arin kneels, palms cold iron, anchors ribbon; environment guides every move. Compass point functions as micro-setting, constrains the pivotal circle-drill and reappears as the exact diameter of the missing pane—charges closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: sound of impossible organ precedes visual warp, smell of wet parchment rises from shaft. One hairline slip: “three leagues” feels slightly RPG-generic amid otherwise vivid idiom, but the world-rule is taught early and remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mist, shale, lamp-wick cough, and the ribbon-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the quarry’s “jagged throat” literally shapes the paper she works on.

Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—ink scent, star rustle, petal warmth—each filtered through her synesthetic vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vortex of leafless apple trees is not backdrop; its root-buoys literally constrain foot-placement and pacing, while apples “bob like skulls” mirror the seed she carries. Micro-setting succeeds: the flesh-eating seed becomes the terrain her body must negotiate. Silver mirror-water appears at the exact beat the confession is demanded, fusing setting to test. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible root hops—and cold rot scent is filtered through her guilt-narrowed attention.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Cobalt glade” functions as micro-setting that constrains the final graft; the clipped sidewalk leaf at the end re-anchors the urban/organic balance. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—mirrored blades, shimmer, screens—but filtered through visionary POV so selectivity reads intentional. Spatial choreography is dream-logic coherent: hedge unfolds only after clipping tugs, fireflies drift above paths, silhouette steps back. No occupational detail required; environmental evolution (grass coins, sap-circuitry walls) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The catacomb orchard is continuously handled—skull-cradled trunk, gatekeeper’s skull, sprouting tarot—each object constrains or enables the final barter.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Harbor, drowned deck, and plankton cloud are tactile and filtered through Jin’s synesthetic bias; every environmental detail refracts back to “color of sound.” The skeleton key against throat, the air-pocket breaths, and the tilting bookshelves constrain physical choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The sky-lantern reflections and underwater strobes integrate into the final image, charging the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ambered observatory is not backdrop but instrument: its panes brighten only when coins lock into spiral grooves, physically guiding Lira’s supine surrender. Micro-setting (the cold brass rail against palms, melted coin edge tasting of iron) constrains her final act—swallowing jagged metal is impossible without the deck’s grooves aligning like a throat. Even “starlight fossilized into golden panes” is reused at closure when the tower fossilizes her waveform, completing the metaphorical circuit. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—sound/temperature dominate because vision has been swallowed by contraction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Observatory, copper pool, and atlas page each constrain tactics: the dome’s star-map sentences force confrontation; the liquid-copper mirror traps his reflection; the atlas folds itself into vessels that carry the named sacrifices away. Micro-setting qualifies; the atlas page’s evolving states (flat → boat → ledger → paper souls) directly charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the brine/gunpowder smell and frost fingertip widen the palette. One minor telescope lens continuity skip (quartz dust vs. cracked lenses) does not disturb choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sapphire viaduct and salt-crusted bell function as micro-setting that constrains every action—light must strike bell, drip must land under arch. Sensory economy favors iron-taste water and rust-flake scales over vista description; details filtered through Kael’s mage-archivist attention. Spatial choreography clean: bell hung, Kael walks until water reaches knees, bones buried beneath same arch. Final image of drip on bone recharges setting as eternal clock.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    The reservoir’s retreat is not backdrop but a dynamic constraint: each newly exposed surface dictates where Marisol can step and what she can retrieve.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower city over the black gorge, the bloated moon, and the dust-lit transmitter room are tactile and bias-filtered: she notices rust, iron, vacuum tubes because they are tools for her task. The gorge’s widening under lunar pull literally offers “space for something new,” charging the final image. Micro-setting (the star fragment on the coil) constrains the decisive tune. No world-rule contradiction; speculative physics is cued and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment functions as micro-setting: the grotto’s knitting stalactites physically narrow escape route; phosphorescent barnacles provide coordinates that steer the helm. Ferry hull flickering starboard/portside is a tactile constraint that determines when Arden dares flip the hourglass. Brass rail, radio chrome-ice, and hourglass temperature-shift are handled tools that charge final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—salt-taste language, melting-moon visual—never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is not backdrop but active constraint: Möbius corridors force her weaving path, gravity-as-suggestion lets her stitch ceilings, the composite man’s dissolution reconfigures space.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The facility and tunnel are not backdrop but actuator: the corridor folds into living basalt, the cable vault becomes a heart Voss must keep beating. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every body is half-merged with hardware at believable angles, and the gold fleck’s phase state determines when walls soften or stiffen. Environment directly constrains tactics: claustrophobic throat-stone forces Mara to crawl, scraping skin, so the act of naming becomes physically arduous. Final image—the gold settling into the codex—makes the setting itself the archive, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal-glass dome, copper roof, and frost-rimmed inkwell are not backdrop but tools: the ink’s surface tension becomes a literal interface for the ghost-to-flesh transfer, constraining how the protagonist can re-enter matter. Snow’s Morse code (“stay, stay, stay”) converts weather into antagonistic pressure. Body-as-setting is equally potent: the mechanical tick in the ribs is the only map he carries down the spiral stairs. One minor slip—valley roofs “quiet certificate” drifts toward abstraction—but the dome’s glinting shard in the final half-line recharges the motif, justifying the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Micro-setting triumph: the diamond’s cracked wing and bone-flute towers constrain every sonic tactic.

Concrete specificity: “coin-return slot of the adjacent soda machine that had never worked” gives tactile history. Final rain re-images entire border—setting actively reconfigures stakes, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The train itself—curved ribs, torn velvet, shattered mirror corridor—functions as both geography and moral maze, constraining his path to the overturned car pool. Micro-setting objects (sawdust glittering with gold paint, brass pole warming under a child’s palm) are handled, not catalogued, and return transformed in memory-song. The vines threading “green notes on a staff of starlight” charge the final image by equipping the pool that mirrors sky, making the halo legible. Environmental logic stays intact: rainwater collects only where ceiling is torn open; reflection physics respected when he steps onto unbroken surface.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Scientific-poetry library functions as micro-setting: shelves curve “like inside of a seashell,” constraining locomotion and mirroring her mental warp. Hyperbolic geometry is not backdrop but tool—she steps through angles Euclidean disallow, the physical rule-set enabling her final access to pre-narrative void. Tactile specificity anchors abstraction: “weight of alien suns, texture of unborn languages.” Environment charges final image: infinite-curvature center becomes the literal place where every point touches every story—setting and closure inseparable.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Coral shelves that hum when loss is sensed, shell-pages that glimmer when greeted, and the sunrise-darkroom that develops the sky itself all constrain tactics and charge the final image. The palette’s mending with dawn-gold literalizes setting-as-tool, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)

Weather is not backdrop but antagonist: the bruised nimbostratus is literally ingested as evidence. Spatial choreography is flawless; the drop-meter and starlight motes track cleanly to the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The hollow tree-library is not backdrop but active constraint: its curved inner wall dictates canvas shape, living wood drinks paint, root vibrations time her brushstrokes. The coin’s copper coldness, candle’s dance across wet ultramarine, and the knothole’s dying sun fragment all filter through her haptic, face-blind perception. Environment literally guides choice: the wall’s curvature forces the fractal sky pattern; the demolition countdown compresses pigment mixing into urgent gesture. Final image—the painted sky glowing in the last flicker—recharges every prior sensory seed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Airship ribs, moon-grated cargo deck, and chalk-dust spirals are tactile constraints that shape where Lira can kneel, copy, speak. Brass, copper, flour-fine dust recur with evolving stakes, charging the final ignition. Starling murmuration externalizes her interior map and mirrors the spiral she translates—specific rather than decorative. One minor slip: “cloud-sea” leans poetic-generic, but is saved by later mechanical specificity of hydrogen cells.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Frozen library, spires of glass, cloud-sea sunrise: every environmental beat is filtered through Rowan’s tool-centric perception and directly shapes access ("boots squealing," "lantern twin"). Micro-setting of the black-bronze door and its waning-moon keyway forces gear choice and supplies the healed key payoff. Tools—crescent cogs, eclipse-pawl—function as portable setting that narrows tactical options. Final mirror-room pays off with emotional cost, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rock arches, sideways apple trees, and violet nebula are vivid, selective, and filter through Mara’s translucent perception. The watering bell serves as micro-setting: handled in at least four beats, its bronze timbre modulates communal rhythm and final farewell. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, ladders, baskets, seed-fruit chains track across tilting arches without drift. Environment directly constrains choice: only coordinated ladder placement counters arch tilt; nebula’s time-dilation allows three-day harvest to feel like one long dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse’s spiral rails shrink like birth canals, constraining ascent; the pane of hush and puppet head act as micro-setting that charge the final image.

Environment literally guides choice: only at the summit can the pane swallow sound and reverse time.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mechanical birds, frost-laced grass, and the nut-shell’s microscopic ridges are not garnish—they constrain tactics (can’t enter, can’t shout, must use oil). The cliff shadow’s kiss with the frost line is the micro-setting that literally maps the exit, charging the final image. Environmental details evolve: frost progresses from brittle to noose to crystal fossils, mirroring tightening stakes. Cold is felt through gloved palm, molars, boot crunches—tactile economy at work.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ravine’s braided topology isn’t backdrop; it dictates the sculpture placement and literalizes the “divergent path” concept, forcing Mara to island-hop in the final act. Micro-setting is fused with macro: the chrysalis-as-mold, shale under boots, 440 Hz resonance—each tactile detail constrains her polymer craft. Sensory hierarchy obeys grief’s tunnel vision: cicadas swell and drop in sync with emotional peaks, water temperature cues transition from despair to purpose. Only a near-generic “pale stone” prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass orchard library is not backdrop but active pressure: crystal fruit chiming syllables, shelves rearranging to erase aisles, clouds writing dedications that fade unread. The obsidian floor’s “algorithm of absence” directly shapes the vendor’s table placement and pricing method, while the moonlight beam refracts possible prologues onto the ceiling—setting literally projects narrative options. Spatial choreography stays clean: boy steps between shelves, librarian drifts, vendor folds table, all tracked without float. Environment constrains the final image: the library seed-crystal nucleates only by the absences she Collects, so her vanishing is inseparable from setting physics.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fortress-after-rain and coral pavilion function as micro-settings that actively cut and contaminate; sand-turned-glass underfoot limits stealth and later re-patterns itself as payoff. Bioluminescent coral columns charge the final image by shifting hue as human memory infiltrates oceanic time. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marisol’s chef-perceiver: taste > sight; salt, almond, copper arrive before visuals. Spatial choreography tracks her descent and body position without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Platform narrowing to “mere suggestion” and bark scarred by grafts function as micro-setting that directly constrains Myrrh’s surgical stitch; the reversing tide and moon-dragged sap are environment-as-clock, charging the final image. Olfactory details (iron, bruised banana) are filtered through her professional lens, not tourist catalog. One hairline slip: “wind-spirits” geography is lightly sketched, but the closing bridge placement maps space coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and mossy bark shelves are tactile and choice-guiding: she lands on bark, leaps leaf-to-leaf, uses water currents as map. Gravity inversion is not backdrop but tactical obstacle that rewrites footing and time. Micro-setting (arrowhead) charges the final image when it becomes glowing keeper-token. No exposition dump; world rules learned through motion. Spatial choreography flawless—no impossible positions during aerial branch traverse.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    The port’s rust-red container canyons, humming glass plaza, and diesel-salt wind are filtered through Mara’s forensic gaze—every detail is selective, purposive, and guides her path like a maze she must “learn by ear.” The fused-green-glass circle becomes the micro-setting that literally charges the final image, constraining her choice to write backward into predictive palimpsest; without it, the conceptual reprice would fail. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis perception—sound drop-out, then granular wind signatures—keeping atmosphere and action braided.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is never a postcard; the sky drips color onto the path, narrowing Elias’s footing and sightlines, then re-absorbs the pendant’s light at the end. Micro-setting (the pendant’s filigree, his worn boot soles) constrains grip and gait, feeding the final dissolution. One hairline slip: “liquid sky” is almost mixed metaphor, but the physical logic stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost-scratched window are not backdrop but instruments: temperature drop tightens the hush, frost veins become legible text, and the crystalline trees sing the glass-soft song that times the beat. Spatial choreography is flawless—Elian’s knee to door, prism to dashboard, dew frozen mid-air—each position is trackable and consequential. Sensory economy is biased toward touch and sound (brittle song, frost ferns, warm glass) that mirror internal state without overt symbolism. The setting earns its 9+ gate by supplying the very medium through which communion occurs; only minor over-lyricism in “frozen lightning” keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard is not backdrop but actuator: the cider-rot scent, moss-stitched branches, and bamboo-filtered dawn physically guide her discovery of the box and later catch the golden thread. Tools—wheel, shuttle, puzzle pieces—are handled with tactile specificity; the loom itself becomes portal-frame. Micro-setting (amber bead pressed to chest) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is pristine: foot strikes box, pieces spread on packed-earth, panel lifts, threads anchor to sky—no floating objects.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Floating rock arches constrain the final image—they must physically lower to create the bridge; specificity of “azure moonlight filtered through stone” is tactile and POV-filtered. Mine shafts function as micro-setting whose collapsed state is altered by Thistle’s silk-lined reinforcements, directly enabling the ladder. Sensory economy favors touch (cold forge, silk warmth) over visual catalog. World rule (arches respond to silk) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is micro-to-macro: cracked deck, vacuum bay, volcanic ash—each parallel bay is evoked through sensory hierarchy (scent of grease/ozone/lilac rain). The repair bay itself is handled tactily—kneeling, pressing glass to deck, bracing in zero-g—and the final image of “broken ribs settling into the shape of a question” charges closure. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room syndrome. Only the briefest moment of static star-catalog description prevents a 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)

The setting charges the final image—dew as untouched medium—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Floating tea-house, silk tethers, valley-mist, and morpho-scale light are economically interleaved with action; environment literally lifts and lowers the scene. Micro-setting (wing, tea vapour) constrains the brush-stroke discovery and charges the final map-image. Slight over-reliance on visual shimmer keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tower’s moon-drinking stones constrain the entire repair ritual: without their light the brass cannot transmute. Micro-setting of the parapet—wet chalk grid, hissing rain, spectral numbered leaves—directs Mara’s tactile choices. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bag → parapet → grid → corridor pin → descending stairs. Environment charges the final image; the cedar’s numbered leaves literalize the tower’s gift and price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Alchemical orchard is lived-in: alembic roots, phosphor smears, clockwork seeds—details constrain tactics (songs must be sung to tick backward fruit). Micro-setting body/tool rule satisfied: mica window evolves from palm pane to blood-fused lens, directly enabling final revaluation. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile/auditory—chiming pomegranates, tin-foil leaves—mirrors keeper’s synesthesia under pressure. Spatial choreography clean: aisle walk, branch brush, pane slam track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    The secret society library is not backdrop; its “enlarged tranquility” is a tactile force that narrows choice—chains on grimoires, ember-red chandeliers that purge intruders, the mirrored desk that literally doubles Elara’s paradox. Micro-setting objects—invitation, marble lectern, lantern gold—are handled on the page and change state (invitation blanks, desk reflects absence). Spatial choreography is clean: Elara slides between rows, kneels, paper drinks her pulse; Vale’s lantern washes the aisle without spatial jump. The final image recharges the setting itself as guardian, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting constrains choice: vines part to reveal the tea-house, asphalt scars dictate burial sites, palace stones literally brightened under touch. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mila’s bias—flour ghosts, camellias, basil spelling erased names—integrating detail into action rather than catalog. Micro-setting (the loaf’s residual warmth) functions as portable altar that charges the final image. One minor slip: “distant traffic” is the only modern cue, slightly undercutting mythic register, but it tensions the theme of encroaching normalcy.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frozen library is not backdrop but instrument: the quartz hush narrows hearing to tuning-fork frequencies, the sub-zero air lets light layers float as jellyfish, and the copper alcove literally warms under Wonder’s last resonance. Spatial choreography is flawless—gloves, slide, flint, tablet track across moves. The micro-setting of the cracked slide doubles as wound and lens, constraining the final projection. No orientation penalty; the altitude is felt in crystallizing breath. This is elite-level specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pier’s barnacled pilings, rising tide licking crate bottoms, and swaying lanterns supply immediate tactile constraints—water level forces market dissolution at dawn, timing the hand-over. The silver mermaid fob functions as micro-setting: its half-moon bite and "gutted fish" tail-flick mirror the internal wound and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—shine jars become "fallen stars" only after betrayal, reflecting her shifted emotional spectrum. Spatial choreography is flawless: from under-pier entry to phonograph horn pressed to sternum to daylight exit.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lavender bluff, pollen-election forests, and aurora are not backdrop: the bluff’s eastern slope is the only path the compass permits, forest results decide winter’s tone, and the aurora’s light writes the final stories. Micro-setting of compass-ring-against-lips and branded palm constrain the merge. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: metallic-electro-honeyed-bitter tastes drive every beat.

Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The floating orchard is not backdrop but tactical instrument: peach cambium conducts F-sharp, glass buoys become bells, deck planks double as speaker cones. Micro-setting—the music glade, seed-pots, kerosene lamps—constrains where children sleep and where dub can occur. Spatial choreography is flawless: prophet climbs, descends, stands prow, rigs crown; crew tap rails; children dance in cleared circle. Weather evolves from lyre-cloud to spiral-eye, each shift causally linked to sound-fractal feedback. Final image of raft dragging its own acoustic wake is inseparable from setting, charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The spiral-shell atlas constrains every mapping decision; its grooves literally echo the watchers’ slit faces, charging the final image. Body-as-setting—warm nape, coral collar, spine Morse—grounds stakes inside sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Granite coping, rusted chandelier chains, and the inkwell itself act as micro-settings that constrain entry/exit and furnish hiding cavities. Lagoon’s skin mirrors moonlight in shifting tessellations, charging the final image where separation=foundation. Spatial choreography tracks ladder, nave, altar, void without drift. Porous stone ink-stain serves as environment-body-tool fusion that reweights the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Flooded library is rendered through lived motion—ankle-deep seawater, kelp forests, bobbing parchment—anchoring who/where/when by sentence two. The brass stamp functions as micro-setting: its rubber face and mahogany mount constrain handling and final phosphorescent reveal. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mara wades, sets lantern, kneels, exits. Final image of water streaming from her coat recharges the submerged-city motif with new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Floating stones, steaming tea-leaves that exhale strangers’ dreams, and the cracked moonstone leaking silver are never mere scenery: each constrains her path (she pockets fuel-grief, must kneel at engines, cannot keep the cranes). The glass basilica’s starlight winter breath becomes the final image’s empty nave—environment recharged. Specificity is irreplaceable; spatial choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Transparent floor, hissing helium sacs, cooling breakers—each detail is filtered through grief-urgency and later weaponized (breaker smash, telescope tilt). The geode’s jagged edges against ribs function as micro-setting that literally cuts and guides choice. Final image of desert rushing up recharges the opening crater, environment constraining the fatal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)

    The driftwood sculptures function as micro-setting: their “mermaids with eroded breasts” and children’s “featureless” faces literally embody Elias’s eroded moral features and foreshadow the carved true-face he will carry upstairs. The cobalt terrace at dusk is not postcard scenery; its color word repeats at the end to charge the final sky-image with Charged Poise. Spatial choreography is tight: shore → steps → terrace edge track cleanly. Weather (tide exposed) directly enables discovery of the sculptures, hence constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Parapet-as-micro-setting constrains every move: stone bites skin, wind carries clang, mist swallows rope & cannons. Dock-rope’s tarred fray and the brass leviathan’s tail-curl recur, evolving from cell relic to wisdom key. Weather (bruised dawn, thunder prowling) mirrors internal ebb of grievance. Spatial choreography remains lucid throughout: west/east exits, Kael’s descent center—environment shapes tactical possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Body, tool, and water micro-settings constrain every decision: cracked compass slashes suit, salt enters, route changes. Pole-light hues and dolphin neon are not garnish—they are the only map she allows herself, charging the final image when poles end and “black and uncharted” becomes the new medium. Airy risk of 9.0 withheld only because one sodium-orange descriptor edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The baseball, lake, and drains function as micro-settings that constrain movement and meaning; the orbiting ball literally re-stitches his scars. Sensory hierarchy is biased to cold, wet, and luminous—perfect for a man navigating guilt. Spatial choreography is clean: diagonal steps carve “a path of maybes” until concrete yields to living rock.

Weather is static (perpetual moon) yet justified by fairy-tale rule-set.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “midnight glade above clouds” is simultaneously cathedral, backyard, and thoracic cavity; environment is micro-scaled to the saucer and macro-scaled to weather, both constraining choice. Silver moss, starless geography, and iron-tasting spiral are specific, never decorative; each reappears to alter tactics (moss receives her hand-trace, spiral bleeds upward to force the read). Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: during descent only the heartbeat-minute numbers register, then grass scent returns at landing. Final image—saucer filled with moonlight—recharges every prior cloud and fracture with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Recycled hull as micro-setting constrains choice: only salvaged jade, hair-filament, and ghost-photos can be used.

Final image of “gates yawning toward a horizon no longer rented” reweights the entire luminous fort as liberated political space.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal bluff is not backdrop but constraint: frictionless stone determines Elias’s motionless stance and the rocks’ exact placement. The aurora’s “borrowed dawn” reappears in the star-dust constellation, recharging the image. Micro-setting—the pouch’s heat against cold wind—anchors body attention. Spatial choreography is clean: rocks, tide reach, and eel-routes track throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory is more than postcard: the dome’s iron breathes, the cloud deck becomes a “darkroom developing horizons,” and the wet print on the windowsill is a micro-setting that constrains the final action. Weather actively steers metaphoric and literal choices; spatial choreography is clean from catwalk to darkroom. One hairline slip: “rain upward in reversed waterfalls” momentarily violates physics without signalling altered reality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass atrium/brook function as micro-setting: the mirrored dusk angle physically completes the sundial and enables their truce; selective sensory detail (brass fingers, foil song) is vivid without checklist drift, though spatial track of the scholars’ ring is lightly skimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted library’s iron dust, warped stacks, and potbellied stove constrain every tactical move (shelter, fire, hiding place).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station’s marble floor, ozone-shaft, and greenhouse of air-roots are filtered through the pianist’s musicianly perception (notes “drift like reluctant pigeons,” fluorescent stutter as metronome). The cloud-ark above the clouds is not postcard whimsy; it supplies the breathable ladder and the trade-currency (ozone scent = ticket into film), directly enabling her refuge choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bench → counter → alcove → ladder → sky-garden → platform → shaft → bench, every object tracked. The broken clock’s brass corpse and the reels of safety film constrain tactics (she must strap the clock on her back, must trade its chime), charging the final image when the same clock rings “across the empty tiles.”

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridge as dragon-back dream-scale, vanilla lattice dream-bower, and copper-ink seed are tactile, world-defining micro-settings that constrain tactics (she must braid orchid fibers into the earthly fissure). Sensory hierarchy filters through Calyx’s checker perception—empirically whimsical hush, orchid and iron taste—never tourist catalog. Weather clock (pre-monsoon light, first fat raindrop) directly governs the final braiding urgency. Spatial choreography remains clean across the shift from dream-canyon to waking ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black sand, salt-slick driftwood, and diesel breeze are selective, POV-filtered, and guide the ritual’s pacing.
