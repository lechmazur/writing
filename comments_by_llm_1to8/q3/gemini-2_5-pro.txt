  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse setting constrains Aris's choices: the dust-coated pane becomes the lens through which he observes, and removing it (wiping clean) is the final decisive gesture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (silt smell, humidity weight, mildew creep). The polycarbonate pane and its dust are micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    The canyon micro-setting constrains choice: shaded sentinel rock and river reeds supply ephemeral frost landmarks that Kaelen must read at dawn, forcing her retracing path and timing. The cobalt shard on the windowsill charges the climactic recognition beat when ice-lace echoes the ledger glyphs. Setting details—petrified wood curtain, tributary canyon—are filtered through her artist's eye and directly enable plot progression. Spatial choreography (kiln→window→sentinel rock→tributary→cave→studio) tracks cleanly across the week-long search.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    The winterglass conservatory constrains Elara's world (bubble against stillness) and the frosted panes serve as her projection screen, charging the final image with layered light. Micro-setting elements (flagstones, velvet-lined case, cereus bud) are handled concretely and shape her thermal work. Spatial choreography is clean; the conservatory's humid air and glass walls recur with purpose. The night-blooming cereus's opening at closure ties environment to character arc. Sensory detail is purposeful (cool blues, gentle green warmth, incandescent violet) without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered: basalt shelves, coral astrolabe, vaulted ceilings in gloom. The broken lens as a recurring object charges the final image by enabling the astrolabe. Spatial choreography is clean (pier → non-space → library center). The setting constrains the central choice (the astrolabe needs the lens), meeting the 9+ gate, but the "occupation of impossible spaces" remains abstract—no tactile detail of pressure or water parting limits full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: a "skeletal structure" and "place of ghosts" that Elara transforms into a garden site, constraining her choice to respond publicly rather than in ambush. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wind through clay pillars, "sliver of moon," withered vegetables). The sanctions period manifests in "hollowed cheeks," "stooped shoulders," and the scarcity that makes an orange crate bring tears. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the ridge-to-settlement sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The viaduct, jasmine, and camera obscura are rendered with purposeful sensory detail filtered through Elara's artistic priorities. The kwan yin's tear and the mahogany box function as micro-setting that constrains method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (parapet, box, dark cloth) remains coherent. The twilight setting subtly guides the breathing-and-seeing ritual, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The maze's hyperbolic geometry and the yew clearing function as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice: Elias uses "the maze's distorting logic" and "paradoxical geometry" to break the artifact's hold. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("glossy leaves," "green scent," "thick with the ghosts"), filtered through his disintegrating perception. The living bridge and verdant arch anchor early and return at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across curved passages and the impossible center.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prize redemption center supplies concrete resources (claw machines, Skee-Ball lanes, ticket dispensers) that constrain and enable Elara's final tactical choice, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: dust, corroded panels, rusted tin roof all filtered through urgency. Minor deficit: the vault beneath the floorboards and the Divider Wall outside remain somewhat abstract placeholders rather than spatially grounded elements that alter micro-choices during the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and skeletal shipwrecks constrain atmosphere and charge the closure image ("not just monuments to disaster, but also to survival"). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: salt-streaked glass, moss hum, aurora colors that "made his teeth ache." The ashen forge functions as micro-setting, its cold luminescence powered by absences. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting's dual role—beauty in endurance—directly mirrors Elias's arc and recurs in the final beat to reweight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Emerald Station's green-tinted glass and art-deco architecture create a spectral stage that charges the jar's luminescence; the setting is introduced early and returned to at closure when Silas places the jar in his apartment, reweighting the portraits on the walls. Sensory details (honeyed light, emerald glow, cool glass) are filtered through Silas's reverent perception. The jar itself functions as micro-setting/object, constraining his choice to take it and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    The control room is vividly anchored—dormant console, corroded ceiling drip, residual red warning light—and the melting ice pressures the timeline and destabilizes the structure, directly constraining Elara's final choice. The bookmark functions as micro-setting, charging both the memory beat and the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (wet earth, weak sunlight) and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library under stars is vivid and purposeful: "exposed girders," "mangled roof," "skeletal ruin" create tactile decay. The loose panel, maintenance phone, and constellation-visible dome all constrain and enable Leo's choices—he must climb despite acrophobia, use what's present, decode by starlight. Spatial choreography (shelf height, panel location, entrance sightlines) tracks cleanly. The seashell and cast are handled objects that charge the closure, satisfying the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort and sealed chamber constrain Kaelen's work—"this was the time, the only time"—grounding the ritual in spatial necessity. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: the "ambered hush," the wind as "a blade sharpening itself," the star pulsing through the stone slit. The body becomes micro-setting ("his finger, calloused and stained with ink") and the gold leaf booklet charges the final image as flakes cling "like dying embers." Spatial choreography is clean (cross-legged on flagstones, chamber above the storm, slit in ceiling). The environment actively pressures the ritual's success and shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard constrains Unit 734's workspace to a "perfect square of frost-crusted flagstones enclosed by silent, grey monoliths," and the barren fountain at center becomes the violin's focal point. Violet/purple twilight and the dimming sliver of sun track the looped hour's temporal boundary. The courtyard's cold merges with the ice violin's cold at the climax ("The cold of the courtyard and the cold of the ice became one"), charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective—optical sensors, soft whir, frost, shimmer, refracted rainbows—and filtered through the robot's mechanical perception. Minor gap: the "silent, grey monoliths" remain generic placeholders without further specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wet forecourt, lobby clock, and park cenotaph are vivid and filtered through Elias's night-watch perspective. The projector lens functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his interpretive choices (magnification) and charges the final image when placed in Lena's palm. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: wet stone, jasmine, gravel crunch. The "crystal whispering" phrase reappears purposefully at closure, reweighting the forecourt motif with emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden maze functions as micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices—divided sectors, the mossy sundial as marble repository, hedgerows with history—and the butterflies' choice of his half charges the closure. Sensory detail (blooming roses, bee hum, cobalt flutter) is purposeful and filtered through stakes. The "Decisive Decade" and wrist-com luck scores anchor the speculative frame early, though the world-rule mechanics (how scores work, why they matter beyond hiring) remain lightly sketched. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The violet gas giant, crystalline-winged lepidoptera, and icy-warm station air create a vivid, specific world. The lever, hologram lattice, and Elias's left-behind hydro-spanner all constrain or charge key moments. Spatial choreography (observation deck, the device's core, diagnostic screen placement) is clean. The "mechanically warm" device energy is a purposeful sensory contradiction that recurs and tensions the "icy warmth" motif, grounding the conceptual shift in physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns provides vivid, purposeful atmosphere: water as stagnant mirror, skeletal balconies, velvet darkness. Sensory detail is selective and tied to POV priorities (musician noticing "ribs of upper balconies," "hush of unstruck chords"). The antique program and water directly constrain the climactic choice—he must submerge the artifact to decode it—meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that setting/object shapes action. Spatial choreography (pit lip, nearby seat, water below) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The weather station setting constrains choice throughout: the barograph's click and anemometer's whine anchor sensory texture, the cold air makes every action tactile, and the west-facing window becomes the charged site of closure. The botanical illustration (a micro-object) recurs with reweighted meaning and directly shapes the final image. Economy is high—details serve pressure rather than catalog. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (meteorological instruments filtered through her oracle-like awareness).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tunnel's damp dark, rust smell, oily water, and looming machinery create vivid spatial pressure. The beaded valve wheel—condensation drops, frigid metal, resisting vibration—is the micro-setting anchor that constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: tunnel → cavernous room → submerged floor → central pipe. The setting is not ornamental; the valve's physical resistance mirrors the protagonist's internal battle, and the environment's weight literalizes his search for a "place heavy enough."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and specific: the overgrown library with vellum, stone tablets, bioluminescent fungi, and the black-sand riverbank create distinct atmospheres. The obsidian refuge functions as both destination and constraint—its "profound, healing emptiness" supplies the resource the keeper needs. Sensory detail is filtered through the keeper's priorities (papyrus decay on their hand, ozone scent during transition). The origami swan and the silent river constrain choice by serving as the sole means of access and the singular balm. Spatial choreography is clean across both locations.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sage Ridge anchors the piece early with "dusty ground," "dried sagebrush," and "western horizon," and the eclipse light transforms the setting ("bruised twilight," "ethereal glow," "ghostly ring of fire") in ways that heighten the ritual. The kalimba and the earth under Lena's palm function as micro-setting that shapes the therapeutic moment. One slip: "Sage Ridge" itself remains postcard-generic; no scent, temperature, or tactile detail specific to high desert at that hour pressures the choice to hold the session outdoors.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The silo's curved walls, bronze quiet, oak desk, and single beam of light create a vivid, consistent micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clear (ground-floor fireplace, desk at apex). The tapestry and diaries function as handled objects that constrain Kaelen's interpretive choices. The setting's "bronze quiet" recurs and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and returns with charged specificity at closure ("great lamp casting his long shadow," "winding stairs for the last time"). The binoculars and lamp function as tools that enable his method of distant control. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (sea fog, tinny bell, damp air), filtered through Elias's perch. The coastal geography and all-night diner anchor the exchange spatially, though the diner itself is generic. The lighthouse perch constrains his mode of action throughout and charges the final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "dimensional anchor" and "perfect cube of unnerving quiet" anchor the exorcism spatially and tonally. The loop pedal, microphone, and palette are handled objects that constrain tactics: Alistair taps the pedal to layer sound, creating the "manufactured imperfection" that unravels the entity's stillness. The palette's single gray smear is both micro-setting and symbolic constraint, charging the final image when it falls and the gray dries "just a color, one of many." Spatial choreography (Elara seated center, Alistair leaning in) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are established early and return with force: the mirrored horizon at dawn creates "an infinite, luminous sphere with the spire at its heart," a vivid sensory anchor that charges the closure image. The nautilus segment is handled twice (tracing whorls, warming in palm) and functions as a focusing lens. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor limitation: the "upturned hush" and magnetic flux remain atmospheric rather than constraining a tactical choice, keeping the setting just shy of active pressure on Kaelen's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (ozone, wet metal, droplets catching internal light). Spatial choreography is clean: floating above, drifting upward, touching down at the origin coordinate. The viaduct's procedurally generated architecture and its "oppressive glow" constrain Kael's tactics and charge the final image when the light softens to "grey dawn." However, the city beyond remains a placeholder; the viaduct functions more as symbolic space than lived-in environment with tactile consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful: "deep limestone belly," "raw, percussive shapes of hanging drums," stone floor that conducts vibration. The broken needle and modified turntable function as micro-setting tools that enable the climactic choice. The sensory hierarchy is filtered through Elara's deafness (vibration prioritized over sound), and the environment directly charges the closure image when vibration recedes "back into the stone."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard's "residual warmth bled from the cobblestones" and "scent of damp ivy and cooling stone" anchor the scene with sensory specificity filtered through Elias's meteorological idiom ("pressure system centered squarely on him"). The "wrought-iron bench" and "flagstones" provide spatial choreography for the pigeon's arrival. The courtyard functions as micro-setting—tranquility contrasts his nerves, and the pigeon's tumble uses the space causally. The final image ("deep, velvety blue") charges the ending but the courtyard itself does not constrain the choice to descend; the old waterways do that work off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto is vivid and purposeful: "cool, earthen womb," "clay bowl," "clay knob." The rope's tactile history (prison dust) anchors past desperation and contrasts with cosmic abstraction. The starlight and shimmer create atmosphere but remain largely decorative until the final beat. The rope constrains the final choice by serving as a concrete analogue for binary escape versus nuanced freedom, charging the closure image when Elias addresses it directly before his declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse dome and shipwreck ring function as instruments that shape and hold sound, directly constraining Elara's method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through acoustic perception: "saline air," "groan of settling silt," "resonant tremor in curved panes." The sunken orchard with skeletal trees and beached wrecks creates a micro-ecology of sound that makes the closure possible. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection: "thick, honeyed layers," "dust and ozone," and the dusk-triggered luminescence that cues the transformation. The obsidian slab and crystal phial are concrete tools that anchor the ritual. The setting constrains the work—Kael must wait for dusk, and the grotto's resonant crystals provide the "baseline against which he could work." Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The micro-setting (body, tool, object) participates in the closure: the phial becomes the vessel for the extracted joy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop library terrace under stars is vividly anchored and the "breezy library" recurs purposefully. Sensory details (sea breeze, starlight catching silver hair) are filtered through Elias's professional-turned-personal lens. The locket photo constrains the emotional pivot and the spatial choreography (tables, chair-pulling) remains clear. The setting subtly supports the closure by linking the library overlook to the concert hall, though it doesn't materially alter tactics in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vivid and consistent, grounding spatial choreography (fissure, crater's lip, arbor's shadow). Setting constrains Kaelen's search strategy—he seeks "overlooked spaces" where reeds grow, a micro-setting choice that reveals character and enables the discovery. The phosphorescent vine woven into the arbor and the protective reed mats both use the environment as a charged material, and the final pairing of "yielding reeds at his feet" with "unbending obsidian before him" charges the closure image with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop canal system, stone walkways, and towers are vividly anchored with sensory detail (sloshing rhythm, syrupy crawl, frothing torrent, crystalline nest). The pendant vibrates and glows in response to temporal frequency, constraining Elias's choice to act at the central aqueduct. The setting pressures the protagonist through spatial access (tower to tower pursuit) and the nest's cathedral-like scale charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: pre-crisis is metronomic observation, crisis narrows to the Chronovore's scuttling and crystalline hum, resolution to the pure wave and dust.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and specific: moon through fissure, wet limestone scent, dripping stalactites, moss-covered mosaic path. Sensory detail is filtered through Elian's focus (the glass eyes "catching the sliver of moonlight like captured stars"). The setting constrains choice—the mosaic stepping stones are the ritual's anchor, with Lyra's metaphorical fingerprints "embedded in the grout" priming the closure image. The stalactites "that gave it life" tie environment to the orchard's survival. The path's chipped patterns become data points, fulfilling the micro-setting role that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's architecture (pipe chases, ventilation shafts, oak table) directly enables Elias's agency and the discovery beat. Sensory detail ("sapphire hush," "strobing movements," "colossal shelves") is vivid and filtered through POV. Spatial choreography is clean: grate behind Modern History stacks, service panel beneath the table, high ventilation grate for observation. The setting meaningfully constrains choices (where he can move unseen) and charges the final image (Anya in the "empty, silent room").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mossy trellis after rain functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its "skeleton of some great beast that had finally collapsed" charges Elias's realization and his walk to the tool shed. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (damp earth, shattered wood, fog on glass) and filtered through Elias's professional lens. The greenhouse and its plants anchor who/where/when early. The trellis participates directly in closure by embodying both the wreckage and the prompt for reconstruction, though it doesn't create an impossible choice—its role is more symbolic than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal causeway, retreating tide, and western bluffs create spatial pressure that constrains access and discovery timing. The convergence of petrified roots and corroded drone chassis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and dramatizes the post-war world through objects rather than exposition. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "salt-crusted memories," "warm against his skin despite the cool air," "slick mud." The amber brooch as portable setting-object recurs with reweighted meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The musical crystal cave constrains Lyra's choice at the threshold: the oscillating crystal guides Kael's path, and the overlapping shadows force her realization. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Lyra's professional lens (scrying amethyst, crystalline melodies). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance to hidden chamber to central spire. The cave's "immense, ancient desire" subtly mirrors Lyra's inner shift. Micro-setting (the shadows, the spire) charges the final image when the pearl is placed and light pulses outward.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ivory harbor, rain-slick stones, and liminal shoreline constrain Kaelen's daily search pattern and supply the valve. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("mist...tasted of salt," "slick, pale stones"). The workshop's shelves function as micro-setting that charges the woman's recognition scene. The harbor after rain recurs at closure ("sound of the surf"), reweighting the opening image with the woman's new resolve. Environment pressures the woman's choice to stay rather than retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting moves from cracked pavement to mist-choked alleys to a starlit vault with vivid, selective detail. The phantom punch perforates the veil (a micro-constraint that gates the journey) and the fortress itself is a cathedral of space rather than stone, which is memorable. However, the vault functions primarily as backdrop for revelation rather than constraining Elias's final choice, limiting its role in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The skeletal tower with unglazed archways, salt wind, and whale moans below establishes a vivid, pressure-laden micro-setting early. The storm in the third night intensifies sensory detail (rain on stone, urgent whale songs) and the tower as vortex directly shapes Elias's near-choice to hurl the tile, then his breakthrough. The obsidian tile itself functions as recurring object that constrains and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats, and the Pacific/tower juxtaposition anchors the celestial-oceanic synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with refracted storm light, kaleidoscopic walls, and dimensional pocket logic. The setting constrains choice: the storm provides the power source, the sanctuary's perimeter marks the fissure's location. Sensory detail is strong ("wavelengths of angry crimson and violet," "unreflective blackness"). The crystalline walls' "deep, resonant growl" and the escondite's final fate (unmade by the storm) charge the closure image with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prep room is vividly rendered with chemical tang, steel table, ventilation whisper, and dragon-clawed ink pot—all purposeful. The setting constrains choice: the repatriation contract provides the breach method, the table becomes Mr. Silus's liminal space. The final prop (graph paper, brachistochrone curve) charges the closure image. Minor density note: "porcelain stillness" and "chemical tang of formaldehyde" are strong, but "universe settle" reads slightly abstract for Elara's concrete professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bonsai labyrinth constrains her work spatially (she carries the lamp "into the heart of the labyrinth," sets it on a flat stone) and the interplay of artificial lamp-glow with dawn sunlight is the mechanism that enables her method. The "cool, sterile light washing over the delicate moss and twisted branches" charges the ritual. Micro-setting (the flat stone, the canopy filtering sunlight) shapes the closure beat when "nascent sunlight, filtering through the bonsai canopy, seemed to press against the fluorescent glow, bending it." The workshop is mentioned but not shown, a minor missed spatial opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The port setting is established with concrete sensory detail (rust-holes, brine, diesel, green-bearded pylons) and filtered through the narrator's acoustic sensitivity ("sounds bend, carrying…the weight of their origins"). The container functions as micro-setting, its walls becoming "translucent membranes" at peak pressure. The tide rhythm structures the piece and constrains the narrator's cycle. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves (quay below, container interior, pylons). The setting subtly guides the narrator's method: the acoustics "sharp and clear" at low tide enable collection. Strong anchoring and purposeful sensory selection charge the final image but do not directly force the closure choice, capping the score just shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory setting (wind-scoured cliff, crumbling dome, grime-caked slit, dusty floorboards) constrains Elias's experiment spatially and tonally. The half-finished cello and painted seashell function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image: their physical interaction produces the ephemeral compass. Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone, vibration, luminescence—filtered through Elias's focus during peak pressure. The empty corner floorboards become the story's hinge: setting supplies the exact place where cosmic event left its scar, turning environment into answer.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly realized through sensory layering (calliope, fry-oil, water lapping, bunting-draped alleyways) and spatial detail (high-wire platform, main granary, fisher-folk pier). The setting actively constrains the Revel's options—they "couldn't fight" or they'd be "towed away and dismantled"—and supplies the graffiti substrate that enables Kael's method. The foundation stone chip and the floating infrastructure charge the final image, tying physical precariousness to cultural survival. Micro-setting (each mural location) guides reorganization tactics across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The moonlit summit, chemical plate, and Hasselblad camera all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "crunch of regolith," "suit's internal heaters groan," "blue and violet" light painting the rock. The setting evolves causally (pre-dawn stillness → sunrise blade → sterile light) and the Silene Flora's bloom is grounded in plausible (if speculative) biology, making the environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The signal box repair shop, mist-coated depot, and crystal basins are vivid and purposeful. The water basins constrain her method and charge the final image of still water. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's tactile focus: "cool, wet rims," "shimmering membrane," "whirring...painful thrum." Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The micro-setting (workbench, basins, lamp) functions as the true stage and directly enables her diagnostic method.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The outpost environment is vivid and purposeful: "corroded antenna," "tepid tea," "deep-seated chill," and the single pane of glass that becomes the method's vehicle all constrain and enable action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional POV (seismic sensors, ground-penetrating radar). The frozen lake and atmospheric pressure aren't postcard elements—they directly shape the climactic event. The glass pane's micro-setting role is essential to closure, making the environment indispensable to the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient archway, cobblestones, and spectral market square are vividly rendered and purposefully deployed: the stones function as keys in Elias's method, and the archway frames both entry and closure. Sensory detail is selective (hum through boot soles, shimmer of the baker's outline) and filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The micro-setting of cobblestones constrains his method and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement; however, the town itself remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure on choices, capping the score in the strong 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater temple is vividly anchored with phosphorescent algae, obsidian altar, and crushing silence; the environment constrains choice (oxygen timer, helmet light, suit chronometer). The vial as micro-setting object charges the final image. Deduction: spatial choreography is thin—kneeling at the altar is the only physical position detailed—and the submersible's interior/exterior relationship is vague, weakening the sense of tactical options within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse prison is vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (copperlight repose, jagged reef, rusted iron) and the confessional lattice becomes a literal viewing screen that constrains discovery. Spatial choreography is clear: winding stairs, third-floor landing, narrow door, cell beyond. The suspended bodies are textured with wool and bone; the setting's "strange physics" directly enables the impossibility. The coastal geography appears in the final image (coast guard launch as a speck), grounding the ending. The micro-setting (confessional screen as aperture) charges the closure by framing the witnessed tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse as micro-setting constrains choice (the orchard's heart, the Night Phalaenopsis location) and charges the final image (Elian stands alone in the greenhouse with the bead). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "breath a lonely cloud," "humid aisles," "pearlescent bud," "soft, internal luminescence." The alchemical plants (moon-petal vines, shadow-lilies, blood-fern, belladonna, soul-blossom, silver-leafed rose) are filtered through Elian's occupational lens and the ghost bride's influence, grounding the setting in tactile interaction. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout; the "endless night" and "winter-cracked fields" frame the bubble of glass without drifting.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The red canyon labyrinth and bone-white wharf remnants are vividly realized and consistently maintained. Sensory detail is purposeful: "bruised yellow" sky, wind-hummed threads, crimson dust. The copper plate and thread physically constrain Kaelen's final choice—he must anchor delicate dream-work with pragmatic knots—thus charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the nocturnal wanderings and storm sequence. The setting functions as more than backdrop; it actively pressures the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: roots snaking through bones, the fig tree gripping the sundial base, damp soil and faint blossoms create a lived-in texture that reflects life/decay duality. The setting constrains Elara's choice to free the stone "over several days" and charges the final image when sunlight strikes the repaired base. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The micro-setting (sundial base underside) delivers the climactic carving reveal, directly shaping closure.

    The golden arcade at dawn constrains the operation's timing and provides the concrete plaza for the chalk drawings. The ebony clipboard anchors his analog method. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered: "rough concrete," "faint taste of adhesive," "colorful dust." The micro-setting (pavement, arcade entrance) charges the final image by embodying the analog-versus-digital contrast. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves, and the environment directly enables his method.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt observatory is anchored early with vivid sensory details (cold, eternal candle flame, massive dome groaning) and the setting actively shapes Elara's tactics—she uses the auxiliary terminal and synchronizes with the telescope's calibration sequence. The eternal candle provides consistent light and returns in the final image, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (corner, terminal, dome). However, the autumn cold is mentioned once and never constrains action; the observatory's professional systems (comms relay, guidance satellites, narrow-band channel) are sketched efficiently but could be more tactile to reach the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mangrove labyrinth with singing spirits is vividly anchored: "tangled roots...drank saltwater," "humid night pressing against the glass." The stilt-hut, window, and gargoyle shard create micro-setting that frames the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: condensation blooms, spirits' keening hymn, the shard's coldness. The environment constrains the ritual (spirits as medium, window as canvas) and charges the final image (moon rising to heal). Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium, sterile air against humid chaos, and violet twilight establish tone and contrast effectively. The cast itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (plastic chair, glass walls, atrium doors) remains clear. Does not quite reach the 9-band: the environment supports but does not constrain a pivotal choice; the coral is handled twice but remains more thematic anchor than tactical tool.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ruined orchard district is vivid and specific: "skeletal remains of ancient espaliers," "damp scent of moss on crumbling brick," and the pockmarked wall all filter through Elian's artist's eye. The fresco fragment and silver projector are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and the fog encroaches to reclaim colors, creating atmospheric resistance. The wall itself is the canvas that enables and receives the final mural, directly charging the closure image. Micro-setting (the fragment in his palm) anchors both the opening and the ending, reweighting its solidity against the vaporous vision.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting that directly constrains choice: specific crystal angles produce specific realities, forcing Elias to learn tactile rules (blue spire = geometry; amber dish = liquid twilight). Sensory details (cool humming turf, bone-absorbed chimes, bioluminescence, rain/wet stone smell) are filtered through his restorer's methodical perception. The scaffold/cathedral frame anchors who/where/when before displacement. The hobo nickel evolves across beats (skeletal landscape → tree → ship → laughing face → open eye → mirror), charging the final image with accumulated transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered ("cathedral of glass and steam," bioluminescent fungi, spectral orchid) and directly enables the climax—the orchid's neuro-electric field is the instrument of warp. The garden as "living library" and coded blossoms establish a micro-setting that constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The single gourd rattle seed in Kaelen's pocket recurs with physical presence and charges the final image when inserted into the orchid's "fleshy receptacle."

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that shapes choice: it amplifies her work, traps her in solitary vigil, and ultimately houses the postcard in a "pearlescent crevice where the moonlight would strike it first." The twin moons, off-key wind, and nacreous walls are filtered through Elara's poetic perception and constrain her tactics (she "ensconces" poems in smaller shells, later places the postcard where light will reach). Sensory selection is purposeful—salt-damp air, half-sung lullabies, midnight sea—but the broader geography (the shore, the sea, the ships) remains abstract, never grounding her in a tactile relationship to the world beyond the shell.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The opal floors, petrified air pedestal, and glass orchid are vivid and purposeful; the setting is selective and filtered through Elian's preservationist lens. The cracked bamboo tube anchors micro-setting and constrains his method—its fracture produces "broken, haunted" sound that expresses damaged trust. However, spatial choreography within the alcove remains thin; we don't see how proximity or access shapes his movements, and the "library above the clouds" functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a constraint that pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive setting is vivid and functional: "dust motes danced like constellations," shelves of "silent ghosts of dead tongues," ambient magic "urging him toward both breakthrough and ruin." The glass ink well constrains the final act (nearly empty by the end, its "transparent promise finally fulfilled") and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (desk, door, chamber, the lattice hanging "between them"). Micro-setting detail—vellum, quill, moon-quartz powder—shapes the magical method and reflects Kaelen's scholarly priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crumbling amphitheater inside the volcano is vividly drawn (obsidian cliffs, thermal breathing, fissures filtering dawn light) and consistently tracked. Spatial choreography is clean: stage → tiers → wall cavity. The chain's physical weight and the stone's coolness anchor tactile detail. The geothermal regulators gleaming in the distance at closure charge the final image, linking setting to theme. Sensory selection (pollen grains, azurite flecks under magnification) reflects the machinist's professional filter and drives the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The attic, skylight, dust, wicker cage, and meteorite are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias's grief-focused attention. The storm's leak directly threatens the music, making environment an active constraint. The meteorite returns with shifted meaning (gift from Lena, not a lucky charm), charging the final exchange. Spatial choreography (wobbly stool, Anna steadying his ankle) is clean and purposeful. Minor: "a universe of dancing dust" and "dust-stars" lean ornamental in the opening, but the skylight ritual does constrain his balance practice.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is vivid, strange, and functional: shards, airless space, a single wooden table that provides the grain he must read. The environment constrains his method (wood is the only navigable text) and the northernmost threshold he predicts charges the final choice. The silver void and empty chair in the closing beat shift setting purposefully and underscore his new isolation. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor: the terrace's physics (airless, floating) are evocative but not tested under pressure—he never struggles with drift or breathlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The deep-sea facility is rendered through specific sensory detail: stressed metal groans, emergency lighting weaving with shadow, plasteel dome, crushing pressure equalized in the case. The geothermal grid as "slumbering circulatory system" makes infrastructure tactile. The dome's darkness and subsequent bioluminescent meadow constrain and then reward Kaelen's choice to wait and dim lights. Spatial choreography (corridors to dome, Elara already there) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The iridescent geode cave supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: rainbows refract emotional echoes, the amethyst cluster serves as workspace, and the quartz basin enables the seed-vine map. The crater glass itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's method and charging the final image when its origin is revealed. Sensory hierarchy (visual light refractions, tactile coolness/warmth of the glass, auditory chiming) reflects Kael's professional focus. The geode's reflective surfaces actively enable the transliteration mechanic, making the environment indispensable to the central task.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal arcade under stars, coin-pusher mechanics, water channels, and the ceiling mural all constrain Kael's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail (rhythmic hiss, metallic sigh, phantom warmth of starlight) is purposeful and filtered through Kael's attentive POV. The bishop as micro-object and the tide as environmental pressure both drive the closure beat. Spatial choreography (puddle, machine leg, beam path) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The twilight garden and celestial imagery anchor early and recur throughout. The cool moss, night-blooming jasmine, and violet sky are filtered through Kaelen's dancer perspective. The moonstone dust and the final obsidian line constrain the closure image, charging it with the garden's sensory particulars. Spatial choreography is clear; no impossible positions. The setting functions as micro-setting (body/object) that shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail ("pearlescent glow," "noctilucent reckonings," mist texture on skin). The brackish pond and granite outcrop provide micro-setting that constrains the ritual. The atrium's facets and their light-scattering at closure charge the final image directly. Spatial choreography is clear and sensory hierarchy reflects Silas's professional lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridge setting is vivid and selective: "granite spine," "gnarled pines," "smoke-scented air." The cracked box functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's touch and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory hierarchy reflects firefighter priorities (heat-testing, smoke). The Perseids and moonlight frame the scene without overwhelming it. The box's physical state (cracks, porcelain texture) directly enables the ending gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with phosphorescence, tidal rhythm, and the hum that charges pressure. The tide functions as both catalyst and constraint, submerging the pattern at a precise moment and pulling the light away. The shells, obsidian, and whelk are handled tactilely and their placement is integral to the experiment. The gauge, nested on a flat stone, anchors micro-setting and charges the final image when the needle settles higher.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage, damp flagstones, and the fireplace maw anchor setting and pressure. The film negative caught in sunlight is a vivid micro-setting moment that charges the climactic discovery. The post-climate-shift world is sketched efficiently through "resurgent green" and "the generation that witnessed the world change." The fireplace functions as both spatial anchor and symbolic locus, constraining Elara's final choice to leave the journals where she found them.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and wet stone after rain create a micro-setting that directly enables the painter's work—water and light converge to shatter into rainbows, which he conducts. The stone amplifies the lullaby, sending it into the city as vibration. Spatial choreography is clean (terrace edge, parapet, city below). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the painter's professional focus. Setting constrains the peak action (the perfect convergence) and charges the final image (wet sheen returns as bells ring), meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient terrace is anchored early with cracked marble, overgrown balustrades, and harvest-god reliefs that signal decay and endurance. Elias's scraping of moss and dust from a crack is a purposeful micro-action that supplies the material for the sigil, directly constraining his ritual method. The setting's atmosphere—midsummer jasmine, decay, celestial convergence—charges the final image when the unified moonlight bathes the terrace at signature. Spatial choreography is clear (Elias at the edge, the stone table between the generals), and the environment's symbolic weight is filtered through Elias's professional lens without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt flat, brine basin, and geothermal vent constrain and enable the climactic act—only this unique microbial soup allows the biochemical gesture. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven: "heat was a physical weight," "sharp salt crystals biting," sulfurous warmth. The environment charges the final image: the egg dissolves into the ancient water, and the setting's harshness mirrors the broken world. Micro-setting (the basin) functions as both grave and genesis, anchoring theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver courtyard under snow is anchored early and the prism sanctuary charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraint. Sensory detail is selective—snow, starlight, frozen tears—and purposefully lyric, though the courtyard's spatial choreography remains vague (no walls, doors, or sightlines to ground her solitary work). The prism's "complex lattice" and "trapped light" are evocative but described rather than interacted with across beats; Elara does not touch, adjust, or navigate its structure during the rite, missing tactile specificity that would anchor the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome provides excellent atmospheric specificity (curved walls, polished concrete, perfect hush, viewport) and the "meteor hush" tone pervades effectively. The story stick as micro-setting object returns with shifted weight at closure. The trunk of marionettes anchors the final beat concretely. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting doesn't actively constrain a choice in the middle beats—it's more atmospheric container than tactical pressure—keeping this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto is vividly rendered: damp moss, cradle of green floating in clouds, blushing mist, silvervine, river stones. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's hands and vision. The environment constrains his work (materials must be gathered, knots tied between ferns and outcrops) and charges the final image when the butterflies pass through the archways before vanishing into the sky. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting functions as micro-setting that shapes action and amplifies the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora timepiece, ice-carved workbench, and phosphorescent rope anchor setting vividly and filter through Elian's craft focus. The rope's braids and the ice dome constrain and enable his work, charging the final light projection. Sensory detail—cool pliant strands, pearlescent radiance, emerald aurora—integrates action without catalog. Micro-setting (the workbench, the rope) functions as the crucible for his act of preservation, satisfying the 9+ gate in spirit but not surpassing 8.4 because spatial choreography is minimal and the environment does not force a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bunker's concrete, vine-draped decay, and the storm's physical encroachment (dirt/water cascade, rising ankles) constrain Kael's timeline and charge the ending. Micro-setting works well: the console's single light, the recessed cradle, and the glass housing are handled tactilely. The rewilded forest frames the premise but remains somewhat atmospheric rather than pressure-bearing until the flood. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kael's fractured perception.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ziggurat observatory, obsidian dust circle, and magic square tile constrain the ritual's execution and charge the final image. Sensory economy is strong: "dusky harmony," "violet sky," "gossamer structure of iridescent gas." Spatial choreography tracks Kavi's movement through the uppermost floor clearly. Minor slip: the palace below is mentioned but functions only as atmospheric contrast, not as pressure or resource; the interregnum's chaos is told rather than shown affecting his access or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The soundless sanctuary is vividly established with non-walls and pervasive silence, constraining Elara's method (no speech). The music box cylinder and the materialized light are handled on the page, and the sanctuary's tearing silence charges the climax. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; the "outside reality shifts" are told rather than shown affecting choices within the sanctuary, and spatial choreography between Elara and the formless Vale is abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The obsidian mirror and petrified stump function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual and charges the closure image. Fog, frost, and orchard skeleton are filtered through Elara's professional lens (glass, silver, silica). Spatial choreography remains clear across the single scene. The mirror's transformation from empty to frost-mountain to empty again delivers the final reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard-in-rafters micro-setting constrains the mending choice (tools beside him, fissure accessible only at height) and charges the final image (climbing down, ribbon left behind). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "scent of apple blossoms and damp stone," "milky quartz," "faint lines of light." Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the climb and wrap. The body and recurring object (ribbon, seed) function as setting elements that alter tactics at closure, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly but losing points for minor over-reliance on the visual sense in the Heartwood description.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The astral orchard is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: "ghost-silver branches blossomed with starlight," "pistachio shell cameo blank," "droplets clinging to his eyelashes like miniature nebulae." The bathroom functions as effective micro-setting, providing the anchor Kaelen needs for clarity and constraining his inquiry to a focused, solitary moment. The recurring cameo shell charges the final image when he picks it up "with a steady hand" and returns to the orchard. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's paradoxical nature (nonlinear inheritance, temporal chaos) directly informs the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Scriptorium as living mountain bookstore is vividly rendered through sensory particulars: "rustle of vellum," "scent of decaying paper," "air growing still and heavy," "wall of seamless, living rock." The botanical diary functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains Elara's method and charges the final image (she clutches it at closure). Spatial choreography through tunnels and alcoves is coherent. The "Whispering Moss" and "Lector's Vine" ground the magic in tactile, lived-in detail that shapes her path and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned carnival ship is vividly particular: warped deck, skeletal rides, peeling carousel paint, corroded gate, glass-walled bridge. Fog and rust-salt tang anchor sensory texture, and the setting's decay mirrors Elara's fractured identity. The ship constrains her pilgrimage spatially (midway → Ferris wheel → bridge) and the final location (bridge as "nexus") shapes the climactic beat. Minor gap: the swatch card's physical interaction with surfaces (carousel horse, gate, console) is described but the tactile feedback and resistance are underexplored, leaving the sensory hierarchy slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered with specific detail (escapement wheel, chiming drum, governor mechanism). The setting actively constrains Elias's choices: he must work within the gears, and the rope's integration into the clockwork is spatially precise. The ceremonial rope and wax seal function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail (hum of energy, shimmer of rope, scent of old paper) is filtered through Elias's professional perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harmonic caves, echo chamber stone, and Chamber of First Frost constrain Kaelen's choices throughout: he must travel deeper into cold, extract specific ice, and use the stone's crystalline properties to achieve silence. The ice-sheet's fracture pattern is both map and tool, charging the closure image when the stone absorbs the hum. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through urgency—"needle-point of sound," "webbed with lacework of fractures"—and the caves' acoustics amplify stakes. The gently luminous light modulates from weary to steady, tracking emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass pavilion functions as both observatory and constraint, its dome serving as the lens for starlight that enables the final rekindling. Sensory detail is purposeful: "bruised twilight," "silver" starlight striping the floor, the floor's vibration. The post-collapse plains provide atmospheric grounding without over-describing. The prism itself—especially the "shard of hush"—acts as micro-setting, its tactile and acoustic properties (absorbing light, deepening silence) directly shaping Elian's final choice and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory dome, plinth, forecourt crystals, and shadow-casting monuments form a coherent micro-setting that constrains Kael's method (he needs lightning flashes and monument angles) and charges the closure (the unified chime validates his realization). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ozone-rich air," "wet, reflective ground," "colossal bolt that turned the world white." The setting is not merely backdrop—the storm's energy amplifies the trauma echoes, and the forecourt's spatial layout (glyph on perimeter, Lyra's outstretched hand) enables the discovery. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming fortress anchors spatially and sensorially from the opening: "ancient, grey stones surrendering to riots of moon-petal vines and blood-blossom moss." Micro-setting shines in the fissure that holds the knot and the inner bailey wall that becomes the schematic canvas. The luminous flora and cracked parapets are filtered through Kael's professional lens (fireworks designer noticing pattern, bloom, release). The fortress environment directly enables the final revelation—moon-petals weaving through stone constitute the blueprint—charging the closure image with setting-specific constraint and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto functions as threshold setting, its "walls encrusted with shells of beings who lived and died on the cusp of worlds" mirroring the transition theme. Micro-setting details—the snail on moss, the jade cicada in her palm—anchor perception and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (seated figures, grotto mouth, starlight). The setting constrains the intimate, liminal quality of the conversation and amplifies the stakes through its symbolic resonance with transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The trellis—"intangibly tangible," "crystalline framework...yet through which he could see"—constrains the peak choice by offering a silence that must be collected and carried rather than lived in permanently. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "ozone and nascent starlight," mist with "emotional" weight. The body itself functions as micro-setting; his "contracted muscles and spirit" fighting openness directly shapes the ascent's difficulty. The doll's changing meaning across spaces (bunker shelf to trellis to final precipice positioning) charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drifting prism terraces, Aether, storm glass, and spatial choreography (gondola gliding, dock departure) are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "sound of light striking the prism edges," "ghost of the train." The storm glass constrains a teaching beat by providing tactile proof of stability. The amethyst and rose quartz destination terrace charges the arrival image. Micro-setting (the gondola as workspace and the vial as tool) effectively narrows the frame to match the story's single-scene scope.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, crystalline trees, and Palimpsest Pillar are vivid and integral to the method. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The ruby flake indentation and the monolith's data-sealer layers function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's approach. Sensory detail (ozone, blooming metallophytes, tearing silk) is selective and POV-filtered. The hidden orchard charges the final image when the energy staircase coalesces. Minor slip: "deeply futuristic nostalgia" is told in summary rather than embodied through Elara's perception, and some proper nouns (Aethel System, Prime Conductor AI) anchor without enriching the immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen sanctuary under starlight and the cold iron ring constrain Elara's ritual choices, and Liam's suffocating room amplifies the shift when he breathes. Sensory selection—gritty ash, phantom chill, stale air—reflects each character's urgency and filters through their emotional states. The doorknocker ring's coldness turning warm at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling in ash, ring pressed to scar) is tactile and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm provides vivid sensory grounding (soft blue-green light, damp earth and ozone smell, fungal spires) and shapes the closure—the diamonds blanket the mycelia in starlight, recharging the setting's bio-glow with a new layer. The bolt is a micro-setting object that constrains choice: Elara uses it as both shield and channel against the Promise's psychic pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (deep shafts, cavern, circle of leaders), and the prismatic light cutting through serves as a concrete cue that narrows Elara's attention and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (decaying paper, polished mahogany, golden shadows) and the pedestal/moon-globe apparatus provides a concrete spatial anchor. The crank handle and pedestal constrain Elara's ritual, making the setting an active participant rather than backdrop. The golden shadows modulate from motion to stillness, charging the final image ("the eloquent sound of being found") with atmospheric resonance. No spatial confusion or floating geography mars the choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with silver-leafed trees, liquid moonlight fruit, obsidian dais, and glass panes that hum. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Kaelen's urgency (thin air, dissonant vibrations, sweet stardust scent). The clasp on his gauntlet constrains the final choice, and the obsidian dais serves as the orchard's heart where the ritual occurs. The micro-setting (gauntlet, lectern, dais) directly shapes the peak action and charges the final image with nebulae-dripping trees and chiming bells.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room's sensory anchors (decaying paper, binder's glue, dust patterns, raking light) are filtered through the archivist's professional attention and pressure discovery at every turn. Dust becomes forensic evidence that unlocks the fold; the button's "cold weight" and the lamp's raking light enable the revelation. The acid-free sleeve and archival card in the ending beat show the setting's tools charging the closure action. Micro-setting (the document itself, the blotter, the lamp) constrains and enables each step of the discovery, fully integrated into the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting constrains choice throughout: monitored thoroughfares force the puddle-map route, toxic marshes provide cover the Directorate ignores, the geothermal phone booth enables the broadcast node. The auric lagoon's bioluminescent pulse becomes the transmission medium in the final beat, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (phone booth interior, causeway, ankle-deep water) grounds spatial choreography. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency: metallic tang, salt, damp earth, golden light pulsing with her heartbeat. Minor: the permacrete towers and cracked pavement read slightly generic; one idiom-specific place name or architectural tell could sharpen locale.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    The radiant grotto and prism atrium supply vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail (blue-green luminescence, dripping cadence, fractured rainbows) filtered through Elias's vigilant attention. The saxophone as tool and the atrium as resonant structure constrain his method—he uses sympathetic vibration to starve the prophecy's acoustic space. Setting detail is layered (moss, ferns, stone teeth, fungi) and drives the closure image: dewdrops "hung heavy and perfect" after the hush is restored. Micro-setting (the atrium's facets, the mist) charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and purposeful: "perpetual twilight," "pale branches," "ashen veins" create coherent atmosphere. The moonstone speck's "coolness" and the mica monument anchor micro-setting that charges the final image when "viridian green wood" emerges beneath ash. Spatial choreography is clean (sorting bench, miniature landscape, monument spire). The arbor constrains Elian's world and supplies the medium (leaves, seeds) for his work, though the setting functions more as backdrop than active pressure on tactics until the transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Blackwood greenhouse, flagstone, and subterranean cavern are vivid and integral: the improvised fulcrum (sap, stone, resin) constrains the compass choice, and the waterfall's chaotic light charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective ("cool earth," "wet stone," "glittering black rock") and filtered through Elias's tinkerer priorities. The micro-setting (sap-and-stone fulcrum) shapes the key turn, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The foundry environment actively constrains and enables: the furnace is "for distilling memory," the slag pedestal holds the coin, the heated floor sizzles tears. Rain-washed metal and quenched coal establish sensory texture filtered through Kael's professional lens. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from furnace to pedestal to his stumbling approach at the end. The zodiac coin functions as micro-setting, constraining the entire ritual's mechanics and charging the final image when its crack fills with gold.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered (mist coiling, canyon walls, acoustics warped by pain) and the distorted harp notes function as both atmosphere and navigation tool. The crocodile's tooth is handled twice with tactile specificity (cool against skin, pressed to temple, warm at chest), and the spectral harp's transformation from overturned-and-snapped to righted-and-golden charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The sunrise frames the timeframe but does not materially constrain Silas's choices; it serves closure as metaphor rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and purposeful: light as "weight," "pressure," and "penance"; moss that feels like "crushed velvet"; the bone-white tree at the clearing's center. The pewter mask strap functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged at closure. The specific angle of his ankle on uneven ground triggers memory, demonstrating that environment constrains perception and choice. The humming frequency and UV light pressure guide Kaelen to the focal point and force the brace action.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's market is vividly anchored with specific sensory details (powdered sunsets, caged echoes, linseed oil and ozone) and filtered through the protagonist's professional lens. The lighthouse seascape painting and the lens fragment both function as micro-setting objects that constrain the protagonist's choice: the incorrect details signal the keyhole, and the lens enables the revelation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The market pressures the protagonist's search, and the tent's shadow and canvases guide the final act, charging the closure image with the corrected seascape and ghostly hand.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned circus ticket office supplies vivid, purposeful detail: peeling paint, cracked clowns, phantom popcorn smell, greasy lift mechanism, stained acoustic tiles. The dust accumulation pattern on the ceiling tile becomes the key constraint that enables discovery—Leo cannot find the barrel without analyzing the disturbance. The rusted ladder's screech and the trapped-time smell from above charge the sensory experience. The setting embodies the core concept of "cracks in the façade" and directly enables the climactic choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (crystalline trees, frosted pane, nebula-clouds) and the environment constrains the Operator's method—frost patterns form on glass because of temperature differential. The setting actively participates in the rupture: the pane dissolves, knowledge merges with clouds, new milky-glass trees grow. Spatial choreography is clear (plinth, pane, floor, archway) and the final image (open archway framing chaos) charges the closure by embodying the shift from cage to potential.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The baroque asteroid—"chiseled spires," "gilded filigree," "obsidian tabletop"—saturates every beat and directly enables the climax: reflective surfaces everywhere necessitate the covering ritual, isolating the shard for the reveal. Temporal squall mechanics (visible time lapping at the present) anchor the speculative premise and constrain Kaelen's action. The shard itself functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when it glows and delivers the vision. Sensory detail is POV-filtered ("frozen light," "edges sharp enough to draw blood or a memory") and the baroque excess thematically mirrors the First Ones' "frantic, beautiful attempt to build a dam of art." Gate test satisfied: environment shapes the peak choice and the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with acoustic wood, spun copper, and amplified micro-sounds, and it directly constrains Elias's final action by amplifying the chord that defeats the rust. The workshop's "pocket of clarity" contrasts the grey decay outside, and sensory detail (metallic tang, scent of blossoms) is selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The chamber's function charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement, though the broader city setting remains generic "sullen grey" without further specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting constrains choice: the fissure is revealed only after the factory closure dries the creek; the hinged stone requires the psychometry vision to locate; the lagoon's otherworldly petrichor is the story's anchor and closure charge. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("cool, mineral breath," "captured aurora," "wet stone and ancient starlight"). The limestone cliffs, subterranean maze, and lagoon form a coherent spatial ladder with clear choreography. Minor: the "waterlogged journal" and "bedroll" on the far shore are noted but not engaged, leaving a small thread of the lost expedition's physical presence inert.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archway functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it traps her during the storm, provides the projection surface, and its base becomes the canvas for her survival sculpture. Sensory detail is strong—"wind keened," "rain lashed," "sea-spray"—and filtered through her sculptor's attention to wood grain and stone. The final image charges when "driftwood scattered around her" transforms from art material to linguistic alphabet. Minor: the "sea-chest" appears conveniently without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting work is strong and purposeful: the amber pavilion frames the quest, the neglected cathedral quarter adds atmosphere, and the rose window itself becomes the puzzle that constrains Elara's method. The colored filters and angled light function as tools that enable discovery. The melting snow serves as temporal anchor and thematic echo. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and sensory details—dust motes, weak light, violet-filtered glow—are filtered through Elara's artist's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian lagoon, dunes, and beach debris anchor the psychic landscape with vivid specificity; the urchin skeleton and sea-worn glass are purposefully chosen to convey Kaelen's reframed message. The zeppelin library is sketched lightly—brass desk, porthole—but does not constrain choice within the frame story. Spatial choreography across the lagoon is clear. The micro-setting (beach detritus) charges the final image by enabling the parley's resolution, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cove is vividly anchored with sensory specificity ("salt-scoured air," "skeletons of lanterns," "anchor stone") and the paper lanterns function as micro-setting that charges the final image—they transform from death markers to vessels of revived life. Spatial choreography is clear (damp sand, water's edge, lines strung between posts) and the amber bottle's placement on the anchor stone shapes Kaelen's ritual focus. The setting constrains his method (he must work within the empty cove, no materials beyond memory) and the two glowing lanterns at closure reconfigure the visual field, moving from absence to nascent presence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard garden atop the Spire grounds the opening; sensory details (caramel-colored blank, diamond stylus, apple blossoms turning cloying) are purposeful and filtered through Elian's role. The foghorn's absence functions as negative space that charges the atmosphere. The museum memory supplies concrete setting (cavernous hall, polished brass, salt and dust) that enables the immersion method. Spatial choreography is clear. Minor gap: the garden itself does not constrain a choice at closure, capping the score below 8.5, but the contrast between beauty and threat sharpens the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium is vividly anchored with crystalline frost, frozen fractals, and cracking ice walls that firm at closure. Starlight operates as a persistent environmental detail, moving from "captive" to "patient" and charging the final image. The acorn cap functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining the method of restoration. Sensory hierarchy is strong: cool, cold, ozone, and luminescence are filtered through Elara's focused attention. The setting directly enables the central action (the vortex is housed here, the ice responds to her work) and the closure image of "garden of time" reweights the space.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The windblown sanctuary, floating peak, and stone interior are established early and remain coherent. The glue-drying patch on the console and the cathedral bell rope both constrain and enable the climax choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("fibrous length," "stone thrummed"). The setting charges the final image when the mountain itself "sings." Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8+ because the sanctuary's interior layout (monitors, capacitors, sacristy, rope path) is sketched rather than fully mapped in tactile action across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The yellow lantern glass constrains his perception method and charges the final image by filtering starlight into "a deliberate, final brushstroke." The tracking station's "dormant machinery" and "observation decks" anchor spatial action (he sweeps, polishes, uses guidance arms), and the Perseids meteor shower provides the temporal and sensory trigger for the climactic beat. The "velvet pouch," "main eyepiece," and "cold metal of the console" ground tactile choices. The body as micro-setting works well: his "breath fogging" and hands holding the glass embody his lived experience and constrain the empathic act.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scorched wasteland, desiccated hives, and brittle lavender constrain Elias's choices: the sundial and stone bench are spatial anchors that guide his action (kneeling, carrying the box, sitting). The stained glass box functions as micro-setting—its honeycomb interior charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "ochre dust," "phantom honey," "golden luminescence" filter through Elias's perceptive bias without catalog clutter. Spatial choreography is coherent across all beats. Minor slip: "heat haze" and "harsh and white" sunlight are slightly generic descriptors that could be more character-particular. The setting's evolution (phantom spring over dead garden) supports closure without forcing symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emerald silo is vividly specific and recurs across beats: it hums, glows, resonates, and ultimately functions as a memory storage device. The urn fragment is handled repeatedly and its willow branch detail charges the traveler's message and the final act. Sensory details are filtered through Kael's obsessive POV (the "metallic wound," the "translucent" panel). The silo constrains choice by containing the time capsule and enables the closure when the fragment activates the wall panel, meeting the 9+ gate for setting as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: cobalt lagoon, wet earth, brine, sea grapes, damp sand. The post-rain atmosphere ("burnished hush") modulates throughout and the driftwood seat anchors the weaving moment. The feather "nestled in a tangle of dark seaweed" functions as micro-setting that charges the closure by supplying the object that completes Kaelen's composition. Sensory detail is filtered through POV and the honeyed light at the end reweights the earlier bruised-purple clouds, giving the setting a clear role in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly anchored early ("monolithic pillars that held up the sky," "smooth and cool like a river stone") and constrain the final choice: the fissure in the pillar is the conductivity point Elias must find. The copper wire glistening "like a strange, metallic dew" and the viridian glow charge the closure image. Sensory details (metallic scent, loamy air, thrumming vibration through boots) are filtered through Elias's priorities as caretaker. The micro-setting (the fissure) enables the culminating act, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting details are filtered through Aris's professional lens ("psychogeographic resonance" vs. "priming through suggestive iconography") and constrain his path via the dusty footprints and sculpture trail. The rainwashed tower and spiraling footprint mandala charge the closure image directly—without that spatial convergence pattern, the realization collapses. Sensory hierarchy is selective and purposeful: scent of dogwood and damp earth, bronze quiet as ambient pressure, drizzle washing to gray light. The micro-setting of the amber in his palm recurs and its final placement at the nexus is spatially and thematically load-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The jetty's alien blooms, dead reef, and weathered fissure constrain the coachman's work: he finds a basin, prepares soil in cracks, places seeds in specific micro-environments. The setting charges the final image—dozens of soil patches breaking uniform grey—and the narrow/vast spatial opposition mirrors the thematic tension. Sensory detail is vivid (chemiluminescent blooms, cold stone, perfume/silence contradiction) and filtered through the coachman's purposeful attention. The body in space (kneeling, aching back) grounds the action.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scrapyard, wasteland, and geothermal cave are vivid and purposeful. The fissure's carved patterns constrain the search and the cave's warmth and fungi charge the final image, making environment essential to closure. Sensory detail (red dust, phosphorescent fungi, geothermal steam) is selective and filtered through Elara's focus. Spatial choreography across the two-day journey remains clear without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    The accretion disk, observation deck, and the sketchbook create vivid anchors. The gilded compass rose applique charges the final image when Elara reassesses its "rigid points" as "quaintly simplistic," constraining her choice to reject fixed direction. Sensory detail (pulsar light arriving in "slow, syrupy waves," charcoal "gritty between her fingers") is filtered through her temporal perception. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Crysolith Spire and "wrong sky" (viridian nebula, fractured moon) anchor setting early and constrain choice: Kael must climb during this celestial window, use the nebula's green glow for the light trick. The brass sundial lid (useless for broken time, useful for catching light) is micro-setting that directly enables the distraction. Spatial choreography inside the observatory is clean: window, chessboard, far wall prism. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven ("frosted ledges," "eerie green glow," "voices that were not wind").

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Great Dome's whispering gallery actively constrains action: the Regent's voice "sliding along curved marble," Elara's footsteps spelling letters on dusty floor, the tapping from the high barred window amplified by acoustics. The obsidian chessboard missing pawns anchors spatial choreography and symbolic weight, recurring as Elara stops "directly before" it at the climax. Micro-setting (gallery perimeter, barred window) channels choices and charges the final image of the unlocking door's groan echoing through the space.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinthine bookstore supplies concrete micro-settings (cart of cartography, hollowed-out book chamber with grimy skylight, glass-domed aviary) that gate Elara's search and constrain her path. The stone and feather function as tactile anchors that enable the closure act—tracing texture becomes the method. The final image of herbs in teacups and cleared pathways charges the space with her new rootedness. Sensory hierarchy is controlled (scent of vellum vs. salt-sprayed docks) and filtered through her evasive attention until she chooses to "feel the mountain around her."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The petrified fountain, frozen milkmaid, and suspended hammer establish the time-locked village vividly. The tapestry's frayed border constrains the decoding choice and charges the final image when the hush unravels. Sensory detail—cool platinum weight, gut-shaking thunder, cleansing rain—filters through Elias's chess-tutor perception. The setting functions as more than backdrop; it supplies the cipher that unlocks his absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon's unique acoustics constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when echoes refract her question into fragments. "Towers of bone," "marrow-paths," and "hollow of a massive vertebra" create a consistent skeletal architecture. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: the mist, the "forged hush," the canyon's currents. The pale spire functions as spatial anchor and thematic marker throughout. The environment does more than backdrop; it becomes the instrument of her defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bathysphere, acid sea, and Observer statue constrain the entire sequence: the single-breath timeframe forces urgency, the caustic environment shapes the saint's ruin cartography, and the chamber's glass boundary holds back the leviathan shadow. The coral charm functions as micro-setting, anchoring Elara's past world and charging the final act. Sensory detail is purposeful—"phantom scent of soil after rain," "screaming green tumult"—and filtered through alchemical focus. The gears-and-cogs workshop floats credibly in this post-Miasma world.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network and hidden oasis constrain the journey and charge the final image: the "perfect circle of daylight," "impossibly clear water," and "pale stones" are selective and purposeful, grounding the closure act. The painted seashell functions as micro-setting, its colors igniting "one last time" in the light before sinking. Spatial choreography is coherent (tunnel descent, cavern opening, pool edge). The setting is filtered through Elias's painter's eye ("grey moods of the sea," "impossible green"), meeting the perceptual-priority test and directly enabling the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lighthouse and predawn setting are vividly established with purposeful sensory detail ("world outside a predawn bruise of purple and indigo"). The vial cork functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The fog's vanishing at the end is asserted rather than shown through environmental cues, and the timeframe (dawn breaking) could more actively pressure the action rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The starlit signal station is vividly rendered with selective detail: obsidian sky, gantry, rooftop array, bakelite phone. The censer foot's tactile weight and warmth, the wind's moan, and the starlight feeling "solid" create embodied presence. The environment constrains Elias's project (defunct transmitter parts, rooftop exposure) and the final array is spatially coherent. The censer foot's placement at the heart of the array charges the closure image, satisfying the micro-setting criterion. Minor: the "great push outward" and reverse migration remain abstract backdrop rather than concrete geography.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hanging orchard and ravine setting constrain Elias's choices throughout: isolation provides psychological safety, the storm supplies the required "profound environmental turmoil" for attunement, and the damaged-but-holding orchard mirrors his fractured endurance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wind screamed," "sheets of rain hammered," "cerulean iris," "cool and heavy"). The neighbor's voice "echoing in the clean air" after the storm provides spatial choreography and tests the relic's effect. The glass eye on the mantelpiece charges the final image, transforming from desperate purchase to "silent, cerulean guardian."

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam constrain perception and charge the atmosphere throughout. The boutonnière itself functions as micro-setting: Silas touches it repeatedly, and each contact narrows his understanding until the final shelf placement. The beam's "rhythmic path through the fog, a metronome for his thoughts" integrates environment into his investigative process. Sensory details—"wet, shifting colors," "salt-bleached piling," "desiccated petals"—are filtered through Silas's thirty-year familiarity and serve closure: the high shelf "reserved for the most curious treasures" transforms the flower into monument.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    The blooming cavern is vivid and purposeful: ghostly fungi, translucent flowers, night-blooming jasmine scent create atmosphere that supports the "doorway of decisions" concept. The chip (tool/object) constrains the final choice—its warmth and projected light key the archway, charging the closure image. The rising creek functions as environmental pressure, narrowing the window. Spatial choreography is clean (shop → fissure → grotto → archway). Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's grief-laden perspective without catalog excess. The setting enables the peak moment and reconfigures meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight constrain the climactic choice: the light's beauty is the peril. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"viscous drops," "cold diamonds," the hum—and filtered through Elara's disenchantment. The fireflies offer a purposeful tonal pivot. Spatial choreography across the climb and inside the grotto remains clear. Minor: the kingdom below is sketched minimally, but sufficient for this single-scene frame.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Ember Nexus functions as active setting—residual magic justifies the alchemy and the dusk/twilight palette mirrors the fading friendship. The failed sphere, nautilus shell, and final living sun are handled objects that constrain and enable choices. Spatial choreography is clean (standing close, handing the sphere). Minor limitation: the setting could pressure a choice more directly; currently it's atmospheric backdrop rather than obstacle, keeping this shy of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cabin's rough-hewn walls, grimy window, and pine-needle scent are filtered through the narrator's crisis and constrain his options (no escape route except inward). The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting, anchoring the chronicling task in tactile detail. The aerial view during the flight sequence reweights the landscape ("the clearing where I'd imagined the grave might be, a patch of earth no different from any other"), charging the final return to the table. Spatial choreography during the flight is slightly abstract but serves the waking-trance logic.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The water clock shop is purposeful and specific: drips measure time in "liquid heartbeats," clepsydra and brass gears anchor the space, fog presses against the window. The micro-setting—Elara's workbench with beaker, calipers, and velvet box—constrains the reading action and charges the final image when sunlight pierces fog and hits "the dusty floor." Sensory hierarchy reflects POV: she notices texture and weight (cool glass, dense screw) because smell is gone. The environment subtly mirrors internal state (muffled world/muffled grief) without overt symbolism. The bell's shift from "muted, apologetic" to "clearer, brighter" tracks emotional arc through setting detail.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating platform "adrift in an ocean of silent, blue air" and "saturated hush" create a vivid, purposeful sensory frame. Spatial choreography is clear: low-slung cedar table, crow quill, granite disc, abyss below. The setting charges the final image: glittering dust dissolves into imperceptible currents from the abyss, and the breath "between storms" anchors the temporal pressure. Sensory detail—moss-slicked stone, cool air, the trimmed quill tip—is filtered through Elian's scholarly yet crisis-sharpened perception and constrains the ritual's intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive's "towering shelves," "dusty lectern," and "grimy windows" create spatial coherence. The perfume bottle (silver filigree, cool glass) and the sheet music with iron gall ink become tactile anchors that constrain Vex's ritual setup. The scent of lilac "eclipsing the dust and decay" reweights the final beat, and the pale grey light + diesel growl charge the ending with temporal inevitability. Sensory hierarchy is strong: ozone, lilac, vibration in teeth all serve the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Ancient Temple Library is vividly rendered: obsidian floor, spiraling shelves, central dais. These details are filtered through the Witness's perception and constrain her path inward, satisfying the micro-setting criterion. The dictionary as recurring object charges the final image when she lets it fall, and the "resounding hush" functions as atmosphere that modulates with her approach to the center. Setting meets all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and directly shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fjord/station setting is vivid and selective: "granite shelf high above the water," "low sun from the high window," and the sealed hydraulic system all constrain Elias's perception and the impossibility of ice formation. The micro-setting of the escapement mechanism and the obsidian razor edge functions as the story's pressure point, charging the final image when the ice shard is discovered there. Spatial choreography is clean; the Grand Chronometer's cathedral scale and the glacial melt detail both ground and elevate the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rainwashed library, subway cars, and rail-yard balcony are anchored with selective sensory detail (tarnished frame, smoky shields, humid summer air). The mica pane and lantern function as micro-setting objects that constrain her journey and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across train cars and the maintenance stairwell remains legible. One miss: the subway system's texture could have filtered more through Aris's probability-trained perception to sharpen POV specificity and raise setting above functional backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The concrete alcove (damp earth, ozone, bundled cables, distant train rumble) is vivid and selective. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, constraining the method and charging the final beat when Silas returns it to the pouch. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not constrain a choice that alters the outcome, but it charges the atmosphere and method throughout, meeting the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive's "scent of aging paper and preservation" and the workshop's ceramic dish ground the early beats. The blooming jetty at twilight is vivid and constrains the encounter spatially, charging the final image with the phosphorescent buds as both setting and symbolic recursion. The walnut-stained fingers and the chemical bath ("color of strong tea") provide tactile, occupation-specific anchoring. No orientation debt; the micro-setting (locket, dish, jetty planks) shapes choices and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered (ivy-draped clock, vaulted glass ceiling, splintered trolley, pigeon-filled rafters) and constrains Silas's choice: the station's physical decay and romantic ruin enable the fairytale he engineers. The clock's frozen hands anchor the myth and reappear at closure ("Under the ivy-choked clock"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (moss on brick, pockmarked moon rock). Spatial choreography is clear (ticketing office shadows, side door, back platform, fire barrel). The setting charges the final image by providing both the object of the rumor and the literal ground for community-building, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as active pressure: its "deafening orchestra" and "crushing soundscape" constrain Kaelen's sensory navigation and motivate the quest. Tactile micro-setting (silverleaf frond, ironwood trunk, crystalline rivers, fossilized flower) provides specific touchpoints that enable his dowsing method and are filtered through his blindness. The final environment—moss curtain and unified chord—charges the closure image by transforming cacophony into harmony. Spatial choreography remains clear across the multi-day journey, and sensory hierarchy reflects his professional dowsing priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as both constraint (warping spacetime to fold time) and atmosphere (weight, pressure, embrace). The dried pen recurs with changing valence (failure monument → testament) and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; the console, anomaly, and pen anchor Kaelen's choices. The station's "cloister" shift from cage to comfort mirrors internal change without overt symbolism. Minor: occupational details (signal interpretation, data streams) remain efficient and don't bloat the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous harbor is vivid and specific (corroded pylons, waterlogged bench, collapsed pier), with moonlight turning water to "rippling sheet of silver." The camera functions as a tool that constrains Elian's method: he frames, clicks, then translates. The ferry landing's "hole in the world" charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean as Elian moves along the wharf. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop for his ritual rather than applying immediate pressure or altering his tactics; he progresses unimpeded through each location.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archive is concretely rendered: "dust-choked silence," "scent of petrified paper and time," basalt walls, and a high window fissure that the tapestry-lens exploits. These details constrain Kaelen's detective moves—he must align fabric-weave with afternoon sun—and the micro-setting (easel, canvas, frame initials) supplies the closure pivot. Spatial choreography is clean across five years of solitude compressed into a single scene of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sensory lab ("sound wave garden") is seeded early, anchored with concrete detail (emitters, receivers, central diagnostic slab), and functions as micro-setting by enabling the climactic transformation—drumming on the slab triggers the light projection. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities (tactile drumming, visual starlight, the "cool weight of his hand"). The facility's "profound stillness" and "hush of the universe inhaling" set tone and constrain the moment she acts. The auric lagoon charges the final image directly, fulfilling the body/tool/recurring-object gate for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective detail (rust-streaked boxes, eerie aurora light, echoing canyons) that reflects Silas's professional POV. The geomagnetic storm disables technology, forcing reliance on celestial navigation—a concrete constraint that shapes his tactics. The manufacturer's plate and recessed rivet are micro-setting elements that enable the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt dock, wet pilings, and shuttered cottage create a coherent spatial frame. The dental mirror and gas lamp constrain Kaelen's method—only these tools enable the precise beam. The "single line of light" left through the final shutter-slat charges the closure image with a micro-setting detail that embodies the promise. Sensory selection (gleaming cobalt, cold ache, heavy air) reflects urgency and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are vivid and purposeful; the grotto amplifies Elias's attribute and supplies the stone, which he uses to focus his will at closure. Mist and starlight create consistent atmosphere. The ninth-bell timing and window-display geography are clear enough for the single-scene frame. The stone charges the final image with "internal warmth," meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sublittoral fringe is both named and functional: the unnaturally low tide exposes the petrified roots, enabling the detachment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (salt-crusted shed, wet earth, primeval blossoms, cascading brine). The scrimshaw's grooves and the whale's etched eye are tactile and charged. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from docks to cove to rising island. Minor: "mossy stone" appears suddenly under Kaelen's feet without prior anchoring of the island's surfacing mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The farmhouse kitchen, turbine thrum, and dried bouquet function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the noise is a "monstrous, uncaring heart," the table a stage for private rebellion. The wood shavings and ceramic mug are handled in ways that reveal character priorities (performance vs. privacy). The turbines' indifference charges the final image. Slightly short of 8.5+ because the setting's role is atmospheric and symbolic more than it directly alters a tactical choice, but it does supply the spatial and sensory frame for the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt atrium, unglazed arches, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly established and filtered through Kael's aesthetic sensibility ("lantern-moth hush," "sheet of polished bone"). The colonnade's pulsing light and thrumming sound constrain Kael's approach—he must "let go" and "allow his own sense of self to soften"—and the final image of the frozen lake as "blank page" charges the ending. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful, though the space itself does not alter tactics in a concrete way beyond framing the immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glassblower's courtyard is vividly anchored with kiln, cooling rack, clay wall, and firelight. Elian's cot and Vex's workspace create a lived-in space. The concertina reed tongue and glass resonator are handled concretely—Vex seals the reed, Elian blows across the hole—and the tool (glass vessel) directly enables the closure beat. The "phoenix rises" timeframe colors the palette (ash, smoke, scarred world) but remains atmospheric rather than constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The laboratory is vividly rendered ("scent of ozone and dust," "shafts of light"), and the carillon's semi-circle of crystal bells provides spatial grounding. The miner's lens constrains the climactic choice—without its specific refractive properties, the solution fails. However, the setting doesn't evolve; the "golden shadows" remain static decoration until the final glow. The "unstable times" and "power grid stabilization" are gestured at but never pressure the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's "infinitely layered curtains of intention" is a vivid central image that constrains and enables key beats—her curiosity opens them, his projector uses them as lens. The spatial choreography is clean: rotunda, eastern wing, central dais. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (polished obsidian, vellum texture, projected starlight). The "genuinely artificial" cosmos functions as both setting and thematic anchor, directly shaping the closure image when Elias projects the constellations through the vellum.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The loft setting—exposed brick, rain-beaded skylight, wide oak table, single low-hanging bulb—is vivid and layered with sensory detail that filters through Elara's professional focus. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting: it's a tactile anchor inherited from her father, used on the page to map the card array, and its worn smoothness signals repeated use. The rain operates as atmospheric pressure throughout, and the final skylight image recurs with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography is clean: Elara at the table, Julian opposite, cards and tape between them. The environment subtly guides the reader's attention without becoming a static catalog, and the tape constrains Elara's method—she uses it to "give dimension to the intangible," a choice that shapes her demonstration to Julian.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is anchored early with concrete details (saffron veil, bronze prism, cavern fissure, ozone scent). The pagoda functions as both setting and tool, constraining her movements and enabling the ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the sequence. However, the archive itself remains somewhat generic—"lost civilization archive" could describe many fantasy settings—and the environment doesn't pressure her choices as much as facilitate them.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Lumina-Arbor as blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful; the console, pearl, and river stone constrain Kael's ritual. The holographic panes and light-vines are integrated into action. Spatial choreography is clean. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's professional lens (spectral light-vines, wilted sections, twilight staining clouds). The micro-setting (console, stone) charges the final image when the stone hums with warmth. Penalize slightly for the phrase "memories cultivated like orchids" and "light-vines" which read as slightly ornamental rather than mechanically necessary, and the window view of the "cloud-sea" adds atmosphere without altering a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The workshop under fog and stars functions as sanctuary and crucible, pressuring Elias's focus and framing the final star-piercing image that charges hope. The prosthetic itself—grain-of-rice scale, velvet cloth, magnifier—constrains his delicate task and charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective (damp earth, medicinal herbs, terrarium shimmer) and filtered through his professional lens. No 9+ gate met: the setting enables but does not force a key choice; it enriches rather than constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tower's ivy vine functions as micro-setting that constrains Elias's choice: its memory of being pruned contrasts his fragmentation, and its final withdrawal mirrors his panic, charging the closure moment. The frosted hourglass operates as weighted symbolic object. Coffee rings on the yellowed map provide tactile ritual grounding. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered (chemical scent, bitter coffee, stone window frame). The setting directly participates in the ending: "meteor hush remained, heavier than before."

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The projection booth's dust, grimy glass, and ancient ventilation hum are specific and purposeful. The booth functions as both literal perch and metaphorical vessel for Arthur's archived longing. Sensory selection is tight: "taste of rust and regret," "celluloid cool and sharp," velvet cushion under klieg light. The setting charges the final image—love absorbed into "plush red velvet of the seats, gilded proscenium arch, dust motes"—making the space itself the answer to Elara's question. The recurring film strip and theater architecture constrain the vision's unfolding and supply the resolution's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The aurora-lit archway frames action throughout: it is the chosen perch, the meditation site, and the threshold where the cosmic insight arrives. The astronomical instrument (brass rings, lenses, diamond stylus, smoked glass) constrains her nightly ritual and is pushed aside at closure when her creative act shifts from celestial tracing to human portraiture. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"sky bled green and violet," "ghostly fire," "smoked glass," charcoal "a sliver of the night sky"—and filtered through Elara's psychic sensitivity. The high peaks and valley geography are spatially coherent. Minor: the "worn leather satchel" appears late without prior setup, a small convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting constrains choice: the dune's fragile peace and shimmering blooms react to the memory spike, making erasure versus synthesis legible. The crystalline tree charges the final image by merging sand-glow with pine geometry. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kaelen's professional priorities (ghost-pale flora, resinous scent). Minor gap: spatial choreography of the skiff cockpit versus the surrounding dune is loose; we do not see Kaelen exit or physically approach the tree, slightly weakening embodiment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: "filigree of brass and steel," "lubricating oils," "clockwork automata." The crystalline tree functions as both environment and symbolic nexus, and the protagonist's navigation method—wind acoustics—integrates setting into action throughout. The quartz tree's "cathedral-like" structure and symphony constrain the protagonist's final choice to stop and listen, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the philosopher's priorities (sound over sight), and the setting evolves causally from copper moss to ironwood to quartz. The environment meets the 9+ gate by shaping the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The veiled ridgeway, misty promontory, and sea of clouds constrain movement and filter perception through scent (jasmine) and light (moonlight on leaves). The ticket punch and kelp ticket function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image: the star stamp's luminescence ties directly to Elara's heartbeat and her choice to walk forward. Spatial choreography (stone → hills → promontory → ridgeway alone) tracks cleanly. The setting subtly mirrors internal state (mist clearing as willingness grows) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt fortress, unused spiral staircase, rust-colored stain on the nineteenth step, and the bolt itself form a coherent micro-setting that constrains Elias's choices and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (room 313, stairwell, tray on floor), and sensory detail is selective and purposeful (snow whisper, dusty gloom, cold metal threads). The environment is filtered through Elias's professional and emotional priorities; the staircase becomes his "secret cathedral," and the stain anchors his guilt without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Athenaeum is vividly rendered with petrified wood, vellum scrolls, basalt pedestal, and the star-chart lectern under captured starlight. The library functions as micro-setting: the pellet's placement on the map directly over the false star constrains the ritual's mechanics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's professional priorities (script, symbols, light streams). The dome of frozen constellations structures the window of action and resumes motion at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The monitoring station functions as both prison and micro-setting constraint: the console is the anchor for tapping, the viewport frames the bleached reef and later the resurrected vision. Sensory detail is purposeful—"cool metal casing," "shimmering like heat haze," bioluminescent coral colors—and filtered through Aris's scientific yet grieving POV. The station's spatial economy (single chamber, viewport, console) remains coherent. The atlas page as recurring object charges the final image when its spiral notation unlocks the sequence, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The spaceport repair bay is vivid and purposeful: ferrocrete, scorch marks, shattered dome, dormant gantries. The obsidian monoliths embedded in the floor constrain Elara's method—she must align them precisely and touch the central stone. The "margin of daylight" timeframe tightens the window for the ritual, and the body (bare feet on cool metal, palms flat on stone) anchors the scene tactilely. The setting charges the final image when console lights flicker and the satellite blinks, transforming the graveyard into a living network.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The geothermal setting is vivid and specific: sulfurous steam, basalt shelf, extremophilic ferns, thermophilic algae, mineral-rich water. It constrains Elara's choice—only this vent matches the ancient formula—and supplies the resources (algae enzymes, thermal regulation via ferns) that enable the unsealing. The sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities (green-and-red consciousness, ozone smell, wet earth), and the environment charges the final image as the embryo absorbs the slurry. Micro-setting elements (water chemistry, rock face) actively shape the climax, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The arboretum constrains choice: its glass walls mute the surf, creating acoustic conditions where the drone's thrumming becomes inescapable. The Wollemi pine returns at closure charged with new weight (a species that "survived ice ages and cataclysms" mirrors Anya's endurance). Soil under thumbnail and pine resin are grounding anchors during the panic sequence. Minor limit: the automated lighthouse and "after the last lighthouse keeper" frame remains atmospheric rather than pressuring a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse's circular stone room, closing walls, and spiral staircase all constrain and charge the protagonist's choices—the space literally pressures him and provides the architectural mirror for his spiral design. Sensory details (salt-laced dust, brittle spine cracking, groaning floorboards) are selective and filtered through his artist's attention. The sweeping lighthouse beam functions as metronome, shaping the work rhythm and final "gentle, knowing glow." Micro-setting (the floor itself) becomes the canvas for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting details are selective and voice-filtered: "wind-carved encampment," "rust-colored sandstone," "hollow scooped from the rock by millennia of patient wind." The basin worn smooth by gales serves as both canvas and tool, constraining Kael's method and charging the final act. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (the drone's "irritating needle" hum during high focus). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the world's "consciously wild" ethos pressures the drone's presence as blasphemy.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frost-rimmed vaults, ventilation whisper, and blizzard insulation create a tactile, oppressive atmosphere. The archaic terminal and pneumatic tubes ground the climactic choice in a concrete location that enables the act. The "library under snow" and "dizzying quiet" recur with shifted valence at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (descent into substructures, return to observatory window) remains clear and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dome and rose farm constrain choice throughout: the "engraved quiet" versus the "chaos outside" frames Elara's stance, and the setting's peace is tested by the knife's presence. The sandbag scrap under her knees is handled twice (opening and mid-scene rustle), anchoring micro-setting. The knife on the potting bench amid "clay shards and seed packets" creates spatial pressure. The final image—kneeling "directly on the cool floor"—marks a shift from cushioned distance to full commitment, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with crystallized frequencies, petrified chords, and valleys of muted bass, and it actively shapes Kaelen's path through shockwaves and chasms. The rail spike functions as a divining rod that reveals "footprints of silence" through tactile feedback (thud vs. ring), constraining his navigation. The garden's architecture shifts due to the sleepwalking constellations, forcing backtracking and lateral moves. The final hollow—a "perfect sphere of absolute quiet"—serves as the climactic arena, and the spike's interaction with the silent floor charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory above the clouds is vivid and atmospheric, anchoring the protagonist's remove from "messy headlines" below. The rosewood nib, mahogany desk, and telescope supply concrete micro-setting that charges the final image. The setting does not, however, constrain Celeste's choices—she could conduct the same phone call anywhere—so it remains more stage than crucible. Strong sensory detail and POV-filtered particulars (the hum of the dome's rotation, star-dusted velvet sky) elevate the score without reaching the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The studio lamp, amber, and the Laboratory's cold servers provide tactile grounding. The amber constrains the closure choice: its sharp edge becomes the etching tool, and its smooth surface contrasts the cold machine, charging the final image when he places it as a "golden tombstone." Spatial choreography remains clear across the studio and Laboratory. The "city's old broadcasting district" and "concrete monolith" are slightly generic but functional; the micro-setting (amber, metal panel, server casing) drives the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto's damp archways, mist, and acoustics anchor the setting early and constrain the narrative (a place famous for echoes now holds only sourceless ones). The whispering gallery tile flake functions as micro-setting-as-object, and Elara's kneeling on "smooth, stone floor" grounds the mandala work tactilely. The grotto's physical properties (perfect acoustics lost, stone surface for sand) directly enable the climactic act, charging the closure image with spatial resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The plaza, shattered sky, crumbling walls, and mosaic stepping stone are specific and consistent. The tessera's lapis lazuli surface and the stone's circuit-like cracks ground the magic system in tactile detail. The stepping stone directly enables the renaming action, and the setting's post-fire ruin charges the atmosphere without becoming a postcard. Spatial choreography (Kaelen kneeling, placing the tessera, touching temples) is clear. The environment constrains the method and appears in the final gaze at the sky, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hedge maze, Chronos Tree, and nighttime frame are signaled early and charge the final image (the blossom unfurling as Julian's "final bow"). Sensory details—warm yellow sunlight on Elara's neck, cider-sparkle laughter, Moon-Blossom scent "like silver and honey"—are vivid and POV-filtered through Julian's synesthetic perception. However, spatial choreography is light (we never track Elara's path or Julian's drift beyond "central clearing"), and the maze itself does not constrain a choice; it functions more as atmospheric container than tactical pressure. The piece satisfies micro-setting allowance (body/tool/object) through the tarot coin and tree bud, both of which charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    The light painting studio functions as micro-setting that enables the experiment and charges the final images. The muscovite geode sliver constrains choice (it's a conduit or placebo) and appears at closure, catching light and anchoring their signal. Sensory detail is selective: the "small red light a lone star," the "cavernous dark," the hum of studio lights returning. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (remote, shutter, LED wand, camera screen). The studio's darkness and the geode's layered structure both pressure the proof Elias seeks and deliver the visual metaphor at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cave network is vividly rendered with mineral tang, ozone, cathedral chamber, tidal archway, and ceiling fissure. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → narrow passage → vast chamber. The environment constrains choice (she must squeeze through, tide timing affects energy ebb) and charges the final image (the resonant field enables floating, the waveform capture). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her professional lens (heat-map colors, sensor display flicker). The elm leaf fossil functions as micro-setting anchor, grounding her analytical mind.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber warehouse is vividly particular: "sunlight struggled through grimy, resin-caked windows," "canyons of forgotten things," the great hourglass as physical clock. The cataloging table and its thousands of buttons ground Kaelen's work in tactile detail. Sensory selection reflects urgency: dim light, whisper-thin sand trickle, "unearthed silence" all reinforce the quiet, monastic atmosphere. The warehouse constrains choice by housing both the prophecy jar and the exit doors; the cliffs frame his final act of stepping "into the dawn." The burn-scarred wooden toggle is the story's strongest setting-as-constraint object—it came from the fire-warden's cloak, embedding the ignored warning in physical form.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Zephyr Bluff's mist and melting snow function as more than backdrop: the ephemeral setting justifies the dead-drop method and the temporal urgency (morning sun will erase the message). The pillbox's polished surface as a mirror adds micro-setting utility. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("damp rock," "breath pluming"). The setting constrains the information exchange and charges the final image of dawn lightening the mist, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fog-bound crossing, ferry dock sounds (chain clank, hammering, bell), and the yarn needle function as micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's professional priorities (ambient awareness honed by "lightless roads") and the rain's cessation marks the moment silence permits understanding. The needle—concrete tool for mending—anchors both memory and the resolution metaphor (designed "to join, to finish, to make whole"), meeting the 9+ gate test by constraining a reflective choice and charging closure. Spatial choreography (coach, moored ferry just out of sight, river pylons) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oasis setting constrains Kaelen's choices throughout: hexagonal hive shadows guide his tracking of light angles, the collapsed irrigation channel becomes the object he must repair, the spring is "the oasis's heart." Micro-setting elements (alluvial clay patch, rose bush against stone wall) charge the final image when his potter's hands shape earth "back into its purpose." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his craftsman's perception (clay "familiar and cool beneath his fingers"). The wasteland contrast creates urgent context without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fire escape, harbor, and the specific sliver of glass between blinds and sill create a coherent micro-setting. The lockmaster's tooth becomes tool-as-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's gardener's attention. The piece does not require broader occupational systems at this length; the father's locksmith trade functions as motivational backstory without exposition drag.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal library's "atomically reflective floor" constrains the peak choice by mirroring the extinct creatures, turning the abstract memory problem into a visible, spatial encounter. The brass sundial anchors the opening and closing beats, reweighted from "measuring a lost day" to "a focal point for harmony." Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("mist and starlight," "coarse fur," "liquid eyes"), filtered through Kael's POV. The hum of the stone circle provides tactile grounding that shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and wet post-rain surfaces are vividly rendered and sustain a coherent sensory palette. The "prismatic quiet" and "thousand fractured rainbows" charge the final image, making light and water active contributors to Elara's shift. The nest object and the installation's lattice function as micro-setting that constrains her choice (where to place it, whether to release it). Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The radio station is vivid and specific ("dusty bubble of analog warmth," "bakelite cool and solid," vacuum tubes and copper wire) and constrains her choice: she transmits via the station's carrier wave using salvaged equipment. The astronomical charts, waveform generator, and VU meters are handled objects that pressure tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ozone and dust, the low thrum). The micro-setting functions as the sole arena for her rebellion, charging the final image of her lonely vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nexus's impossible geometry and the organ constrain Elias's choices: he must play the chord to unlock the space, and the compass point's target (the keystone) is spatially specific. Sensory detail is vivid ("scent of damp earth and ozone," "pipes coated in a thick velvet of dust") and the final circular passage charges the closure image. However, "starlight," "fallow period," and the church ruin remain atmospheric rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry setting is vivid and particular: "cold, wet mist," "brutal, sharp geometry of the excavated stone," granite walls, flat rock table. The environment actively shapes Elias's ritual—the stone/mist duality becomes his canvas subject, the rough cold stone serves as his work surface, and the physical void mirrors the conceptual void he's exploring. The ribbon fragment touching stone creates a charged tactile moment that drives the painting's conceptual core. Setting constrains method and charges the final image of wound/void.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The weather station's "spongey dread" anchors atmosphere throughout and modulates at closure ("beginning to dry"). The copper nail, basalt monolith, and oilskin pouch constrain the physical quest and charge the ending image. Sensory detail is purposeful (biting wind, streaked lichen, grinding sound). However, the station itself remains somewhat generic; occupational detail (map librarian's tools, drone programming) is functional but not deeply integrated into choices. The cove's transformation post-Shift provides world-building but doesn't actively complicate tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain pullout, bridge scaffold, and glass flake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ozone tang, resinous pine, iridescent grid). The scaffold wrap's fluttering pattern constrains Elias's final choice: he must decode it to proceed, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The piece does not exceed 7.2 because the environment does not evolve causally or supply a resource that alters tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and purposeful: "rust and dusky harmony," the clown mask, the acrobat's slipper, the hand-cranked music box all constrain Elias's tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his perceptive calm. Minor slip: the startup's "surrounding acreage" and "main access path" remain spatially vague, but the micro-setting of the train itself does the necessary work.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is grounded early with tactile details (cold copper eyepiece, gears whispering, dusty room). The variable star RR Lyrae and the refractor mechanism constrain Elian's method and charge the closure—without the observatory's tools and silence, the final transcription loses its spatial anchor. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: the dream sequence narrows to glowing ideograms, the waking dawn brings "pale blue" and "gentle gold." Minor gap: the Sunken Temple remains abstract; we never learn its geography or the civilization's identity, which slightly limits specificity. The daylily telegram functions as micro-setting (object-as-anchor) and returns with reweighted meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vortex, petrified soil, and blanched reeds anchor spatial pressure; the gnarled branch at the nexus becomes a constraint that must be unbent to achieve closure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("black as obsidian glass," "bark pale as bone," "frozen blossoms a constant, silent scream"). The flesh-eating plant seed functions as micro-setting object, its planting in soft mud at story's end charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ritual circles and final center-walk.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt glade, weirwood throne, and moonpetals establish vivid atmosphere early. The maze topiary clipping functions as micro-setting: it's handled, grows hot, and its "dense, orderly structure" becomes a key that unlocks chaos—constraining her choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (she's fused to the tree, looking both into the glade and into dream-space). The "cobalt light swirling with impossible colors" at the moment of connection integrates setting into action. Minor deduction: the ozone/moonpetal scent is evocative but doesn't return to shape a later beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: phosphorescent moss, silver-barked saplings, bone-rich soil. The environment constrains Aris's method (he must fill the void, not fight it) and supplies the femur that the root finally touches—charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quarry setting is established early and used strategically: "vast limestone pit lay silent, a great scooped-out void" functions as objective correlative and then transforms in the final paragraph to "no longer felt like a wound in the earth. It was just a place." The micro-setting of the workbench with gooseneck lamp, the bar fridge hum, and the shoebox anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The speaker grille cloth's material specificity ("Mid-90s Marshall, salt-and-pepper basketweave") and the micro-cassette recorder's "cheap plastic casing" provide tactile anchors that constrain the physical struggle. The quarry's echo-valley quality charges the final image, making environment integral to closure rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly particular—"low thrum," "central node," field lines guiding vines—and constrains Elara's choice to plant near the strongest field, charging the final image when the hum shifts semitones. The seed's physical weight ("dense, like a collapsed star") and the luminescent filament anchor sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean: garden lattices, nutrient bed, central node. The "blue emptiness above the clouds" and "silver-leafed vines" create a distinct locale without tourist catalog, filtered through Elara's grief and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal atrium is concretely realized: crystalline salt patterns, marble floor, oculus casting moon-shimmer, forge-basin flooded by moon-charged water. The rising tide functions as both environmental constraint and transformation catalyst, pressuring Kaelan's identity shift. Sensory details (soft metallic chime, swirling luminous brine, white-hot glow) are filtered through the titan-gear POV and integrated into action. The bamboo creel and forge-basin serve as micro-setting anchors that charge the final image, lifting the score toward the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal cave setting is vivid and particular: "colossal quartz formations," the central pillar with its gap, the fossilized conch shell, all anchored in tactile detail. The gap between the crystal points becomes the site of the climactic choice, meaningfully constraining the final action. Sensory selection is strong—"low hum," "oily, impossible luminescence," "warmth spreading up his arm"—and filtered through Elias's perception without catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    The station is purposefully decayed (ivy shroud, cracked tiles, dust) and the final stall becomes the locus of revelation. The accordion as micro-setting object constrains the closure: its patched bellows and wheezing note embody fractured capacity, charging the final renunciation. Spatial choreography is clean (gravel bed → main doors → hall → lavatories → last stall → bench). The river recurs as indifferent constant, reweighted in the final line from antagonist to parallel flow.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glowing library in mist is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("ozone and regret," "pearlescent sea," "sourceless light") and the watch functions as a micro-setting element that constrains her navigation method. Spatial choreography is coherent—she repositions herself, triangulates light motes, moves toward the central chamber—and the mist's dissolution signals the time limit. However, the setting mostly frames action rather than forcing a choice; the environment enables her method but does not create a moment where access, proximity, or terrain alters her tactics under pressure, which caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    The velvet observatory, chilled marble pedestal, and refrigerated air are vivid and purposeful, grounding the scene in sensory specifics. The Cyphandra vine functions as micro-setting that constrains the pivotal choice—its memory contradicts the scrolls and offers the cutting. The midsummer morning at the end contrasts the earlier cold vigil. Minor cap: while the violin and vine are richly detailed, the "wild valleys" Elias walks toward remain abstract, slightly weakening the final spatial anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly anchored early and sensory detail is purposeful (obsidian slab, emerald chip's coolness, aurora's vibrations). The aurora functions as both atmosphere and resource, shaping Elara's method of extraction. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting charges the final image (aurora softening, radiant hush) and the archive niche constrains the ritual's endpoint, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for environment shaping closure, though the effect is more lyric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto's basalt, mist, luminous water, and the Whisperwood tree supply concrete spatial anchors that guide Elara's climb and tool use. The setting constrains her solution: sluggish water pooling below the Heart-Bloom forces the scalloping intervention. The final image charges the "vineyard hush" with shared purpose. Sensory selection (cool obsidian, damp earth, pearlescent light) is POV-filtered and purposeful. Minor: the perpetual cloud sea is mentioned once and does not return to pressure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse catwalk, wind chimes, and dawn light function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image: the wind immediately seizes the narrator's coat and later pulls the discarded cloak to the rocks, externalizing the stakes. Sensory detail is filtered through professional idiom ("my office, my ledger, my oracle") and selective perception (salt-eaten iron, fur-lined clasp). The hollow mirror shard held up against the roiling sea charges the void metaphor with spatial specificity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the narrow catwalk and down the spiral stairs.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating platform, crystalline surface, magnetic grotto hum, and shallow circular pond are vividly established and filter through Kael's impatient perception. The pond's still water and the grotto's low thrum constrain the teaching method—Elara uses the ripples as her medium. Sensory detail is selective: "starlight sharp enough to cut," "rough fabric…scraping," "sycamore hush." The micro-setting (pond and stone) charges the final image when the last ripple collapses and the mirror is restored, directly shaping the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly realized and pressures choices: Kaelan climbs the rib cage to gain height for the bird-appraisal, and the acoustic properties (every whisper a chorus) frame the harmonic skimming method. Micro-setting details—vertebra as millstone, fossilized rib cage ramp, dusk-ravens roosting in skeletal jaws—are specific and functional. The arrowhead's nesting in sediment "that marked the passage of ages" charges the timeframe. The setting constrains the method (acoustic heart of the canyon) and charges the final image (stillness settling over bone towers). Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (sound and vibration dominate, filtered through the skimmer's art).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, thin air, skeletal garden, and the arch with keystone are vividly rendered with purposeful selection. The keystone's "moon-like stone" and "internal glow" constrain Kael's diagnostic attempts (they fail against it) and charge the final touch. Micro-setting (the pack, its weight, the snow) alters tactics when he unstraps it. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency: cold, thin air, and "brilliant dimness" filter through Kael's frustrated, then revelatory state. The environment directly shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: "books… drifted… like sleeping bats," silt-draped shelves create suspended atmosphere, and switching off the torch to achieve total darkness directly enables the synesthetic discovery. The pier's gas lamps and lanterns frame the descent with clear spatial anchors. The wreck's "skeletal city" and the library's "vault of silenced stories" charge the setting with thematic weight without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ambered observatory deck constrains choice (power diversion flickers the field, risking true isolation) and charges the final image (amber silence vs. voices filling the room). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "bruised light," "screaming physics," console hum deepening. The worn leather pouch and foreign coins function as micro-setting that drives the beat. Spatial choreography is clean. No occupation-level systems exposition at this length, appropriately. The "crushed cosmos" and "final contraction" world-building serves pressure without becoming a tour.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory's copper-ribbed skeleton, twilight cascade, and the prism from the defunct Orrery lens all constrain Kael's ritual: he must use "the final, fading rays" at the precise transition time, and the dust motes and scattered light are active materials in the crystallization. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's professional role (reaper, ferryman) and grief-driven attention. The atlas page with sea monsters anchors the metaphor of naming fears in a physical object. Micro-setting (the console, the prism, the audio player) charges the final image when the crystal rests beside the atlas page, completing the naming ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sapphire viaduct is grounded early with precise sensory detail (crystalline arch, rose and gold underside, internal light) and constrains action—Kael returns to "this exact spot" for precision placement. The dust-choked canyon and the darkened patch of moisture charge the final image. Dawn's progression modulates tone from elegy to promise. The description is filtered through Kael's priorities (dripping rates, bell placement) rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Midnight Ridgeway, reservoir bed, and skeletal town create a coherent spatial frame. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "cracked mud… sucking at his boots," "warped floorboard," "dusty boxes." The liqueur label functions as micro-setting—a tangible artifact that anchors the past and charges the final display. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the peak beat (the ledger correction occurs in an archive, spatially generic), which keeps this from the 8-band. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift or floating.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is vivid and purposeful, anchoring Elias's sanctum. The gnarled apple tree, dew crystal, and starling murmuration are specific and charged. The crystal's sublimation constrains the final transformation—without it, the closure image loses its catalyst. Sensory detail (moss-soft earth, violet and rose hues, scent of ancient ice and new blossoms) is selective and filtered through Elias's alchemical perspective, supporting the tone without becoming catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor setting provides atmospheric grounding (ozone, bioluminescent mosses, lattice-branch walls) and the fragile crystal dial constrains the climactic choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (radio static → silence → screen patterns). The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, charging the closure through tactile memory. Minor cap: while vivid, the setting doesn't pressure multiple choices—it anchors one pivotal beat strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    The floating rock dojo and temporal static sky anchor setting early and contribute atmosphere. The shoji screen and wooden stand provide tactile micro-setting. However, these elements remain largely decorative: the dojo's isolation and the rewriting sky do not constrain Kael's choice or alter tactics. The jar sits on a stand but is not handled with physical specificity (temperature, weight, resistance). Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not charge the closure image or pressure a key turn, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel constrains and charges the climactic beat—sound bounces to maximize reach, drawing the wife into the hallway. The garage as repository of "forgotten projects" and the pull cord as "silent promise" anchor the ghost's limited agency. Dust motes, brittle leaves, and the faded plastic housing texture the neglect without becoming a catalog. The body-as-setting (spectral fingers wrapping the cord) qualifies under the micro-setting allowance and drives a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen garden with skeletal roses, perpetual mist, and weeping statues constrains Lyel's choices throughout: it mirrors his fog-bound memory and becomes the site where the portal tears open. The pendant's cold weight against his chest and the violent shrieking edges of the rift are sensory anchors that pressure the climax. Micro-setting (the nest of discarded book pages, frosted grass) grounds action. The mist and frost charge the final image when the rift dissolves "like a watercolor in rain" and silence returns. Environment is integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember nexus is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: "ley lines fizzled out into warm, ashen dust," "soft, internal light of a cooling hearth." The setting supplies both resource (dying embers) and thematic mirror (a place of endings). The final act uses the "warmest bed of embers" to enable the breakthrough, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor: "blasted heath" is generic fantasy shorthand; a single idiosyncratic detail would sharpen the locale.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The radio tower city over Black-Lip Gorge is vivid and specific, with "serenely electric" air and the Hollywood star fragment grounding micro-setting. The fragment's physical placement (cradle beside intake, not in-path) constrains her choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The tower "groaning" at perigee and the "crackling pressure" integrate environment into the climax without postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The spectral grotto is vividly rendered with crystalline walls and alien starlight, and the radio, hourglass, and ship's clocks constrain Finn's choices. The environment charges the final image (greasy harbor fog returns). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the grotto functions more as atmospheric stage than a setting that meaningfully narrows options; Finn's solution arises from pattern observation rather than environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The optical illusion gallery is vivid and purposeful: checkered floors, blinking portraits, moire patterns that "swirl violently" matching heartbeat. The sinew thread functions as micro-setting, handled across beats and charging the closure when it bursts into the kitchen vision. The gallery's illusory depths "freezing into solid black glass" subtly mirrors the protagonist's emotional state. Environment constrains the final choice by literalizing his entrapment, satisfying the 9+ gate, but some details (ozone/salt smell) feel ornamental rather than choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The benthic city setting is vivid and particular: "plasteel domes," "phosphorescent barnacles," "pressurized twilight" anchor the environment early. The anchor chain link functions as a recurring object that charges the final image, shifting from relic to "first link." Spatial choreography in the council chamber is clear. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kaelen's professional lens (sonar sweeps, pressure checks). The setting constrains the central conflict—navigating by starlight from a world that cannot see stars—earning the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and atmospherically specific (glass/steel cathedral, weeping figs, central fountain, marble floor). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias could have found Leo anywhere. The setting charges the mood but remains postcard-level; it does not pressure the closure beat, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The flooded relay hub, rebar-choked collapse, and tidal clock constrain every choice. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "taste of salt and forgotten time," "ozone and granite on his tongue." The codex fleck and star-shaped console indentation function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting is indispensable to the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal observatory under snow is vividly established with sensory anchors (profound hush, frigid slate surface, snow muffling the world). The porcelain shard and ink function as micro-setting tools that constrain the defragmentation method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single-location scene. The "starless-night ink" and "slate table directly under the main lens" create purposeful mirroring that supports the thematic work without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and sky-pattern all constrain and enable Kaelen's final choice: the spire's resonant texture is the word to be unlocked, the starlings' geometry provides the alignment key, and the diamond must be oriented atop the tallest tower. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—copper-veined skin that "felt the world more than saw it," iron-feathered starlings, wind whipping hair—and filtered through Kaelen's tactile-first perception. The setting charges the closure directly: the tower's texture becomes the sound, fulfilling the micro-setting test for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground garden's gravitational playfulness, bioluminescent orchid, and stone shelf create a coherent micro-setting that constrains choice (the grotto as ritual space, the phone and arrowhead as fixed anchors). Sensory details—"damp, cool earth," "electric snow," "amber light"—are filtered through Julian's investigator lens and escalate at the transformation beat. The spatial anchor of "shadows" from which Julian watches, then steps forward, tracks position cleanly. The setting charges the final image: Julian holding the objects in that specific space reweights his entire mission.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Orchard of Sighs is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: "apple blossoms...the color of old bruises," "leaves rusted on the bough," granite Wardens with "blank eyes," the Mother Tree's "bark...scaled like a dragon." These images are filtered through the stakes and recur with pressure. The locust shell and violin function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: the shell's glow signals success, the violin channels her pulse. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the descent from sky-bridge to orchard center compresses distance without friction. The final transformation charges the closure image with color and scent, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt arcade's flickering sign and rusted postbox anchor the scene; twilight's "fading bruise" clouds and the brittle hush create atmosphere that reflects urgency. The hidden port in the mail drop functions as a micro-setting element that enables the transfer—Elias presses the panel, jacks in the cable—so environment directly constrains and facilitates the climactic action. Sensory detail is selective (dust, cold air, luminous dial) and filtered through Elias's professional focus. The setting is specific and charged, though the "disputed territory" remains slightly abstract; more granular locale detail (signs of conflict, border markers) could sharpen the world.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned train setting supplies vivid, selective detail (rusted carriages, velvet-stripped seats, peeling gilt, lion cages) that grounds Elias's isolation and shapes his world as "outside of time." The wind bells function as micro-setting, measuring his days and triggering the climactic moment. The fragment's "whispering gleam" charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting directly constrains and enables: the train's stillness permits his retreat, the carriage doorway holds the bells, and the evening breeze through that threshold catalyzes the ending. Environment, recurring object, and body all converge to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Athenaeum is vividly particular ("cathedral of shelved paradoxes where equations rhymed"), and the scarf itself functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its tension and embroidery guide the geometric path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: ozone, nightshade, the "chromatic shimmer" all charge the climactic beat. The object (scarf) materially shapes the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for this category. Spatial choreography of books, desk, and patrons remains clear; the setting pressures the protagonist's solitary method.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering archipelago, pre-dawn mist, easternmost islet, and the library's scent of paper and sea salt anchor place and atmosphere with consistent sensory detail. The brass-lensed camera and petrified-wood palette are tactile and specific, constraining Silas's method (glass plates, spring water basin, candle glow). The fog bank that diffuses light into a prismatic haze directly enables the final breakthrough, making setting an active participant in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stone circle, twilight timing, and starlight filtering through hair provide concrete spatial and temporal anchors that constrain the ritual's mechanics. The frayed ribbon and lock of hair function as micro-setting objects that charge the final dissolution. Sensory detail (ozone tang, velvet curtain of twilight, shimmering lattice on stone) is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the Locksmith's focused perception and shaping the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken greenhouse with its skeletal shipwreck corona and warped glass panes constrains Elias's method of detection and charges the final image. The submersible's mechanical arms and viewport anchor spatial choreography throughout. Sensory details are filtered through professional priorities: "polished brass knuckle," "pressure gauge," "algae-kissed panes." The vibrant moss ring and glowing mushroom become micro-setting that drives the climactic choice. Environment is lived-in and purposeful, never merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library is rendered through sensory specifics: dust motes settling, dusty floorboards, velvet-draped pedestal, tumbling scrolls. The playground swing sound anchors time and isolation. The crystalline cube with trapped shadow functions as micro-setting that charges the stakes by showing prior failure. Spatial choreography is clean (across the room, pedestal, table, stacks). The fallen scrolls directly enable the closure choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall mist, and clay pot supply concrete anchors; the mist functions as both veil and resource, enabling the essence-capture. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "shimmering mist," "thunder of the water," "rich, dark soil." The setting constrains method (Elian must reach through the waterfall's veil) and charges the closure image (the orchard's emerald deepness returns), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor deduction: the "kaleidoscope of hues that had no names" risks abstraction, and the orchard itself remains underdescribed—we see moss and air but few trees or fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered through "faceted ceiling," "starlight...shattered into...trembling shards," and the suspended fisherman's net, all of which constrain the ritual action. The tapestry needle becomes micro-setting, its "slender, bone-white" form and "minuscule opening" shaping the technique. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "cold," "briny deep," the net's "hempen cords dark with salt and time." The final image of "less frantic" starlight charges closure by reflecting the eased ambient pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (narrator steps closer, then back; Kaelen beside, then receiving the tool).

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The workshop sensory anchors (dehumidifiers, archival glue, old paper) and the projected films provide strong micro-setting. The lichen-covered capstone functions as both object and constraint, its growth pattern enabling the discovery. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The "rain-scoured fresco vault" description, while evocative, arrives late and does little to constrain Elara's choices; it is observed in footage rather than navigated, so the vault itself remains at a remove.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken library is vividly realized with tactile, specific detail (warped bronze doors, swollen book-pages as "pale flowers," lead-lined strongbox fused by heat). The environment constrains action (manipulator arm struggle, sterile surface vessel for safe opening) and charges the final image by providing the physical anchor for the father's "gilded cage." Sensory selection reflects the narrator's professional filter and the tone of melancholy exploration, though the surface vessel is less texturally developed than the underwater scene.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sky-courtyard setting is vivid and specific—"pearl-white stones," "ozone and wild, high-altitude blossoms," "moss-kissed walls"—and the mist's transition from ambient drift to deliberate swirl directly charges the closure image. The bolt plate receptacle in the plinth constrains Elian's action. Micro-setting detail (the beam, the aperture, the walls) shapes the encoding ritual. One anchor arrives late (the courtyard's suspension above clouds is named in the opening but its altitude mechanics aren't leveraged as a pressure until the mist's final move).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The crystal elevator and icebound spire anchor place vividly; the glacial shell and "pale sunlight" enable the goggles' function, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (polarized hues, shimmering script, charcoal sketch). The elevator's chime markers create spatial-temporal rhythm. Slight dock: the Grand Archives arrive only at the ending without prior setup, making the tenth-floor destination feel generic. The goggles' lenses "catching the stray photons" and resolving encrypted text through scattered light grounds the speculative mechanic in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sky gondola micro-setting constrains choice: Elias can only observe through the telescope, and the drifting altitude frames his curatorial stance. The brass telescope functions as a charged object across multiple beats (retrieval, three cloud observations, final casing), and its metal coolness and Lena's history anchor sensory specificity. The noctilucent cloud's "complex lattice, pulsing with…luminescence" charges the closure image with visual and thematic weight. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's professional meteorologist lens (cirrus wisps, altostratus layers, ice crystals) without tourist catalog excess. Minor: the gondola's interior spatial details remain sparse, but the frame remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The petrified oak library is vivid and purposeful: circular room, oldest rings converging at the knot, shelves as spatial anchors. The heartwood knot constrains the final action—Elara must press the stone there—and the wood's fractal grain charges the closure image by channeling the sky-light. Sensory detail (dust motes, dry rot, vibrating floor) reflects urgency and filters through Elara's bias. The micro-setting (coin, obsidian stone, vellum slip) functions as object-as-setting, driving the sequence. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The airship's brass fittings, aging canvas, engine oil, wooden planks, and observation deck create vivid micro-setting that constrains movement and charges atmosphere. The hopscotch board—chalked decades ago, unevenly worn—supplies the method and anchors the breakthrough. Starlings' murmurations and the cumulus cloud function as environmental actors that guide the luminance reveal. The scent of "old paper and engine oil" and the single lantern hold sensory specificity. Spatial choreography (deck → hold → deck) tracks clearly. Minor gap: the airship's interior layout and the mechanics of observing starlings from a moving gondola remain lightly sketched; adding one line about altitude or drift would tighten the physicality of the search.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen library above clouds is vividly rendered with "crystalline stasis" and "hauntingly bright frost," and the hall-of-mirrors core directly pressures Elara's choice by blinding her with refracted failures until she creates shadow. The obsidian vial and clockmaker's gear assortment are handled objects that constrain tactics. Spatial choreography (satchel at hip, vial from coat lining, gear sliding into lock) tracks clearly. The environment's harsh light becomes a puzzle Elara must solve, charging the final image when warm golden light replaces it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating arches, petrified orchards, and fused-sand sidewalks create vivid setting texture, but the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The arch climb uses spatial choreography (pulleys, cable, wind) yet the mechanics feel generic rather than leveraging the arches' specific crystalline or magnetic properties. The bell's interaction with the arch (striking rock to produce resonance) charges the final image, granting modest credit for object-as-setting, but the broader setting remains postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse lantern room, crystal lens, and dusk sky are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail that supports the accumulative tone. The "pane of hush" functions as both physical setting and conceptual constraint, and the crystal dissolving into motes charges the final image with environmental participation. Sensory selection (coolness of wood, hum of crystal, thrum in atoms) filters through Elias's calm focus. The setting directly enables and constrains the ritual, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure, though the broader world outside remains abstract ("sky that no longer held stars"), keeping specificity high at the immediate scene level but generic at global scale.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cliffside ledge, wind, frost forming, and the labyrinth's shifting granite walls are vivid and purpose-driven. Mechanical birds with "copper-etched feathers and merciless obsidian eyes" are striking without becoming ornamental. The frost functions as a ticking constraint that narrows the window and charges the final image ("treacherous, beautiful armor"). Micro-setting (the flat ledge, the chaotic pile of components) anchors the assembly action and the beacon's placement directly shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The braided ravine is signaled early and its physical properties (multiple threads, eddies, granite slab) anchor spatial choreography. The river foam itself functions as micro-setting that constrains Aris's realization—he must sit, watch the eddy, and trace bubble coalescence for the insight to arrive. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "wet stone and pollen," "sun-warmed slab," "foam." The canyon walls shift from "prison of regret" to "nave of a cathedral" at closure, charging the final image. The setting does not pressure a tactical choice but it enables the conceptual shift that defines closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Glass Orchard Library is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail (crystalline groves, prisms, chimes of glass leaves). The environment actively constrains Elian's method (he measures silence between chimes, traces barren limbs) and the ancient smooth tree charges the final image by offering the requisite blank canvas. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves from shop to orchard to heart-tree. Micro-setting (the tree's virginal surface, the shard, the pooled moonlight) directly enables the climactic incision and elevates the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The desert fortress after rain is vividly rendered ("wet stone and bruised creosote"), and the coral pavilion's "impossible, unmelting ice" provides tactile constraint when Kaelen digs and enters. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered throughout. The pavilion's physical dissolution mirrors the emotional release, charging the closure image. Minor gap: the fortress kitchens receive only one line, reducing the tangibility of Kaelen's daily world.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The astronomical clock tower with celestial dials and brass armature grounds the scene vividly. The cuckoo clock weight functions as both tool and constraint—its trembling during transmission and final stillness charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("borrowed starlight," "polished brass dial"). The setting actively shapes Elias's work: the armature translates, the weight steadies oscillations. This crosses the 9+ gate (object constrains choice and charges final image), though the plains below remain more conceptual than textured.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The canyon workshop, periscope mirror, and neural-lace setup are vivid and purposeful, grounding the scene in tactile detail (conductive gel, ozone/lavender scent, wire filaments). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop; the canyon and moonlight frame the scene lyrically but do not constrain a choice or shape tactics. The periscope mirror charges the final image (her reflection in the uncracked part), meeting the micro-setting gate and lifting the score into the 6+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The inverted grotto is vividly rendered with stalactites-as-pillars and upward-falling water droplets; spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The obsidian wall functions as setting-as-constraint, requiring perceptual reframing rather than physical breach. Sensory details (phosphorescent fungi, silver pearls, damp stone) are filtered through Kael's archivist lens and the environment directly enables the closure revelation. Minor: the mist and pre-dawn frame could integrate more tightly with the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The siskin alder grove is vivid and selective: "wind-whipped branch," "filigree of stress cracks," "damp earth." The Old One's stress-crack map becomes the core constraint—Elara's entire method depends on reading these lines. The porcelain insulator's density matters on-page ("clean, pure vibration it could transfer"). The grove's spatial choreography is coherent across moves, and the setting charges the final image when the siskins pause and the air "grew thick with harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Umbral Caldera is vividly particular: obsidian ridge, bloated purple sun, magnetic hums that ache fillings, emerald/violet ribbons. The basalt stone (dented, dropped, released) constrains the final choice and charges the closure image. Sensory detail reflects urgency (silence texture, vibrational weight) and professional lens (chess-board metaphors filter all perception). The magnetic nexus pressures his methodology and supplies the climactic covenant display. Minor: the "whispering desolation" phrase leans slightly stock.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The workshop is anchored early with sensory specifics—ozone, old paper, copper wires "thin as spun hair"—and the fireworks timeframe tightens spatial pressure (thud through floorboards, sky visible from window). The leather-bound diary and brass clasp become tactile focal points that constrain the tuning sequence. The setting does not force a mid-scene choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it frames rather than pressures, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The treetop setting constrains movement ("perpetual sway," rope bridges, wind chimes) and actively complicates Elara's task during the tide shift. Sensory hierarchy is sharp: her nose filters "damp earth, sweet decay, sharp tang of minerals," and the wind's riot of smells is specific (moon-petal orchids, lightning-scorched tree, wet-fur scent). The seed's terracotta pot functions as micro-setting and the wrapping-paper canvas charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock arches, inverted river, and geode cavern are vivid and specific, anchoring the skiff's journey with strong sensory detail (levitating droplets, pulsing crystal, ochre soil). The environment supplies the hidden path and constrains timing (gravity shift window). The crystal's accelerative property is shown in the seed-pod moment, grounding the world's logic. Minor: some exposition ("This was the hidden path") tells rather than letting movement demonstrate, and the orchard itself remains generic—silver leaves, blight—without tactile lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The corrugated steel labyrinth is established early and constrains Kaelen's survey methodology throughout; spatial choreography remains coherent (edge → deeper → nexus). The "haze tasted of salt and rust" anchors sensory texture, and the "cathedral of stillness" recurs to charge the final image. The dark stain at the nexus serves as a concrete closure anchor. Micro-setting (anemometers, tablet, containers) functions as constraint and tool. The environment directly shapes the investigative tactics and the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and ice bells are rendered with vivid sensory specificity and anchored in Kael's synesthetic perception. The setting enables the ritual method (aurora as sheet music, ice bells as instruments), shaping the central action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or evolve under pressure; it functions as a stage rather than a crucible. Spatial choreography is clean, and the world rules remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon operates as active constraint: "avalanchingly quiet pressure" and "cathedral of silent, waiting stone" shape Kaelen's ritual choices and frame the final revelation. The driftwood spiral and flattened center stone provide tactile micro-setting that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: "phantom scent of ozone," "shimmer... like heat haze on a winter's day," and the contrast between "placid, indifferent blue" sky and the oppressive hush. The flute as object-setting constrains the revelation mechanically. Canyon setting directly participates in the ending: "The canyon held his grief, and now, it held his understanding too."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    The topaz walls, halo fragment, and letterpress are rendered with tactile specificity and constrain Elias's method (he lowers the lens, pulls the lever). The timeframe between vanishing stars pressures the ritual window. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's detached focus (geometry, light, metal clicking like bones) versus Anya's emotional disorientation. The embossed card—a captured nebula—charges the final image and makes the setting's alchemy indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway is anchored early with shale, cold air, aurora, and high-pass exposure. The aurora detaches and pulses overhead, bathing the ridge in green light—environment directly enables the pendant's activation and the germination of crystalline plants at Kael's feet. Spatial choreography is clean (scree, frozen ground, ten feet to Elara's phantom). The setting charges the final image: "impossible garden" and "desolate winter" frame the wonder Kael now carries forward.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quartz arbor, frost-sheathed windshield, and prism-on-pedestal constrain the experiment's setup and charge the closure image. Sensory details—"feathery" ice ferns, "spear of pale light," "cold, quartz-littered ground"—are filtered through Elias's focused attention and directly enable the final revelation. The arbor's isolation and the car wreckage anchor his obsession spatially. The setting is essential across beats: it frames expectation, supplies the frost canvas, and delivers the diagram that shatters his lie.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The loom functions as micro-setting and constrains choice—it "demanded a price for its use" and the grooves reflect "a thousand forgotten threads." The amber bead charges the final image by nesting into the tapestry's center. The orchard and bamboo forest anchor early but remain largely atmospheric; spatial choreography is clean (cottage, loom, tapestry) and the puzzle-frame map guides the weaving pattern, making the object-as-setting test pass.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating stone arches, mine shafts, and geode cavern are vivid and purposeful. The geode constrains Elian's method (he must reach the nexus), and the blue-traced arch in the final image charges closure. Sensory detail is selective: geothermal warmth, silk's azure glow, dust-soured fruit. Minor cap consideration: occupational detail (forge, blacksmithing) is mentioned but not integrated into the descent action; however, at this length and given the piece's focus on the barter ritual, that omission does not materially harm.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay supplies concrete sensory anchors—stained concrete, cold ozone, fractured gantry—and the green shard functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's access to the parallel visions. The cyclical hum and structural sound are filtered through his sensory-map expertise. The shard's coldness against his skin charges the final choice. Spatial choreography is clear; the bay evolves from haunted to finalized in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse cove, cliff stairs, and lantern room are concretely anchored and guide Silas's choices (mooring in calm water, climbing slick stone). The Fresnel lens, fuel line, and stone shore all constrain action. The sea glass charges the final image by refracting the resurrected beam. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (foam, spray, wind howl, cold iron). The "haunted lantern room" legend is introduced then dismissed efficiently; the mechanics (clogged fuel line, match-scratch) are plausible and affect closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, crystalline apparatus, and glass wick are vividly rendered and anchor the scene throughout. The wick's facets constrain Kaelan's method (total internal reflection), and the storm's passage produces a tangible environmental shift ("light seemed sharper, air cleaner"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the focalizer's priorities, meeting the micro-setting test by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock tea house, valley cliffs, and chalk-marked sun trails supply vivid spatial grounding and constrain Kaelen's method of inquiry. Sensory hierarchy reflects his dye-master training (microscopic ridges, refraction vs. pigment). The morpho wing functions as micro-setting object, charged at closure when it returns on his palm to articulate the prism metaphor. Minor slip: the mist and prayer-flag simile risk postcard lyricism, but the chalk trails on floorboards and the eastern window anchor choice and observation concretely enough to earn the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tower's arched windows and broken sextant constrain the moonlight-analysis method; without that exact setup, the healing cannot occur. The storm provides the crescendo that breaks the clouds, enabling the pure moonlight shaft—environment directly enables the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: workbench to passage to slate plate to wall mosaic. The sextant's cracked lens is both tool and micro-setting, its spiderweb fracture essential to scattering light for dream-mapping. Sensory economy is tight: thunder, rain-scent, chill of the shard, and the pearlescent glow at the end all advance pressure or charge the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific flora (Sun-Drop Fern, Shadow-Vine, Petal-Moths) and the mica window returns at closure to frame the new dawn, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's POV (humid air, mossy flagstones, phosphorescence). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains choice—the tree's fading state drives the quest—and the alchemical properties enable the climax, satisfying the micro-setting test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Athenaeum's sensory anchors (aged paper, beeswax, vellum, green-shaded lamp, worn armchair) are filtered through Elias's perception and the library itself becomes the tool for his hiding technique—he dissolves into "the scent of vellum, the weight of a billion printed words." The celestial cartography book constrains Elara's gesture and charges the final image ("vast and full of silent stars"). Spatial choreography (oak table, shelves, distant alcove) tracks clearly. Minor: the "24-hour laundromat" facade and "senior members" hint at a broader world but don't pressure this scene's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting does active work: the courtyard's "crumbling colonnades," "moss eat[ing] the marble," and "pavement cracks" constrain Elara's gardening method and supply the resources (mortar gaps, statue base) that shape her micro-tactics. The bread heel and trowel function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's noticer lens—"fine, grey dust" of decay, "flour-dusted windows," the cold biting deeper—without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library setting constrains Kaelen's actions throughout: frigid air fogs his breath, the obsidian vault chills the slide, the ice-glazed floor amplifies the quartz hush. The resonator apparatus—"spun silver and polished lenses"—is tactile and specific, handled across multiple beats (slot, adjust dial, capture rune). The grand observation window frames the final stance and links the archive to the city below, charging the closure image. Sensory selection is purposeful (cold, hush, light) and filtered through Kaelen's focus on the task. Minor gap: the cloud-sea below and the spire's crystal structure remain postcard-vivid but do not directly constrain a mid-scene choice, limiting full indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rotting pier setting (brine, mildew, phosphorescent kelp, splintered crates) is vivid and integrated into action—Elara moves through the throng, nudges crab pots, steps into kelp's glow. Spatial choreography is clean (stall, walkway, shadows). The brass listening device and the fob function as micro-setting objects that constrain and charge the final image. The timeframe (night to dawn, rising tide) subtly pressures Elara's urgency. Minor gap: the market's social rules (truce of hush, Boro's role) are sketched but don't materially alter Elara's tactics after the Boro beat; the setting supports rather than transforms choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and personal weather systems are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's sensory bias (taste, scent, visual shimmer). The tin compass ring's erratic spin and the convergence geography constrain the scene's logic. Spatial choreography (carriers approaching from different paths, storms merging overhead) remains clear. The micro-setting (compass ring, bluff underfoot, taste on tongue) charges the final image when the ring's obsolescence is contrasted with "a map written in lightning." However, the "forests holding elections" remain atmospherically declared without on-page spatial presence or choice consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave constrains the final choice: the painting depicts exaggerated refraction from a specific crystal cluster, which Elias decodes as the lock sequence (azure, rose, gold, violet). The phosphorescent pigments ground from the cave's own crystals in the payoff reinforce the micro-setting's causal role. Spatial choreography is clean (alcove, iron box, painting above). The cave's prismatic light charges the final tear image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("crystalline hum," "selenite spars," "dawn and twilight combined") without catalog excess. No occupation-level detail is forced; the setting does double duty as sanctuary and puzzle-frame.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and vault arboretum are vivid and purposeful. The Silver-Vein fern constrains the opening observation, and the zinc postal plate is handled twice (taped fragment, then key insertion). However, the middle passage (maintenance shafts, conduits) provides postcard movement without spatial friction that alters Elian's choices. The final arboretum setting charges the closure image effectively, reweighting the fern's earlier presence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering bluff, cloud-floor, thermal chisels, and kinetic mobile are vivid and purposeful. The bluff's "whisper" and pressure-change cues constrain Elian's timing; the iceberg's physical properties (translucence, mist release under vibration) directly affect the sculpture's function and closure. The pearlescent sky and rare updraft are filtered through Elian's professional attention. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: he feels the thrum in his palms, hears the wind's keening, watches the glistening transformation—all grounded in his craft focus rather than tourist observation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass dome, desert rose formations, and geothermal regulators are vivid and purposeful; the dome breach uses the setting's weak joint as the escape route. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("ozone and lost things," "abrasive shock to my sensors"). The micro-setting (central crystal formation) constrains the miniaturization tactic and charges the final doorway image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography stays clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("scent of coffee and damp earth soured by frustration," wilting geraniums, low brick wall) and the star-shaped lock depression becomes a functional constraint that the locket's back resolves. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the mailbox bank serves as a tangible pressure point. The setting charges the final moment (collective sigh, neighbors sharing stories) but does not constrain Elias's central choice—he could have pursued the key insight anywhere. The vibrant-dawn element signals tone but does not alter tactics or complicate the search.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken lab is vividly rendered with "quartz-glass walls," "aquatic hush," and bioluminescent algae that pulse in rhythm at closure. The hangman's dice and scarred plasteel desk anchor micro-setting. The environment subtly constrains choice: isolation intensifies Elara's dialogue with code, and the "oppressive hum" shifts key at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered ("geometric salt formations…fracturing it into a thousand shivering stars") and functions as micro-setting: its "gleaming silence" and resonant hum anchor Silas's ritual and charge the moment he reaches into the gravity pocket. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (brine drip, misting breath, saline air). The setting constrains choice—he descends to this specific place to perform divination—and the final image of "salt crystals glittering indifferently" modulates tone and reweights his solitary work. Spatial choreography is clear (ladder, flat-topped crystal, slate tile). Minor gap: the docks and lantern-lighting receive atmospheric treatment but don't pressure a choice, though they establish his dual roles efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, moss-covered stone, and moon-drenched clearing anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The brook's murmur establishes a baseline and returns at closure, and the stone serves as the fulcrum's platform. Yet the environment functions primarily as backdrop—it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply a resource she must navigate. Spatial choreography (kneeling, palms hovering, eyes opening) is clear, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Althea breathes through specific sensory anchors: groaning pipes, peeling wallpaper pulse, chipped plaster arguments, sun-bleached cat spot. The rooftop garden supplies the open-sky pressure that makes secrets feel lighter, and the terracotta planter receives the seal's spiral impression—micro-setting charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: calm tutorial details (dust, dried lavender) versus the urgent meteor-streaked darkness. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden, resonance structures, and twilight-to-dawn timeframe create a vivid backdrop with sensory specificity (moss muffling footsteps, blooms "thick with unspoken histories"). The crystalline spires constrain Elian's method and the fading star marks the temporal pressure. However, the garden remains more atmospheric stage than active constraint; Elian's movements through it do not alter tactics or complicate his goal. The setting charges mood but does not shape the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Sanctuary's marble altar, stalactite drips, and aurora provide vivid, selective sensory anchors filtered through Kaelen's professional focus. The heritage rose thorn—bone clasp, arctic fox brush, iron-gall ink—constrains the central choice: only the thorn is fine enough for the work. Spatial choreography (altar, scroll, tools, exit) tracks cleanly. The aurora's pulse bathes the closure beat in green and violet, charging the final walk into dawn. Micro-setting (tools, scroll surface, ink viscosity) alters tactics at every step. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: cold air stinging lungs, viscous ink, stalactite heartbeat rhythm. The setting is purposeful, not touristic, and each detail pressures or enables action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine nexus is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail ("liquid silver" starlight, resonant crystal formation) and the setting constrains her method—she must sing to unlock each corridor, and the final chamber's crystal dictates the harmonic solution. Sensory selection is strong ("scent of dust and starlight," "deafening" hum), though some descriptions verge on postcard ("cool air," "quiet mist"). The seashell as micro-setting object charges the closure when it merges with the crystal, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (breath-hollowed space, blue million-year-old cold, weeping walls) and the melted snow globe functions as both anchor and constraint. The dream-ocean and the old research outpost are detailed enough to ground the climactic scene. The candle flames dipping during the trance and the final steadiness charge the closure moment, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility even though the dreamscape itself remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting constrains choice and charges closure: the parapet frames observation, moon-path pools guide navigation, the meadow envelops him. The tea whisk and mending tools function as micro-setting that recurs with reweighted meaning at the end ("instruments for participating"). Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered (brine/tar fingers, wet earth, lime-green pulses). The whispering parapet recurs as anchor and the final image reprises tools beside the tea bowl, rewarding the reader who tracked their presence. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard/wasteland boundary, research station interior, and antenna provide concrete spatial anchors that constrain movement and choice throughout. The Ash Diamond functions as micro-setting: its asymmetrical lattice (examined under magnification) and light-focusing properties directly enable the closure discovery. The twin Seraphim peaks supply the alignment constraint that makes the final beat possible. Sensory detail is purposeful—"greasy smear" of fractured light, "shimmering circle...like heat haze on a cold day"—and filtered through Kaelen's professional perspective. The mossy earth, rusted hinge, and battery-powered lamp all ground the investigative work in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory and cobalt glass portico are vividly established and return at closure, charging the final image when real sun replaces blue-filtered storm light. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory detail is strong ("bruised-indigo lens," "ozone and regret") and POV-filtered. The storm as environmental pressure shapes the climax directly. Micro-setting (the console, the portico, the chest) all constrain or enable key moments, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping choice and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The feral loft is vividly rendered with specific, functional detail: "ribcage of driftwood," "grime-streaked porthole," shelves of scavenged planks. Sensory selection reflects the poet's priorities (sound over sight, texture over color) and the setting constrains his method—he must scavenge jars, move across dunes to collect. The music box and jars function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. The dune environment enables his collection ritual and the loft frames both opening and closing beats with purposeful spatial return.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drift-ice marina's "groaning, shifting floes" and the lighthouse's iron staircase and bedrock crypt anchor space and movement cleanly. Sensory hierarchy is strong: Elara notices sonic detail first ("discordant hum...grinding teeth"), filtering through her professional expertise. The crypt keeper's key and the Siren's Heart constrain her method—she must use the key to access the console, and the Heart's fragility forbids "blunt contest of power"—shaping tactical choices. The final image of "violet dusk" and the "steady, azure-coated engineer" charges closure by anchoring her endurance in place and role.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen lake, wet viaduct surface, and basalt sanctuary are anchored early and integrated. The viaduct's post-rain surface is critical to the plan's mechanics: "magnetic viaduct after rain was a different beast, its surface mirroring the sky with unnerving fidelity." The scrying bowl's obsidian and deep-aquifer water constrain the method. The setting charges the final image when the viaduct's lights die and "profound quiet of the frozen lake" replaces the oppressive hum. Micro-setting (bowl, window scratch, brass scope) functions as toolkit.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tunnel is vivid and purposeful: "wet earth and cold iron," "brick-lined passage," high-water mark, and the rumbling train all ground the action and create atmosphere. The lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's interpretation and charging the final image when he sees it as both promise and cage. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional lens (boot prints in silt, scuff marks). The setting does not force a tactical choice mid-scene but does shape the emotional arc and final stance, placing it in the strong 7s rather than the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The repair shop is vividly rendered ("dust motes, ancient and golden") and purposefully contrasts Arthur's penitentiary world. The grimy window and storm-light actively constrain the revelation: Elias gestures toward it, the sunlight "didn't choose the clean spots," charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (Arthur at the workbench, Elias bent over the locket, both turning toward the window). The shop's particulars (brass, mahogany, felt hammers) create texture without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    The acid sea and floating workshop constrain every choice: the launch platform is "corroded," the sea "churns like a monstrous stomach," and falling means death. The twin suns' dawn light signals time pressure. The wing's "copper tubing and whalebone struts" and the "non-Euclidean configuration" are specific to the world and the task. The kaleidoscope's arrowhead fragments ("dust-fine fragments of a hunter's arrow tip") supply the generative tool. The final image—hanging fifty feet above the fuming acid—is charged by the setting's lethality and the workshop as "testament to a life spent chasing an echo."

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The digital archive environment is rendered through functional detail: "corrupted cluster of music files," "error log," "server architecture," "layers of security," "quarantine zone called the Void." Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract setting—Elara navigates from public archive to fortified Void via coordinate-based commands. The recurring Seraphim-7 patch functions as micro-setting, appearing first in a cached image and returning physically at closure to charge the final beat. Kael's "bland corporate circle shimmering behind her" efficiently conveys both his avatar presence and power asymmetry. The audio-tagging feature and celestial coordinate system read plausible within the speculative frame. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional focus: she notices numbers, file structures, and code before atmosphere. The patch's "silver threads cool against her skin" provides the sole tactile anchor at closure, grounding the digital environment in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse orchard, frost-rimmed apples, and grinding ice floes anchor the setting vividly and pressure the fragile community. The cheval mirror is purpose-driven, enabling Kael's method. Spatial choreography is clear (orchard tableau, lighthouse interior, return to orchard). The setting charges the final image—the sigh pluming in frigid air underscores their shared vulnerability. Minor issue: the vintage store detail feels ornamental; the mirror's age matters less than its function.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina constrains her method (debris field supplies the textbook) and charges the final image (ice calving provides the sound she sought). Sensory hierarchy filters through her purpose: salt, diesel, splintered wood, tidal surge residue. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is clean: pier, debris piles, ice edge. The "immense, unhurried separation" sound shapes the closure beat directly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber pavilion frames every reflection, the western plot's struggling vines concretize the mismatch metaphor, and the burned letter's "scorched filigree" becomes the closure image. Autumn light, fermented earth, woodsmoke, and the cool wind are filtered through Elias's viticulturist attention. The recurring letter fragment constrains his stance and charges the final moment when he slips it back, its fragility a tangible reminder. Micro-setting (the letter, the vines) functions as setting here and drives the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The murmuring pavilion, the stark desert, and the kinetic parapet are all vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—cool ceramic mask, bleaching sun, obsidian lenses. The pavilion anchors the opening social pressure; the dunes and leviathan rib guide the reader spatially; the parapet's interlocking rings and glowing lenses constrain Kael's approach (peripheral awareness required). The body and tool (mask, bone marker) function as micro-setting elements that charge the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lavender scent, rusted factory, and weathered plank anchor the setting early and create vivid atmosphere. The vines function as a clock and constrain the timeframe, appearing at open, middle ("each season"), and close ("reached the factory's crumbling roof"), thus charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (coal smoke vs. lavender, "skeletal fingers"), though the photographs themselves remain visually generic. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment presses against memory without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library is established early with vivid particulars: suspended hush, stopped presses, Isfahan rug, Bohemian crystal chandelier. The crystal (micro-setting as object) constrains the final choice—its acoustic property enables the discovery that makes publication feel inadequate. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "cool and heavy," "faint hum," whispers and rustles. The "suspended hush" recurs to charge the final image. Minor note: spatial choreography is minimal but sufficient for a solo contemplative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fog sculpture garden functions as more than backdrop: the mist shapes navigation (thinning to reveal the basalt slab at the crucial moment), and the driftwood markers constrain his path while reflecting his fading memory. The chalk and stone slab become micro-setting that charges the closure image—the circle drawn on "damp black rock" immediately begins dissolving, a physical constraint that mirrors thematic erosion. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (salt, wet stone, moss) and filtered through Silas's purpose-driven attention. The setting actively pressures his choices and charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lunar observatory setting constrains the climactic choice through gravitational harmonics and lunar zenith timing. Spatial choreography is clean (cupola workshop → chronometer hall → portal window crack). The lens as micro-setting object is handled across beats and charges the closure. Minor cap applied: while vivid, the "sea of bruised clouds under a canopy of diamond-dust stars" leans decorative in the opener without immediate choice-pressure; the setting's constraint work arrives in the chronometer hall.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Eyrie's cantilevered perch, cloud sea, and "pulsing stillness" establish a vivid micro-setting. The oolong steam, radiant floor, and turntable are handled objects that guide Elara's ritual choices. Spatial choreography is clear (door, chair, turntable in corner) and the apricot-gold light charges the reunion beat. The setting constrains access (Lena must travel "far below") and the radiant floor, gravity-spun blanket, and oxygen-rich air all contribute specificity without slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory, brass automaton, and clockwork key are vivid and purposeful; the key's "interlocking rings and glyphs" constrains the final action (rotating to describe a topological knot). Sensory detail is selective: "low hum," "crystalline eyes," "tangible darkness." The final projection—shadow folding into a "dimensionally thin crease"—charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (pedestal, automaton in corner, projection on wall), and the post-spoon-bending world rules remain consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The secret garden setting is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (wilting moon-petal roses, rowan wood box, hedge maze walls). The trowel and digging action provide tactile micro-setting that leads to discovery. The box's location beneath the roses subtly mirrors Elara's world hidden under his rational surface. However, the garden itself does not meaningfully constrain Elias's choice at closure—the tooth could have been discovered elsewhere—which keeps the score below the 9-band gate despite vivid execution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, and coastal cleft anchor space and atmosphere early. Sensory details—cool air tasting of salt, damp stones, swirling mist—are filtered through Elara's star-watcher perspective and her earthbound frustration. The sliver of twilight that pierces the entrance at the climactic beat enables the sea glass to glow, making the environment causally active. The grotto's "winding, serpentine walls" curve protectively at the end, charging the final image with spatial resonance that reweights her solitude as embrace rather than confinement.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The defunct server farm setting is vivid and purposeful: moss on steel, high windows holding ice, the slate panel positioned to catch drips. The drip pattern itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's symbolic intervention and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (petrichor, velvet moss, honeyed hush) and filtered through Elara's botanical priorities. The environment both mirrors theme (rust as bed for life) and supplies the crucial prop (the branching water pattern) that enables closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral nexus is vividly established through mist, damp earth, and swirling hush; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The seashell fragment functions as micro-setting, recurring across beats and charging the final image when buried. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias moves through mist to a clearing—and the environment subtly reflects his fractured state. The nexus dissolves into his writing desk at the end, a conceptual move that ties setting to interiority, though the transition risks feeling convenient rather than causally motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (latticed roof, weathered central post, coalescing light) and micro-setting elements—the vine, the post, the overhead lattice—directly enable the ritual's mechanics. Spatial choreography is clear: tendril touches post, vine weaves through lattice, golden tableaus bloom overhead. The harvest moon and pre-dawn timing constrain the ritual window, and the arbor's "natural frequency" must be tuned, making environment integral to the action. Sensory selection reflects urgency (luminescence pulsing, golden light spinning stories) and the final image of saturated wood and leaves charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vividly anchored—frozen soil, skeletal branches, bruised twilight—and the ritual materials (twigs, rust flakes, pebbles) function as micro-setting that shapes Kaelen's method. Sensory detail is purposeful: "cold ozone and distant memories," the permafrost's "resonant marrow." The final crater-rim release uses setting to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    The marble cavern, fissure, polished steel pins, and sunbeam tracking are vivid and specific. The setting constrains Elian's method—he must wait for light angles across the day—and the final hum and golden shimmer charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (pins placed at intervals, far wall painted with light) remains clear throughout.

    The bronze grotto, starlight through the ceiling, kerosene burner, and mosaic floor are vivid, selective, and purposeful. The burner constrains the ritual (holds the wisp, aligns with Alphena's light), and the mosaic charges the final image (Kaelen sets the new stone "into the pattern"). Sensory detail is filtered through Kaelen's non-human perception ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush"). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. Micro-setting (burner, grotto, starlight) all constrain choices and charge closure, meeting the 9+ gate test, but one hairline slip: "thawing world" above remains abstract rather than shown through concrete detail at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The skylight loft, kettle, and ash wood blank function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image: the kettle's countdown creates temporal pressure, the wood's "pale grain" becomes the vehicle for containment, and rain modulates from "sheets" to "whisper" to mirror emotional arc. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV—Leo's claim that ash "smelled of resilience and calm thunder" anchors character history in physical perception. The "rust-hued peace" in the final beat reweights the opening's hypnotic rain, charging closure. Spatial choreography (workbench, stove, mug, wood) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kinetic lagoon recurs and charges the final image: "no longer a taunt but a simple fact" reweights prior material. Spatial anchors (Precipice Platform, gilded rail, sheer drop, pile of crystallized condensation) are concrete and guide scavenging action. The camera wheel's "tiny teeth" and click constrain the memory beat. Minor gap: the world-stopped-turning premise supplies atmosphere but doesn't shape a mid-scene choice; the lagoon functions more as backdrop than tactical pressure until the final reframe.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through selective detail: "old ozone and new popcorn," "defunct Gate A-12," "dusty baggage carousels." The carnival's leftover generators and cables become essential resources that constrain and enable Elara's solution. Spatial choreography is clean across maintenance shafts, gantries, and the departures hall. The electro-chromic ceiling charges the final image decisively, transforming from "dead panels" to living star chart.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The forecourt functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's ritual: wet slate, dripping eaves, and the "single, golden ray" charge the final image and embody the conceptual shift from glacial tomb to cleansed world. Sensory detail is purposeful ("petrichor nostalgia," "the wet chill of the slate") and filtered through Elias's reverence. The sanctuary's "glacial hush" recurs with evolving pressure, and the forecourt's "crystal whispering" after rain structures the climax. Scale matches significance—no tourism, all tactile presence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    The twilight barge canal is vividly realized—"water the color of a day-old bruise," crumbling abutment, silt's grip—and the setting constrains Kael's method (pole, punt, grappling hook) and imposes a deadline (morning broadcast silence). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: cold water seeping into knuckles, chain rattling, mud shedding from the lockbox. The physical environment directly enables the salvage action and the radio on the bow creates a ticking clock. Minor opportunity: the dismantled bridge could have been leveraged more tactically in the retrieval choreography to push this into the 8.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Golden Dock, snow, fog, and oceanic hush are vividly rendered and sensory detail is selective. The setting constrains choice lightly: the liminal hour and fog cocoon enable the work, and the cold is felt through gloved fingers. The fulgurite glass and the rope function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (dock's end, harbor beyond). The environment modulates with pressure (fog invasion/recession) and the final reveal of the harbor reinforces closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadowed autumn garden is anchored early with selective, POV-filtered detail: "rust-colored chrysanthemums," "fallen pear leaves plastered to mossy ground," "skeletal branches" gilded by fading light. Sensory hierarchy matches Kaelen's reflective calm; scent and texture dominate over sound. The thread functions as micro-setting, its coarse texture and warmth ghost serving as the tactile anchor for the projection method. The garden's "lonesome splendor" and island isolation constrain Kaelen's work by sealing him in until spring, and the dying light pressures the writing act in the final beat. One missed opportunity: spatial choreography within the garden (bench, wisteria, distance to water) is sketched but not used to constrain movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The suspended palace on stalactites, the chasm city of gears below, and the Grand Orrery workshop create vivid spatial grounding. The incubator—"a strange marriage of scavenged clockwork and torn tapestries"—directly enables the hatching and charges the closure by embodying the hybrid aesthetic the hatchling inherits. The geothermal vent, velvet pedestal, and salt-rimed railings are purposefully selective, filtered through Kaelen's focus, and the micro-setting (incubator, egg on pedestal) constrains his choices and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian lagoon anchors the frame with vivid specificity ("ghost ship on a glassy sea"). The conservatory's banyan tree and the graft tools (knife, bark strip, red thread) constrain her actions and charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Sensory selection reflects her professional filter (soot, charred bark, scorched limb). The lagoon returns at the end to charge the final image, shifting from "church" to active promise. No occupation-level depth issues; the firefighting and grafting details read plausible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains, the Orrery basin, and the shattered oculus anchor the action concretely. The stained glass box as micro-setting object constrains the final choice (rotation to align colors) and charges the closure image when the sigil forms. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's analytical gaze (dusty twilight, saline flats, fractured color). The setting pressures the protagonist by limiting the celestial window and dictating the pedestal's exact position, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered ("swirling color," "gossamer veils of hydrogen and helium," "shimmering dust") and filtered through Xylar's melancholy bias. The gear—a "mote of impossible solidity"—provides tactile contrast and constrains the revelation by embodying the ancestor's failed logic. The setting's "troubling serenity" and "cyclical wound" charge the final image when Xylar turns silence into transmission. Minor slip: spatial choreography of the "oldest, most forgotten quadrant" remains abstract; we never learn what makes this region distinct from the cultivated zones.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient greenhouse functions as micro-setting throughout: vines like skeletal fingers, damp earth scent, storm rattling panes at climax. The slate and ribbon roll are handled across multiple beats, each texture traced deliberately. The storm's physical manifestation ("rattled the greenhouse's fragile panes") directly charges the peak moment when his focus narrows. Environment constrains and amplifies: the sanctuary's quiet enables meditation, the storm externalizes internal thundering, and living things surround the final carved web.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The belfry's sensory anchors—brass gleam, gear oil, stone walls—ground the opening cleanly. The tidal obsidian ridge functions as micro-setting within the ritual: its salt spray, black rock, and churning water constrain Elias's imagined release and charge the final return to the tower's "stone and shadow." The pendulum bob's "heavy, polished weight" becomes a tactile anchor for the town's burden and potential equilibrium, shaping his mental stance. Scope fits: body (torn hands, whipping coat), tool (rake handle, fine-bladed knife), and recurring object (pendulum, rake handle) all pressure the ritual choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt silo's "velveteen gloom" and "curved metal skin" create vivid micro-setting that constrains Elias's work (the lantern-lit workspace, felt-lined tray, wooden frame). Spatial choreography is coherent: tools, charts, tapestry, and sovereign case remain tracked across beats. The silo's cool stillness and the final shelf-building act charge the closure image by providing a physical anchor for the reunited intention and path. The setting does more than describe; it shapes the ritual's intimacy and the final gesture's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and twilight sky anchor setting early with vivid, purposeful detail. The drafting table and blank vellum function as micro-setting that constrains the central choice throughout. The kingfisher quill's "impossible blue and copper" charges the final image, and the analytical engine hum threads atmosphere. Sensory selection (sight, sound, tactile pressure of the quill) supports urgency without catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember alcove, shortwave dial glow, vellum, and luminous ink function as micro-setting that directly constrains and enables Elias's choices: the glow reveals the hidden words, the alcove is his sanctuary, the ink's wavelength-specific visibility drives his verification ritual. Sensory detail is filtered through his POV (jade light painting his frown, mist as accomplice) and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The final image of dust in the radio beam charges the thematic closure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment/object shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gallery is anchored early (ventilation grilles, charcoal dust, winter light) and micro-settings—Kiln Room's scorched brick, Stillness Room's rocking chair—constrain ritual steps and charge the final image. The chair's momentum functions as a ticking clock and the shaft of sunlight elevates the scattering beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. However, the "Vanishing Point Gallery" name feels ornamental; its spatial logic (rooms, transitions) remains functional but not deeply lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean setting—drip, brackish water, sedimentary layers, dry cistern ledge—constrains Silas's world and charges the final image of archiving in "the quiet dark of the sunken world." Sensory detail is purposeful: "rhythmic drip," "chalky residue of dissolved plaster," "gray light of the upper world" filtering down. The chronometer cog functions as micro-setting, its "breathtakingly fine pitch" teeth embodying lost precision. Spatial choreography is clean; the girl's arrival from the tunnel and retreat are legibly staged.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The velvet library and autumn frame the opening effectively, but the rehearsal hall lacks spatial anchors—no sense of room size, seating, or how the circle forms. The rosette appears in Elias's hand and is held up, but we never see it placed or its fretwork examined by the choir. Body/tool constraint is minimal; the rosette is more symbolic token than object that shapes a choice. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual and generic ("deep quiet," "dry leaves").

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: groaning metal, shattered glass, and moonlight through broken panes create both atmosphere and a surgical theater that frames the pruning act. Sensory details (metallic tang, acrid smoke, cloying sweetness) anchor the synesthetic premise and are filtered through Elias's chef palate. The celestial alignment and greenhouse wreckage together constrain the action to this night and this space, charging the final image. Minor: the "skeletal remains" and "forgotten era" lean slightly generic without additional specificity tying them to prior world history.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning collection tower is concretely rendered and constrains the scene's spatial logic; Silas's tollbooth and the tower's managed arcs frame the closure image. Sensory details—ozone, pollen, syrupy dusk—are filtered through Silas's priorities and modulate from opening urgency to closure calm. The lacquer box functions as micro-setting, charged at the end when it remains closed. The tower charges the final image (lightning arcing against purple sky), meeting the 9+ gate test; however, the bio-mechanical drones are summarized rather than shown as environmental actors, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting details are selective and purposeful: the "salt-heavy air," "manicured rock garden," "polished concrete stoop" all contrast organic chaos against sterile geometry. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, charging the final image and constraining her choice to place it. Spatial choreography is clean across both evenings. The white cube house serves as both setting and antagonist, shaping her most desperate attempt. Minor penalty: the bay itself remains somewhat generic beyond "quiet" and "spring"; a single sensory anchor unique to this bay would elevate specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater garden is vividly realized with bioluminescent flora, crushed pearl paths, and the filtration membrane reimagined as a living gill. The ampoule itself—foxglove-stained glass, violet nebula contents—constrains Mara's final choice and charges the burial image. Spatial choreography is clean: statue to garden to gill to plinth. Minor gap: the rebreather's hiss is the sole body/equipment anchor; one additional sensory constraint during the swim (pressure, cold, breath control) would have elevated the setting's pressure on choice into the 8.5+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The infinite staircase constrains every choice: indistinguishable steps create the measurement problem, the gray stone accepts his proofs, and the "designated step" becomes the rupture site. Micro-setting (dice, flint shard) functions as toolset and charges the final image when the chipped die shifts from flaw to key. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elian's mathematical priority (formulas over scent/sound). The staircase's shimmer and groan provide tactile resistance at the closure beat, making the environment essential to the rupture's legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop greenhouse is consistently pressured by smog, moonlight filtering through chemical haze, and the canyon of darkened towers. The moon-tipped brush, terracotta floor, philodendrons, and battery spotlights are tactile and recurring. Spatial choreography is clean: greenhouse interior, outer ledge, view across apartment blocks. The setting constrains the action (he must rouse a sleeping city from this elevated perch) and charges the final image when distant windows light in reply. Sensory detail is vivid—humid air, pale luminescence, plant-scented breath—and filtered through Elias's painter's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto city, frozen waterfall, dimming moss, and communal oven are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear; Alistair moves from council to cavern to the foot of the falls. The emerald lens filters glare to reveal stress fractures, constraining his perception and shaping his tactical choice. The scent of bread cuts through "sterile cold," anchoring sensory contrast in a high-pressure moment. Idiom remains consistent with a displaced, educated populace. The setting pressures choices: ice weight threatens collapse, moss provides light, the oven offers warmth—all functional rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse workshop is vivid and particular ("ozone and cold brass," "curved walls," granite foundations settling), and the low tide functions as both atmosphere and temporal constraint. The yoyo and hunger stone are handled as concrete objects that shape the final action. The setting does not strongly constrain choice during the peak beat—Elias's lever-pull would work in any isolated workspace—but the exposed rocks and island isolation charge the final image of stepping into the unknown, lifting this above pure backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    The funhouse setting (peeling paint, sagging pendulums, carousel of mirrors) is vividly rendered with selective detail and the "lingering luminance" mechanic filters perception through the protagonist's gift. The warped slide and mirror-carousel constrain navigation and charge the final confrontation. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The opera cloak clasp on the pedestal supplies a tangible object that anchors the climax, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating orchard is vivid, specific, and constrains Kai's options throughout (fragile sanctuary, interconnected timbers). The mallet and cedar log function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful ("taste of deep-water brine," "sun-bleached cedar") and the driftwood's groaning response to the storm drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtle-city setting is vivid, tactile, and purposeful: "shells grinding," "whelk-shell tower," the bleached sun as "silent pressure." Kaelen's perch on the shell-tower and the watchers' distant shimmer constrain his attempts and charge the final map projection. Micro-setting (the whistle, the worktable, the horizon structures) all funnel choice. The "Maw of Silence" vortex and the sealed gate supply the conceptual trap that makes the closure image undeniable. Sensory selection reflects urgency without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    The disused station and ivy are vividly rendered ("brick mausoleum choked with ivy," "dust motes danced"). The ivy returns as a metaphor ("slow and steady suffocation") that Aris points to during his argument, which charges the image slightly. Spatial choreography is clear (opposite benches, ticket window). However, the setting does not constrain choice—the conversation could occur anywhere—and the final beat (sliding the vellum "across the dusty space") uses setting as backdrop rather than pressure. The rosebush petal in the opening functions as a poetic marker but does not recur or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and particular: marsh mist, brackish water, skeletal pavilion dome, fissures in stone. The submerged pavilion constrains Elias's access (wading, bracing against tide) and supplies the fissure that enables his ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (datum points, foundation wounds) while the inkwell's "iron and permanence" smell charges the closure. However, spatial choreography during the underwater scramble lacks precision—exact depth, visibility, and body position remain vague when they would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunken library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: biolamps, condensation drip, phosphorescent moss. The micro-setting (moss-light, salt-sealed drawer) constrains Elias's physical choices—he must kneel and crane his neck to verify the match. The blackout functions as both atmosphere and pressure device, isolating him in "reclaimed stillness." The setting charges the closure image (silent library as partner in reclamation) without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Floating isles, crystalline staircase, glass basilica, and tea garden are vivid and purposeful. The paradoxical physics (descends while ascending) constrains movement and mirrors internal descent into memory. The gem's "powdered starlight" dust and the basilica refracting aether into rainbows provide sensory specificity filtered through grief. The lotus lantern at the dais charges the closure image. Minor gap: the tea garden's spatial choreography in the final beat (stone bench, paper from satchel) lacks the tactile grounding present earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orbital observatory and the capacitor bank's metronomic cooling anchor the scene vividly. The geode, console, and panoramic viewport are handled across beats and the geode charges the final image with its "terrible, beautiful coordinates." The cooling timeframe constrains her window, making the setting functional. However, the observatory itself is described more for atmosphere than as a resource that alters tactics; the circuit breaker reset is announced but doesn't force a new choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory dome with its "ring of polished obsidian" console, recessed handle, and massive lens is vivid and constrains Elara's path—she must use the drone to reach the hidden panel. The "cool, thin air of the mountaintop at dusk" and "jagged peaks" ground the setting with selective sensory detail. The lens itself becomes a functional setting element that channels starlight to the chip, directly enabling closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the drone's spiraling path and the iris opening.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood are vivid and purposeful; the shore's sensory detail ("sandpaper on bone") is well-filtered through Elias's grief. The watch hand and driftwood function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. Minor gap: the terrace itself does not constrain a middle choice, serving more as frame than pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The parapet is vividly rendered (mist tasting of salt and old stone, eroded crenellations, loose flagstone with lunar crescent) and constrains the exchange spatially—narrow walkway forces proximity, exposed height underscores vulnerability. The lion drawer pull as micro-setting object charges the final image when it returns warm in Elias's palm. Sensory selection is purposeful (wind snatching voice, chains' muted clatter swallowed by mist), though the grey-sea description in the opener leans slightly decorative. The lockbox mechanics (lead-lined cavity, ornate depression) anchor the ritual's tactile reality and charge the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and the compass all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "thick with the smell of salt and low tide…a scent that used to mean home and now only meant accusation." The body and tool (compass, duffel) anchor micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean: gravel to sand, water lapping at boots. The environment pressures the protagonist's stance throughout, and the final step onto damp sand makes the shift tactile and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("soft blue and green light," "smell of wet stone and something alive") that charges the final reconfiguration. The cavern constrains the protagonist's choice by isolating him with the letter, and the "delicately robust" ecosystem mirrors his thematic realization, elevating the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean through the descent and islet discovery. Minor deduction: the Cinderwood Barrens and the protagonist's apartment are sketched without tactile grounding, and the journey's middle transit lacks environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit orchard is vivid and purposeful: silver-leafed trees, glowing moths, six-legged foxes, and sloths with nebula eyes ground the fairy-tale frame. The setting charges the final image—Elian becomes "a function of this sacred place"—and the orchard's permanence mirrors the eternal bond. Micro-setting elements (the carved wooden box, the stone mortar) appear in ritual beats but don't constrain choice; they serve texture more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade setting is vivid and charged—ozone, starlight, phosphorescent moss, churning clouds—and the altitude/beauty motif recurs purposefully. The saucer's cool ceramic contrasts with the thrumming energy, grounding tactile detail in the POV's present perception. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice; Elara could reach the same realization in any contemplative space. The glade functions as atmospheric stage rather than pressure source, capping the score below 9-band eligibility despite strong sensory work.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Scrap-Ark's grated deck plates, recycled metal skin that groans and contracts, and the microgravity core all constrain Elara's movements and charge key beats—her feet lifting when joyful, sinking when weighted by sorrow, floating in the core after euphoric lightness. The command deck's main table and dome structure frame the final image. Sensory detail is selective and embodied through her tactile and gravitational experience, with the ship's responses mirroring her emotional states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and specific: black sand, obsidian grains, tidal pool, basaltic stones. The hidden alcove and carvings add texture, and the volcano's hum creates atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics; the conch shell redirects his path, but the alcove serves primarily as a stage for the fireflies rather than a spatial constraint that forces a trade-off. The setting charges the final image (glowing steam, warmth in the sand) but does not shape the decision-making process.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The luminous fort's phosphorescent algae walls and glowing moss-slicked stone create a vivid micro-setting, and the half-painted sundial anchors the climactic unlock. The bronze quill holder constrains Kael's method (he must turn it against coded numerals), satisfying the 9+ gate for an object that shapes choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's vigilant stance. Spatial choreography is clean: main gate → central courtyard → sundial. The setting does not evolve causally after the unlock; the change is described in summary ("dozens of windows… began to flicker"), limiting the environment's live pressure on subsequent action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The basalt bluff, aurora, and frictionless sea are vividly rendered and establish a coherent SFF setting. The magnetic boots and the stone spiral function as micro-setting elements that constrain Kael's movement and choices. The aurora serves as both atmosphere and trigger, directly shaping the climactic beat. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment charges the final image when the wave splits around the bluff.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly rendered and pressures the protagonist's state throughout: the trapped lightning echoes his inner storm, the dead telescope mirrors his silenced voice, and the clouds' parting at the end opens a spatial path that charges the closure. The darkroom timer, bus timetable, and telescope control panel function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is strong (light, thunder, metal echoes), filtered through Elias's poet's eye, and the setting's particulars (mildewed periodicals, iron catwalk, alcove) are integrated into action rather than cataloged.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atrium, sundial, and gnomon's shadow constrain Kaelen's tactical sequence beat by beat; the brook provides ambient percussion. The mechanical arm's "faint whirring of its internal chronometers" and the Danish tin catching light are vivid, purposeful anchors. Spatial choreography (circling, lunging at marked angles) is coherent and the setting charges the final image when the pedestal opens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted library dome, jagged skyline, and shattered glass are filtered through Silas's "cathedral of decay" lens and recur purposefully. The gaping entrance frames the strangers' arrival, altering Silas's choice to step forward. The coffee tin's false bottom and the teetering book stack both constrain action and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the grimy marble floor, the dented tin) functions as pressure; the lunar glow pours silver at closure, elevating the ending without excess decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arbor is vividly rendered—"platform of woven lightwood and flowering vines that bobbed on an ocean of slow-drifting vapor"—and the setting constrains choice (compasses fail, forcing reliance on the film reel). The final threshold "smelled of ozone and old celluloid," charging the closure image with sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean and the arbor's "strange physics" enables the sonic breakthrough, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient ridge, sky-plume blossoms, and approaching monsoon constrain Elara's timeline and charge the final image: the rain begins as she plants the seed, creating a tactile payoff. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"metallic tang of the coming deluge," "impossible blue deepening to an almost painful vibrancy"—and filtered through Elara's professional/emotional lens. The seed as micro-setting object recurs with evolving significance (inert, then pulsing) and the highest point of the ridge becomes the precise location where faith must be enacted, directly shaping the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Islet setting is vivid and selective: windswept juniper, granite bluff, scent of salt and damp earth. The compass in Kenji's hands and the bluff's stone constrain the ritual beat, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves (desk → bluff → desk). Sensory hierarchy reflects Kenji's priorities (lace pattern, compass needle) without tourist-catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting constrains choice and charges the final image: the storm-damaged greenhouse pressures tactics, and the butterfly-dust pane acts as a micro-setting that enables his perceptual shift. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the canyon and frost patterns constraining choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and filtered through Kaelen's POV, such as the "delicate lacework of ice." Micro-setting elements like the ledger and kiln are integrated into action, supporting the 9+ quick test by altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The winterglass conservatory constrains choices by serving as a score for Elara's projections, charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, with the setting integrated into action. The circlet and tuning fork case function as micro-settings that influence tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the underwater library and broken lens constraining choices and charging the final image; sensory details like "salt-stained box" and "shimmering light" are filtered through Elias's POV, enhancing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting details like the "terra-cotta arbor" and "antique silver bell" are selective, purposeful, and charge the final image by constraining choices (e.g., the arbor as a meeting point). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's POV, with crisis narrowing perception to immediacies like the bell's etchings.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly specific, with the twilight viaduct and moon-jasmine constraining Elara's choice and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism, enhancing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is vividly specific and constrains choices, particularly the hyperbolic maze which is essential to the climax. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, charging the final image with the green scent and paths.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prize redemption center constrains choice and charges the finale, transforming into a defense system. Sensory details like "dust sifted from the ceiling" and "corroded panel" are purposeful and POV-filtered. Micro-setting elements (piano bench, keys) directly shape tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting is vividly specific and filtered through Elias's synesthesia (e.g., salt-streaked glass, ghost-white blossoms). The greenhouse and shipwrecks constrain choice by mirroring his internal state and charging the final image.

Environment and recurring objects (the arbor, the bell) actively shape choices and charge the final image of tools and seeds on the ridge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially in night scenes and the community’s work at dawn. The world stays slightly generic in geopolitical terms, but for this length the atmosphere and spatial logic are strong and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight viaduct, misted valley, and jasmine bloom are rendered with rich, selective detail that strongly support tone and theme, and the micro-setting of the flower on stone directly charges the final realization about tenacious beauty born from transformed love. The camera obscura box as a dark sanctum also functions as a tactile micro-setting. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain options beyond being a chosen liminal space, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The living bridge, hornbeam hedges, and hyperbolic maze are richly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s obsession with time. Setting is not mere backdrop: the maze’s geometry becomes his tactical tool at the climax, and the leaves literally bear his memories. The final image—him standing in the maze, with only scent and paths—reweights the environment as both origin and blank page. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, supporting tone and theme without bogging pace.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prize redemption center is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: claw machines, Skee-Ball lanes, ticket dispensers, and dusty prizes all become functional parts of the defense system. The chain and wall are not just atmospheric; they constrain her choices and charge the final image of the “chained liberator.” Sensory detail is concrete and purposeful (“dusty, grinning bears,” “hurricane of paper”), and spatial logic in how the machines impede movement is clear. The environment both shapes tactics and mirrors the thematic tension between manufactured fun and real survival.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck masts, aurora, moss-hum, and ash forge are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory and emotional biases. The setting does more than decorate; it parallels his internal state and charges the final shipwreck image with thematic weight. However, the environment rarely constrains his tactical choices—it shapes meaning more than it shapes options. That keeps it just short of the very highest band despite its richness.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Emerald Station’s “grand art-deco terminal” and the emerald-tinted moonlight are vivid and atmospheric, and the setting’s tone harmonizes tightly with the magical object and his emotional state. Details like the rusted service hatch and marble pedestal feel specific and well-chosen. The environment mainly serves mood rather than constraining his choices, which keeps it a notch below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned control room and the thawing station are vividly rendered (“metallic tomb,” “steady drip,” groans of melting ice) and directly constrain choices via the structural failure. Environmental change (collapse vs. mild, wet air outside) mirrors Elara’s internal thaw and charges the final image with conceptual weight. Tools and objects (furnace, blowpipe, consoles) are integrated into action, not just scenery. The world feels specific and atmospheric without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted library, ten-meter drop, and exposed girders under a star-sprayed ceiling are vividly drawn and consistently used: the height ties into acrophobia, the ruin explains the hidden panel and maintenance phone, and the shattered dome enables the constellation cipher. Setting details stay tethered to Leo’s priorities—fall risk, concealment, sightlines to stars—and never devolve into touristic cataloguing. The environment meaningfully constrains and enables tactics, particularly in the decoding moment where the visible constellations supply the key. While atmospheric and functional, the setting stops short of a fully symbolic counterpoint; it supports rather than profoundly reconfigures the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the storm-tossed ridge fort, ambered hush, slit of sky, and salt-heavy silences all feel tactile and integrated with Kaelen’s work. The environment isn’t postcard garnish; the storm literally generates the silences he “maps,” and the single star through the stone slit constrains when the ritual can occur. Details are filtered through his obsession with silence and darkness, giving the world a strong POV bias. The final image of the softened wind and marbled hush crystallizing around him shows the setting actively charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen courtyard at violet twilight is concretely drawn and consistently returned to, with the fountain and monoliths giving a contained, carceral feel. The setting meaningfully constrains the story—this is a bounded arena where the anomaly appears and resets occur, not a generic backdrop. The crystalline violin refracting “purple gloom” is both environmental and symbolic, charging the central choice. A bit more tactile engagement with cold and physical constraint under stress could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and selective: the “crystal whispering expanse of wet stone,” damp granite, jasmine-scented park, and the cenotaph all feel embodied and atmospheric. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility—objects of perception (the forecourt, cenotaph, tickets, lens) double as emotional barometers. The projector lens functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when placed in Lena’s palm. Environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but it strongly charges mood and meaning in the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The garden maze, hedgerows, wisteria, mossy sundial, and bees are vividly rendered and always filtered through Elias’s attention, making the setting feel lived-in and consequential. The environment directly shapes the outcome (only his side supports the returning butterflies) and charges the final image of him walking the paths at dusk. World details like wrist-com luck scores and Flora-Optima fold in smoothly without derailing the grounded botanical space.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—violet gas giant, continent‑sized sleeping lepidoptera, the station’s mechanically warm device—filtered through Elias’s working hands. Environmental detail is economical yet atmospheric, and the "hush" plus twilight resonance concretely frames the experiment’s timing. The final image of the icy station air as a cradle subtly recharges the earlier cold/warmth and vastness imagery. While the xenobiology specifics don’t heavily constrain tactics, the environment does meaningfully charge tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The flooded opera house with lanterns and the orchestra pit is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—the water isn’t backdrop but the literal mechanism of revelation, and the ruined hall’s “in between” state mirrors the ghost’s unfinished business. Spatial and sensory details (dark mirror, skeletal balconies, damp velvet) are specific and filtered through Elias’s artistic eye. The environment constrains options—he must work with water and low light, not a lab or pristine archive—which charges his tactic. The final exit from the hall into the “living symphony” of the city gives the setting a meaningful, reweighted send-off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain weather station is vividly and economically rendered—the cold air, instruments, and “auroral” light all feel concretely inhabited and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental details mirror and charge the interior stakes (barograph, anemometer, ozone scent) without turning into blunt symbolism. Crucially, the setting and light explicitly charge the final image of the illustration on the windowsill, satisfying the object-as-setting gate. The only slight limitation is that the physical environment constrains mood and atmosphere more than literal options for action.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific, from the “damp, devouring dark” of the tunnel to “machinery loomed like sleeping iron beasts” over oily water. Environmental details do work: the submerged floor, darkness, and rising pipe constrain movement and focus attention on the valve as the only actionable locus. The industrial space plausibly houses a “factory ghost shift,” and that concept is embodied in sound, smell, and texture rather than mere label. The final quiet—a tunnel room emptied of spectral noise—feels like a reconfigured environment that mirrors his internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the overgrown catacomb library, the folding transition, and the obsidian riverbank—are vivid, tactile, and filtered through the keeper’s sensibility. Environmental elements actively shape possibilities: the oppressive library and catacombs create the need for escape, while the river’s “regenerative silence” and the obsidian shard define what restoration looks like. The recurring materiality of stone, dust, and glass charges the final image of quiet by the river. Description is lush but mostly efficient, with strong sensory variety (dust, moss, ozone, wet stone, liquid starlight).

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: dusty ground, dried sagebrush, and the shifting sky during the eclipse all mirror and charge the emotional movement. The eclipse in particular is not just backdrop but an active atmospheric device—the bruised twilight, corona, and “diamond” of returning light shape the ritual’s beats and the closure image. Sage Ridge as a proper noun is less essential than the desert-like feel, but the environment is consistently filtered through the emotional stakes. The kalimba and earth-as-living-body function almost as micro-settings that focus the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The reclaimed silo library, “bronze quiet,” apex light shaft, and fireplace are vivid, selective details that create a strong atmosphere and are filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility (“walls… cupping memory like water”). Setting elements matter structurally: the curved walls justify his vocation, the fireplace yields the diaries, and the apex light and oak desk charge the final image. The world rule of a post-dream era is cleanly integrated and consistent with the environment’s stillness. The silo and its objects genuinely constrain what he can do (read echoes, not intervene), satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse, fog, coastal road, and distant mainland are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a keeper-spy’s eye, giving the piece a strong sense of place. The environment meaningfully informs his distance and method (watching through binoculars, directing from isolation) and charges the final image of him descending the stairs. Weather and light (the “ghostly metronome” of the beam) support the musical and navigational motifs without feeling forced. The setting could constrain concrete choices a bit more, but it already does notable thematic and atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cube-like “dimensional anchor,” bone-felt hum, and sparse room defined by silence create a strong, specific atmosphere that is inseparable from the method of exorcism. The loop pedal and microphone function as tools embedded in the setting that directly shape tactics and outcome. The artist’s palette and its gray smear also work as micro-setting elements that carry thematic charge into the final image. The world’s rules stay consistent and are conveyed economically through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are not just pretty; they architect the central image of the mirrored horizon forming an “infinite, luminous sphere” with Kaelen at the core, which directly charges the climax and final atmosphere. Environmental details (black-glass ice, pre-dawn stillness, vibrating light) are selective, sensorial, and closely tied to his inner state. The nautilus fragment functions as a micro-setting/tool, mediating his attention and focusing his method. The only thing holding this just shy of 9+ is that the physical environment constrains options symbolically and atmospherically more than through concrete tactical limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing viaduct, wet tarmac, ozone, and internal lighting create a vivid, specific, and consistent atmosphere. The environment is more than backdrop: its reconfiguring geometry and oppressive glow mirror and embody the procedural prison, then soften at closure to mark release. However, the setting rarely constrains moment-to-moment choices tactically; it’s primarily symbolic and atmospheric rather than a live physical obstacle. Still, the bridge and its light meaningfully charge the final shift into “true dawn.”

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drum maker’s limestone cavern, hanging drums, and cool draft are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through touch and vibration, matching the protagonist’s sensory reality. The setting is not decorative: stone and floor conduction make her tactile music possible and charge the final image of “resonant heart of the earth.” Seasonal cues (“faint rustle of turning seasons,” damp earth, encroaching cold) deepen the atmosphere and frame the ending as a kind of emotional winter breaking. Environment, tools, and object-as-setting all converge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the courtyard’s “residual warmth,” “damp ivy,” and “velvety blue” deepen mood while the sealed eastern district and forgotten subterranean arteries are tightly integrated into the plot. Environmental detail is filtered through Elias’s professional bias (barometric pressures, ventilation shafts, pressure equalization conduits), which grounds the speculative element. The world’s rules (quarantine, rogue zone, underground infrastructure) feel internally consistent and are learned through his reasoning, not dumped. The courtyard itself is more atmospheric than constraining, but the city’s physical infrastructure meaningfully shapes his ultimate tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered—condensation, fractured light, UV lamps, “library of lost fragrances”—and consistently filtered through his sensory priorities, especially smell and light. The environment is not just decorative: it provides the specialized UV apparatus and the extinct bloom necessary for the revelation, and the final image is charged by glass, blossom, and shadows together. A slight reason for not pushing higher is that the setting rarely pinches his options moment-to-moment; it frames the experiment more than it actively constrains tactics under pressure. Still, for this length, atmosphere and specificity are notably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto, clay bowl, and strange starlight are vivid and filtered through Elias’s sensibility, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The rope is an object-as-setting that returns to charge the final realization by contrasting bodily escape with this new existential threshold. The environment doesn’t constrain physical tactics but it decisively frames the emotional and conceptual stakes at the end. World rules (Lumin, sky-river) are consistent and delivered economically.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: the “sunken orchard greenhouse” and shipwreck ring shape acoustics, atmosphere, and metaphor. Environmental specifics aren’t postcard; they actively matter when the dome and wrecks become the resonant body for her music. The mendicant’s bowl and condensation ritual anchor world and theme, then directly charge the final image with the single drop. World rules (drowned coasts, chronic hush) are consistent and threaded through action and perception rather than dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber grotto, obsidian slab, and resonant crystals create a vivid, sensorially layered environment that clearly reflects Kael’s specialized work and interior state. Details are filtered through his professional lens (light, charge, crystal phial) and recur to charge the final image (“its facets catching the amber light”). While the setting doesn’t constrict his physical options, it strongly shapes tone and the emotional logic of the ritual. The world rules (crystals, static, memory) feel consistent and integrated rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop library above the sea and concert hall is evocative and well-integrated, with the salty air, starlight, and vantage over the hall reinforcing themes of quiet infrastructure and distant beauty. Details like the open-air tables and plaque location make the space feel lived-in rather than generic. The environment supports tone more than it constrains choices—nothing about the physical setup really alters what they can or must do. Still, it provides a strong atmospheric frame that coheres with the characters’ vocations and the memorial gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are vivid, textured, and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop: the arbor and its saplings directly shape his offering (reed mats at their roots), and the fissure near the crater’s lip directs the search tactic that leads to the discovery. Environmental details evolve with the action—from the glowing corridors of the search to the quiet night of weaving—without static repetition. The orchard/arbor pairing also thematically mirrors the tension between fragility and permanence, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Aerie’s rooftop canals across a sleeping giant’s chest, the metronomic water, and the crystalline nests of stolen time are vivid, specific, and integrated into action rather than static backdrop. Setting is inseparable from the stakes (the giant’s nap, the city’s heartbeat) and from the mechanics of the conflict (channels speeding/slowing, Elias applying the “beat” to the water). Sensory texture leans visual and conceptual but feels purposeful and coherent in tone. The environment guides what’s possible without needing heavy exposition, though it stops just shy of constraining Elias tactically in a more concrete, body-level way.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern orchard, dripping stalactites, and fissure-fed moonlight are not just atmospheric; they actively inflect the magic (light for the lattice, dripping water nourishing the hidden space) and charge the final image of buried optimism as a “seedling in the dark, fertile ground.” Details are tightly chosen and filtered through Elian’s sensibility, giving the environment a lived, ritualistic feel rather than a tourist catalog. The mosaic path and stones further function as a micro-setting that structures his actions and his emotional calculus. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library is vividly rendered—“shadowed library at dawn,” “sapphire hush,” stuttering power—so the environment feels textured and specific without touristic listing. The building’s hidden architecture (pipe chases, crawl spaces, grates) is integral to Elias’s tactics and identity rather than merely scenic. The outage and dawn light tangibly affect what’s possible and when, culminating in Anya entering with first light as the key temporal and spatial hinge. The final image of the “sapphire hush of the library” as sole witness nicely charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse, storm, hemlocks, mossy trellis, and damp earth are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through a botanist’s eye, avoiding generic weather description. Environment isn’t decorative: the trellis’s collapse and the storm season directly generate the crucible that forces his decision. The linden vine and leaf function as charged micro-setting/objects that constrain his choices and inflect the final realization. Atmosphere and physical space evolve with the plot (from gale to cleansing mist), amplifying the thematic shift without feeling over-arranged.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal island, retreating tide, storm-scribed mud, and exposed knot of roots and drone are vividly rendered and always filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Environment shapes action (he can cross only as tide retreats; the storm’s erosion reveals the convergence) and charges the central image. The amber brooch and the island’s history with the last ferry recur to weight the ending. It stops just short of 9+ only because the setting, while excellent, doesn’t quite introduce a new constraint at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The musical crystal cave is richly realized and integral: its sounds, light, and crystals constantly shape perception and options (e.g., the refracted path guiding Kael, the chimes’ crescendo at his entrance). World rules around the cave’s song and the Heartstone are consistent and taught through action rather than exposition dumps. The environment directly charges the final image—cave song altered, magic diffused—and constrains what is possible. A slight excess of abstract description (“immense, ancient desire”) sometimes edges away from concrete sensory grounding, but not enough to harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ivory harbor, mist, wet stones, and cluttered workshop are rendered with strong, specific sensory detail that feels lived-in and purposeful. The environment reflects and reinforces the story’s preoccupation with liminality and aftermath, especially the “liminal space between the known land and the unknowable sea.” While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it consistently inflects perception and tone and charges the archival work. World rules (tides, ruins, return of exiles) feel coherent without exposition dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful, from the cracked pavement “language” to the misty alleys to the starlit vault that literalizes unspoken truths. Details are well filtered through Elias’s cartographic mindset, making the environment feel both lived and symbolically resonant. The fortress-as-vault of truths directly supports the premise and final reconfiguration, though it rarely constrains his options in a concrete way. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are a major strength, only slightly shy of using environment as an active obstacle or enabler.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stargazer’s open tower, unglazed archways, salt wind, and migrating whales create a vivid, texturally rich setting that consistently reflects and pressures the action. Weather and environment meaningfully affect events—the storm sharpens the whale-song patterns and prevents this from being a purely abstract puzzle. The tower as sanctuary and vantage point charges the final image when he looks out over the now-placid water. A touch more tactile engagement with the space during the climax could push this higher, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prismatic escondite, the solar storm, and the imagery of bent light and impossible geometry are vivid and strongly atmosphere-building. Setting details (crystalline walls, refracted ghosts, groaning cosmos) are well-integrated into the action rather than feeling like a static backdrop. The storm and the sanctuary both shape what’s possible—he’s harvesting the storm, and the hideout buffers him until he can open the rift—so the environment genuinely constrains and enables choices. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual and auditory would push this closer to elite.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly realized—the “porcelain stillness,” formaldehyde tang, ventilation, and stainless-steel table all feel tactile and grounded in her occupational lens. That environment is not just decorative: its institutional processes (repatriating foreign nationals) directly enable the smuggling plan. The recurrent presence of tools and the ink pot tie atmosphere to action, and the room’s quiet serves as an effective counterpoint to her father’s world. A slight limitation is that once the plan is underway, the setting mostly stabilizes rather than further constraining her options.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop, and silent town are vivid and specific, with sensory detail (moss, twisted branches, cool lamp light, dawn sunlight) tightly integrated into action. The fluorescent lamp and bonsai canopy are not mere backdrop; they physically shape the method—sunlight pressing against artificial light to “refract” history—and charge the final image. World rules around the silence and the workshop are consistent and economically sketched. This environment very much feels like the only place this story could occur.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port and container-yard are rendered with sensual, selective detail—“iron labyrinth,” “slick, green-bearded pylons,” brine and diesel—anchored firmly in the narrator’s auditory and tactile bias. The environment is not decorative: the stacked metal walls shape acoustics, enable the eavesdropping method, and the tide’s rise/fall literally governs when stories arrive and recede. The small container interior and the poison-label tin function as micro-settings that charge the final image of carefully storing the label again. This integration of place with perception and theme is strong enough to feel indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory and cliff are vividly, efficiently realized, and their decay (“grand tomb for forgotten questions”) mirrors Elias’s chosen obscurity. Objects-as-setting—the seashell and half-finished cello—are fully integrated and directly constrain what he can do, culminating in a charged final touch of the shell. Weather and dust aren’t mere wallpaper; the wind becomes counter-melody and dust motes become the compass needle. The scale of detail is well-judged for the length, with no white-room gaps or irrelevant cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft-carnival world is vivid, sensory, and specific, with calliope music, bunting-draped alleyways, and phantasmagoric graffiti integrated into action rather than paraded as backdrop. The setting directly constrains tactics (they can’t “fight,” must reorganize within the floating city’s visual language) and makes the graffiti-led economic order feel organic. The foundation stone chip and the water’s edge at the end charge the final image, tying setting and theme together. World rules about the Revel’s culture and the encroaching mainland remain consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: Kepler-186f’s cold, the long night, the “moonlit summit,” and the hostile sunrise all constrain what’s possible and when. Details like regolith crunch, groaning suit heaters, and the Hasselblad vs. digital systems feel specific and purposeful rather than touristic. The environment directly shapes the climax—the star’s first ray acting “like a blade” that kills the flora—and charges the final image with that barren, newly lit summit. It’s excellent work just shy of the most breathtakingly original worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and textured: mist-coated rail depot, disused signal box, condensation-slick windows, and the crystal basins under a lamp all feel specific and inhabited. Environmental elements—fog, harbor horns, vibrations through the workbench—are integrated into Elara’s method, not just scenic garnish. The basins and water function as a kind of micro-setting or tool that literally constrains how she perceives and acts, and they charge the final image. A slightly clearer spatial tie between rail depot and harbor might increase plausibility, but it doesn’t harm the core effect.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The outpost, frozen lake, corroded antenna, and single pane of glass are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the premise; the cold and condensation literally generate the core magical image. Details are filtered through Elias’s professional eye (map, watershed, “tin can at the edge of the known world”), giving the setting both atmospheric and conceptual weight. The environment constrains options—he’s isolated with only instruments and a window—and charges the final image of the glowing frost-map against the humming dark. A slight deepening of non-visual senses under peak pressure (sound/physical strain) could push this toward absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ghost town is vividly evoked—the archway, cobblestones, market square, and “wild hush” all feel tactile and specific. Setting is filtered through Elias’s sonic focus (stones as keys, streets as rhythms), which deepens both world and concept. The archway and tuning fork charge the final image as tools embedded in place rather than mere props. At this length, the integration of environment with method and mood is notably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underwater temple is vividly particular—phosphorescent algae, “liquid midnight,” obsidian altar—and all of it is filtered through this character’s reverent, scientific gaze. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: the abyss’s isolation, the drowned faith, and the physical constraints of depth and pressure all heighten the stakes and feed the tone. The micro-setting of altar + abyss + submersible and their lights/power directly shape what is possible at the end. It stops just shy of perfection because the temple’s physicality doesn’t quite alter tactics beyond atmosphere and inevitability, though it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef is vividly realized and integral, not decorative: its isolation, decommissioned status, and uncanny physics make the impossible tableau and delayed discovery plausible. Details like “a rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea to the gray sky” and “copperlight repose” are filtered through the narrator and consistently support tone and theme. The environment constrains choices (no witnesses, slow coast guard response) and charges the final image (“the lighthouse will remember who set it free”). World rules (this place sustains impossibilities) are introduced early and then dramatized through the suspended bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and “bubble of glass against a tapestry of endless night” are vivid, coherent, and filtered through Elian’s work-focused perception. Setting is not postcard-only: the transformed, poisonous plants and the Night Phalaenopsis directly shape the stakes and the mechanism of resolution. Environmental details evolve with the haunting and culminate in the charged final image of the silent orchard and warm bead. A slight overreliance on visual/ornamental flourish in places keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, coherent, and integral: the bone-white wharfs, red canyon walls, emptied tide pools, and labyrinth architecture all shape tone and concept rather than serving as mere backdrop. Environmental pressure matters: the canyon walls literally receive the threads; the dust storm, carved alcove, and porous rock materially constrain and enable choices. The copper plate and the storybook harbor function as charged objects that reframe the present setting and explicitly reemerge in the ending as the “key” to the map. It stops just short of 9+ because in the climactic storm sequence, weather and terrain guide stakes more than moment-to-moment tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “catacomb orchard” is vivid, specific, and sensorially grounded—roots snaking through bones, damp soil, faint blossoms—immediately anchoring tone and world. Setting is not merely decorative: the fig tree’s root physically grips the sundial and complicates the excavation, and the orchard’s fusion of life and death thematically underwrites the final sense of continuity. The environment recurs and subtly evolves from eerie to sustaining as Elara’s understanding shifts. This integration of place with both action and theme is strong enough to charge the final image but stops just shy of absolute indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Gilded Gryphon and the dawn-lit, empty plaza are vividly rendered, with selective detail (glass ceiling, golden cabinets, sanitation drone, chalked pavement) that supports tone and world-building. The environment feels particular to this story and neatly echoes the theme of analog relics in a hyper-digital world. Still, the setting frames rather than constrains choices; it charges mood more than it pressures action, which holds the score below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt observatory, grand telescope, eternal candle, and turning dome are vivid and integrated into action rather than set-dressing. The environment genuinely constrains choices—the calibration protocol, unmonitored narrow-band channel, and dusty auxiliary terminal create the vector for her intervention. The eternal candle returns in the last image, charging the final moment with a quiet, almost mythic continuity between her small act and the observatory’s larger history. Autumn as a detail is more atmospheric than functional, but the micro-setting work overall is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth, stilt-hut, spirits, and window are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the ritual, never feeling like postcard description. The environment and specific tools (window glass, humidity, moonlight, shard) materially shape how the memory is accessed and how Elara recovers. The final image of the shard angled toward the ascending moon elegantly closes the loop between setting and cost. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere fully in service of the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atrium, mist, twilight, and sterile clinic are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Environmental detail (the misted valley, the glass walls, the hiss of the generator) reflects and contrasts the inner tension without feeling over-signaled. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does charge the final image (“Outside, the mist swirled against the glass, but here… something had imperceptibly cleared”). Specificity is high and well-integrated into action and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ruined orchard district and its “centuries of fog” are vividly drawn and tonally apt, with specific, textured images like “skeletal remains of ancient espaliers” and moss on brick. The environment lightly pressures the action (fog trying to reclaim colors, ruin dictating a crumbling wall as canvas) and mirrors the thematic erosion of memory. The fresco fragment and wall function as a micro-setting that charges the final image. The setting is more atmospheric than constraint-heavy, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized—the “glass ferns,” bioluminescence, and tonal shifts are precise, multi-sensory, and POV-filtered through a restorer’s eye and ear. Environmental rules (sound refracting through crystals) are learned via action and then exploited, and the hobo nickel-as-micro-setting charges the final image. The setting genuinely constrains tactics and perception rather than serving as a postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: community gardens as a “living library,” the glass-and-steam greenhouse, bioluminescent fungi, and the spectral orchid all filter through Kaelen’s priorities and the resistance’s tactics. Environmental specifics like insect messengers and coded blossoms aren’t postcard detail; they underwrite the plausibility of the resistance network and the plan to “break the medium itself.” The orchid and greenhouse architecture materially shape the climax, as their unique properties enable the grid-warping act. One could imagine even more sensory spread under peak stress, but what’s here is already above-average and tightly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gargantuan shell, midnight sea, twin moons, and postcard create a vivid, coherent mythic environment that feels tactile rather than generic. Setting is not just decorative: the shell’s acoustics and chambers transmit her poems, the aperture channels the off-key wind, and the moonlight’s angle justifies the postcard’s final placement. The nacre, conches, and “reef-shadow” imagery mirror the thematic transformation of pain into layered beauty. A slight cap comes from the world’s rules remaining impressionistic—there’s no real constraint or danger from the environment beyond loneliness—though at this length and mode, it mostly works.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined and precise: “opal floors that swirled with the captive light of forgotten dawns,” a “library above the clouds,” and glass orchids as crystallized emotions all feel distinctive and inhabited. These details are not mere backdrop; they’re bound to function and stakes—the gallery’s isolating altitude, the orchids’ fragility, and the artifact-tool all shape what is possible. The final image of Elian as a “solitary figure in the magnificent ruin” leverages the environment to charge the ending. A small amount of description edges toward decorative, but most is purposeful and filtered through his practiced gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The extinct language archive is vividly realized (dust motes, moonbeam, shelves of dead tongues) and filtered through Kaelen’s scholarly, magical priorities. The environment contributes conceptually via ambient magic and the sense of sacred, dangerous knowledge, and the glass ink well functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image. While the archive doesn’t overtly constrain tactics beyond providing access and atmosphere, it deeply supports tone and plausibility. World rules about Proto-Aenic are consistent and efficiently embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcano-crater amphitheater and its “geologic sighs” are vivid, coherent, and consistently filtered through a machinist’s perception. Setting is not decorative: the ghost-orchid pollen, azurite, amphitheater geometry, and “breathing” stone all enable the map, the cipher, and the final reconfiguration of meaning. The morning “breath” of the volcano charges the closing realization and ties environment directly to theme. This is an integrated micro-world that feels particular and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The attic bookshop, skylight, dust, wicker cages, and storm are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility (astronomy, constellations of dust, the meteorite). Environment materially shapes events: the skylight enables the dust-mapping ritual, and the leaking roof endangers the music and triggers the climax. Recurring objects (meteorite, skylight, birds, cages) charge the ending’s emotional field and echo the themes of balance and orbit. The setting feels lived-in and functionally indispensable to the story’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drifting prism terrace and the later silver void are vivid, specific, and integrated with the stakes: the terrace’s edge and light patterns literally govern thresholds, and the platform’s bare chair refocuses everything onto the grain-reading method. Weather-of-realities and wood grain as navigational tools are memorable and character-filtered rather than generic spectacle. Setting constrains choices (only one “northernmost” sacred threshold, no promise of return) and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater city and Celestial Dome are vividly evoked, with sound (“groaned…symphony of stressed metal”), pressure, and darkness working together to create a coherent, oppressive yet wondrous atmosphere. The bioluminescent jellies interacting with the city’s energy grid is a strong, specific environmental mechanic that also charges the central image. The burnt feather as a small recurring object helps bridge surface and abyss, tangibly charging the final sense of belonging. While the setting doesn’t overtly constrain physical options, it deeply colors perception and meaning and is inseparable from the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The iridescent geode cave, crystal vines, turquoise and obsidian light, and stalactite water are vividly rendered and strongly filter through Kael’s sensibility. Setting details are specific and coherent, creating a lush, tactile atmosphere that supports the story’s mood and concept. The environment lightly shapes action (tools at hand, surfaces for projection) but rarely constrains choices in a way that raises stakes. As a result, the setting is memorably textured but not yet fully weaponized against the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade is vivid and specific—the checkered floor, dormant machines, glow-stick, and mural all feel coherently of one place. Environment and objects aren’t just backdrop: the tide’s advance and the building’s physicality literally drive the mechanism of the “show,” and the bishop and ceiling mural are charged in the final image. Sensory detail is well chosen and filtered through Kael’s analytical gaze, avoiding tourist-list description. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the sensory palette leans heavily visual and could use one or two more non-visual anchors at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight garden and star-lit atmosphere are vivid and tightly integrated with theme—the natural cycles, constellations, and plants mirror his attention to “gaps” and cosmic rhythms. The moon, stars, and garden physically and symbolically converge in the final image where he becomes the garden’s center and the stars move within him. Environmental details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the recurring celestial imagery charges the closing moment. The setting rarely constrains concrete choices, but it strongly charges meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vividly and economically realized: Pearl Bay’s pearlescent light, the prism atrium, the brackish pond, and the mist all feel sensorially specific and filtered through a glazier’s eye. Environmental elements aren’t mere backdrop; they actively charge the final image (the bay reclaiming its own, the atrium exploding into rainbows at dawn) and align with the thematic concern of transience and refraction. The pond functions as a micro-setting with a clear ritual significance that shapes his method of knowing. A tighter link between the changing bay conditions and concrete future consequences could push the setting into even more constraining territory.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridge under a gibbous moon, the silvered pines, and the Perseids create a striking, mood-true environment. The fire scene’s sensory detail (floor giving way, house “screaming as it died”) and the porcelain box as a recurring object give the setting textural specificity and emotional charge. The box in particular functions as a micro-setting that constrains a life-or-death choice and then charges the final image. The ridge itself is more atmospheric than constraining, but it still meaningfully frames the ritual and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto, tide, and tidal pool of timelines are vividly and specifically rendered; details like “thin film of salt and phosphorescence” and “tide-polished grotto” feel lived-in and particular. Environment is not just backdrop: the returning sea is the explicit catalyst that activates the pattern, and the location is where timelines converge, so setting literally constrains the method. The recurrence of shells, sand, light, and water charges the final image of the spent, scattered decorations and stable gauge. This integration of micro-setting with mechanism and mood is unusually strong, even if the broader world remains offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The estate, ivy-veiled passage, damp flagstones, and humming walls create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is tightly bound to Elara’s perceptions. The environment is not mere backdrop: the fireplace, the ruined study, and the acoustics actively charge the discovery and the final mapping image. The physical setting and the “walls’ dream” concept are strongly fused, especially in the closing return to the ivy-veiled passage. A slight reason for not going higher is that the setting rarely constrains her options; it primarily charges meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The echoing terrace, wet stone, prism parapet, and post-rain air are vividly rendered and integrated into the magic’s mechanics. The environment constrains the moment—spring shower, fading light, and bell timing are all required for the act—and the bells themselves puncture the spell at closure. Specific locations in the city (bathroom mirror, bakery window, TV screen) further ground the abstraction. Setting is not mere backdrop; it shapes what’s possible in a way that feels organic and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terrace, its age-cracked marble, overgrown balustrades, jasmine, and the dual moons are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s purpose. Crucially, setting constrains and charges action: the moss and marble dust become the sigil medium, and the once-in-a-century conjunction creates a ritual deadline and powers the final image. Details rarely feel like cataloguing; they echo the themes of decay and endurance. This integration of environment into both tactic and closure is strong enough for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat, dead ocean, geothermal vent, and manufactured weather create a vivid, specific world where environment and tools (rig, brine basin, vent) directly frame and constrain the ritual. Sensory detail—heat as a “physical weight,” hissing tires, dissolving shell—feels precise and lived-in rather than touristic. The setting mirrors and deepens theme without feeling like blunt symbol, especially in the final image of thunder/rain as his “creation and his curse.” The environment unmistakably charges the last image and could not be swapped without gutting the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The silver courtyard, falling snow, and prism sanctuary are vivid, coherent, and tightly married to tone and mood. Details like “salvaged starlight and frozen tears” filter the setting through Elara’s sensibility rather than reading as generic fantasy dressing. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics, but it does charge the final image of solitary rebellion under snowfall. Overall, the sense of place is strong and atmospherically rich.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    The decommissioned radar dome and “meteor hush” create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that supports the themes of fallout and ethical aftershock. Environmental details—polished concrete, trunk of marionettes, viewport with emerging stars—are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does meaningfully color his choices and the final image. The micro-setting of the story stick-as-tool also works well as a recurring, charged object.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating grotto above the clouds, the moss, mist, and “cradle of impossible green” are vivid, specific, and sustained without lapsing into tourist cataloguing. Setting and atmosphere are tightly interwoven with theme—transience, sanctuary, and estrangement from the ruined world below—and the environment feels lived-in through his tactile work with vines and stones. The grotto does not strongly constrain tactical choices (it’s more a charged altar than an obstacle field), which keeps this just short of the very top band. Still, the final image of the dissolving structures in that space is memorably grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound dome, glacial walls, and aurora as timepiece create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that infuses nearly every paragraph. Details like the phosphorescent sea-kelp rope and “gentle, pearlescent radiance that cast no shadows” feel particular and integrated with the action. The aurora’s crescendo echoing the rope’s awakening nicely binds setting to climax. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain his tactical choices, but it strongly charges tone and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bunker and rewilded forest are vividly rendered and feel lived-in, with details like the vine-draped concrete, the ironwood trees, and water pooling around his ankles. Environment directly pressures choice: the approaching storm and collapsing bunker create a hard clock and foreclose the option of indefinite guardianship. The recurring console/cylinder/seal micro-setting is tightly integrated into action and theme, especially in the final image of the forest’s reclamation. A touch more sensory range from the body under stress (cold, fatigue, pain) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the Babylonian palace as tomb, the ziggurat observatory, obsidian dust, and specific constellations all feel filtered through an astronomer-priest’s eye. Environment and objects directly charge the final image—the ziggurat as his dominion, the emptied palace below, the re-pouched tile, and the star-cloud as private treasure contrasting with plundered gold. The story uses atmosphere as more than backdrop, though physical constraints of space and architecture don’t significantly alter tactics beyond providing solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “soundless sanctuary” and the writhing reality outside are vivid, coherent, and tightly integrated with action (no sound, so persuasion must be non-verbal; the first sound at the end is charged). The music box and the broken pin function as micro-setting/objects that anchor the otherwise cosmic abstraction. World rules (silence, shifting reality, conceptual wounds) remain internally consistent and are revealed through what Elara can and cannot do. Setting effectively charges the final image of the universe humming with healed music.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptionally strong: the fogged, ruined orchard, the twilight frost, and the stump form a coherent, vivid stage that shapes the ritual and its possibilities. Environmental and tool details (frost, black mirror, broken sextant) directly affect what can happen and charge the final image of the crumbling glass mountains. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with cold, stillness, and visual muting mirroring the thematic erasure of boundaries without feeling like mere backdrop. At this length, the world feels lived-in and tonally unified, though the orchard’s physical constraints could marginally pressure her choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral-orchard setting is vivid and specific, from apple blossoms in the vaulted rafters to the Heartwood crystal as living architecture, and it’s consistently filtered through Elian’s professional gaze. Environment and objects materially shape options (he must work in the rafters; the apple seed is thematically and physically native to this place). The orchard-cathedral fusion also underwrites the old/new, sacred/organic thematic tension without feeling like mere backdrop. This is very close to top-tier, though a touch more interaction with physical constraint (peril, awkwardness of position) could add further pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astral orchard, phantom suns, ghost-silver branches, and the sterile bathroom are vivid, specific, and filtered well through Kaelen’s perception. Setting and recurring objects (orchard, asteroid, sink, cameo) clearly charge the tone and final image, and the bathroom-as-sanctuary functions as an effective micro-setting. The environment’s rules (nonlinear inheritance, fruit/seed simultaneity) are consistently implied and drive the conceptual stakes. There’s still some room for the setting to more actively constrain options or behavior, but it already operates at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Scriptorium-as-mountain-bookstore and the “unheard symphony” of rustling vellum and botanical cryptology are vividly and economically realized, strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting rules (silence zones, living rock, Curators as ink-mind entities) feel coherent and are learned through action, not exposition. The environment constrains choices—the silent wall, root-staircase, and flora as map are literal gateways—and charges the final image of her descent. A small limitation is that sensory range leans heavily visual and conceptual when a bit more tactile/sonic specificity at the climactic wall could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned carnival ship in the foggy bay is evocative and specific, with strong sensory detail (“salt and rust,” “silent skeletal rides”) that matches the liminal psychological stakes. The setting evolves as she moves—from warped deck to midway to bridge—mirroring her descent/ascent into deeper memory work. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it shapes tone and symbolism more than concrete tactics. Even so, the ship as a ghostly, derelict carnival is memorable and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The clock tower mechanism room and archival spaces are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action—the gears, governor, and tower-as-needle metaphor all matter to how Elias acts. The setting is filtered through his professional eye, with specific details (“great escapement wheel,” “climate-controlled drawer,” “seventeenth-century blueprints”) that feel both lived-in and necessary. The environment directly constrains and enables the solution (weaving the rope into the clock’s governor), and the final image of the transformed room and new reading room is strongly charged by place. This is a standout strength and feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly evoked and tightly integrated: the harmonic caves, Chamber of First Frost, and the hum’s physical pressure all shape tactics and atmosphere. Details like “clear as forgotten air” ice and salt-veined rock are specific and filtered through Kaelen’s vocation. Environmental conditions (cold, hum, resonance) constrain his options and directly enable the solution via crack patterns and the echo stone. The closing quiet reweights the entire environment, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass humming pavilion, Spire, fractured plains, and star-filled sky are vivid and specific, with details filtered through Elian’s custodial and astronomical priorities. The pavilion’s dome literally constrains and enables the tactic (funneling starlight at a precise alignment), so setting is functionally tied to the plot. Recurring objects—the prism and shard—are spatially anchored and charge the final image of the lavender beam. Atmosphere (bruised twilight, ghost towns) coheres with the post-collapse quiet and the story’s fragile-hope tone.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory above the cloud-fog, the stormlight, and the crystal forecourt are vivid and purposeful rather than decorative: lightning literally enables the method and the crystals embody collective memory. Sensory detail is rich but mostly well-targeted (ozone, wet ground, pulsing crystals) and filtered through Kael’s archivist mindset. The setting directly constrains tactics (waiting on lightning for shadows) and charges the final image (crystals dimming into peaceful hush). World rules around the solid fog and mnemonic crystals read consistent within this piece.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming fortress is vividly realized through selective, sensuous detail—stone, moss, moon-petal vines, blood-blossom moss—and these are not mere decoration: the wall’s living mosaic literally encodes the schematic he deciphers. Environmental texture tracks his professional eye, and the hush/starless night charge the mood and final image (“canvas, dark and quiet”). Setting operates as both stage and mechanism, shaping his tactics rather than functioning as a backdrop only.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto, its damp stone, encrusted shells, and the glimpse of ancient starlight are vividly rendered and tightly braided to the themes of liminality and time. Details like the tiny snail’s “pilgrimage” and the tidal-pool imagery feel filtered through Elara’s sensibility rather than touristic description. While the environment does not strongly constrain physical choices, it deeply charges the emotional and thematic field, especially as a threshold setting for the relationship’s shift.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful, from the “prototype gilded hush” of the bunker to the “xenial trellis” that feels like standing on solid light, and these spaces clearly mirror and pressure his inner state. The inversion of gravity, the cloud sea, and the humming lattice are not mere ornament; they govern what he can do and where he can breathe. The recurring objects and spaces (bunker, sky, trellis, doll) are all charged and reappear meaningfully in the final image. A slight lack of concrete temporal/world grounding (how common, how known this phenomenon is) keeps it just shy of fully immersive worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    The drift between prism terraces, the Aether, and the amethyst/rose-quartz dock are vividly rendered and strongly tied to tone, with details like “light striking the prism edges” integrating setting into the soundscape. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action and demonstration rather than exposition. The environment mostly shapes atmosphere rather than constraining concrete choices, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly imagined—kaleidoscopic waterfall, crystalline trees, metallophytes, the Palimpsest Pillar—and these aren’t just postcards; they directly host and enable the key actions (veil as gate, orchard as power source, pillar as interface). Detail selection generally tracks Elara’s priorities as a lore-trained protagonist, giving the world a lived-in, professional filter. At times the density of coined or elevated descriptors edges toward luxuriant for the urgency of the scene, but clarity never fully suffers and the environment clearly charges the final staircase image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen ruin under starlight and Liam’s shuttered room are rendered with precise, selective sensory detail that strongly shape tone (“ashen charcoal sanctuary,” “stale air of his room”). The doorknocker ring, scar, ash, and stars all function as micro-setting elements that charge the ritual and final image, not mere decoration. The environment, especially the burned house, conceptually constrains choice—it makes literal that the old home/connection is gone and the only path is this occult, painful link. This integration of setting with emotional and thematic stakes pushes the atmosphere toward publishable caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom cavern and the conceptual-leak world are vivid and specific, with strong sensory touches (“damp earth and ozone,” “fungal spires”) that feel filtered through Elara’s experience. The recurring bolt functions as a micro-setting object that literally constrains her options and charges the final act, and the Promise’s crystalline geometry is memorably staged. World rules around Manifestations and physicalized concepts are consistent and conveyed through action rather than dump. The farm environment itself, aside from atmospheric and thematic mirroring, rarely constrains concrete choices beyond “deep shafts,” keeping it just under the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sepia reading room, arched windows, and golden shadows are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a distinct, coherent atmosphere. Crucially, setting is not merely decorative: the room has been engineered as a resonant chamber, the moon globe pedestal houses the aperture, and the environment is literally the machine for revelation. The recurring room details (decaying paper, polished mahogany, shifting light) charge the final transition into “deep, unambiguous dark,” reweighting the emotional state. This integration of environment, tools, and final image justifies a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse under endless night is richly evoked and specific, with details like liquid moonlight, nebulae fruit, and chiming saplings creating a coherent, tactile world. Crucially, setting elements constrain and enable choice: the clasp channels orchard energy, the obsidian dais is the operational heart, and the strained glass and thinning air escalate urgency. The final image—transformed trees, scented air, the open clasp—feels inseparable from this exact environment. Description is dense but filtered through function; it rarely feels like a static tour.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The file room is rendered with precise, lived-in detail (“decaying paper and binder’s glue,” “towering shelves”), and those specifics are filtered through an archivist’s bias. Environment and small objects actively shape events: the dust pattern enables discovery; the fragile paper constrains her actions; the room’s stillness amplifies the emotional stakes. The recurring object (button) is effectively a micro-setting at the end, charging the final image. This is publish-ready scene work, only held shy of the very top by the absence of a stronger environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally strong: permacrete towers, rain-slick streets, and the toxic marsh edge lands are rendered with sensory specificity and consistent world-rules. Environment and objects (puddle reflections, drones, marsh, auric lagoon, phone booth, key) actively guide tactics and enable the climax, not just decorate it. The auric lagoon and bioluminescent water literally become the broadcast medium, charging the final image and marrying place to theme. A slight over-reliance on visual imagery aside, the setting feels lived-in, coherent, and integral to the story’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto, fungi, mist, and prism atrium are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action: acoustics, luminescence, and the crystal’s sympathetic vibration are all instrumental to how Elias counters the prophecy. The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant; the dancing rainbows and shifting light visualize the conflict and its resolution. The final dewdrop image at the entrance recharges the opening, tying physical environment to thematic and emotional closure. This is elite-level atmospheric work, just shy of utterly transformative because the setting shapes tactics beautifully but doesn’t quite force a visible trade-off beyond mood and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and specific, with details like brittle silver leaves, clay bowls, mica flakes, and glowing moss creating a coherent, textural world. Setting is filtered through Elian’s work and attention rather than as a generic backdrop, and the arbor’s physical state (ashen vs. viridian) directly charges the final image. The environment doesn’t much constrain tactical options in-scene, but it does deeply inform stakes and the emotional weight of the revival. Overall, atmosphere and world-building are a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the decaying Blackwood estate, rusted greenhouse, and subterranean waterfall are vividly rendered with specific, texturally coherent detail. Environment matters functionally—the etched wall and foundation mechanism literally gate access—and conceptually, with the waterfall/mist forming a “celestial clock” that charges the final image. Sensory balance (sound of rushing water, cool air, glittering rock, mist-borne constellations) is excellent and POV-filtered through a mechanic of time. The only limiting factor is that physical constraint isn’t pushed quite as hard as the atmospheric and thematic work, or this could edge into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-washed foundry, furnace, slag pedestal, and reagents are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action, giving the scene strong atmosphere. The coin and furnace recur as functional anchors, and the environmental contrast between cold rain and roaring fire nicely mirrors the emotional arc. Still, the setting rarely constrains options in a way that feels unique to “foundry” rather than any alchemical workspace. Its primary role is tonal and imagistic, which it fulfills very well but without decisive constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Echo Gorge, the river of mist, and the warped acoustics create a strong, tactile atmosphere that’s tightly tied to the premise of sound-shaped grief. The environment isn’t just decorative; the altered acoustics and the gorge’s echoing nature define how Silas tracks the spirit and how her pain manifests. The setting’s sensory palette (mist, stone, sound) is consistent and filtered through his professional familiarity, giving it lived-in specificity. The final return to “the natural sounds of Echo Gorge” nicely reweights the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is sensorially rich—violet light as “weight,” moss like “crushed velvet,” bone-white tree, and the tooth-aching hum all create a distinct, oppressive atmosphere. Details are filtered through Kaelen’s altered body-awareness, which tightens POV and prevents a tourist-catalog feel. The environment meaningfully charges the story’s premise by functioning as both exile and experimental chamber, especially once the tree is identified as the focal point. That said, the setting exerts more symbolic than practical constraint on his options; it shapes meaning more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s market, the tent, the smell of linseed and ozone, and the seascape of the childhood lighthouse all feel vivid and deliberately chosen, with good sensory texture. The lens and painting function as micro-settings that constrain action: the only path to the truth is through this specific canvas in this specific place. World rules (market between grounded and ethereal, paintings as doors) are internally consistent and taught through action rather than exposition. The environment mostly supports atmosphere and theme rather than concrete tactical limits, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered—peeling paint, phantom popcorn, cracked clowns—and always filtered through Leo’s sensibility and profession. Setting is not mere backdrop: the ceiling structure, drop tiles, and ladder materially shape the tactic he uses to answer the ghost. The circus context also underwrites the horologist’s commission and the thematic “cracks in the façade.” It superbly charges the mood and choices, though it stops just short of feeling absolutely irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass orchard library, cloud sea, and frost-covered pane are vividly rendered and strongly integrated into action: the external cold enables the ice patterns, and the rupture literally changes the environment. The setting evolves with the plot, from pristine, enclosed perfection to an open archway onto chaotic, knowledge-gilded clouds. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the final image of new milky-glass trees and pulsing buds is charged by what we’ve seen destroyed. A slight constraint on top marks is the relative lack of tactile navigation or bodily interaction with the space beyond the ritual apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, particular, and thematically loaded: “Asteroid Adagio,” baroque excess, visible time squalls, and the ritual of covering mirrors all feel organic and legible. Environmental rules (temporal storms, reflective surfaces, Oblivion Pits) are dramatized rather than dumped and meaningfully shape behavior (the mirror-covering and shard exposure). The shard as micro-setting/object anchors the final image and charges the theme. A slight cap comes from the fact that, beyond the mirror rule, the physical environment doesn’t constrain on-page choices as much as it colors them.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The workshop and resonance chamber are vivid, precise, and integrated with action—acoustic wood, spun copper, and the giant clockwork spire all matter to what Elias is doing. The chip, housing, wires, and plates function as micro-setting, constraining his choices (delicate tuning under pressure) rather than serving as mere backdrop. Atmosphere—the grey sky, metallic tang of rust, returning scent of damp earth—is strongly tied to the stakes and to the final image. This is just shy of top-tier because the environment doesn’t present concrete obstacles so much as host the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the factory, rust-colored creek, limestone maze, and glowing lagoon are rendered with precise, sense-biased detail filtered through Elara’s nose and vocation. Environment actively shapes events (factory closure and dried creek expose the fissure; rock magnetism scrambles the compass; the hinged stone and vast lagoon govern access and choice). The recurring details of stone, water, and scent culminate in the charged final image of the compass at rest beside the lagoon. This integration of atmosphere, geography, and object is strong enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archway, storm, sea, and driftwood are vividly rendered and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a sculptor and coastal dweller. Environment is not decorative: the archway’s geometry, the storm’s force, and the availability of timbers and stones directly constrain her tactics and enable the covenant’s mechanism. The final image of scattered driftwood as “letters in a language” charges setting details with thematic weight. This is near top-tier scene-setting for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings—the amber pavilion, the decaying quarter, the cathedral, the rose window—are vivid, textured, and tightly filtered through an artist’s eye. The cathedral and its glass are not mere backdrop: they are the physical mechanism of discovery and directly charge the final image of future murals. Seasonal and atmospheric details (autumn light, melting snow, “bruised sky”) reinforce the liminal, transitional mood that underpins the theme. A slight bias toward visual description over other senses is the only real limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Both the Aethelgard and the obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with precise, sensorial detail that feels filtered through Kaelen’s perspective. The lagoon in particular operates as a charged psychic micro-setting whose geography (shore, debris, black rock cup of water) constrains his tactics and defines the ritual of communication. The final revelation that a diary symbol is a coordinate to this very place ties setting directly into the story’s closing turn. A slight deepening of how the zeppelin’s physical constraints affect his options could nudge this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly realized and integral: the paper-lantern cove, salt air, and ruined festival infrastructure all mirror loss while also literally housing the nascent “citizens.” The amber bottle and lanterns function as charged objects that constrain action and power the final image. Details are selective and filtered through Kaelen’s priorities, avoiding tourist-catalog description while sustaining a strong mood. The environment meaningfully charges the ending, where the thousand dark lanterns become a concrete field of future souls and labor.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral, from the “ancient orchard garden atop the Spire” to the city below and the remembered Maritime Museum, all filtered through Elian’s sensibility. The foghorn as a “sonic bulwark” and the Spire’s filtered air both become world-rules that directly bear on the threat and its containment. The closing image—apple blossoms turned “cloying and funereal” as he surveys the silent city—recharges earlier environmental details with new weight. While the orchard doesn’t materially constrain his choices, the environment consistently shapes tone, rules, and the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound atrium and crystalline frost dome are richly specific and provide a strong, coherent atmosphere that fuses with the metaphysics (“held the starlight captive,” memory shards dissolving on the walls). The recurring acorn cap and ice panes clearly charge the final image, where the atrium’s walls reflect an orderly cosmos. Setting is tightly filtered through Elara’s perception as a keeper of seeds and patterns, supporting theme and tone. It is more of a charged stage than a tactical constraint, but its integration is strong enough to approach high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The wind-scoured sanctuary above a sea of clouds is vividly rendered, and key environmental elements—the siren array, capacitors, stone, and clouds—participate in the climax. Setting and tool merge effectively when the mountain itself “sings” and the clouds part in response to his tuning. While the physical constraints of the space could be pressed slightly harder to shape tactics, the selective, atmospheric detail strongly supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The celestial tracking station and “forgotten nebula” are vividly and economically rendered, with strong atmospheric specificity. The antique yellow glass and cosmic dust function as charged micro-setting elements that return meaningfully in the final repricing (“dust was simply the memory of light”). The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options but strongly shapes perception and tone in a way that supports the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scorched wasteland with desiccated hives and brittle lavender is vivid and thematically fused with loss and sterility. The beekeeping oasis, sundial, and stained glass box are specific, recurring anchors that charge the final image and help embody the covenant. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics, but it does deeply shape what matters and what release looks like (phantom spring vs. wasteland). Sensory detail is rich and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald silo, the altered relationship to numbers, and the post-Collapse landscape are vivid and economical, with details like “longitude was just a word for longing” doing double duty as worldbuilding and theme. Setting is tightly integrated: the silo’s physical properties become crucial when the urn fragment is pressed into the “slightly different” wall, and the garage sale at its base is tactically important. The environment’s green light and humming presence charge the final image of a “library of lost feelings” in the walls. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual and conceptual would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lagoon after rain, the sea grapes, the cobalt water, and the bruised-purple clouds create a vivid, tactile environment that’s consistently filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility. Setting and weather are thematically tuned—wet earth, burnished hush, and the parting clouds mirror the movement from loss to quiet recomposition. The feather and kite as objects-in-setting strongly charge the central images and the final pocketing gesture. The physical environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain options, but it deeply saturates tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid, atmospheric, and indispensable to the premise: carbon vs. silicon life, botanical diagrams, and the architectural secret all hinge on this environment. Details like “cool and still” air, moss-covered limbs, and the copper web glistening as “metallic dew” are selective and purposeful, not decorative. The setting directly shapes tactics (pillars as living conductors, the hidden fissure, the orchard network) and charges the final image of a unified organism. World rules (silicon life, conductive fissure) are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting work is vivid and selective: damp earth, blooming dogwood, bronze quiet, overgrown sculptures, rainwashed tower. Details are filtered through Aris’s skeptical but receptive gaze, and the environment’s mood (rain, quiet, footprints) meaningfully charges his choices and the final image. The recurring object-as-setting (fly amber) and the footprints pattern both constrain and shape the ending. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is that the environment pressures him mostly emotionally rather than through hard physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and thematically active: the dead reef, chemiluminescent blossoms, and “corpse of the sea” all filter through his grief-suffused perspective. Environment constrains choice (cracks, fissures, pockets of silt) and literally dictates tactics via the jetty’s geology and the reef’s absence. The final image of dark soil patches along the stone finger meaningfully reweights the initial desolation. A slight tendency toward lushness over tactility in places keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful, from the red-dusted scrapyard to the cracked flats to the geothermal cavern lit by phosphorescent fungi. Environmental conditions (wasteland desolation, geothermal warmth, hidden hinges in rock) directly constrain and enable action, culminating in the secret garden that charges the final image. Details are selective and filtered through Elara’s priorities rather than touristic. The recurring small objects (cylinder, leaf) function as micro-settings that meaningfully shape choices and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is evocative and purposeful: the observation deck, accretion disk, pulsar, and black vortex are all filtered through her altered perception, reinforcing both mood and concept. Objects (jacket, sketchbook, compass rose) are embedded as part of the environment rather than decorative props and recur meaningfully. The one limitation is that the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it mostly serves as a charged backdrop rather than an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the viridian nebula, obsidian sliver of a moon, and the Crysolith Spire all create a strong atmospheric frame that is distinct to this world. Environment and objects meaningfully shape action—the climb on glacial ice, the observatory’s prism, and the nebula light focused via the sundial lid are directly tied to Kael’s tactics. The sterile interior versus chaotic sky nicely externalizes the control/chaos tension without being over-explicit. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and recurring objects (spire, chessboard, sundial, seed) charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Great Dome/whispering gallery, barred window, and obsidian pawnless chessboard are vivid and purposeful, not decorative. Acoustics matter to the lie and to Elara’s tactic of embodied grief; the high window and key/door materially define what’s possible. The chessboard and missing pawns recur at the end to charge the Regent’s choice and the theme of absent masses. A bit more sensory texture beyond the visual/aural might elevate it further, but what’s here is economical and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain-bookstore and its aviary are vivid and specific—labyrinthine corridors, skylight dust, sleeping owls—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the mountain-as-entity, the aviary’s feather, and the bookstore’s physical sprawl all constrain options and enable the method she uses. The final image of herbs in chipped teacups and cleared pathways meaningfully uses place to embody her new stance toward home. A slightly stronger sense of material constraint (how the mountain resists or shapes her more directly) could push this into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The time-frozen village, the woven hush, and the ever-lurking thunder are vividly rendered and consistently shape mood and meaning. Setting is not mere wallpaper: the stasis gives Elias the timelessness he thinks he needs, and the eventual rain physically enacts his internal release. Environmental specifics—the milkmaid, the blacksmith, the alderman’s hall—anchor the magic in concrete social life. The platinum labyrinth functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his thinking and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bone towers, pale spire, and canyon of endless echoes are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics—the environment is not backdrop but the literal tool that allows Elara to refract truth. Specifics like the “forged hush” and the horn on the Ossuary spire both set tone and drive plot. The echo behavior at the end (splitting into fragments around her final poem) directly charges the final image and redefines the world’s central constraint. A slight reason to hold below 9.0 is that tactile, non-auditory sensory detail is somewhat thinner than the aural/visual richness.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The acid sea, groaning gears, bathysphere, and leviathan create a vivid, oppressive environment that is both original and tightly integrated into the pressure. The setting directly constrains options (she is literally sealed into a pressure sphere with one breath) and charges the final image when the statue’s light pushes back the “crushing green darkness.” Details are filtered through Elara’s priorities as an alchemist and survivor rather than as a tourist. World rules (acid sea, miasma, floating cities) are sketched economically yet consistently, serving the ritual rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the cave mouth, narrowing tunnel, and sunlit underground pool are vivid and sensorially grounded. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a painter, giving the physical world a subjective, tonal charge. The environment meaningfully shapes the story—the wrong turn through the cave network is the vehicle to the oasis, and the pool plus light shaft directly charge the final image of the shell resting among stones. A slight bias toward visual description over other senses keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, sea, fog, and predawn light are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elias’s perceptions, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. The lens and the vial cork function as micro-setting elements that directly constrain tactics and shape the magic’s mechanism. Weather and time of day support the tone without feeling generic, and spatial orientation (lantern room above, tide below, ship in fog) is consistently clear. The environment charges the final image (sun over the cleared sea) in a way that reweights the preceding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The starlit signal station, rooftop gantry, and wasteland horizon are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s melancholic, quasi-mystical perception. The censer foot functions as a charged micro-setting object, anchoring both his history and the final activation image. Environmental details (wind, stars, moon) reinforce tone and premise rather than reading like postcard garnish. The setting does not sharply constrain tactics, but it does meaningfully charge the final image of a “lighthouse” broadcasting into the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ravine orchard, cliff-clinging house, and storm are vividly realized and tightly tied to his internal state (“precarious beauty constantly battered by storms”). Environment constrains and enables choices: his isolation, the need for a major storm to attune the eye, and the damage that leaves “fractured grace” in the orchard all matter. The glass eye functions as a recurring, charged object that anchors the final image. Worldbuilding around the virus and markets is efficient and believable without bogging the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, opal dock, mist, and lamp room are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Silas’s sensibility. Setting and objects (particularly the Edelweiss and the beam of the light) charge the final image rather than sitting as postcard backdrop. Weather and the lost horizon support the tone of disorientation and absence, even if they don’t tightly constrain physical choice. The environment’s main work is atmospheric and thematic, but it’s done with economy and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly drawn, from the map shop and creek to the glowing fungi and blind flowers of the midsummer cavern; sensory texture is rich and purposeful. Environmental constraints (seasonal bloom, limited-access fissure, rising water) shape when the doorway can be found and subtly charge his decisions. The recurring objects—the map, fissure, chip, and luminous flora—are integrated into both action and theme rather than feeling decorative. The only limitation is that physical peril from the creek or cavern remains backgrounded, so the environment pressures choice more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and filtered through Elara’s sensibility—from “sun bled across the horizon” and fireflies to the cobalt grotto above the cloud sea. The environment materially shapes stakes and options: the climb severs her from the court, the altitude isolates, and the grotto’s architecture creates the literal site of temptation. The bleeding starlight pool anchors atmosphere and action simultaneously, charging the final conceptual stakes. A touch more tactile engagement with the pool’s physicality at the brink could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Ember Nexus, vesper crickets, crystalline dust, and captured suns create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in and tonally consistent with the quasi-scientific magic. The nautilus shell and pocket-sun function as micro-setting objects that strongly charge the final image: the shell’s abandonment and the sun’s transformation embody the internal change. While the broader environment doesn’t much constrain tactics (the scene could theoretically happen in any suitably magical lab), its twilight, fading-energy ambiance meaningfully mirrors the emotional state. The integration is purposeful and economical rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain ranger cabin, birch bark scroll, and light through dust motes are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through his mental state, with the walls and knots mirroring his sense of judgment and entrapment. The environment supports tone and character but rarely constrains concrete choices beyond mood; he could have this realization in several quiet rooms. The flight sequence adds atmospheric altitude but functions more as interior metaphor than as a materially grounded landscape affecting tactics, keeping this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock repair shop and the fog create a distinct, atmospheric micro-world that feels lived-in rather than generic. Details like “liquid heartbeats” and mist-damp coat are purposeful, echoing the story’s preoccupation with time, bodies, and quiet work. The screw as a recurring object is especially strong, physically anchoring both the midwife’s legacy and Elara’s interpretive gift, and it charges the ending by becoming “a key, a conduit.” The setting is more thematic and tonal than constraining of choice, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating granite disc above an abyss, the moss-slicked stone, and the “ocean of silent, blue air” are vivid and integrated into mood and theme rather than feeling like ornament. The tea ceremony platform’s isolation and precariousness echo his internal stillness and suspended state, and the crow quill and crystalline veins function as micro-setting elements that directly interface with his actions. Weather and atmospheric detail (“between the receding thunderheads… promised gales of dusk”) support the “between storms” motif without overwhelming the scene. The environment doesn’t quite force specific tactical constraints beyond psychological tone, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sheet music archive, the decaying paper, and the orchard beyond the windows create a strong, cohesive atmosphere that mirrors the story’s themes of memory and erasure. Setting details (iron gall ink, lilac scent flooding the dusty room, diesel engine growl) are selective and purposeful, not touristic. The archive and its contents directly participate in the ritual (clips to the staves), charging the final image when it returns to mere “dusty room.” Environment and objects constrain the action and meaning rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Ancient Temple Library, the polished obsidian, and the “resounding hush” are vividly drawn and inseparable from the story’s meaning. The setting’s temporal dislocation directly shapes the warped dictionary definition and the possibility of endless, silent resolution. Environmental detail is selective, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through the Witness’s contemplative stance. The library and its hush explicitly charge the final image of the book falling soundlessly and her merging with the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, particular, and indispensable: fjord, hydraulic clocks, granite shelf, horizon-measurement station, and glacial melt all fuse with the premise. Environmental specifics (water sighing through pipes, glacial melt feeding the system) directly generate the central event (the ice shard) and charge the final realization that the clocks “drink” the horizon. Details are filtered through Elias’s professional/obsessive eye, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. The world feels both lived-in and conceptually precise, fully supporting the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cavern and bioluminescent mushroom farm are vividly rendered through smell, light, and texture, and details like the Fae Caps generating the dimensional friction are folded into the mechanics rather than feeling ornamental. The environment directly constrains and enables choices—the barrier exists because of the setting, and his device must interface with the mycelial network. Atmosphere and world rules remain consistent and charge the final image of the air “returning to its normal, hazy luminescence.” A slight expansion of how the space physically shapes his movement could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rainwashed library, subway cars as “steel veins,” forgotten station, and rail yard balcony are all vividly sketched and tied to Aris’s perceptions. The lantern and mica pane function as a charged micro-setting object that returns in the final image to frame her shift. Environment mostly serves mood and metaphor rather than constraining action, but the hidden balcony above the yard is an evocative, fitting locus for the climax. Sensory detail is selective and tone-consistent, without feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The subway utility tunnel, damp concrete, bundled cables, and late-night train rumble create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports theme and tone. The recurring physicality of the alcove, switchboard, and the Bakelite phone makes the environment feel lived-in and integral to Silas’s estrangement. Still, the setting mostly shapes mood rather than constraining tactics or choices in a concrete way, which holds this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the paper-scented archive, the ceramic dish and tea-colored solution, and especially the “blooming jetty” at twilight are all sensorially rich and filtered through Elara’s archivist sensibility. The jetty is not just a backdrop but a historical boundary whose sudden flowering and phosphorescent buds literally and symbolically charge the final image and the towns’ options. World rules are consistent within a quietly magical realism register; the bay, twin towns, and jetty form a coherent physical and social geography. Description is dense but disciplined, with details typically advancing mood and theme rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The station is vividly evoked—the ivy-choked clock, splintered trolley, rafters with pigeons, fire barrel—and the mood of abandonment versus tentative regrowth is strong. The clock and ironwork meaningfully tie into the rumor’s mechanics and the thematic “winding” of community, though they don’t sharply constrain tactical options. Environmental detail is well-filtered through Silas’s sensibility as a logistician and loner. The setting is more atmospheric than adversarial, but fully integrated at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultrasonic forest, silverleaf, ironwood, crystalline rivers, and moss dialects create a vivid, sensorially unusual setting that’s tightly filtered through a nonvisual POV. Environmental conditions (constant sonic pressure) meaningfully shape his experience and underscore the need for a Stillpoint. Tools and micro-setting (the specific trees, fossilized flower, the curtain of moss) directly channel and focus his search. The only minor limitation is that the forest rarely constrains his tactics beyond atmosphere; it feels dangerous and oppressive but never truly obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gravitational anomaly, small station, and console form a focused, atmospheric setting whose rules (time-folding) matter directly to the plot. The anomaly shifts from oppressive cage to cloister, and the pen as a recurring object is integrated into the environment and carries thematic charge in the final image. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual but remains selective and purposeful, fitting the character’s profession and mental state. A touch more tactile or auditory grounding during the editing sequence could deepen immediacy, but the current level already serves the story well.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor is vividly rendered—moonlit water, corroded pylons, unmoving crane, collapsed pier—and always filtered through Elian’s sensibility as a kind of cathedral of forgetting. Environmental specifics (especially the old ferry landing) directly shape where he goes and how the climax manifests. The physical layout is legible and supports the progression from surface quiet to the “hole in the world.” The final image of the harbor’s changed silence is strongly charged by this setting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Xylos Archive is sharply evoked—“dust-choked silence,” “petrified paper,” basalt walls—and details like the pressure plate, sarcophagus, and celestial map are integrated into action rather than feeling touristic. The setting materially constrains tactics: the fissure in the rock, the high window, and the ancient pigments and binders all factor into revelation and planned response. Environmental tone (necropolis of forgotten knowledge) mirrors the thematic concern with erasure without feeling over-explicit. A slightly broader sensory range beyond sight and smell could make key moments even more immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the white room, sterile corridors, and sensory lab with “metallic flora” all reinforce her status as a medical subject and frame the lab as an instrument for her defiance. The sound wave garden’s mechanics (emitters translating rhythm into light) are clear enough and drive the central spectacle. The auric lagoon itself is a strongly rendered, evolving micro-setting that mirrors and amplifies her emotional state. The environment rarely constrains her options, though—once she decides to leave, nothing in the space meaningfully pushes back.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the bruised, aurora-lit sky, frozen cranes, and container labyrinth all feel textured and lived-in. The environment materially shapes choices (no grid, no compass, vertical maze) and the port’s geometry governs his navigation. The storm’s light and the stacked containers also charge the final image of Silas emerging with quiet authority. This is a strong example of atmosphere doing real narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, purposeful, and tightly integrated: the cobalt dock, gas lamp, canal depths, and lock-keeper’s cottage all directly shape Kaelen’s tactics and the final promise-image. The dock-as-mirror logic underpins the entire method of reaching the darkness. Environment and small tools function as a micro-setting that genuinely charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and thematically tuned: the “cobalt library,” mist, and magnetic grotto all echo the mood of dense, charged quiet. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility—the way he experiences the town as a “chord” of thought makes the environment feel lived-in, not touristic. The grotto and the lit windows recur to charge the final image, with the warmed stone in his hand tying the physical world to the psychic shift. The environment colors his choices more than it constrains them, so it stops just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: splintered docks, salt-crusted sheds, the hidden cove with petrified roots, and the rising island all feel textured and lived-in. The environment shapes action—low tide and exposed roots are necessary for the detachment, and the final image of Kaelen ascending onto “mossy stone” is charged. The macro-world idea of a non-violent society is intriguing but underused in scene terms. Overall, sensory specificity and integration with the climax are strong, even if some worldbuilding potential remains untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the farmhouse kitchen as “an island in a sea of noise” and the turbines’ *whump-whump-whump* create a physical analogue for oppressive, state-imposed cheer. Objects—the mug, kettle, knife, pine block, bouquet, and carved bird—are tightly integrated into action and the final image. The turbines and mandated world rules remain mostly atmospheric rather than constraining concrete choices in the moment, which keeps this from the very top band. Still, the environment and objects clearly charge the closing tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are vividly realized, with strong visual and tactile specificity and a consistent, hushed atmosphere. Details are clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility as a poet, so the environment doubles as an externalization of his inner state. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, it does charge the experience and the final image (the lake as a “blank page”) in a thematically resonant way. World rules around the place and its ban feel coherent, if lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ash-and-smoke post-phoenix world, the glassblower’s courtyard, and the furnace are all vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elian’s grayscale perception. Setting is not just backdrop: the kiln enables Vex’s glasswork, the courtyard is the ritual space, and the moonflower and plants center the climax. The final image of the moonflower unfurling under stars, paired with glass and breath, feels organically rooted in earlier description. A slightly deeper sense of the larger world’s rules could push this even higher, but at this length the focus is well judged.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: ozone, dust, power-grid hum, golden shafts of light, and the crystal carillon all feel specific and tonally aligned with the story’s aims. Tools and environment (laboratory apparatus, lens, sonic emitter, bells) directly shape what Elian can attempt and how the resolution works, not just how it looks. The recurring “golden” light and shadows evolve meaningfully from atmosphere to thematic charge at the end. World rules about sound/light behavior are consistent within the speculative frame and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory is vivid and thematically tuned, from the “infinitely layered curtains of intention” to the polished obsidian and lesser-used telescope, and it feels like a lived-in, specialized space rather than a generic star room. World rules about the artificial cosmos and intention-activated ceiling are consistent and contour what’s possible, especially in how curiosity and will are literally required to open the sky. The jewelry bench and forge as micro-settings nicely echo his inner life and charge the final image of the “small, but warm” fire. The only minor limit is that environmental constraints don’t force difficult tactical choices as much as they could; they mostly support mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft with its rain-beaded skylight, exposed brick, and oak table is vividly drawn and supports the contemplative, post-crash mood. The measuring tape functions as a micro-setting object that accrues weight, moving from tool to heirloom to charged final image. Weather and environment mostly serve tone rather than constraining action, but they do so with specificity and consistency. Overall, setting is economical, atmospheric, and integrated with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archive and pagoda are rendered with strong, selective detail—the fissure light, ozone, “forgotten perfumes,” and projected histories all create a tangible, charged atmosphere. Setting meaningfully shapes the action: this is a sealed tomb of a lost civilization with warnings that frame the risk and isolation of her act. The bronze pagoda and its glow then directly charge the final image of her altered reflection. There’s little sense of the world beyond the archive, but for this length and focus the micro-setting work is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Lumina-Arbor, cloudscape, light-vines, and pearl console are vivid and integrated into the action, not mere backdrop. The archive’s physical metaphors (vines wilting, color shift to silvery blue) meaningfully mirror and embody the internal stakes. The river stone as a small, handled object anchors both setting and emotion and charges the final image. The “above the clouds” aspect is more atmospheric than functional, but the library itself does help constrain available tactics to archival manipulation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog, herbs, terrariums, magnifier, and misty starlight create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is tightly bound to Elias’s inner state. The workshop feels tactile and lived-in (velvet cloth, filament-thin wire, damp earth), and the thinning mist/stars at the end elegantly mirror his renewed hope. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges both the opening and final images. The specificity and integration with theme and mood are at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular: the quiet tower, the thick ivy pulse, the frosted hourglass, the yellowed city map, and the “meteor hush” all feel lived-in and tonally coherent. Environment is not decorative; the ivy literally participates in the central event, and the tower-at-dawn isolation charges the final image of a “lonely archivist.” Objects like the hourglass and map integrate theme (time you can feel but not see; scars as cartography). The only limit on pushing this higher is that physical constraints of the tower itself don’t actively shape tactics beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Orpheum Grand and its projection booth are vividly rendered with purposeful detail—dust that “tasted of rust and regret,” plush red velvet, the gilded proscenium, the klieg light—always filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the revelation that the building’s materials literally absorb unused love makes the setting the answer to the central question. The final understanding that love becomes “the soul of a place” directly charges the theater and the air she breathes, satisfying the 9-band gate of setting shaping the closure image. It stops just short of truly extraordinary only because the environment never constrains a concrete on-page choice, functioning more as conceptual vessel than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The aurora-lit basalt arch, celestial pole, and custom brass instrument create a vivid, specific environment that strongly supports mood and theme. Details are filtered through Elara’s attention to light and sound, anchoring us firmly on the high peak relative to the valley. The setting charges the final image indirectly by contrasting the cosmic backdrop with the stone and charcoal at her feet, though it rarely constrains physical options. World rules (psychic hearing, star-tracing) are consistent and conveyed through concrete interaction rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: glowing dunes “in bloom,” ghost-pale flora, the starless sky, and the crystalline pine construct all create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental rules (post-forest world, divergent archive riding in a skiff) are learned through action rather than exposition, and the dune’s fabric being torn by the memory makes the place matter to the conflict. The recurring objects-as-setting—the skiff, the chess clock, the dunes, the final hybrid structure—charge the last image effectively. This is high-level atmospheric work that meaningfully shapes and reweights the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly imagined and sensorially rich—crystalline branches chiming, brass canopies, oil rivers, clockwork fauna—without reading like a static tour. Crucially, environmental features constrain and enable his navigation (wind tones as a map), making setting integral to action and not mere backdrop. The quartz tree at the nexus operates as a charged locus where external atmosphere and internal realization fuse. This strong integration of environment with drive and closure justifies a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly evoked—twilight as “purple ink,” misty ridgeway, sea-kelp ticket, lantern like a firefly—and consistently filtered through the liminal, sea-touched lexicon. Environment and objects (mist, ridgeway, kelp ticket, lantern) mirror Elara’s internal crossing and charge the final image of her walking into clearing mist. However, the world is more symbolic than tactical; the terrain does not materially constrain behavior beyond mood and direction. Still, for a lyric short, the atmosphere is immersive and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, marble, and dusty spiral staircase are vividly rendered and always filtered through Elias’s needs and fears. The fortress as a cocoon of safety versus the dangerous “world that had become too loud, too sharp” materially constrains his options. The staircase is a “secret cathedral” that both shelters and accuses him, and the weather and armored glass reinforce the theme of isolation. The final image of snow outside versus thaw inside his chest is thematically and atmospherically precise.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Athenaeum of Lost Moments is vividly and specifically rendered (petrified wood floors, vellum scrolls, the star-chart lectern, dome of captured starlight) and its rules meaningfully constrain action: the library’s latent power and architecture are the very mechanism of the spell. The environment is not a backdrop; it channels the cryptic annotations and focuses them through the nexus and map, then literally vanishes once its purpose is fulfilled. The final image of the library and titan dissolving, leaving only “corrected flow of history,” is charged by everything we’ve learned about the place. This is high-level setting work, just shy of truly mind-blowing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The station, dead reef, and briefly resurrected coralscape are vividly drawn and strongly atmospheric, especially the "bleached white bones" versus "impossible color" contrast. Details like the console, alarm, and viewport are cleanly integrated into action rather than pasted on. The environment shapes his isolation and gives him the tools (monitoring systems) to recognize the prerequisite moment, but it doesn’t quite become an active constraint in his choices. Still, the closing image is inseparable from this particular vantage on the reef.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay, ferrocrete, obsidian circle, and shattered dome form a vivid, coherent environment that’s consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the burial of ancient stones beneath a failed high-tech hub, the bay’s acoustics, and distant consoles flickering awake all actively shape the method and imagery of the climax. The recurring sky/dome motif culminating in the satellite seen through the opera glasses charges the final image with both physical and thematic resonance. A slightly greater sense of physical constraint or hazard in the environment would be needed to push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The geothermal pool and extremophile ecology are vividly realized and integral: the exact vent chemistry, plant enzymes, and thermal currents literally determine where and how the ritual can occur. Sensory detail (sulfurous steam, wet earth, heat) is purposeful, never mere postcard description. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image of the embryo absorbing the dissolved amber in that specific water. World rules around the reconstruction era and fallout-altered biology are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    The arboretum on a sea cliff, the muted surf, the automated lighthouse, and the Wollemi pine are all sharply drawn and consistently filtered through Anya’s priorities. Setting is not postcard backdrop: the waves and earth become tools in her grounding, and the cliff-edge sanctuary mirrors her precarious psychological balance. The ancient tree’s survival across cataclysms charges the final image and constrains her choice to stay, water, and persist here. Environmental specificity, especially the “sound of geology, not technology,” directly shapes both her options and the thematic charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse library is richly evoked as both physical and psychological space: the stone cylinder, iron spiral, sweeping lamp, and dust all mirror his sense of constriction and descent. Setting details are not decorative; the spiral staircase directly informs his spiral arrangement on the floor, and the lamp’s beam syncs with his “luminescent ache.” The environment shapes his tactics via the available materials—charts, atlases, rope, charcoal. This is an exemplary use of micro-setting as psyche, just shy of transcendent because the world never quite constrains a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wind-carved encampment, rust-colored sandstone, and eclipse light are vividly realized and filtered through Kael’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, specific atmosphere. The shallow basin in the rock is a nice micro-setting that becomes the literal canvas for the ink. However, the environment rarely constrains options; it mostly frames mood rather than forcing tactical choices. As a result, the setting feels rich and coherent but not structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the snowbound Grand Archive, the hum of cryo-pumps, and the forgotten sub-basement terminal all feel materially specific and story-shaped. The blizzard’s insulation and the obsolete infrastructure directly enable her method of sedition. The final image of “a blank page unaware of the story about to be written violently upon it” elegantly reweights the snow motif at closure. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, with strong sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and specific—silica dunes, glass dome, tiled floor, desert roses—and consistently filtered through Elara’s priorities. The dome and encroaching desert are not mere backdrop; they embody separation from her father’s world and charge the final image of returning to the rows of flowers. Objects-as-setting (knife, sandbag scrap, wooden box) are spatially clear and integrated into choice. A touch more interaction between environment and practical constraint (e.g., dome fragility or resource scarcity) could elevate it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden and its rules are strikingly specific—crystallized frequencies, valleys of muted bass, chasms of static—and are consistently filtered through Kaelen’s task-focused perception. Setting directly shapes choices (weaving around shockwaves and chasms, tapping structures to find dead thuds) and culminates in the hollow of perfect quiet at the heart, which charges the final act. Environmental logic remains internally consistent and the weather/sky (sleepwalking constellations) actively modulate danger. A slight tendency toward descriptive density prevents it from feeling absolutely effortless, but it is nonetheless a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, the humming dome, and the star-traced sky create a vivid, tonally apt environment that mirrors the “orbits” motif without feeling like mere décor. The mahogany desk, telescope, and especially the pen nib are well-integrated into action rather than static description. The final image of Celeste at the curved glass wall with the clouds below and stars above powerfully charges the thematic closure. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it strongly shapes atmosphere and the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and thematically fused: the bruised-sky city, the meteor-hush studio, and the cold monolith of the Laboratory of Lost Sounds all feel textured and purposeful. The amber and the server casing function as micro-settings that directly shape his tactic (etching a constellation into metal) and the final memorial image. Sensory choices prioritize sight and sound in a way that suits the story’s obsession with stored and lost audio. The “time folds in on itself” line elegantly licenses the speculative strangeness without derailing plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto, mist, acoustics, and stones are richly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, building a distinctive, immersive atmosphere. The setting’s prior function (a whispering gallery) and present failure directly charge the tile and the final mandala image. Environmental details (mist, damp stone, puddle reflections) evolve with the scene and mirror the characters’ emotional drift without feeling like mere ornament. The space doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it meaningfully frames and deepens the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shattered sky, ancient plaza, ash-taste, and mosaic-as-circuit give a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integrated rather than decorative. The environment does functional work: the post-fire damage literally becomes the interface for erasure, and the scattered Retros across the plaza visually extend the stakes. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics; it is more stage and symbol than an active obstacle or resource. Still, the recurring mosaic/ruin imagery charges the final image of Kaelen looking out at “other broken figures.”

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mystic orchard garden, hedge maze, Chronos Tree, and Moon-Blossoms are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail and a strong atmospheric coherence that supports the ghostly, theatrical premise. The Chronos Tree in particular charges the final image when a dormant bud opens, tying environment to closure. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, but it does shape mood, isolate the characters, and give Julian a “stage” that feels integral rather than decorative. World rules (fractured time, impossible blossoms) are consistent and absorbed smoothly into the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    The light painting studio, darkness, camera, and LEDs are integrated into action and meaning, not just backdrop, and the environment literally enables their “language” to appear. The muscovite geode as object-setting returns in the final image, quietly charging the question of conduit vs. placebo. Sensory detail is economical but vivid (the red remote light, blue LED slashes, humming lights). The world beyond the studio is lightly sketched, but for this scale the micro-setting is doing strong work.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cave network and chamber are vividly, economically rendered—ozone, mineral tang, submerged archway, trickle of fresh water—and the environment directly shapes options, culminating in the chamber’s “perfect center” where she floats. World details like the post-hibernation quiet and emotional residues as colors feel integrated rather than touristic. The setting constrains her physically (narrow passage, sand-dusted floor) and metaphysically (this specific chamber enables the resonance and merger). The recurring fossil as an object-setting element meaningfully charges the final image as a bridge between human past and planetary present.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, grimy resin-caked windows, and great hourglass create a vivid, coherent space with strong atmosphere. Objects-as-setting (hourglass, button table, jar) are integrated into action and meaning, culminating in the charged image of walking past the clock and out from beneath the cliffs into dawn. Environmental details feel selective and purposeful, never like a tourist catalog. The world’s larger rules are sketched rather than fully grounded, but at this length that restraint works in the story’s favor.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mist, melting snow, and exposed bluff are not just mood—they justify the dead-drop method, the meeting’s secrecy, and the transient code that must be memorized and erased. Details are selective and purposeful (“silver hush,” “accumulated snow,” “watery dawn”), and they’re consistently filtered through Elias’s spy mindset. The pillbox and snow function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image: he destroys the snow-map, pockets the pillbox, and leaves the Bluff, all in a landscape that’s literally thawing. This integration of environment with both tactics and theme is strong enough to approach the top band, though the physical geography remains narrowly focused on the immediate ledge.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog-bound river crossing is vividly rendered through sound and texture; the environment feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting elements—the fog, river, ferry chain, hammering, rain gutters—aren’t just backdrop but tempo the internal shift and mark the turning point when the rain stops and silence falls. The yarn needle works as a micro-setting object that charges the memory and the final gesture of putting it away. This integration of environment and internal arc justifies a very high score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The oasis and wasteland are richly particular—“hexagonal shadows of disintegrated hive boxes,” skeletal apricot trees, clay near the spring—and every major action is physically shaped by this environment. The setting is not backdrop: the collapsed irrigation channel and available clay directly dictate his tactic and the form of his offering. Recurring environmental details (smoke flattening, thrum in the stillness, bees and honey-scent in the overlay) all reinforce atmosphere and theme without feeling like a tour. This is near top-tier setting work, though one more moment where terrain meaningfully obstructs or complicates his efforts could have added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fire escape, alley, harbor, and perpetually dark window are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with Elara’s aims, especially the harbor moonlight as a literal resource for her tactic. Environmental details are filtered through her sensibility as a “fire escape gardener,” so the setting feels lived-in rather than touristic. The bitting gauge as a micro-setting object is beautifully used, constraining her options (only a sliver of light, only from this angle) and charging the final image of the “tiny, brilliant star.” Weather and seasonal change (plants going dormant, air growing colder) subtly mirror the emotional stakes without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal library above clouds, atomically reflective floor, and humming stone circle are vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the piece’s concerns. Setting is more than wallpaper: the reflective floor literally manifests his extinct world, and the library’s remoteness and vastness embody his isolation and preservational role. The brass sundial as a small, earthly object contrasted with the cosmic chamber sharpens the final image. World rules are consistent enough; the main limitation is that environmental constraints on his options remain mostly symbolic rather than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-rain atmosphere are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail (“world was spun from damp silk,” “plinking of drips”) and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting and recurring objects (lotus, web of offerings, rainbows) actively charge the final image: the environmental light literally transforms the installation at the moment of insight, which in turn shapes her choice. The space functions as a ritual/liminal environment without slipping into generic postcard description. This is very strong scene-setting that’s tightly wedded to theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The university radio station is vividly rendered through tactile detail—“dusty bubble of analog warmth,” bakelite controls, VU meters, salvaged waveform generator—and these aren’t just décor but the literal means of her intervention. The micro-setting shapes tactics: she can only act via carrier waves and subsonic frequencies, and she monitors the consequences on a campus feed rather than entering the crowd herself. Environmental and cosmic details (Cygnus Rift, dead nebulae) are filtered through her professional eye, sustaining atmosphere without white-room abstraction. The final image—her lonely station humming quiet hope into the fractured world—effectively charges the setting as both bunker and weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    The nexus and ruined church are vivid and tactile (“walls leaned without falling,” “corridors twisted into knots”), and the environment actively constrains Elias with shifting geometry and claustrophobic pressure. The organ, stone, and starlight all feel filtered through his fear, and the nexus’s behavior clearly affects tactics. World rules (sound interacting with space) stay internally consistent within the story’s logic. It stops short of 9-band because some atmospheric flourishes (“indifferent starlight”) are more decorative than functional and the outer world remains mostly gestural.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quarry and mist are vividly rendered as more than backdrop: the “wound in the earth” and cold, wet breath both mirror and charge the central image of absence. Setting details are tightly filtered through Elias’s perception as an artist, so the rock, fog, and flat stone all become tools in his method. The environment meaningfully charges the final image via the scratch that echoes the chasm, though it doesn’t strongly constrain physical options. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are high-level and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Far North station’s heavy, damp air and the “spongey dread” create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere anchored in specific sensory detail. The climate-shifted world (micro-vortex, thawed cove) and the basalt “weeping rock” feel concretely tied to the plot, not decorative. Environmental features meaningfully enable his investigation (station data, drones, accessible shore). The recurring weather/air motif charges the final image of the air “beginning to dry,” giving setting real thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain pullout, bridge, green scaffold wrap, and ozone/pine air are sharply rendered and strongly atmospheric, with setting and objects (fiddle, shard, mesh) knitting into the central conceit. The environment meaningfully frames the possibility of a “door” across the gorge and visually incarnates the code. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics—Elias could in theory make the same choice in any vantage with sightlines—it does charge the final image of him playing into the wind. Detail selection feels purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train and surrounding woods are vividly realized and deeply integrated—details like the lion tamer’s carriage, clown mask, acrobat’s slipper, and music box all arise from the environment and shape tactics. The setting’s mood (“rust and dusky harmony”) is carried through and recharged at the end, and the circus relics are weaponized as psychological landscape against the startup. The world feels tactile and coherent without over-explaining. This environment clearly constrains choice and charges the final images, comfortably meeting high-band standards.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory and telescope are vividly rendered and feel lived-in, especially the tactile opening and the quiet dome with “gears whispering.” Celestial phenomena are integrated into action (alignment with RR Lyrae, variable stars as ideograms) rather than treated as a backdrop. Environmental shifts—night sky to the first pale blue of morning, then sunrise—effectively mirror and charge the internal shift. The setting supports and colors choices rather than sharply constraining them, which keeps it just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cursed lake and orchard vortex are vividly rendered (“black as obsidian glass,” bone-pale bark, frozen blossoms) and tightly integrated with the magic’s logic. The environment shapes tactics (she works through soil, reeds, water, vortex) rather than sitting as backdrop, and the nexus branch and lake center literally anchor the conflict. Planting the seed in the lake’s heart charges the final image and clearly uses setting as more than scenery. A slight bias toward visual description over other senses keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt glade, weirwood throne, ozone and moonpetals create a vivid, sensorially dense environment that feels lived-in and thematically consonant with temporal damage and organic entanglement. Elara’s fused body and the tree operate as a micro-setting that constrains tactics (she must act through visions and psychic connection rather than movement) and colors every perception. The setting details recur and evolve toward the end as the glade “holds its breath” and boundaries thin, charging the closing image. World rules around Dissonance and dream-stuff are sketched mostly through implication, but they remain coherent at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is strikingly original and concretely rendered (silver-barked saplings, roots threading ribs, phosphorescent moss), and the environment directly affects the outcome when Elara’s root finally touches the femur to draw “mineral-rich” life. Details are well chosen and POV-filtered, never devolving into a static tourist catalog, and the recurring use of bones and roots mirrors the thematic concern with feeding life from concluded stories. The burned card and stones function almost as micro-settings/tools, charging the final image. This falls just shy of the very highest band because the physical constraints of the space don’t strongly limit tactics beyond what’s already thematically required.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry office trailer and pit are economically but vividly realized, and details like the bar fridge, gooseneck lamp, and dawn at the quarry lip feel lived-in and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the quarry shifts from “wound” to “just a place…an echo valley longing for a new sound,” directly tying setting to internal change. Tools and objects (lamp, shoebox, desk corner) function as micro-setting that shapes his choices. A touch more interaction with the physical constraints of the trailer or pit (beyond atmosphere) would be needed to justify a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds, crystalline lattices, and pulsing filament create a vivid, distinctive environment that’s tightly filtered through Elara’s perception. Setting is not postcard-like; the arbor’s hum, central node, and field strength explicitly shape her tactical choice of where to plant the seed and charge the final image. World rules (magnetic field lines guiding silver-leafed vines, knowledge fruit tree) feel internally consistent and thematically aligned with information and pattern. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond sound/visual) could deepen immersion even further.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal atrium, oculus, moonlight, and salt-crusted marble are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the ritual: tide and lunar phase literally govern Kaelan’s transformation and the forge’s operation. Environmental details evolve with the scene—the water’s return, the flooded basin—and directly condition what is possible. The setting also mirrors the theme of cyclical becoming without feeling like mere symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Torlan crystal caves, the obsidian plate, the conch chamber, and the twin crystal pillars are all sharply drawn and integrated with the story’s function. Setting is not postcard description: the resonant hum, the gap between crystal tips, and the seashell’s etchings directly shape the final tactic and image. Sensory detail—especially sound and tactile warmth—supports tone and theme without bogging momentum. This is just shy of the very top band because we never see the environment impose concrete logistical limits, even though it richly charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The disused, ivy-choked station and river corridor are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elias’s sensibility (“like a forgotten headstone,” “chronicle written in silt and stone”). Setting is not just backdrop: it channels him to the lavatories, provides the bench on which he leaves the accordion, and the river frames the entire quest and final image. The accordion as object-as-setting is also strongly used in the closure. A slight density of metaphoric description presses toward lushness but doesn’t impede clarity or function.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glowing library in mist is vividly drawn and not merely decorative: its light, fog, and motes directly shape how and where she can act, and how the cipher functions. The watch as a tool interacts with the environment (temporal parallax, pulses at twelve) to constrain her movements. Sensory detail is selective and supports tone—“pearlescent sea,” “ghosts of syllables never uttered”—without losing clarity. The setting also charges the ending, as its dissolution underlines the limited window “between the two fateful letters.”

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory, velvet drape, refrigerated air, marble pedestal, ice violin, and Cyphandra vine are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the physical contact with the vine triggers the key revelation, and the “velvet cage” vs. “wild valleys” contrast charges the ending. Details are economical yet lush, maintaining spatial and atmospheric coherence throughout. The environment could constrain his options slightly more explicitly, but it already meaningfully inflects mood and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “grotto of crystalline rock,” obsidian slab, aurora veils, niches of glowing gems all create a strong atmospheric container. Details feel filtered through Elara’s professional gaze (tools, slab, locket), and the aurora as “universe’s chaotic song” integrates worldbuilding with the method. The environment charges the final image of the alcove of gems and the “radiant hush” rather than merely decorating it. It still functions more as lush backdrop than as a constraint on choice, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Umbral Grotto, cloud sea, Whisperwood, and Heart-Bloom are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s caretaking gaze. Details like luminous water veins, shadow patches of decay, and mist canopy are not just scenic; they mirror the cyclical theme and guide her tactics. The hairpin as tool within the earth further turns micro-setting into function rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, the North Atlantic wind, and the ring of wind chimes are vivid, specific, and constantly active in the scene. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the wind drives the chimes (moral instrument), seizes the narrator’s coat, and literally tears the cloak away once it’s unhooked, while dawn after the last ember underscores the liminal moral moment. Details are filtered through the narrator’s practiced eye, keeping us out of tourist-catalog territory. The setting sharply supports tone and theme and constrains action without a single wasted description.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating rock, crystalline surface, magnetic grotto, and star-reflecting pond create a vivid, atmospheric locus that feels particular rather than generic. Setting is consistently filtered through Kael’s perception, with details like “starlight sharp enough to cut” mirroring his tension. The environment supports tone and concept more than it constrains choice; they rarely have to navigate physical limits or resources imposed by the platform itself. Still, the pond as micro-setting is central to the action and the final image, keeping this well above average.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, original, and integral: towers of leviathan bone, rust-colored sky, and a canyon of echoes meaningfully shape both method (sound, birds, resonance) and mood. Environmental specifics like the dusk-ravens and the canyon’s acoustic heart directly participate in the central act of guidance, not just as backdrop. The world’s logic feels internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. It falls just shy of the very top band only because constraints from the environment could press choices even more tightly than they do.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire above a “sea of roiling clouds” and the “sky the color of a bruised plum” create an arresting, specific atmosphere that feels integral, not decorative. The environment constrains options—he’s isolated, at altitude, with only what he carried—and the keystone as architectural and luminous focal point charges the final image. Details like the “skeletal remains of a forgotten wizard’s garden” mirror his sense of obsolescence without over-signaling. World rules around magic-as-algorithm versus this anomalous light feel consistent and are shown rather than explained in bulk.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pier, sky lanterns, and especially the submerged library are rendered with vivid, selective detail that carries mood and character bias (“books, swollen and soft, drifted…like sleeping bats”). Environment constrains action in meaningful ways: the one low tide, the distance and darkness, and the library’s total blackout enabling his experiment in listening. The recurring vertical axis of light (lamps, lanterns, stars, then the faint lantern glow above the wreck) charges the final surface image, though one more tactile interaction with the wreck under stress could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The end-of-universe setting is vivid and economical—“bruised light and screaming physics,” an “ambered field,” recyclers, derelict ships—all filtered through Kael’s professional and existential focus. The observatory’s constraints (power diversion threatens the amber field and sensors) subtly shape his risk calculus. World rules feel consistent without exposition dump, and the scale of description matches the scene’s needs. One could imagine even more tactile engagement with the physical space, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ancient observatory at dusk, the copper ribs, the Grand Orrery, and the specific behavior of sunlight through the dome are vivid and purposeful, not mere backdrop. Setting directly constrains tactics: he uses the final rays, the dome, and a tear-shaped lens to channel light and fix the echo. The environment’s decaying, twilight quality mirrors his interior state without feeling mechanically symbolic. A slight risk of decorative excess in descriptive density keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, economical, and purpose-driven: the sapphire viaduct’s crystalline nature and resonance clearly matter to how the bell’s song travels and charges the final image. The “after the last fish was caught” era, the dust-choked canyon, and dawn light all deepen the elegiac mood while remaining legible. The viaduct’s arch and humming structure literally conduct the change into the seabed, so environment is not just backdrop. A slightly clearer articulation of why this precise spot is uniquely suited (beyond routine) could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the receded reservoir, skeletal town, cracked mud, and the Ridgeway all feel concrete and lived-in rather than decorative. The environmental premise (a drowned town resurfacing in drought) is not just a backdrop but the enabling condition for every plot turn. Later spaces—the archives, his attic, the community hall by the dam—are economical yet distinct and thematically aligned with record-keeping and remembrance. The setting charges the final image (a corkboard of photos and the label by the dam) even if it doesn’t physically constrain last-ditch tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and ancient apple tree are vividly rendered and feel coherent with the alchemical, quasi-mythic tone. The environment is not just postcard; the orchard as sanctum and the overlooked tree concretely shape the discovery of the crystal and thus the transformation. Details like moss-soft earth, fractured light, and scented vapor are selective and purposeful, mirroring Elias’s internal shift. The setting clearly charges the final image of him standing in his sacred space feeling “impossibly, startlingly new.”

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The nocturnal arbor, bioluminescent moss, thin ozone-tasting air, and lattice-branch walls create a vivid, specific environment filtered through Kael’s sensibility. Technical details (magnetic lenses, gravitational wave emitters, spun-crystal dial) integrate setting with action rather than sit as backdrop. While the arbor’s physical layout doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, the tools and console environment clearly do, especially the fragility of the dial as a concrete constraint. The recurring quiet of the world above the clouds subtly mirrors and amplifies Kael’s isolated burden.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating rock dojo over a sea of temporal static, a sun that has forgotten its name, and a sky convulsing between colors all create a vivid, specific atmosphere that suits the metaphysical stakes. Details are filtered through Kael’s detached perception and support theme (revised histories, selfhood, and creation) rather than feeling touristic. The jar as a micro-setting object is well-charged, though the dojo’s physical constraints don’t much alter tactics beyond providing a sanctified space Jin wants to “cleanse.” World rules (time rewriting, yin–yang creation) are clear enough for this scope and never contradict themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “nocturnal haven,” brook, cottage, and workshop are sketched with selective, atmospheric detail that fits Elias’s sensibility and the tone. The environment mirrors and supports his interior state—quiet after cacophony, a protected space for puzzles—without turning into a static catalog. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of the pot among his blueprints as part of his curated space. Sensory specificity (storm aftermath, brook, damp earth) is vivid and integrated into action rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is economical yet vivid: the dust-moted living room, the faded blower in the garage, and the tiled hallway as “echo chamber tunnel” are concrete and emotionally charged. The environment isn’t just backdrop; the hallway’s acoustics and the blower as tool directly shape his choice of method. Physical details like the cold engine and hanging pull cord feel tactile and grounded. Atmosphere of domestic quiet turned uncanny is well sustained without overloading description.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen garden, mist, and stone library are vivid and consistently filtered through Lyel’s psyche, with weather and environment mirroring and informing his inner state. The pendant and the garden both charge the final image: the portal tearing in the garden and Lyel “pushing fog into the tear” binds setting directly to the climax. Sensory detail leans visual and atmospheric but is purposeful rather than touristic, maintaining mood and logic. The environment meaningfully constrains options (isolated grounds, singular portal site) even if spatial choreography is relatively static.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “ember nexus” and fading ley lines create an immediate, atmospheric sense of a dying place whose exhaustion mirrors Elias’s state, and details like warm ashen dust and wraith-blossom dew feel particular rather than generic. Setting is not mere backdrop: the nexus embers and dying ley line are literally the heat source and symbolically charge the final bloom. World rules (alchemy, forgotten faith, relic behavior) are conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps. It stops just shy of 9+ because the environment shapes mood and imagery more than it actively constrains tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “abandoned radio tower city,” “Black-Lip Gorge,” “serenely electric” air, all filtered through Elara’s professional sensibility. Environmental details support mood and theme (lonely towers, forgotten broadcasts, charged perigee) and are consistently integrated with the work she’s doing. The world’s rules feel coherent without over-explaining. Still, the environment mostly shapes tone rather than substantially constraining her choices in the climax, which holds it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The spectral grotto, crystalline moonlight walls, and alien constellations are vivid, specific, and tightly filtered through Finn’s working familiarity with the ferry. Setting is not postcard-only: the starlight’s geometric reflections and frost patterns concretely provide the “data” that enables his solution, and the empty hourglass/time-warping clocks charge the final image. Environmental rules stay coherent and evolve with events (from harbor chop to impossible stillness and back). This integration of atmosphere with mechanism and closure is strong and nearly publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly rendered (checkered floors rippling into chasms, moiré walls, trick mirrors) and consistently filtered through Elias’s work. The environment escalates with the conflict—the walls swirl, floors freeze into black glass, and by the end the gallery itself is thematized as his “beautifully enchanted cage,” so setting explicitly charges the final image. Sensory specificity (ozone, salt, polished stone, internal humming) is tight and purposeful rather than touristic. This is near top-tier work; a single concrete way the space physically limits his options would nudge it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The benthic city and abyssal setting are vivid and conceptually integrated: plasteel domes as “phosphorescent barnacles,” pressure checks, sonar, and recycled air all feel lived-in and support the theme of constrained horizons. Kaelen’s professional lens filters what matters—edges, canyons, currents—so the environment is not a neutral backdrop but a metaphorical training ground for cosmic navigation. The recurring anchor chain link functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The only missing step, for a higher band, is having the physical environment more directly constrain a concrete on-page choice rather than primarily serving as thematic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass-and-steel “cathedral,” and weeping figs give a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s liminal emotional space. Details are selective and purposeful, often mirroring the emotional hush and isolation of both living and dead. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, functioning more as mood and metaphor than as a tactical environment. Still, the visual and aural specificity (fog, echo, marble footsteps) is high and integrated into action rather than tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting and atmosphere are highly vivid: the retreating tide, “concrete wound in the cliffside,” armored cable “skins,” and the humming relay hub all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental constraints matter—the tide window, the physical collapse, and the undersea cables terminating in a flooded floor all shape tactics and stakes. The tone of the place (“tombstone for a project and its people”) marries neatly to the thematic work of unremembered dead. A bit more dynamic interaction with the flooding risk during the middle could further integrate setting with active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal observatory, the snow-buried world, the slate table, and the ink all create a vivid, coherent atmosphere of isolation and quiet ritual. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s attention—silence, cold, glass, and snow reinforcing her liminal status and the piece’s hushed tone. The shard, ink, and slate act as a micro-setting that directly shapes action and the final image. The snow and “opal” quality are more tonal than constraining, but they’re well-integrated rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Chasm of In-An, bone towers, and sky of dust are intensely specific and woven through perception, not tacked on. Setting is not just wallpaper: the canyon’s endless echoes create the core problem, while the tallest bone spire and its texture become the target “word” he risks himself to access. The diamond as micro-setting/tool constrains tactics, and the wind, height, and vibration all feed the decisive act. Atmosphere and world rules feel internally consistent and charge the final moment of silence and sound.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    The herbalist’s underground garden is strikingly realized and felt as a lived, rule-bearing place, from “gravitationally playful” condensation to the bioluminescent orchid and the transformation into a willow-sapling. Setting is not postcard dressing: it provides the mechanism of change and the alternative “harmony” that redefines what happened to the missing, including Clara. The recurring objects (orchid, phone, arrowhead) are embedded in the space and charge the final image and decision. The world’s altered physics and organic quiet directly frame the thematic question of what it means to be “saved.”

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Orchard of Sighs, sky-bridge, Mother Tree, and granite Wardens are sensuously rendered and integrated into action rather than offered as static backdrop. The world’s rules (mechanized guardians vs. dormant magic) stay consistent and are learned through Elara’s choices. Environment directly shapes conflict—she must slip past Wardens, address the Mother Tree, and the soil/vines become her instrument in the climax. The final image of the orchard’s transformation is strongly charged by prior setting details.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: dust, cobalt arcade, drones, and the rusted mail drop all filter through Elias’s task-focused perspective and contribute to mood and constraint. Environmental elements (the drone net, the hidden port, the twilight mail-drop timing) meaningfully shape what tactics are possible. The recurring cobalt/blue motif (arcade sign, bluebird signal) also charges the final image thematically. A minor reason it doesn’t go higher is that physical interaction with the space is limited mostly to the mail drop and cycle; we don’t see the environment adapt or push back mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly realized—the rusted carriages, velvet-stripped seats, lion cages, wind bells, and halo shard all work together to create a dense, atmospheric space. Details are filtered through Elias’s work-focused perspective, so tools, decay, and light matter more than generic scenery. The environment and recurring objects (especially the bells and fragment) significantly charge the final image, even if they don’t tightly constrain physical options. This level of specificity and tonal alignment is strong enough for high publication-tier expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Athenaeum of Scientific Poetry is vividly and economically rendered—“cathedral of shelved paradoxes” and the later sensory shift to ozone and nightshade are both memorable and functional. Setting is tightly integrated with the action: the books are literal coordinates in his geometric ritual, and the library’s liminal quiet allows the atmospheric shift to register as uncanny. The environment clearly charges the final image of him returning to his desk with a “universe of secrets.” This is publishable-level atmosphere with good specificity and almost no waste.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering archipelago, the easternmost islet, the steel-grey water, sea fog, and salt-scented library are vivid and economically rendered, tightly interwoven with Silas’s routines. Environment constrains tactics (boat journeys, reliance on sunrise over open water, spring water development) and charges the final image by making light, sea, and solitude feel inseparable from his longing. Details filter through his vocation and obsession rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The setting’s influence is more atmospheric than oppositional, but it palpably shapes the story’s logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “circle of salt-white stones” and “shadowed nexus under the dome of a deepening sky” are vivid and consistent, and the world’s rules (ley lines, first star) are learned through his process rather than exposition. The setting actively enables and constrains tactics: his work can only begin at twilight in this specific nexus, and the star’s angle through the hair creates the lattice. Those environmental rules charge the ritual and the final image of the idea drifting on solar winds. It feels like a precise, necessary place rather than a generic mystical backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater greenhouse, ring of shipwrecks, and submersible are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s eye as a working folklorist. The environment constrains his choices (submersible arms, viewing through warped glass, distance from the mushroom) rather than feeling like mere backdrop. Recurring objects (the dome, the trees, the mushroom, the constellations) all charge the final image. The only reason this doesn’t reach 9+ is that the setting, while excellent, still leans slightly toward atmospheric beauty over direct tactical constraint in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The forgotten library, the cavernous reading room, the dust motes, and the distant playground swing form a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; the library’s “forgotten” nature and the toppled/restacked scrolls directly mirror and host the thematic resolution. The crystalline cube adds a tactile, uncanny object-bound sense of this world’s rules. One could push the environment’s constraining role a bit further (how exile’s mechanics shape the library’s operations), but as-is it’s strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich—“verdant parapet,” “shimmering mist,” and the waterfall’s roar all feel lived-in rather than merely decorative. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the waterfall’s mist is the veil he must reach through, directly enabling his method of capturing essence. The orchard on the cliffside and the clay pot anchor the magical in tangible, tactile detail, and the final wave of restored color reweights the initial greyness. The density of purposeful environmental detail strongly supports both mood and mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism sanctuary under fractured starlight, the hanging net, and the sensory wash of cold and brine are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s ritual focus. Environment and object-as-setting actively charge the action: the sanctuary “feels it,” the prisms’ light grows frantic then calms, and the net’s physical structure dictates the painstaking method. The final image of quieter starlight and a re-stabilized hush shows the setting reconfigured by the protagonist’s act. This integration of place, atmosphere, and consequence justifies a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archival workshop, dehumidifiers, glue scent, and the henge’s “rain-scoured fresco vault” are vividly rendered, with sensory selectivity tied to Elara’s professional eye. The environment isn’t just scenic; the lichen growth pattern on the capstone is a functional environmental constraint that makes the hidden door discoverable only through long-term, detail-oriented observation. Weather and light (“1950s sun” vs. “mists of the 1990s”) subtly support the temporal and thematic contrasts. Setting stops short of physically constraining the final decision, but it strongly charges the central realization.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater library is richly realized and specific—the warped bronze doors, floating “pale, indecipherable flowers” of books, and bolted tables create a vivid, coherent space. The setting is not mere backdrop: the mirrored miniature library in the globe and the seafloor “monument” directly charge the final image and the ethical choice. Environmental details are filtered through a professional, unhurried gaze that feels true to the narrator. A touch more tactile constraint from the deep (risk, physical difficulty) could have raised pressure further but isn’t strictly necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sky-courtyard above clouds, the mist, the plinth, and the weather system are vividly rendered and integrated with the premise of Lyra as “atmospheric architecture.” Environmental elements (lightning, thunder, mist, stone, glyph-lit walls) don’t just decorate; they define the ritual’s constraints and shape the climax. Sensory detail is rich and mostly purposeful, with only occasional brushes against purple. The recurring object-as-setting function of the bolt plate and plinth nicely charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound spire, crystal elevator, and cloud-sea world are vividly and economically evoked, with details filtered through Kael’s perspective and needs. The environment and tools (elevator, sunlight, goggles) actively shape the action—the sliver of sunlight at the third floor literally enables the deciphering, and the Grand Archives at the end recontextualize his custodial role. World rules (magic script, polarized lenses) feel consistent and learned through present action rather than exposition dumps. It’s rich and purposeful, though the larger world’s pressures remain more atmospheric than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stratospheric setting, sky gondola, and layered cloud types are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elias’s meteorologist sensibility. Atmospheric details (“deepening indigo veil,” “dusty starlight,” noctilucent lattice of ice and light) are precise rather than generic and constantly inflected by his emotional project. The telescope-as-object and the gondola-as-drifting platform both charge the final image of him as “curator…through an immense gallery of memories.” Setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it deeply saturates tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tree trunk library and condemned building are vividly embodied—petrified rings, dust motes, the knot of heartwood, and the groaning structure all feel tactile and specific. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the heartwood “living heart” is a literal locus of action, and the building’s impending demolition constrains time and charges the final image. World rules (petrified wood channeling light, the guild’s carved chamber) are consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition. The only ceiling here comes from scope—this is excellent, but not yet doing something structurally surprising with setting at a masterwork level.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The antique airship, aging canvas, brass fittings, and the main hold with its chalked hopscotch board create a vivid, coherent micro-world. Setting is filtered through Elias’s professional gaze (maps, phrasebooks, celestial anomalies), which keeps detail purposeful. The environment meaningfully charges the closure: the relic hopscotch on the deck and the sky swarmed by starlings become the mechanism of discovery. Weather and altitude feel present enough to sustain the fantastical premise without bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “frozen library above the clouds,” the mirrored core, and the Orrery are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action, not just backdrop. The haunting light and ice directly constrain tactics and make the eclipse solution necessary, satisfying the “object/setting as constraint” test. Details are selective but rich, creating a distinct atmosphere without losing clarity. A small ceiling comes from the “above the clouds” aspect remaining more decorative than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“dust…like rust and regret,” floating rock arches, petrified orchards, strangler figs in a ruined biodome—creating strong atmosphere without bogging the pacing. Crucially, the environment constrains tactics: the chaotic magnetosphere and the altitude of the Sentinel Arch dictate the climb and the use of pulleys, and the arch becomes the literal resonant instrument for the bell. The nebula of respite and bruised-purple sky support tone and stakes rather than feeling like postcard lore. This integration of environment with choice and outcome is strong, though not yet extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the hidden lighthouse, starless sky, and pane of hush all create a coherent, eerie cosmology that mirrors the quiet end of time. Details like “space between atoms” humming and “white silence” seeping in keep the environment dynamically interacting with events rather than remaining backdrop. The puppet head and crystal both recur to charge the final image, and the environment constrains the story’s possible actions (his task is bound to this apex and its machinery). There is some reliance on visual/abstract description, but it suits the mode and never slips into white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and encroaching frost are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s practical urgency and long familiarity. Environment constrains choice (working on the ledge, the need to finish before ice and bird malfunction) and charges the final image of the iced cliffs at the end. World rules (shifting granite walls, tidal pull, birds’ mechanisms) are integrated into action rather than dumped. A touch more sensory variety beyond visual and tactile might push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The braided ravine, river, granite, and chrysalis are vividly rendered through multiple senses and filtered through Aris’s technical mindset, giving the setting both texture and character specificity. The environment meaningfully charges the closure: the “cathedral” ravine, braided river, and chrysalis all reappear conceptually in his final repricing of divergence and transformation. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it profoundly shapes perception and thematic movement. The balance between lyric description and functional anchoring is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Glass Orchard Library, glass trees, crystalline floor over clouds, and prisms are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the story’s logic of stories-as-light and absence-as-silence. The environment meaningfully shapes his tactics (measuring silence between leaves, shadows of barren branches) and culminates in the unique, smooth tree that defines his final choice. World rules (stories as refracted light, absence as smooth clarity) are consistent and learned through his investigatory actions rather than exposition. The setting also charges the final image: when every glass leaf chimes, the whole environment responds to his choice, giving the world a tangible reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the post-rain desert fortress and ephemeral puddles tie directly into his tide-pool analysis, the unearthed fossil, and the access to the pavilion. The coral icebound grotto is not mere décor; its cold, luminous motes and crushing atmosphere materially shape the climax and charge the final dissolution image. Sensory detail is rich and filtered through Kaelen’s perceptual biases as a chef and bearer of grief. Environment and recurring objects (puddles, fossil, coral) all constrain choices and meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astronomical clock tower, consoles, starlight, and cuckoo-weighted armature create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly tied to the action. Details like “borrowed starlight filtering through the great celestial dials” and the trembling weight are integrated into the emotional and procedural beats rather than feeling decorative. The weight and tower function as a kind of micro-setting constraint for Elias’s work and charge the final image. The setting feels both specific and thematically apt without over-explaining its mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit canyon, cavern workshop, and salvage-tech environment are vivid and purposeful, establishing a strong mood from the opening line. Details like ozone and synthetic lavender, the hollow in the rock, and the broken periscope are filtered through Elara’s sensibility and intertwined with the action. The setting charges the final image (mirror, canyon stillness, moonlight) but does not significantly constrain tactical options beyond atmosphere, which keeps it just shy of the very top band. Overall, the world feels specific, coherent, and aesthetically integrated with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vividly and economically rendered—the mist, inverted droplets, stalactites, obsidian wall, phosphorescent fungi—always filtered through Kael’s task. World rules (inverted gravity, threshold, upward-falling fungi) are shown in action and clearly constrain his movement and timing. The grotto environment meaningfully shapes tactics and risk, especially during the escape as stones become “deadly rain.” Occasionally the imagery verges on decorative density, but it mostly serves atmosphere and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grove is vividly and economically realized—the alders as “muted orchestra,” the siskins, the seasonal hedgehog cue—and these details are filtered through Elara’s musical obsession. Setting is not decorative: the different trees’ histories and tensions directly determine which notes she can “coax,” and the Old One’s scarred body literally encodes the method. The porcelain insulator and the Old One together form a micro-setting that constrains her choices and charges the final image (“the porcelain resting still against the Old One’s trunk”). This is very near top-tier, but a touch more environmental resistance or constraint on her tactics would push it into the absolute highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Umbral Caldera, purple sun, magnetic hums, and auroral ribbons are rendered with striking, specific imagery that feels integrated rather than touristic. The environment is not just backdrop: the magnetic nexus, twilight, and celestial alignment are the conditions that make his method and discovery possible. The setting’s textures (tooth-ache magnetism, obsidian ridge, dust on his cheek) are filtered through his sensibility and support tone. It stops just shy of the very top tier because the environment constrains mood and possibility more than it concretely shapes tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: ozone and old paper, brass and copper contraptions, the velvet-cushioned device, and fireworks outside all mirror and heighten the central tension between silence and spectacle. The workshop tools and the diary clasp function almost as micro-settings that constrain his actions and shape the climax. The fireworks and “final stillness” are integrated into the emotional architecture, not just backdrop. A slight deepening of how the physical space limits or aids his process under time pressure could raise this further, but as is, atmosphere and specificity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canopy village in ancient ironwood trees, rope bridges, and shifting canopy currents is vivid and sensorially grounded, especially through smell. Setting is not decorative: the perpetual sway and treetop winds are exactly what make serenity difficult and render her sensitivity dangerous. The environmental turn—the forest’s “sighing exhalation” bearing a riot of scents—is the story’s central pressure event. The world-building is rich and coherent at this length, though we never see physical navigation of space under duress, which could further tighten the link between environment and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: inverted dust motes, a river peeling from its bed, a geode the size of a city, levitating droplets, and gossamer-fruit orchards all feel coherent and fresh. Environmental rules (hour-long gravity inversion, upward river, rock arches) are learned through action and directly constrain tactics. The Anechoic Heart and arrow tip operate as charged objects that shape access and the final image. Sensory detail is mostly visual but purposeful, building a distinct atmosphere without lapsing into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “labyrinth of shipping containers,” salt-and-rust haze, and oppressive silence all contribute strongly to tone and concept. Environmental specifics (steel canyons, ruptured container, asphalt stain) directly inform both the investigation and the nature of the catastrophe. The world’s rules and textures feel internally consistent and filtered through his professional gaze. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain his tactical options, it powerfully charges the final image of solitary knowledge amid dead industry.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and ice bells are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with the premise: the fissure to the sky, the clear ice, and the colored light are not decorative; they are the mechanism of the ritual. Sensory detail is lush and multi-modal (taste of new grass, smell of lavender, pressure of silence) and consistently filtered through Kael’s synesthetic perception. The environment directly constrains and enables action—he must use this cavern, this ice, this window to the aurora. The final image of a transformed cavern reweights prior descriptions, making setting central to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon, “Thunder-echo range,” driftwood, and charged silence give a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors Kaelen’s internal state. Details like “pale, water-smoothed wood” and the “avalanchingly quiet pressure” feel specific and integrated rather than touristic. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices so much as echo and deepen them, which keeps it from the very top tier. Still, the final image of the canyon holding both grief and understanding shows good use of setting as emotional container.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is striking and specific: topaz walls, dying stars, the iron press, and the halo fragment all form a coherent, otherworldly workshop. Details consistently filter through the scene’s stakes (the timing of constellations, the press’s mechanics, the star-ink atmosphere). The environment and tools meaningfully charge the final image—the card as a physicalization of grief arising from this exact machinery and cosmos. It falls just short of 9-band because the environment colors rather than actively constrains tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and specific, with the cold, shale, and sky all tightly interwoven with Kael’s perception and anxiety. The environment is not just backdrop: the aurora directly interacts with the pendant, and the ridge becomes the literal ground where memory and myth crystallize. The final garden of “solidified aurora” charges the closing image and could not exist in a generic setting. A minor limitation is that the physical terrain doesn’t much constrain his concrete options beyond mood and spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quartz arbor, misted valley, frost, wrecked car, and dawn light are vivid and purpose-driven, not just decorative. Environment directly shapes the method (light through prism onto frost) and the final image (the windshield as a schematic screen). The crystalline/icy setting also mirrors Elias’s transition from poeticization to clinical, mineral coldness. One could imagine even more tactile engagement with the arbor itself, but what’s here already charges the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard, bamboo forest, and ancient loom create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that fits the fable-like tone and Elara’s isolation. The loom and bead function as micro-settings/tools that materially shape what’s possible and what it costs to act; the bead in particular charges the final image. Detail is purposeful rather than touristic, consistently filtered through Elara’s work and loss. The only thing holding this back from an even higher score is that the physical environment (orchard/bamboo) remains mostly atmospheric rather than an active constraint on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly woven into the action: floating stone arches shedding souring dust, failing orchards, and “old wounds” of mine shafts all feed the logic of Elian’s choices. The geode and geothermal warmth are tactile, and the blue energy tracing the arch directly charges the final image. World rules (magician drained arches, silk as conduit, mines as wounds) feel coherent and are learned through what Elian does. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top band is that the environment constrains him atmospherically more than logistically in moment-to-moment tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly realized—rust, silence, stained concrete, specific smells—and the sensory mapping ties setting closely to character. The shard itself functions as a micro-setting lens that fractures the environment into layered realities. While the bay doesn’t strongly constrain tactics in a physical sense, its nature as the nexus and family worksite thematically constrains the story’s possibilities and charges the final reclassification of the place.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sea, skiff, lighthouse, and cliff stairs are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Silas’s practiced familiarity, and the storm meaningfully constrains his actions. The haunted lantern room functions as a charged micro-setting, its cold emptiness underscoring the emotional vacancy when the keeper is gone. The recurring sea glass and the mechanical details of the lamp give a tactile precision that supports both mood and plot. This is just shy of highest tier because the “haunted” angle remains mostly tonal rather than affecting tactics or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, glass apparatus, and cosmic storm are rendered with lush, specific imagery that feels integral rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully constrains the action—this work can only happen here, with this beam and this vantage point—and the glowing wick and shuddering tower charge the climax. The setting’s tone (emerald light under stark stars) dovetails with the story’s themes of liminal creation. A slight tendency toward ornamental description keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock tea house, valley mists, ancient chains, vats, and sun trails create a vivid, coherent atmosphere tightly aligned with the story’s concerns about light and color. Setting details are selectively filtered through Kaelen’s professional eye, which strengthens both world-building and theme. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it heavily charges the imagery and final realization (wing, chalked trails, mist). The tea house feels like a lived-in observatory rather than a postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: storm, tower, labyrinth, and tools all feel tactile and clearly filtered through Aris’s sensibility. Environmental elements actively shape events—the storm and tower height produce the lightning strike, the high arched windows admit moonlight, and the mosaic wall charges the final image. Details like “shed grief like pollen” and “dust motes dancing in the stormlit tower” deepen atmosphere without becoming mere wallpaper. The world rules around sorrow, moonlight, and the labyrinth are consistent and smoothly embedded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and perpetual twilight are vividly and economically rendered; details like Sun-Drop Ferns, Petal-Moths, Shadow-Vines, and the Lumina tree are not just decorative but folded into the magic of the song. The environment constrains and enables action (the greenhouse as last refuge, the plants as instruments of dawn, the mica window as a barrier framing the outside night) and charges the final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through observation and action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Athenaeum is vividly evoked through smell, light, and texture (aged paper, beeswax, green-shaded lamp, leather spines), and the laundromat facade adds a memorable “hidden world” inflection. Setting is not just backdrop; it functions as sanctuary and as the medium for his “staying while leaving,” with the library’s presence becoming what he merges into at the end. The environment mirrors his inner state without blunt symbolism—vast, quiet, star-like. The one small limitation is that the “hidden behind a laundromat” aspect is more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vividly, economically rendered, with moss, ivy, shut-off fountains, and chill working as both atmosphere and thematic mirror. Setting is strongly filtered through Elara’s noticing, linking civic neglect to personal grief and rebellion. Crucially, the environment constrains action—the disused palace grounds invite illicit gardening and justify the patrol’s presence—and charges the final image of “smallest seeds” in stone. The recurring bread heel and herbs operate as micro-setting objects that meaningfully inflect the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen spire above a cloud-sea, the hoarfrost, quartz hush, and resonator machinery create a vivid, coherent environment that strongly shapes tone and images. Setting details are filtered through Kaelen’s professional focus (vaults, slides, ledgers) and recur meaningfully (the cold, the window over the clouded world) to charge the final view of the city of strangers. The archive’s isolation and altitude conceptually constrain his role as a distant custodian of fading bonds. Environment and specific objects clearly charge the closure image, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is richly evoked through smell, light, sound, and social rules, and those details consistently shape behavior (the “truce of hush,” Boro’s role, the crowd masking her maneuvers). The phosphorescent kelp and the creaking, waterlogged architecture provide not just mood but tactical cover and constraints. The watch fob and recorder function as charged micro-settings/objects that focus attention and choice. This is highly effective, though there remains room for one more moment where the physical environment directly complicates or risks her final move.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is a major strength: the lavender bluff, aurora, and microclimates around each carrier are sensorially rich and filtered through Elara’s scientific-yet-lyric perception. Environmental elements actively participate in the climax—the merging storms and tightening aurora are not backdrop but mechanism. The lavender scent and tin ring recur, charging the final calm with reweighted meaning. A slight tendency toward lush description in calm moments is the only thing keeping this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and specific, with selenite spars, prismatic light, and phosphorescent pigments that all feel texturally and visually alive. Crucially, the environment isn’t mere backdrop: the cave’s crystals generate both the color key and the literal material of the new art, directly charging the ending. Details are filtered through Elias’s artistic eye, aligning setting with character and theme. A slight risk of over-poeticizing is managed well enough that atmosphere supports rather than stalls the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse city under toxic sky, maintenance shafts, and the climate-controlled arboretum are vividly and economically rendered, with details like “nutrient-paste lamps” and bone-dry conduits anchoring the world. Setting is consistently filtered through Elian’s sensibility and profession, and plant-life functions as a recurring, thematically charged element. The environment conceptually constrains choices (bubble city, poisoned earth) but rarely shapes moment-to-moment tactics or physical peril. This is strong atmospheric work, just short of using environment as an active crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: the whispering bluff, cloud sea, polar-origin iceberg, and rare updraft each shape timing and method rather than serving as postcard backdrops. The weather and altitude constraints directly determine when the symphony can be released and how the sculpture functions. Details like thermal chisels, resonant forks, and pearlescent sky are filtered through Elian’s craft-focused perception, giving the world a strong tactile and tonal unity. The final image of mist and light cascading down to the cloud-blanketed world is charged by all this prior environmental groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The desert rose farm and glass dome are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: the crystal formation becomes the containment crucible and the dome’s joint the escape vector. Sensory details (“air smells of ozone and lost things,” “unfiltered desert air, thick with dust and the scent of distant rain”) deepen atmosphere without stalling momentum. World rules (geothermal regulators, magnetic shift, enclosure wardens) feel consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition. The final threshold image—static garden behind, raw desert ahead—uses setting to charge the thematic before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard, mailboxes, and locket are concretely rendered—coffee, damp earth, brick wall, and the odd star-shaped lock give a lived-in, specific feel. Setting is integrated into action: the communal courtyard enables gathering and storytelling; the mailbox bank is the physical locus of conflict; the locket literally interfaces with the environment. Atmosphere (dawn, sandstorm calm) effectively supports the gentle, communal tone without lapsing into tourist catalog description. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain options beyond “they’re all gathered here,” but it does charge the final image via the garden bequest.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken lab is vividly realized—the humming pressure, quartz-glass, bioluminescent algae, and “forgotten tomb” atmosphere all support the tone and stakes. Setting details are integrated with action and closure (the hum changing key, algae pulsing differently, the fractal on the screen). The environment reinforces isolation and makes the “new and quiet life” at the end feel reweighted and earned. It stops just short of greatness only because the underwater constraints don’t actively force tactical choices beyond mood and backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the docks at dusk, the town’s unsettled quiet, and especially the salt crystal chamber are vivid, sensorial, and filtered through Silas’s mindset. The environment isn’t just decorative; the salt crystals’ resonance and the secluded chamber feel integral to his ritual, and the final image of indifferent glittering crystals deepens the emotional charge. World rules about gravity pockets and the whale’s influence remain consistent and are learned through observations and action. The piece stops just short of making the environment an explicit constraint on his tactical options, which keeps it under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal clearing and brook are sensually vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s task, especially using the brook’s murmur as a baseline. The atmosphere of hushed, moonlit solitude strongly supports the piece’s mood and concept of silence. Yet the environment rarely constrains choices or alters tactics beyond providing sound to listen past; it is more resonant backdrop than active pressure. Still, the recurring brook sound at the end nicely charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Althea, Elias’s apartment, the rooftop garden, and the Perseid meteor shower are rendered with evocative, selective detail that reinforces the story’s concern with memory and impression. Setting is consistently filtered through Clara’s obsession with the “language” of buildings, so environment and motif feel inseparable from character. The antique seal and the rooftop planter function as micro-settings that literally receive the final “impression,” charging the last image. A slight increase in how the building’s physical constraints affect choices (beyond symbolism) would be needed to push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “velvet garden,” moss paths, and crystalline resonance structures create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that supports the story’s liminal, mournful tone. World rules are implied cleanly through how he uses the structures rather than explained in exposition. Setting participates functionally—the structures are the only way to access the memory, and the twilight/last star frame charges the ending image. However, the garden itself is more atmospheric than constraining; it rarely affects tactics beyond mood and location.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary, aurora, glacial ice, and stalactites are vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s focus on time, cold, and sanctity. The recurring details—the dripping stalactites and pearl twilight shifting to dawn—directly charge the ending image by re-framing geological time from measuring war to measuring peace. Tools and materials (sealskin scroll, iron-gall ink, rose thorn) function almost as micro-setting and are used in action, not just catalogued. The one small ceiling is that the environment rarely constrains his tactics in a concrete way; it shapes tone and theme more than logistical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine nexus, canyon chasms, starlight, and resonant crystal are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lyra’s sensory and professional priorities. Setting is not mere backdrop: the canyon acoustics and crystal resonance literally determine her method of inquiry and solution. The recurring shell/crystal/starlight imagery charges the final chamber scene with atmosphere that supports theme. A small step shy of 9+ only because environmental constraints, while present, are not severely limiting her options.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glacier shrine is vividly realized—“breath-hollowed space,” “walls weep history,” blue ancient ice—and the research outpost environment is sketched with enough specificity to feel grounded. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting/object that meaningfully charges the final image. However, the physical settings mainly serve as atmospheric frames rather than constraints on choice; Elara’s tactics would be similar in a different cold sanctum. Strong, purposeful description and tonal alignment lift this above-average but stop short of fully environment-driven storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting work is lush, precise, and integrated: the rain, parapet, city, fields, and fireflies are all filtered through Kaelen’s way of seeing and recur with evolving weight. Environmental details actively matter—the after-rain puddles enable the “moon paths,” the parapet affords the initial distance, and the tools on the parapet at the end charge the final image. The tea whisk, nets, and moon reflections function as micro-setting elements that constrain perception and meaning rather than postcard backdrop. This depth of atmosphere that directly feeds the closure easily surpasses strong-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: irradiated dust, a sharply bounded green orchard, the derelict station, and the Seraphim peaks all feel concrete and purposeful. Environmental details shape tactics (the antenna vantage, the orchard’s boundary, the field’s localized effect) and directly enable the final discovery. The mood—ashen wasteland against stubborn greenery—supports the thematic contrast between entropy and stillness. This is a major strength, though an extra sensory layer (sound, temperature, or smell during the climb or alignment) could sharpen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory, cloud-sea, and cobalt glass portico are vivid, coherent, and tightly integrated into action and theme. The environment actively shapes events—the storm threatens the spire, the portico’s filter reveals the third path—and the final contrast of cobalt blue to gold sunlight reweights the entire piece. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the world’s rules feel internally consistent for this mode. Setting directly charges the closure image, lifting this near the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shore and “feral loft beneath the dunes” are rendered with precise, atmospheric detail—the porthole’s stripe of light, the sighing timbers, the marram grass and foghorn all feel lived-in and sensorially rich. Setting is not merely decorative: the environment supplies the raw material for his art and directly composes the “symphony of the shore,” and the final seashell on the box charges the last image. The world’s rules (capturing and replaying sound) are conveyed through action rather than exposition. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment influences meaning and mood more than it constrains concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina, lighthouse, and crypt are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail; the opening image of “stained-glass” ice floes and the groaning pack immediately sets a charged, alien atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: the environment literally sings, transmits the hostile frequency, and makes Elara’s work legible. The Siren’s Heart chamber and the key-console mechanism function as micro-settings that constrain her options and shape how she can respond. The final return to the quiet marina under violet dusk gives the place a reweighted stillness that feels earned by the ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and rain-slick viaduct are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through her technical and emotional priorities. Environment meaningfully constrains the plot: the post-rain sheen and ice-stilled world are required for the optical/gravitational effect that weakens the network. Weather and architecture also mirror tone without feeling merely symbolic, culminating in the hum’s absence against the frozen quiet. It stops short of the very top band because we rarely see her physically navigate or be impeded by the space; she mostly observes it.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly realized—“wet earth and cold iron,” brick-lined passage, high-water mark, and the rumbling active line above all feel tactile and purposeful. Setting is not decorative: the post-drought flooding reveals Finch and the lantern, and the reverberating train literally triggers the second, stronger wave of entangled memory. The lantern functions as an object-as-setting, a charged tool whose history and physical presence shape perception and the final image. The only ceiling is that the environment constrains emotion and perception more than it forces hard tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The shop is vividly rendered—the “vibrant hush,” dust motes, brass, and mahogany feel tactile and specific, and the storm-lit street outside echoes the thematic light-through-darkness. The environment is filtered through Arthur’s sensibility, contrasting penitentiary cacophony with this charged quiet. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, the tools and objects (music boxes, locket, heart) are thematically inseparable from the story’s premise. The final image of sunlight flooding the shop ties atmosphere directly into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The acid sea, floating gears-and-cogs workshop, twin suns, and cobbled glider parts are sharply drawn and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s practical, tinkering eye. The environment genuinely constrains action—the lethal sea and corroded launch platform make his test a real risk, and the final image of hanging over toxic waters charges the “grip” with tension. World rules feel coherent for this slipstream/ SF setting, revealed by use rather than exposition dumps. A slightly wider sensory palette beyond visual/aural (e.g., smell of acid, corrosion on skin) could have deepened embodiment, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The social network archive as a “silent city” and the deeper “Void” give a strong atmospheric frame that’s specific to this premise, and the Seraphim-7 patch functions as a charged micro-setting object. Environment and tools (legacy stacks, error logs, coordinates) are integrated into action rather than feeling like exposition. Sensory detail leans heavily visual/conceptual with limited tactile/aural texture beyond a few nice touches (“server noise,” “silver threads cool against her skin”). The world is compelling but could feel even more embodied and constraining in the key tense beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse orchard above grinding ice floes is vivid, distinctive, and woven into the stakes via the snapped anchor-line and memory of prior deaths. The interior “vintage store” of salvaged objects, especially the cheval mirror, is textured yet efficient rather than touristic. Weather and cold are present but not over-labored, and the setting’s isolation reinforces the sense of a fragile sanctuary. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain each micro-choice, it does meaningfully charge the premise and final image of shared breath in the frigid air.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly realized—salt and diesel in the air, yachts “like broken toys,” “bruised apricot” light—and always filtered through Elara’s perception rather than feeling like a catalog. Environment is not just backdrop: the ice’s calving and its sound literally provide the lesson she came to learn and charge the final image. The parasol tip as micro-setting object also meaningfully charges the middle and end. Description is lush but generally purposeful, and the world’s rules and physicality stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the amber pavilion, bus station, autumn light, and specific grape varietals all feel lived-in and filtered through Elias’s expertise. Environmental details (the cypress shade, sun needs of Mourvedre vs. Grenache, the cold night coming) are not postcard filler but active metaphoric machinery that shapes his thinking and charges the final image. The vineyard’s seasonal shift and the pavilion’s glow directly inflect the thematic work on endings and preservation. The only reason this doesn’t hit a perfect mark is that the physical environment doesn’t materially constrain his options, functioning more as charged canvas than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the murmuring pavilion of whispers versus the stark, bleaching dunes and the cool, intricate parapet below all mirror the theme of noise versus silence. Details such as the sun-bleached rib marker, interlocking rings, and obsidian lenses are specific and integrated into action, not just decorative. Environmental features meaningfully shape tactics (walking the unseen line, spiral pacing, descent, the hidden machine) and charge the final image of a hidden clearing under the sand. The world rules feel consistent, though the parapet’s operation is more mystical than constrained, which slightly softens environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lavender field against rusted factory ruins, the slag heap turned park, and the clean creek form a vivid, textured environment that strongly mirrors and amplifies the story’s emotional trajectory. Setting details are specific and sensorial (scent of lavender, coal smoke memory, vines on brick-and-steel bones). The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the healed landscape and overgrown factory echo the town’s recovery—even if it doesn’t literally constrain choices. Integration of place into theme and mood is unusually strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The library is vividly evoked—the “shadowed” stacks, Isfahan rug, Bohemian glass, and dead presses create a palpable, almost sacral atmosphere. Details are selectively chosen and filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a scholar and curator, supporting the tone of a “finished world.” The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but the chandelier and its crystal meaningfully charge both the inciting incident and the final image. Overall, the setting feels integral to mood and theme, if not to moment-by-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The junkyard and especially the fog sculpture garden are richly rendered through multiple senses and strongly filtered through Silas’s purpose, avoiding “museum tour” description. The environment meaningfully constrains and charges choice: the fog amplifies echoes, the driftwood markers shape his path, and the altar-like basalt slab plus damp air directly frame the chalk circle finale. The final image of the chalk circle blurring in wet fog perfectly fuses setting with theme and cost (transience, inability to hold onto time). A minor expansion of how the physical environment might further impede or assist him tactically, not just symbolically, would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar observatory is vividly realized—“highest cupola,” “sea of bruised clouds,” the grand portal, and the visible moon—and details are filtered through Elias’s professional, patient gaze. Setting is not decorative: the moon’s constant pull and zenith timing directly shape the problem and the solution, and the cracking window and vibrations materially pressure the choice-window. The central objects (clock, lens, portal) function as both tools and charged micro-settings that constrain action at the climax. The final image of the motionless hand pointing at the moon is strongly environment-charged, giving the piece a memorable spatial and atmospheric stamp.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Eyrie above the cloud sea, oxygen-rich air, oolong steam, and ozone form a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this story. Setting is tightly integrated into the tone and thematic work, especially the “radiant haven above the clouds” as a liminal space between worlds. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices—it’s more a beautiful container than an active pressure on tactics. The sensory palette is nonetheless strong and purposeful, particularly in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory on a floating rock, “star-dusted velvet of the void,” brass automaton, and projection wall are vivid, distinctive, and consistently filtered through Elara’s scholarly perspective. Setting details (runic chestplate, crystalline eyes, the pedestal with the key) are tightly linked to action rather than postcard description. The environment effectively charges the final image of the island and its folded shadow, tying cosmic scale to her isolated vantage. The world’s altered rules are conveyed economically through setting rather than lore-dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The hedge maze and secret garden create a vivid, emotionally charged micro-world that suits the story’s liminal mood. Objects like the trowel, oak table, and especially the tooth are well integrated into action, not just described. The maze/garden does more atmospheric than constraining work—it doesn’t strongly shape his choices—but it does deepen the sense of entering Elara’s “world.” Overall specificity and tone are strong without lapsing into touristy cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, salt, and stone are vividly and economically rendered; sensory detail is selective and strongly filtered through Elara’s priorities as an observer of light. The environment actively shapes the story: mist occludes her celestial vocation, the grotto offers solitude and focus, and its curving walls ultimately catch and reflect the new light. The sea glass and grotto walls serve as charged micro-settings in the final image, reconfiguring the space from confinement to embrace. World rules are consistent and unobtrusive, and description rarely feels like static postcarding.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned server farm turned moss garden is richly sensory (sound as “honeyed hush,” damp earth, moss texture) and consistently filtered through Elara’s priorities. Setting is not wallpaper: the dead racks as “cold steel skeletons,” rust as substrate for moss, and the drip-formed pattern on slate all mirror and enable the thematic move from failure to regenerative growth. The environment also practically gives her the metaphor and method she uses to reach Kaelen, charging the final image of “new life growing on old failures.” This is very close to 9-band; the only limiter is that the setting constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “feral nexus” and mist are vividly rendered and thematically apt, with details like damp earth and gnarled roots grounding the abstraction. The shell functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his choice—he must decide whether to cling to or bury it, and it charges the final image. The transition back to the worn wood of his desk is clear and satisfying, recontextualizing the earlier liminal space. Atmosphere supports theme without over-explaining, maintaining a consistent, tactile strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The verdant arbor, the latticed roof, the harvest moon, and the first ray of dawn are vividly rendered and integral to the ritual’s mechanics and mood. The setting is not a backdrop but a constraint and resource: the cultivated vine, ancient central post, and celestial alignment are required for the act to work and charge the final silence. Sensory specificity and integrated worldbuilding are strong without becoming touristic or over-dense.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly and specifically rendered and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s work (twigs, rust, pebbles as tools). Environment and objects are not just backdrop; they literally supply the materials and mood of his alchemy, and the cold shapes his body’s experience. The contrast between this desolate crater and the distant, unseen city charges the final image of isolation and duty. World rules—starlight harvesting, flash paper, crater setting—stay internally consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble cavern, fissure of light, and reflective surfaces are vivid, sensorially grounded, and tightly integrated with the mechanism’s logic. Setting is not backdrop: the geometry and materials directly determine the timer’s function and Elian’s method, and the final image (golden light on stone with music) is charged by that established environment. Details are economical yet specific—spun silver, quartz, velvet cloth—filtered through the locksmith’s professional gaze. The world rules (echoes in stone, light as tuner) remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bronze grotto, drilled starlight, and mosaic of stones are richly evoked and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s function and constraints; this never feels like postcard description. The starlight through the rock actively shapes tactics (he must align the burner to a specific star), and the grotto is both workshop and prison. The final image of the stone settling into the mosaic is deeply charged by earlier environmental detail. Setting earns its keep at both atmospheric and structural levels.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The loft, rain, skylight, and gas stove are not decorative; they shape tone and action, with the kettle as both environmental and temporal constraint. Sensory layering is excellent (sound of rain and kettle, scent of chamomile and ash, warmth of the mug and coolness of wood), all filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting subtly mirrors and modulates her inner state (storm → whisper; scream of kettle → deeper silence). The ash block and kettle function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The kinetic lagoon, Grand Carousel, and energized mist create a vivid, distinctive atmosphere that feels integral to the premise of a world whose motion has stopped. Details like “sound congealed like amber” and crystallized condensation are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. While the environment does not strongly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully mirrors and charges the internal stillness vs motion theme and the final stasis. World rules (stopped world, lingering kinetic lagoon, frozen sound) are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport layered with carnival residue is vivid and specific (“old ozone and new popcorn,” confetti, greasy napkins), and the building-within-a-building grid directly shapes Elara’s tactics. The environment provides both constraint (decommissioned core, hidden conduits) and resources (carnival generators) and culminates in the star-chart ceiling, which powerfully charges the final image. Description is economical and filtered through Elara’s technical-professional lens, integrating setting with action rather than pausing for touristic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sanctuary, forecourt, and weather are rendered with exceptional sensory specificity—“petrichor nostalgia,” “crystal whispering forecourt,” droplets holding “shards of nascent sunlight.” Setting is not postcard; the glacial hush and after-rain air visibly constrain behavior and mood and culminate in the sunlight striking the bells. The environment functions as both container and counterpoint to his buried dream, charging the final image. Spatial and temporal anchors are always clear despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight barge canal, the dismantled bridge, the punt, the mud—all feel tactile and specific, and they’re integrated into action rather than sitting as backdrop. The micro-setting constrains tactics (he must pole, then grapple; the box emerges from silt) and the radio’s silence at dawn charges the final beat. The sundial as object-setting is strongly reprised to frame the thematic turn. Atmosphere and environment are tightly tied to mood and meaning without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: the snow-powdered Golden Dock, the muffled tide, and the invading fog all shape the story’s liminal, listening mood. The fog’s arrival and recession frame the window in which this work can happen, so environment isn’t just wallpaper. Tools and objects (dock, rope, fulgurite, journal) are handled in tactile ways that reflect Elias’s priorities. The harbor’s re-emergence at the end charges the closure image with the sense of a ritual completed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shadowed autumn garden, the sealed island, and the palace hall are rendered with rich, multi-sensory specificity that is consistently filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility. The garden and thread frame and charge the final image, and the physicality of the loom and hall during projection feels tactile and lived-in. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes mood and the conceptual stakes, and the recurring objects (thread, loom, carpet) meaningfully carry thematic weight into the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich and specific: a suspended palace hanging from stalactites over a chasm-city of gears and pistons, the Grand Orrery turned workshop, the geothermal-vent incubator. These environmental details are not mere backdrop; they thematically and visually charge the final moment when the hybrid song makes the machinery below falter. World rules (a fully mechanized environment that has extinguished organic life) remain consistent and meaningfully constrain what’s possible. The prose occasionally luxuriates in description, but the atmosphere supports the story’s ambitions rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, conservatory, and banyan are all sensorially concrete and thematically aligned without feeling like a tourist catalogue. The environment shapes perception and tone at every stage—the lagoon as “church,” the conservatory as threatened legacy, the blackened soil receiving the coin—and recurring objects (sand, thread, obsidian water) decisively charge the final image. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s dual identity as firefighter and heir to fire, giving a strong perceptual signature. The world feels fully realized for this length without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains and the Orrery are vividly imagined, with details (dry basins as “gaping, voiceless mouth[s],” the shattered dome’s oculus, saline flats with geese) doing double duty as atmosphere and mechanism. Environment and object-as-setting decisively constrain tactics: she must use the specific pedestal, the oculus, and the passing of the Locksmith’s Eye to act at all. The setting charges the final image—the whispering fountains and departing geese reconfigure the city’s entire emotional weather—making the world itself feel altered by her choice. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, fully integrated with goal and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered as “silent, swirling color” and “gossamer veils,” and the setting feels integral to tone and theme rather than generic space wallpaper. The cosmology of cosmic husbandry and star nurseries is internally consistent and filtered through Xylar’s sensibility. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices—it is more emotional/lyric backdrop than a pressure source. The final blooming image recharges the garden motif nicely, but still as metaphor rather than as a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse, weather, and migration are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility (“vines…like skeletal fingers,” butterflies as “flickering embers”). Environment and recurring objects (greenhouse, slate, ribbons, butterflies, storm) actively charge the emotional arc: the storm coinciding with his breakthrough and his decision to leave the stone “among the living, growing things” knit setting into the closure. The micro-setting (bench, tools, glass, scents) feels lived-in and functional rather than touristic. The only reason this doesn’t edge higher is that the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than literal options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The belfry and its mechanism, as well as the tidal obsidian ridge, are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail (salt spray, gear oil, black rock) filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional priorities. The environment is not backdrop: the pendulum’s pause constrains the ritual’s timing, and the ridge functions as a mental setting whose danger and sharpness mirror the old wound. Recurring objects (clockwork, pendulum bob, rake handle) are integrated into the spatial sense of the tower and charge the final image of resumed motion. The world feels narrow but deep, appropriately scaled to the story’s focus.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are standout strengths: the cemetery, cobalt silo, “velveteen gloom,” and tactile workspace are all vivid, specific, and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, especially the refigured gloom and the stars above the silo, even if it doesn’t heavily constrain physical options. Sensory detail (smell of dry earth, old cloth, cool still air) is well balanced and never feels like a tourist catalog. The only thing keeping this just below the top band is that the setting mainly supports mood rather than concretely shaping choices.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: obsidian spire, milk-colored sky, frozen lake, and the humming analytical engine all mirror and pressure the stakes of stasis vs transformation. Details are selectively filtered through Kaelen’s professional lens (ice as “unwritten page,” engine as river deltas of futures) and recur meaningfully, especially the kingfisher quill in the final image. The environment and objects constrain choice: encroaching ice forecloses easy options, the spire’s isolation concentrates the decision, and the quill functions as a charged micro-setting in his hand. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical cold or height at the climax could have further bound body to place.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and tightly integrated: the “ember alcove,” mist, and radio glow all filter through Elias’s sensibility and mood. The shortwave’s green light doesn’t just decorate; it literally reveals the luminous ink and charges the final image of constellations and dust. World rules around the story famine and outlawed culture are consistent and learned through his habits rather than info-dump. The environment shapes tone and final resonance, even if it doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, Kiln Room, and Stillness Room are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s professional sensibility, creating a cohesive, haunted atmosphere. Setting objects—the mask, the urn, the rocking chair—are concrete and symbolically charged, with the rocking chair and sunlit dust directly constraining the timing and shape of the final act. Detail is economical but specific (charcoal dust, scorched brick), and the environment consistently mirrors and intensifies the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sewer “grand gallery,” dripping water, sediment layers, and drowned city above are vivid and tightly filtered through Silas’s sensibility as a rational scavenger. The environment is not postcard dressing: living below the “Sun-Kissed” shores and sifting strata of waste directly shapes his tactics and worldview. The cog, cistern, and velvet-lined box together act as a charged micro-setting in the final image. A slightly broader sense of the surface world’s daily life could add scale, but for this slice the atmosphere is rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the “velvet library,” autumn outside, and the smell of “old paper and dry leaves” all mirror Elias’s concern with vanishing arts and decaying community. The rosette functions as a micro-setting object that charges both his realization and the rehearsal demonstration. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear, and the move from library to rehearsal hall is legible. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it meaningfully shapes mood and thematic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted greenhouse and arboretum ruins are vivid and tonally precise, from the “metal skeleton sighing” to the broken panes admitting moonlight. Setting is nicely integrated into action—the greenhouse as “operating theater” and the celestial alignment as surgical lamp—which charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with good use of sound and visual decay to mirror the culture’s state. The environment, however, mostly frames rather than truly constrains tactics; Elias could do similar work in almost any controlled space with access to the light.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich: ozone and pollen, “nectar dusk,” the humming silence of a disabled city, and the tower arcing against a purple sky create a coherent atmosphere. Details like the ration line and the Great Hive root the speculative premise without over-explaining. The environment aligns with theme—the industrialized hive replacing a destroyed organic one—but mainly as backdrop rather than a tight constraint on choices. Still, the closing image of the tower and sky clearly charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: “streetlights daydreamed,” “bruised lavender” sky, salt and mud smells, and the sterile rock garden all mirror the theme of numbed versus messy life. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s bias—she notices greys, curtains, and lawn perfection because they threaten what she values. The orris shard, bay, and suburban facades all recur to charge the final sense of disruption, even if the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices. It’s vivid, atmospheric, and integrated, just shy of using place as an active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater city garden is vividly and economically rendered, with bioluminescent flora, crushed pearl paths, and the gill-lung not just decorative but central to the ethical choice. Setting details are filtered through Mara’s shifting understanding, so the environment’s meaning changes as she learns (from “tomb to hubris” to “cradle of life”). The physical environment constrains and charges her options (where to break the ampoule, where to bury it). The final image of the brightening vine on the statue’s shoulder effectively fuses setting and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite staircase is sharply evoked—sterile air, indistinguishable steps—and its sameness functions as both constraint and thematic backdrop. Setting rules (infinite, directionless, self-consistent) are clear and honored, and the environment directly shapes what tactics are possible. The sensory work in the rupture—rain on asphalt, damp chill—contrasts effectively with the sterile stairs and heightens the emotional pivot. A touch more tactile interaction with the steps or physical strain of “unmeasured age” spent climbing/scribing could further deepen embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse over a smog-choked city is sharply drawn and thematically apt—clean, humid air above a suffocated metropolis. Moonlight, plants, smog, and the canyon of towers all function as more than ornament, shaping mood and plausibility of his projection. The moonlight and glasshouse meaningfully charge the final image of illuminated symbols and answering windows. A slight bias toward visual detail over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto city, frozen cataract, phosphorescent moss, and communal oven are vivid and specific, filtered through Alistair’s sensibility as a guide and exile. Setting actively constrains and enables choices: the frozen waterfall is both shield and threat, the acoustics and ice structure make resonance-based thaw plausible, and the dimming moss heightens urgency. The emerald lens functions as a tool-as-setting, modulating what he can see (stress fractures) and thus how he acts, and it charges the final image. A slight expansion of how sound behaves in the cavern under pressure could deepen the sense of physical constraint, but as is, the atmosphere is rich and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse on a settling granite foundation, the low tide exposing “bones of a forgotten leviathan,” and the ozone-and-brass workshop form a richly specific, coherent environment. Detail selection feels POV-driven, tied to a clockmaker’s attention to mechanism and timing, and the low tide concretely constrains when he can attempt this act. Objects-as-setting (the hunger stone, the yoyo) are integrated into both atmosphere and function, then recharged at the end as the machine activates. The setting doesn’t merely decorate; it charges tone and plausibly shapes the timing of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The funhouse and carnival detritus are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail (“ghosts of sugar and rust,” sagging pendulums, warped slide) that feel lived-in rather than ornamental. Setting elements directly shape action and choice: the slide brings him into the “rot-eaten heart,” and the carousel of mirrors structures the confrontation. The luminance integrated into the environment reinforces both mood and mechanics of Fear’s feeding. This is very strong atmosphere with functional grounding; pushing one environmental constraint even harder at the climax would be the only route to higher.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, original, and deeply integrated: an apple orchard on a driftwood ring in open sea, with the cedar spine and storm-weathered wood directly mediating his magic. Sensory detail is rich but purposeful—the scent of salt and blossoms, the groaning timbers, the feel of spray—anchoring both mood and stakes. The environment meaningfully constrains choices: the raft’s fragility and interconnected wood make his resonant strikes plausible and consequential. The final image of “ancient timbers humming with the memory of the storm's song” strongly recharges the world as living instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The world-building is vivid and economical: drifting turtle-shell districts, the washed-out twin suns, the sealed Sea-Gate, and the needle-thin watchers all feel specific and internally consistent. Setting meaningfully constrains options—the city’s drift, the sealed gate, and the physical distance to the watchers make their doom slow and inescapable rather than immediately actionable. Environmental detail is tightly filtered through Kaelen’s sensibility as a cartographer and pattern-reader, so the sensory choices (light, rhythm, movement) reinforce both theme and plot mechanics. The recurring objects-as-setting (tower, whistle, watchers) all charge the final image without lapsing into tour-guide exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Blackwood Terminus is vividly evoked—the ivy-strangled brick, dust in light shafts, cracked tiles—and it establishes a funereal, secretive mood that suits the thematic excavation of buried truth. The ivy in particular is well-used, moving from background detail to metaphor when Aris compares it to suffocating growth. The station itself, however, does not materially constrain action; they could plausibly have this conversation almost anywhere secluded. The setting excels at atmosphere and thematic echo more than at functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marsh, drawbridge, and submerged pavilion are vividly and economically rendered, with tactile sensory detail (“brackish water,” “skeletal dome,” “marsh mist”). Setting meaningfully constrains options: the raised drawbridge enforces solitude, the water’s depth and currents threaten the inkwell, and the pavilion fissure enables his method. The environment reflects his inner life without feeling schematic, especially the image of the pavilion as a “skeletal hand” of drowned memory. The inkwell as a charged object-as-setting in the final hut scene helps power the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater library is richly and economically realized—hydrospheric generators, biolamps, phosphorescent moss, saline-treated paper, and the dome’s dripping condensation all feel lived-in and specific. Setting constraints directly affect tactics (power loss forcing use of moss light; salt-sealed desk; the city’s pressure mirrored in his inner calm). The dome and ocean-depth imagery charge the final sense of peace and burden. World rules are consistent and integrated through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating isles, crystalline staircase, tea garden, and glass basilica are vividly rendered and filtered through Kaelen’s grief, with strong, purposeful specificity (e.g., lantern “skeletons,” the basilica refracting aether). Environment is not mere backdrop: the staircase’s paradoxical physics mirrors his interior descent, and the tea garden’s reprise at the end charges the final image. The basilica as a glass vessel that becomes Elara’s dream directly shapes the climax. Setting meaningfully supports tone and theme without overexplaining its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, capacitor bank, viewport, and coolant systems are vividly realized and consistently tied to Amal’s priorities, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. The space setting and the geode work as environmental/micro-setting anchors that constrain her options (the cooling window, the isolation) and charge the final image. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the serene Earth-as-lie image deepens the atmosphere without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient observatory, brass-and-stone dome, mountaintop dusk, and star-beam through a hidden lens are all vivid and sensorially grounded, with good integration of tools (console, Nighthawk, chip) into action. Environment is not postcard backdrop but an active mechanism: the dome’s hidden iris, Lyra’s position, and the lens geometry literally enable the climax. Details are filtered through Elara’s technical/professional gaze, supporting tone and worldbuilding without overexplaining. This integration of setting into plot and final image is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt terrace, bruised-purple dusk, and bone-sandpaper waves create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that strongly supports the tone. The shore and driftwood are not just scenic; they’re tactically used as his method of searching for Anya and directly produce the revelation. Objects-as-setting (watch hand, driftwood, gouged oak) are integrated and charge the final image. The environment doesn’t much constrain options or tactics beyond hosting the method, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Watcher’s Spire, the mist, and the “churning grey sea” are vividly realized and tightly bound to the idea of exposed neutrality and liminality. Environmental details (“too high and too exposed for treachery,” mist swallowing the lands) deepen both atmosphere and the theme of precarious trust. The recurring brass drawer pull functions as a micro-setting object, charged with history and resurfacing in the final image. While the setting doesn’t force tactical improvisation in the moment, it consistently shapes tone and the logic of why these characters can even risk this exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, sensorial, and filtered through a mariner’s bias: utility poles vs. celestial sphere, salt and low tide as “accusation,” the kayak launch as both mundane and charged. The environment constrains choice—landbound poles as a temporary navigation system, shoreline as liminal threshold—and evolves meaningfully when he passes the last pole and steps onto sand. The astronomical compass functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Description is purposeful rather than touristic, with only minor flirtation with overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings—from the Cinderwood Barrens fissure to the “cathedral-like” bioluminescent cavern—are vividly drawn with selective, purposeful detail that mirrors his inner state. The underground lake and its “delicately robust” ecosystem charge the climax and final realization, giving the thematic turn a concrete visual anchor. Environmental specifics (wet stone smell, damp air, narrowing tunnel) are filtered through his wary, half-numb perception rather than reading like a neutral tour. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond requiring descent and discovery, it meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit orchard, silver trees, and strange beasts are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elian’s state, and the environment clearly charges the final image (“a function of this sacred place, a cosmic intimacy made manifest”). The setting is not just a backdrop: the permanent moonlight and witnessing creatures become part of the metaphysical bond they inhabit. Details like zero-gravity star anise and nebula-eyed sloths feel fresh without becoming a catalog. The world’s rules are suggestive but coherent for this length, though one constraint-driven interaction with the setting could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The midnight glade above the clouds, phosphorescent moss, and visible constellations are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s heightened, anxious perception. Setting and small objects (cloak, saucer, linen, pen) carry atmospheric and thematic weight and charge the final images. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her tactical options, but it does frame her act of repentance as something liminal and consequential. Specific sensory cues (thin air, ozone, silver light) keep it from feeling like generic fantasy scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Scrap-Ark and command deck are vivid and purposeful, with details like grated deck plates, groaning metal, and microgravity tied directly to Elara’s emotional state and actions. Objects-as-setting (Kwan Yin’s Tear, the photographs, the needle and spun starlight) do heavy lifting in anchoring atmosphere and charging the final image. The “twilight of humanity” context infuses the space with palpable stillness and scale without over-naming lore. One could imagine the same ritual in another liminal site, but the specific spaceship salvage aesthetic adds meaningful texture and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: black volcanic sand, obsidian grains, basalt circle, glowing steam from the peak, and the planetary alignment all cohere into an atmospheric whole. Environment and objects genuinely shape the story—without the hidden alcove, tidal pool, and glyphs mirroring the sky, there is no ritual stage or closure image. Details are filtered through Kael’s sensibility, emphasizing light, texture, and quiet power rather than postcard cataloguing. The final contrast of the volcano’s new, steady heartbeat against the cooling sand ties setting directly into the story’s emotional and thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The luminous fort, phosphorescent walls, and blackout city are vivid, specific, and tightly tied to the plot: the bioluminescent infrastructure literally carries Kael’s signal. The half-painted sundial, algae-seeded walls, and flickering window-nodes all function as tools and constraints, not just scenery, and the final image of patterned lights reweights the setting meaningfully. Sensory focus is primarily visual but purposeful and filtered through Kael’s tactical gaze. World rules (luminous foundations as network) are implied through action rather than infodump.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frictionless world, basalt bluff, aurora, and eel pen are all vivid and integrated, with details like magnetic boots and sliding sea clearly shaping action. World rules (no friction, localized gravity from dust) are consistent and dramatized rather than lectured. The environment directly constrains options and enables the solution via the aurora and the spiral circuit, and the final image of the fading aurora/dawn is thematically charged. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond the visual could deepen immediacy, but the atmosphere is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory “skull,” storm sea of clouds, and dead telescope-eye are striking, coherent images that evolve with the story. Setting constrains and charges choices: the altitude and isolation make this a plausible vigil site; the key fits the locked control panel; the receding storm and single city light serve as a charged final reorientation. Details are purposefully filtered through his artistic, wound-obsessed gaze, avoiding tourist cataloging. This is very close to top-tier; an even stronger sense of how the physical space would change once he uses the key would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glass atrium, quiet brook, sundial, and mechanical arm create a strong, coherent atmosphere with vivid, selective detail; the space feels physical and particular. Setting is well integrated into action—the sundial isn’t backdrop but puzzle-key, the light through glass matters for reflections, and the environment supports the tone of contained ritual. The micro-objects (needle card, rapier, mechanical arm) function as quasi-setting and tools, shaping his tactics. The brook and wider world feel more decorative than constraining, preventing this from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined library and “dead sector” are rendered with economical, striking images (“rusted girders clawing at a ceiling of cold, indifferent stars”) that clearly anchor where and what kind of world we are in. Setting is not mere backdrop: the skeletal library defines their task, draws the drifters by rumor, and furnishes the books that constitute both their labor and their rebellion. The moon and rusted dome return in the final image to charge the sense of fragile community under a hostile sky. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices, it consistently shapes tone, premise, and their available form of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds, lightwood, vapor ocean, and shimmering doorway are richly rendered with strong visual and tonal specificity. Setting is integrated into action—the arbor’s strange physics enable his musical “attack” on reality—but mostly as a permissive backdrop rather than an active constraint on options. Sensory detail is dominated by sight and sound yet feels purposeful given the pianist focalizer. The recurring objects (piano, clock, compasses) help charge the final image, though the environment itself could slightly more directly pressure his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The island ridge, sky-plume blossoms, and incoming monsoon are vividly realized and filtered through Elara’s priorities. The setting does real work: the ridge’s height and bloom mark it as the key site, and the monsoon’s approach constrains timing and charges each sensory detail. The blossoms’ color and movement reappear at the end, deepening the sense that environment and memory are intertwined. A minor limit is that the ridge itself, while evocative, could press back a little more concretely on Elara’s tactics beyond being the “highest point.”

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The islet, squall-cleansed air, juniper, cottage, and granite bluff are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Kenji’s perspective. Weather and environment actively matter: the tide/wind interaction is literally the trigger for the ritual, and the bluff, sea, and “cerulean” sky charge the final image. Objects as micro-setting (compass, bonsai shears, lace) are anchored in space and meaningfully constrain or enable his choices. Description is lush but still purposeful, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting acts effectively as both antagonist and catalyst, with sensory details like the "smell of rot" and "suffocating" humidity creating tangible pressure. The dust-coated polycarbonate pane serves as a brilliant micro-setting/tool that constrains the view and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the canyon's specific features (frost, light) drive the discovery. Sensory details are vivid ("blackened brick," "sentinel rock"), though occasionally the description slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is integrated beautifully; the "winterglass" serves as the literal score and canvas for the protagonist's light projection. The contrast between the frozen exterior and the humid, light-filled interior creates a strong sensory constraint that shapes the action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater library is evocative, with details like "shelves carved from basalt" successfully establishing a somber, mythic atmosphere.

The sensory details—light striking edges, the hum of the train—effectively ground the abstract concept of silence, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, blending "blooming metallophytes" and "sonic architecture" to successfully evoke the futuristic nostalgia tone. The "Palimpsest Pillar" is a strong, concrete locus for the scene's action that grounds the history-layering theme.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "ashen charcoal sanctuary" is rendered with vivid, tactile specificity that mirrors the thematic focus on ruin and regrowth. The setting acts as a constraint, grounding the magical ritual in physical residue (ash, cold iron) rather than abstract mana.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "Time of Manifestation" is established with visceral specificity, particularly the "viscous Debt" and the bioluminescent fungal cavern. The setting rules are integrated well, creating an atmosphere that actively pressures the characters rather than serving as a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The physical props—the moon globe, the hollow pedestal, and the crank—are specific and tactile, grounding the scene well. However, the lighting ("golden shadows," "sepia") leans toward generic atmosphere, and the setting description occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "factually mystical" setting is realized with exceptional sensory specificity; images like "bells of solid sound" and "liquid moonlight" are vivid and original. The environment functions effectively as an antagonist, pressuring the protagonist’s choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory details like "binder's glue" and the "sharp, clean line" in the dust effectively ground the scene. The setting actively provides the clues for the narrative turn, though some descriptors ("heavy blanket") are generic.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "puddle map" relying on light reflections is a brilliant, specific sensory detail that grounds the setting. However, the use of "permacrete" (a Star Wars loan-word) and generic "patrol drones" leans too heavily on sci-fi defaults.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the prism and fungi act as active tools in the resolution rather than static backdrop. Sensory details like "stone teeth" and "pearlescent mist" effectively ground the surreal concept in specific textures.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with evocative, if slightly precious, sensory details ("ashen skyborne arbor," "twisted root hairs"). While the atmosphere is cohesive, the world operates more as a static backdrop for the fable than a source of physical constraints or pressure. The environment is visually distinct but lacks tactile resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is a strength, with specific sensory details like the "hardened pine sap" and "glittering black rock" grounding the fable-like tone. The setting of the greenhouse and subterranean cavern is vividly rendered, though the "collapsing cathedral of glass" leans slightly into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.7)
    The foundry atmosphere is tactile and vivid ("wet metal," "quenched coal"), establishing a strong mood. However, the "colored flames" sequence feels slightly artificial, and the "solitary spire of defiance" metaphor is visually overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    The acoustic nature of the gorge and the "mangled music" provide a distinct, atmospheric backdrop that grounds the magic system. However, the setting functions primarily as a passive stage for the action rather than an active pressure cooker that constrains Silas's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The integration of the proprioceptive enhancement into the setting description is excellent; details like "micro-gram accuracy" and the "velvet" texture of moss ground the abstract sci-fi elements in immediate physical sensation. The environment and body act as constraints that shape the narrative experience, satisfying the criteria for a high score. The setting is not just a backdrop but a filter through which the character processes reality.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of the alchemist's market is vividly rendered with sensory details like "caged echoes" and "smell of linseed oil." The specificity of the painting ("reef... like a broken tooth") anchors the ethereal tone effectively. The environment supports the magical realism genre well.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is strong, utilizing specific sensory details like the "phantom smell of popcorn" and the "furry grey blanket" of dust to ground the scene. The setting actively supports the mood, though the "clowns with fissures" imagery leans slightly into standard abandoned-carnival tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot, with the "glass orchard" and "pane of glass" providing the specific medium for the frost-based climax. The atmosphere of "static perfection" is palpable and successfully contrasts with the chaotic beauty of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively blending the "baroque excess" of the asteroid with the sci-fi concept of visible time ("starship blooming like a metal flower"). The environment successfully pressures the protagonist to act (covering mirrors), grounding the high-concept elements in tangible behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like "polished brass" and the "metallic tang of decay" ground the fable-like setting effectively. However, the workshop and the "covenant of rust" lean on standard steampunk and fantasy tropes without offering a distinct, specific texture that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Sensory details are exquisite and drive the narrative logic; the "rust-colored creek" and "captured aurora" create a vivid, distinct atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist (the dried creek revealing the fissure) and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmosphere is vivid and the setting is well-anchored, though descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("stony embrace," "full-throated roar"). The sensory details of the lantern and wood are tactile and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric detail is lush and specific ("bruised sky," "leaden lines"), establishing a distinct mood. The etched glass mechanism is a strong, tangible focal point that integrates well with the light/color filters, though the "amber pavilion" feels slightly disconnected from the core action compared to the cathedral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dual setting—the sterile, brass-toned zeppelin and the searing, high-contrast lagoon—creates a functional psychic distance. The beach debris serves as an excellent "micro-setting" (see rubric) that constrains Kaelen’s communication options and charges the final image with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory details like the "scent of scorched sugar" and "rough texture of a fisherman's net" are vivid and effectively ground the abstract magic in physical experience. These specific memories do the heavy lifting for the atmosphere, though the opening description leans on broader strokes ("salt-scoured air") before narrowing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory details like the "cloying and funereal" apple blossoms and the "phantom resonance" of the brass effectively ground the supernatural elements in physical reality. The juxtaposition of the serene garden with the industrial/maritime memory creates a textured atmosphere. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "icebound atrium" and "petrified oak" provide vivid, tactile grounding for the abstract metaphysical stakes. Sensory details like "snowflakes on a warm tongue" effectively bridge the gap between the cosmic and the intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "sea of perpetual cloud" and "solstice hush" create a strong, cohesive atmosphere that grounds the fantasy elements. The environment successfully isolates the protagonist, though the "glue" detail feels slightly mundane against the mythic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmosphere is established, but specific details undermine credibility. "Swept drifts of ancient starlight" blurs the line between metaphor and literal action confusingly, and placing the "Perseids" (an Earth-specific meteor shower) in a "forgotten nebula" breaks the internal logic of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like "desiccated hives" and "brittle husks of lavender" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that grounds the fantasy elements. The scorched apiary effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal desolation and constrains the imagery of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, successfully establishing a fable-like post-collapse tone. Details like the "emerald silo" and the "thinning of the light in his own bones" ground the abstract premise in sensory experience. The garage sale items add necessary tactile specificity to the "forgotten numbers" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and establishes a strong atmosphere ("scent of wet earth and brine"), though description often tips into the ornamental. The environment provides props for the protagonist's thoughts rather than genuine constraints that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the concept of "silicon-based life" masquerading as pillars creates a distinct, tactile constraint. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's method (copper wiring) and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the damp earth, the specific "green" bronze, and the "rainwashed tower" create a tangible atmosphere. The fly amber functions as a micro-setting that constrains the final choice and powerfully charges the closing image, meeting the high-band criteria for integration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is excellent, actively constraining the protagonist's actions; the specific interaction between the landscape's needs and the bird calls creates a unique, functional ecosystem. The "dead ocean" is not just a backdrop but the primary antagonist and partner in the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, specific details like "red dust," "geothermal moisture," and "phosphorescent fungi" that enhance the atmosphere. The contrast between the desolate scrapyard and the humid, subterranean garden supports the thematic arc well.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, using specific sensory details like "ozone," "gritty charcoal," and "syrupy waves" to ground the abstract concepts. However, the setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of active constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The visual imagery is vivid and atmospheric ("viridian nebula," "fractured obsidian"), effectively grounding the surreal premise. The setting descriptions are the story's strongest asset, though they occasionally lean into static tableau rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the "whispering gallery" mechanics enable the protagonist’s agency and the prisoner's signal. The obsidian chessboard serves as a potent, functional symbol that anchors the physical space and the thematic conflict simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, with distinct touches like the "petrified wood" and the "glass dome" aviary. However, the "magical labyrinthine library" is a familiar trope, and the environment serves more as a backdrop for introspection than a source of physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    The frozen village setting is vivid and functional, providing a necessary constraint for the protagonist's introspection. The atmosphere of the "woven hush" is palpable and well-integrated with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is integral; the acoustic properties of the bone canyon constrain the protagonist's tools and enable the climax. The "towers of bone" imagery provides a specific, grounded texture to the abstract conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "screaming green tumult" and "acid sea" creating immediate atmospheric pressure. The physical constraints (bathysphere, one breath) effectively narrow the protagonist's focus, though the "floating workshop" outside is established clearly but plays little role in the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, creating a strong sense of place within the cave and oasis. The sensory details ("salt-laced wind," "damp rock") ground the scene well, though the reliance on repetitive adjectives dampens the effect slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse setting is established with some vivid sensory details, particularly the scent and the dawn light. However, the atmosphere often relies on clichéd descriptors ('oppressive fog,' 'held breath') and adjectival stacking rather than specific, constraining environmental interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength, effectively using sensory details like "solid" starlight and the "low moan" of the wind. However, the contradiction in the moon's phase disrupts the visual coherence of the setting and the logic of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the storm is not just atmospheric but a mechanical requirement for the ritual, raising the stakes of the climax. The "hanging orchard" reinforces the precariousness of Elias's mental state, grounding the speculative elements in tactile geography.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like the "opal dock" and "salt-bleached piling" effectively establish a mood of nautical isolation. The atmosphere is consistent, though the lighthouse setting relies on familiar tropes (mist, solitude, gulls) without subverting them.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, from the "sugar crystals on mossy stones" to the "night-blooming jasmine" scent of the cavern. The setting isn't just a backdrop but an atmospheric pressure cooker, although the "rising water" constraint fades slightly into the background once the magical threshold is crossed.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sensory details are vivid ("viscous drops," "cold diamonds") and the grotto functions well as a constraint. The description occasionally leans into "purple" adjective stacking ("brittle prophecy," "looming indifference") which slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting of the Ember Nexus is vividly realized, with sensory details like "crystalline dust" and "vesper crickets" grounding the metaphysical stakes. The environment mirrors the theme of fading energy effectively. The physical props (sphere, nautilus) are handled with tactile specificity that anchors the abstract magical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting anchors the surrealism effectively; the birch bark scroll and charcoal provide excellent tactile constraints that ground the abstract time-slippage. The cabin details are functional, though the "sea of green" and "damp earth" lean toward generic imagery compared to the specificity of the scroll work.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is excellent; the "liquid heartbeats" of the water clocks and the muffling fog effectively mirror Elara’s sensory isolation. The physical environment actively supports the theme of altered perception. The shift from fog to sunlight at the end, while traditional, is executed with earned atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; details like the "moss-slicked stone" and "ocean of silent, blue air" ground the fantasy elements in tactile reality. The setting effectively enhances the isolation needed for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Specific details like "iron gall ink" and the "oscillator" ground the scene well. However, the opening line ("air... was a held breath") is a worn cliché that weakens the immediate atmospheric authority.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric, utilizing high-concept imagery ("polished obsidian," "plenum of resolution") that establishes the tone effectively. The softcover dictionary is a standout specific detail that grounds the abstract environment in tactile reality. While the library itself leans on standard "void" tropes, the interplay between the mundane book and the cosmic silence works well.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the hydraulic nature of the clocks and the glacial water source are not just backdrop but the engine of the conflict. The sensory details ("cathedral of brass," "obsidian razor edges," "fjord quiet") are vivid and specific, creating a palpable atmosphere that supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bioluminescent cavern is evocative and provides a strong functional backdrop for the barrier technology. While the imagery is vivid, the sensory details like "damp earth and ozone" lean on generic tropes for underground energy settings.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The opening library scene is grounded with specific details ("clover pollen," "dog-eared forms"). However, the subway traverse—a crucial part of the setting—is blurred into generic descriptions ("steel veins," "grimy corners") due to the summarized timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospherically distinct and constrains the protagonist's isolation effectively. Details like the "concrete-lined alcove" and "ozone" ground the magical realism in a tangible, sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive setting is rendered with evocative, specific sensory details ("walnut husks," "iron salts"), though the sudden shift to magical realism at the jetty disrupts the established grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the station's specific disrepair (the broken clock) provides the necessary mechanism for the community's formation. Vivid details like the "soft thud of moss" anchor the atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    The sensory details are vivid and specifically tailored to the protagonist's blindness, effectively using texture and vibration ("silverleaf frond," "vibrates softly," "weeping moss"). However, the description occasionally drifts into lists of sensory inputs during the montage section rather than integrating them into urgent action. The "ultrasonic forest" provides a solid atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is atmospheric, with the gravitational anomaly and the station’s silence providing a strong backdrop for the internal drama. Sensory details like the "silence that had weight" and the "exotic nib" effectively ground the reader, though the physics of the time-folding remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.6)
    The setting blends effective specifics (shadow of a crane, waterlogged bench) with generic atmospheric descriptors ("luminous harbor," "rippling sheet of silver"). The environment serves the ritual well, but the reliance on standard "moonlight/water" imagery prevents deeper immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting of the Xylos Archive is rendered with evocative sensory details like "petrified paper" and "dust-choked silence." The environment effectively constrains the protagonist and provides the necessary tools (ancient pigments) for the resolution, integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "sound wave garden" is a vivid, specific setting that functions as both a tool and an atmosphere, integral to the story's resolution. The transformation of the sterile facility into the "auric lagoon" provides a strong sensory anchor, though the "hush of the universe" descriptor leans toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The geomagnetic storm is vividly rendered and functionally integrated, forcing the protagonist to use celestial navigation. The atmosphere of the "dead city" supports the tone well, though some descriptors ("poisoned bruise") lean toward the melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    The specific mechanics of the setting—the "loom" of the shutters and the angle of the gas lamp—are integrated beautifully into the action. The environment is not just a backdrop but the instrument of resolution, creating a distinct and tangible atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "cobalt gloom" and "frozen sea" create a vivid, cohesive mood. The window displays (braided loaf, gear, telescope) are excellent, specific details that ground the abstract rebellion in tangible reality. The setting effectively pressures the mood, though the grotto feels geographically disconnected.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details like the "salt-crusted supply shed" are functional, but the setting largely serves as a backdrop rather than a constraint. The "sublittoral fringe" offers a nice visual, but the world-building regarding the outlawing of conflict feels disconnected from the dockside reality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The auditory contrast between the "percussive thrum" of the turbines and the "remade hush" of the kitchen effectively pressures the protagonist. While the sensory details are functional, they sometimes lean on standard descriptors ("worn oak," "rust" colored tea) rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("polished bone," "milky sentinels"), establishing a strong atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop for the epiphany rather than a source of constraint or friction that forces the character to adapt his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "ash and smoke" world and the "glassblower's courtyard" are established with vivid, sensory-rich details that support the tone. The setting constrains the atmosphere effectively, though the specific mechanics of the "plant language" feel slightly untethered from the physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.7)
    Atmospheric details like "ozone and dust" are effective, but the setting relies on static visual palettes ("golden shadows") and abstract concepts ("nuance of human feeling") rather than interactive constraints. The "laboratory of lost sounds" is a compelling concept, but it functions more as a painted backdrop than a pressure cooker that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "curtains of intention" concept is strongly integrated, creating a setting that actively constrains interaction and visualizes the internal states of the characters. The atmosphere is vivid and supports the story's logic well.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    The juxtaposition of the "rain-beaded glass" with the specific tools (measuring tape, onyx cards) creates a vivid, tactile atmosphere. The physical tools ground the abstract conversation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bronze pagoda and cavern lighting provide solid physical anchors that constrain the focalization. Atmosphere is vivid, though occasionally relies on abstract descriptors ("tomb of wonders") rather than concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "blooming library" concept is vivid, and the contrast between the organic vines and the digital archive is handled well. The specific diagnostic details in the video footage (curling fingers) provide excellent, grounded specificity amidst the more ethereal setting elements.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory details are precise and evocative ("scent of damp earth," "feet making almost no impression"), firmly grounding the reader in the workshop. The setting actively participates in the mood, mirroring the internal shift from fog to clarity, though the "shimmering stillness" leans slightly into adjectival excess.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower setting is rendered with atmospheric precision, utilizing the ivy and the hourglass to anchor abstract concepts in physical space. The “meteor hush” and chemical scents create a visceral sensory baseline. The ivy functions effectively as both a setting detail and a dynamic participant.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the projection booth and the theater itself are vividly rendered and integral to the resolution (the seats absorbing the love). The sensory details ("dust tasted of rust") effectively ground the abstract premise, though some descriptions lean toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "soul-scribe" instrument is a standout element, providing tactile specificity that grounds the abstract psychic conflict. The atmospheric descriptions, while vivid, occasionally lean into generic "visionary" tropes (e.g., "sky bled green and violet") rather than character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is established with evocative precision; the "ghost-pale flora" and "starless sky" create a cohesive, ethereal atmosphere. The chess clock is a standout artifact, grounding the abstract "probabilistic haze" in a concrete symbol of linear time that effectively charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "mechanical rainforest" is vivid and functionally integrated, constraining the protagonist's navigation through specific sensory rules (wind sounds). The setting acts as a true narrative force, with the "crystalline branches" and "metallic loam" grounding the abstract themes in concrete, tactile imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and consistent in its "dreamscape" quality, with details like the kelp ticket adding nice texture. However, the setting relies heavily on standard atmospheric tropes ("mist," "shrouded hills," "twilight") and often feels more allegorical than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "cobalt fortress" and "unused stairwell" act as active constraints that enforce the silence and isolation. The specificity of the "nineteenth step" grounds the abstract memory in concrete geometry, while the "armored-glass" and "sterile safety" reinforce the thematic conflict. The setting feels essential to the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Athenaeum is rendered with vivid, specific details ("petrified wood," "vellum scrolls") that establish a strong, dusty atmosphere. The iron gall ink pellet is a standout tactile object that grounds the magical abstraction. However, the setting remains a static backdrop for the ritual rather than an environment that forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is grounded effectively, contrasting the "sterile white" station with the "vast, indifferent blue" and the vibrant, summoned reef. Sensory details like "fish like shards of stained glass" and the "low thrum" of the station create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that anchors the metaphysical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The juxtaposition of "ferrocrete" and "obsidian monoliths" creates a distinct, atmospheric setting. Specific details like the "scorch marks" and "bruised purple" light ground the scene well, though the description occasionally leans on standard ruin tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the geothermal pool, algae, and ferns are not just scenery but active tools in the resolution. The integration of environmental details (using algal enzymes and thermal currents) into the protagonist's tactics creates vivid, grounded specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is actively utilized as a tool for resolution; the sensory details of the soil and pine resin are not just atmospheric but functional in the protagonist's grounding technique. The contrast between the ancient pine and the modern drone serves the theme well.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("salt-laced dust," "hempen fiber," "charcoal dust"). The setting is not just a backdrop; the lighthouse’s spiral architecture actively informs the protagonist's solution (the map's shape), creating strong integration between environment and action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "wind-carved encampment" and "rust-colored sandstone" create a tactile, vivid environment that contrasts well with the metallic drone. The visual specificity of the ink's "fractal lattices" provides a strong anchor for the magical elements, grounding the abstract in the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with the "echoing library under snow" creating a tangible sense of isolation. Sensory details like the "whisper of ventilation" and "frost-rimmed data-vaults" ground the sci-fi elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sensory specificity is high, with the "silica dunes" and "glass-domed enclosure" creating a vivid, pressurized vessel for the scene. The "airship ballast sandbag" and the knife serve as excellent micro-settings that constrain physical action and guide the narrative. The atmosphere of "engraved quiet" effectively tensions the intrusion of the father's chaotic memory.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "sound wave garden" is a distinct, imaginative environment where physics (crystallized frequencies) meaningfully constrains the protagonist's movement (zigzagging, tapping for hollows). The setting is not just backdrop but an active antagonist and puzzle. Specific sensory details like "frozen harmony" and "muted bass notes" effectively ground the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory setting is integrated masterfully, serving as both a physical location and a thematic mirror for the "orbits of regret." The rotation of the dome, the silence, and the "star-dusted velvet" actively charge the atmosphere, elevating the phone call into something celestial and weighty. The specific prop of the rosewood pen anchors the intellectual argument in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent, with specific details like the "prehistoric gnat" and the sterile server room creating a distinct mood. Some descriptions, however, lean into cliché ("sky the color of a deep bruise").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively utilizing the "grotto" and "mist" to establish a mood of isolation. However, the description leans heavily into purple prose ("lavender-grey shroud," "lilac unease"), and the sensory details often rely on abstract metaphors ("paragraph of loss") rather than concrete, grounding textures that would sharpen the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)

    The alchemical greenhouse is evoked with distinct, if slightly standard, high-fantasy sensory details ("phosphorescence," "mica," "silver-barked"). The setting actively participates in the magic system, though the "mirror world" concept serves primarily as a backdrop for the twilight atmosphere rather than influencing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The library setting is atmospheric but leans on standard tropes ("scent of vellum," "green-shaded lamp"). While the "laundromat facade" is a nice detail, the setting functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is active and distinct, mirroring the theme of decay versus persistence; the "moss ate the marble" and the "petrified bread" are tactile anchors. The environment constrains the action and charges the final image, meeting the high-band criteria for integration.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, establishing a vivid "quartz hush" and a frozen, melancholic world that permeates the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and functional, with sensory details like "phosphorescent kelp" and "brine" grounding the scene. The environment is actively used as an obstacle and resource, integrating well with the plot pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the cave provides the lighting for the puzzle, the code (via the painting), and the ultimate reward (pigments). Sensory details like "selenite spars" and "crystalline hum" ground the scene vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details of the "glass-and-steel bubble" and the "silver-vein fern" effectively ground the story in a specific solarpunk/dystopian mood. The sensory work creates a tangible sense of the "artificial humidity" and "ochre smog," though the vault interior feels slightly more generic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "whispering bluff" and "frozen blues" provide a distinct, atmospheric container for the action, establishing a clear high-fantasy tone. However, the setting cooperates perfectly with the protagonist's goals (the wind arrives exactly when needed) rather than exerting pressure or forcing tactical shifts in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is utilized excellently as both constraint and tool; the magnetic shift acts as a ticking clock, and the crystal formations serve as the mechanism for the climax. Sensory details are sharp ("facets sharp enough to cut light"), grounding the abstract action in a tangible, specific environment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sensory details like the "chipped ceramic mug" are solid, but the "star-shaped depression" feels like a video-game puzzle element inserted into a realistic setting. The atmosphere leans toward the sentimental ("scent of coffee... soured by frustration") rather than the specific.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful; the "aquatic hush" and "pressure against quartz-glass" tangibly reinforce the protagonist's isolation. The environment actively constrains the mood and supports the "sunken" thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt crystal chamber is a vivid, specific environment that successfully grounds the abstract magical elements. The sensory details of the brine and the fracturing light are strong. However, the initial description of gravity fields as "unseen dust motes" is a strained simile that blurs rather than clarifies the spatial reality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting ("nocturnal haven," "quiet brook," "moon-drenched") provides atmospheric wallpaper that aligns perfectly with the character's mood but offers no resistance or constraint. The environment facilitates the ritual rather than pressuring the choices, missing the opportunity for the physical world to force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Althea is realized with distinct, sensory particularity ("grammar of groaning pipes," "chipped plaster") that anchors the premise. The setting effectively functions as a character, grounding the fantastical elements in concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting provides atmosphere but leans on stock "literary" imagery ("velvet garden," "captured starlight") that doesn't uniquely constrain the protagonist's tactics. The "resonance structures" function as a generic plot device rather than a specific, tactile machine that requires skill to operate.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory detail is vivid and specific ("arctic fox fur," "pearl twilight," "iron-gall ink"). The environment actively contributes to the atmosphere, with the dripping stalactites effectively marking time and the cold adding physical texture to the task.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.4)
    Setting details drift into generic fantasy abstractions ("liquid silver," "secret song") without tactile grounding. The "webs of intrigue" are asserted as a concept but never manifested in the environment, leaving the physical space feeling like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    The "breath-hollowed" glacial shrine and the melted snow globe provide distinct, vivid anchoring that grounds the magical elements. However, the dreamscapes feel comparatively generic ("shimmering ocean"), and the sensory details occasionally lean into static description rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid, effectively using the "whispering parapet" and the rain-slicked city to ground the philosophical musings. The imagery of the fireflies as a "living loom" is specific and strong, though descriptions occasionally lean toward the ornamental ("stone arteries").

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong, specific imagery ("stained-glass mosaic," "fractured plains") grounds the speculative elements in a tangible reality. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, with the tower's vibration adding urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The integration of the "wet sheen" on the viaduct with the celestial alignment is excellent, making the physical environment the key to the plot's resolution. Sensory details like the hum and the silence are vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subway tunnel is rendered with specific sensory details ("wet earth and cold iron," "damp silt") that enhance the atmosphere. The setting actively contributes to the discovery (flood waters) and the climax (train vibration).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is visually distinct and the photo-matching mechanism provides concrete imagery, though descriptions lean on clichés ("skeletal fingers"). While the environment is vivid, it functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral; the library's "suspended hush" provides the necessary contrast for the sonic crystal. The crystal itself functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains Elias's focus and drives the discovery, anchoring the abstract concept in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and functional; the "fog sculpture garden" serves as both a physical obstacle and a thematic mirror for the protagonist's fading mind. The specific markers (driftwood, stone) ground the abstract quest in tactile reality, effectively guiding the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is vivid with strong sensory details like the "high, unnerving whine" and "bruised clouds." The astro-geography is slightly disorienting—being on a "Lunar Observatory" while looking up at a "changelessly constant moon" creates a momentary spatial confusion (is he on a moon or looking at one?)—but the immediate physical setting of the vibrating cupola is grounded and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, effectively grounding the "haven" concept with sensory details like "oolong and ozone" and the visual of the cloud bank. The environment actively supports the tone and charges the final image of the "radiant haven." Specificity is high, though it occasionally teeters into purple description ("pulsing stillness").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with vivid anchors like the &quot;floating rock&quot; and &quot;tangible darkness,&quot; creating a clear sense of place. While functional, the imagery leans on genre conventions (e.g., &quot;star-dusted velvet,&quot; &quot;brass and copper relic&quot;) rather than utilizing specific, surprising details to deepen the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting details—the wilting moon-petal roses, the polished rowan box, the glowing tooth—are specific and atmospheric. The environment actively supports the reveal; the secret garden functions as the subconscious of his rational life. The transition to the study anchors the resolution firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric grounding is the story's strongest asset, with the "serpentine grotto" and "thick mist" creating a vivid, claustrophobic sensory experience. Specific details like the "murky teal" and "saltwater and grit" effectively anchor the abstract concept in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The juxtaposition of "cold steel skeletons" and "green velvet" creates a vivid, tactile environment that serves the theme. The sensory detail of the dripping water effectively anchors the passage of time and creates a necessary focal point for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "feral nexus" functions as a generic misty void, a common backdrop for introspection that lacks distinct, grounding geography until the final shift to the desk. Sensory details like "damp earth" are functional but standard.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the arbor is visualized with some clarity, the descriptions rely heavily on genre clichés ("gathering hush," "holding its breath," "pregnant with memories"). The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric work is the story's strongest asset, with specific tactile details like the "brass body tarnished" and "wick-raiser knob" grounding the magic. The "bronze grotto" and "pinprick starlight" create a vivid, contained environment. However, the space feels slightly disembodied (white-room syndrome) outside the immediate focal objects.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sensory details are vivid and purposeful, particularly the tactile descriptions of the ash wood and the auditory pressure of the kettle. The environment actively constrains the character's focus, grounding the abstract memory work in a tangible setting.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "day-old bruise" water and the "tactile conversation with the mud" ground the scene effectively. The setting is palpable and integrates well with the solitary nature of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Specific, evocative imagery ("fat, silent flakes," "bleached pale") effectively establishes the mood of the "liminal hour." While the setting is vivid, it serves primarily as an atmospheric backdrop rather than an active constraint that forces the protagonist to adapt his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, with specific, multisensory details ("scent of pears," "rust-colored chrysanthemums") effectively grounding the mood. The setting actively supports the tone, though the transition to the memory hall relies on a magical dissolving of the world rather than organic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with strong sensory details like "salt-rimed railings" and the "chasm of interlocking gears." The contrast between the organic stalactites and the mechanical city is well-established and serves the theme. Some descriptions drift into list-like territory, but the atmosphere is palpable and grounds the fantasy effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Specific details like the "specialist’s knife" and the "obsidian lagoon" ground the scenes effectively. The contrast between the burning conservatory and the quiet lagoon is vivid, though the lagoon functions more as a framing device than a pressure-cooker setting.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "City of Forgotten Fountains" is realized with distinct, evocative details like the "saline flats" and the "Locksmith’s Eye" star. The setting is not just a backdrop but actively participates in the plot through the oculus alignment and the specific discoloration on the marble.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "nebula garden" is evocative, though descriptions rely heavily on abstract visual adjectives ("swirling," "gossamer"). The "calculating machine gear" provides excellent tactile contrast, grounding the ethereal setting and serving as a necessary focal point for the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse setting is atmospheric and grounded, providing a solid anchor for the reflection. However, the description suffers from notable clichés ("skeletal fingers," "sun bled") that dampen the vividness of the specific sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong atmospheric contrast between the mechanical, oiled belfry and the violent, organic memory; the clock's mechanism effectively constrains the scene's timeframe.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on ornamental "purple" description ("drank the twilight," "velveteen gloom") rather than tactile interaction that pressures choices. The silo serves as an atmospheric container but does not constrain the protagonist or influence the outcome beyond providing a backdrop. The "Whisperwind Ridge" location feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using the "obsidian spire" and "milk sky" to establish a cold, stark mood. The specific concept of the "Ignorance Cartographer" anchors the world-building well, though the sensory experience is largely visual and filtered through the protagonist's contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, particularly the specific use of the "jade" radio glow to activate the luminous ink, which integrates the prop directly into the mechanics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "grand gallery" and "dry cistern ledge" are vivid, grounded anchors that support the tone. The sensory detail ("rhythmic drip," "cold ache") effectively creates atmosphere, though "sedimentary layers of muck and memory" leans slightly into purple abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details regarding the "taste" of memories are vivid and specific, grounding the concept well. The greenhouse setting is atmospheric, though the "rusted skeleton" imagery is somewhat standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory-rich details like “tasting of ozone” and “syrupy, nectar dusk” that effectively ground the reader. The atmospheric integration of the lightning tower and the post-blackout city strongly supports the tone. The environment feels tangible and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, sensory specificity ("bruised lavender," "salt-heavy air") that effectively establishes the atmosphere. The contrast between the organic bay and the sterile "white cube" supports the theme, though the environment could press harder on Elara's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary plot constraint; the specific biology of the city (the filtration membrane/gill) dictates the protagonist's choice. Sensory details like the "crushed pearl" and "ghost-white skate" are vivid and purposeful, charging the atmosphere with the necessary "life-in-death" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sterile, infinite environment is well-rendered, providing a strong contrast to the sensory richness of the rupture ("damp chill," "rain on asphalt"). The setting functions not just as a backdrop but as the antagonist, applying constant pressure to the protagonist's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sensory details establish a vivid contrast between the humid, ochre-tinted greenhouse and the chemical smog of the city. The setting effectively mirrors the theme of isolated life fighting for breath.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with evocative details like the "phosphorescent moss" and the "emerald-tinted lens" against the ice. The atmosphere of the frozen grotto is tangible. However, the specific phrase "rosewater dread" is repeated verbatim as a bookend, which feels slightly mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is established with strong sensory details like "ozone and cold brass" and the "slick, black rocks," effectively grounding the metaphysical action. The atmosphere supports the "bleak exhilaration" tone, though the lighthouse trope is standard.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The concept of an orchard afloat on driftwood is vivid, original, and grounding, providing a strong atmospheric anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting details are evocative and purposeful, particularly the "salt-bleached worktable" and the "copper and rust" light which ground the fantasy elements. The turtle-city concept, while a genre staple, is treated with a geological gravity that enhances the tone. The environment actively pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ivy metaphor ("pruning the branches of a tree whose roots are rotten") effectively integrates setting with theme. However, the description relies on atmospheric stock phrases ("dust motes danced," "groaning oak door") that reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strength, effectively establishing the "marsh mist" and the "skeletal dome" of the pavilion.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is active and constraining; the blackout and the "phosphorescent moss" are not just atmospheric but essential tools that shape the protagonist's tactics in the climax. The transition from the hum of generators to the "drip of condensation" effectively grounds the crisis in sensory specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively utilizing the "floating isle" and "glass basilica" concepts to create a cohesive mood. However, descriptors like "crystalline," "shimmering," and "powdered starlight" lean heavily into standard ethereal fantasy tropes, offering a familiar aesthetic rather than a specifically grounded, lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and functional, utilizing the "oppressive silence" and the "blue lie" of Earth to reflect the protagonist's internal state. The cooling circuit breakers serve as an effective environmental constraint that dictates the scene's pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting provides a functional backdrop with some vivid visual details ("golden filigree," "jagged peaks"), though it relies on standard "ancient tech" tropes. The spatial geography of the drone's path is clear, but the environment serves more as a passive puzzle board than a source of pressure or distinct atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and moody, utilizing the "cobalt terrace" and "bruised purple" sky to mirror the protagonist's internal state. While evocative, the setting lacks concrete spatial anchors or specific sensory grounding beyond the visual, feeling somewhat like a floating stage.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is strong and consistent; the brass drawer pull serves as an excellent micro-setting element that constrains the action. Some descriptors lean toward standard fantasy tropes ("crumbling perch," "eroded crenellations").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if occasionally purple, sensory details like the "bruised twilight" and "scent of... accusation." The utility poles and the compass serve as effective, specific grounding elements that link the environment to the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bioluminescent lake is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("shifting constellations," "pulsing") that effectively anchor the climax. While "Cinderwood Barrens" feels generic, the immediate sensory environment of the cave successfully generates atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, particularly the olfactory descriptions of the spices and the "burnt sugar" scent of Lyra. The setting exerts pressure through the requirement of moonlight, though the "six-legged foxes" and "sloths with eyes like nebulae" feel slightly ornamental compared to the grounded details of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with details like "phosphorescent moss" and "ozone" grounding the fantastical premise. The environment effectively isolates the character, though it serves more as a backdrop for reflection than an active pressure system constraining her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "Scrap-Ark" offers a distinct texture, and the integration of the environment—the deck plates buckling, the ship groaning in sympathy—is excellent. The gravitational lightness mechanic effectively turns the setting into a barometer for the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit adjective-heavy, imagery ("glassy obsidian grains," "salt-stung"). While the atmosphere of the "vibrant hush" is tangible, the description often veers into purple prose ("silence... louder than a scream") rather than serving as a source of friction or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the luminous fort and the sundial acting as integral plot mechanisms rather than just backdrop. The integration of the "cradle of sparks" into the fort's architecture allows the environment to drive the resolution directly. The imagery of phosphorescent algae and light-based communication is vivid and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is evocative, but the core premise of a frictionless world is contradicted by the mechanics of the "method." Kael requires magnetic boots to stand, yet he places non-magnetic obsidian stones into a spiral on basalt that stays perfectly in place without friction; this inconsistency undermines the story's physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory as a "skull" and the "dead eye" telescope are vivid, effective anchors that mirror the protagonist's internal state. While the atmosphere is strong, some descriptions drift into purple prose ("sea of clouds churned," "silently blasted") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is rendered with distinct sensory details, particularly the play of light and shadow which is integral to the plot. The "glass atrium" and "white marble" create a vivid, sterile stage that suits the intellectual tone, though the environment functions more as a puzzle box than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, tactile specificity ("rusted girders clawing," "grimy marble") that reinforces the theme of decay versus reconstruction. The environment actively frames the action, though the "dead sector" feels slightly less threatening than implied given the ease of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "tidal arbor" and "ocean of vapor" are vividly rendered and constrain the action effectively; the setting physically manifests the stakes of isolation and transience.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting of the blooming ridge is vivid and anchors the action well, with the approaching monsoon providing palpable atmospheric pressure. Some descriptors ("impossible blues") are evocative but lose impact through verbatim repetition later in the text.

    Greenhouse ruin is tactile: silt stink, sagging beam, pearlescent film. The polycarbonate sheet becomes micro-setting that literally refracts choice. Spatial choreography holds as Aris moves from doorway to stool to pane. Weathered environment dictates what he can see and therefore what he can bear to do. Meets 9-band gate: tool (pane) constrains final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Canyon topography—sentinel rock, tributary slot, petrified-wood curtain—functions as both map and hiding place, directly constraining her route and the smugglers’ cipher. Frost topology on cobalt shard and river reeds is handled as manipulable text, not backdrop. Micro-setting (kiln, windowsill, cave mouth) charges every choice; spatial choreography remains coherent across dawn excursions. Final fused-glass artwork internalizes the entire landscape, meeting 9+ gate by recharging the setting through artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The winterglass conservatory is both literal pressure—humid bubble against eternal frost—and metaphoric instrument: its panes become the score she light-paints. Spatial choreography is clean (bench-circlet-flower-glass). Frost, flagstones, and violet thermal bloom constrain her choices and charge the final image. One hairline slip: “winterglass” is never defined beyond poetic portmanteau, but the perceptual logic is consistent enough to waive penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)

    Violet gas-giant glow and continent-sized sleeping wings are sensory, selective, and filtered through Elias’s mechanic gaze—he notices hydraulic stains on his own hands before cosmic scale. The lattice’s “mechanically warm energy” functions as micro-setting/object that constrains the choice (must stay at lever) and charges closure (warmth vs. icy cradle). Spatial choreography is clean: two men, one lever, one hologram, plains below. Proper-noun economy: only “Xylos,” “ornithopters,” “hydro-spanner” used; each re-anchors. No static repetition; cold/warm mirroring supports theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Flood-dark mirror, velvet darkness, flickering lanterns: every descriptor is filtered through Elias’s devotional gaze and guides the only possible action—touching water.

Spatial choreography is flawless—lip of pit, glassy surface, door—no floats.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Weather-station micro-setting is tactile and selective: wool blanket against skin, barograph needle, anemometer whine—all filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The alpine light on the windowsill charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility stumbles. Only minor gap: “west-facing window” appears late, so early spatial footprint could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting details are sparse yet selective and POV-tinted: "rotted tie," "oily water," "weeping walls" surface only when they sharpen danger.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sage Ridge is sketched with economy—dust, sagebrush, blanket, stones—yet each detail is re-used: dust returns on the curl, stones “coaxed” by sound, blanket becomes altar. Micro-setting (the curl as landscape-in-miniature) constrains the final choice. Spatial tracking is flawless; no impossible body positions. Sensory hierarchy respects crisis: narrowed sight to the “sharp-edged” sun, widened to corona brilliance at release.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The silo is a body—curved walls cup memory, light pours like liquid bronze; the environment literally “holds sound.” Micro-setting triumph: the half-charred diary is handled three times; its ash smudges Kaelen’s fingers, marks time, and finally frames the dragons. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track floor-to-desk-to-apex in a single sweep. Setting constrains the only choice available—listen, then accept the quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse, lantern room, sea-fog, and sugar-glaze cookie are tactile tools that constrain movement and transfer. Sensory hierarchy (tinny bell, ghostly metronome beam) mirrors Elias’s metronomic control. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: binocular perch → distant diner → taillights vanish.

    Orchard, asteroid, bathroom—three shards, but transitions are legible and pattern taught early (“recurring joke with himself”). Micro-setting rule met: the pistachio shell on the basin charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“droplets like miniature nebulae”) and guides the breakthrough. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain bookstore is not postcard scenery; the silence wall and root-staircase are micro-settings that physically constrain her path and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: vellum rustle and decay-scent dominate, visual detail is selective. Spatial choreography is flawless—catalog gaps map to tunnels to seamless rock to staircase. No environment-only paragraphs stall momentum; every descriptor is braided to her goal-directed action.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ship’s salt-rust fog, peeling carousel horse, and dead console are not backdrop but instruments: the corroded gate accepts the Mossy Stone swatch, the dead screen enables the final memory extraction. Micro-setting (emerald card) literally re-colors the past and thus steers every beat. Spatial choreography is tight—deck → midway → bridge—and weather (gentle swell) is referenced only when it makes the Ferris carriages sway, grounding scale. One anchor lapse: “bay” first appears late, but the fog has already taught the watery context, so orientation survives.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mechanism room’s grease-stained struts and groaning floorboards are tactile, selective, and guide proximity; the rope’s internal shimmer and the reading-room’s dream-titles are sensory payoffs that reweight meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alchemist market “strung high above rooftops” is sketched with the exact sensory economy the rubric prizes: planks creak, canvases smell of linseed + ozone, bottled starlight glints. The lighthouse painting becomes a micro-setting that constrains the decisive act; its reef’s absence is the spatial flaw that unlocks truth. Bodies move credibly through tent shadows, lens-to-eye gesture tracked without drift. Only one minor里程 marker (the city name withheld) keeps it from the 9-band’s razor edge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is not postcard décor but a toolbox: the ladder’s screech, the tile’s puff of dry-rot air, the brass catching the headlamp beam all constrain the next move. The circus ticket office is filtered through Leo’s technician gaze—he catalogs hoist cables, not clown kitsch. Spatial choreography is clean: ladder placed, tile pushed, ghost stationary in corner. Environment charges the final image when the rafter’s dark rectangle becomes the source of release.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass orchard, cloud sea, letterpress, vial—each is sensuously particular and returned to in motion (hand on press, frost traced, pane breached). The milky buds in the closing image grow directly out of the dissolved books, recharging the setting with new stakes.

Spatial choreography flawless: shards spiral outward, then reverse flow inward with cap as axis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sanctuary is rendered through selective, sense-tight detail—“wind that scoured the stone,” “thick, plaited cathedral bell rope” snaking upward—that doubles as action triggers. Micro-setting (the rope as obsolete manual control) directly enables the climax. Only missing a single tactile cue of glue dryness to nail the countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station is evoked through lived motion—sweeping starlight, polishing lenses, guidance arms moved by gloved hands. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting: its antique curve constrains how Kael can see, therefore what he can feel. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: visual isolation first, then tactile heat of friction when empathy ignites. One nit: “forgotten nebula” is proper-noun economy that could have been reused to charge closure; the unused name keeps this just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting triumph: the stained-glass box and honeycomb lattice function as both prop and environment, constraining the final release. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s beekeeper past—scent of phantom honey, fractured colored light—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean from bench to sundial. The scorched wasteland is sketched in broad strokes, but because the bench/box dyad carries the closure image, that selectivity feels purposeful rather than thin.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The silo’s green lattice becomes a micro-setting that physically channels the memory; its translucent wall-panel is the pivot object.

    Rain-washed library, pollen-dusted mica, and rust-rail balcony are filtered through Aris’s probabilistic eye, constraining her choices (she boards because the environment “speaks”). Micro-setting—the lantern—charges the final image. One minor drift: “urban squalor” is tourist-catalog; the rest is tactile lived-in specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tunnel alcove is more than backdrop—its copper arteries and ozone tang literally carry the glass harmonica’s tone into the caller’s ear, making setting a transmission medium. Micro-setting triumph: the Bakelite phone, concrete walls, and velvet pouch form the entire world; their materiality constrains every action (tone must travel through wire; isolation is structural). Sensory selection skews auditory and tactile, matching Silas’s profession and craving for disembodied contact. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions—though visual breadth is intentionally narrow, appropriate to claustrophobic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Archive, workshop, and salt-bleached jetty are economically seeded; smells of gallnuts and sea-lavender recur, anchoring theme. The locket-as-micro-setting constrains the final beat, its tarnished surface mirrored by the phosphorescent boards—object and environment charge one another. Sensory triangulation is biased through Elara’s conservator eye; no world-rule violations.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The station’s rusted clock, ivy veins, and splintered trolley act as tactile constraints: the frozen hands motivate the rumor, the leaky roof offers a joint task, the barrel fire becomes communal hearth. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: Silas notices dripping ivy and moss-soft sound because they mirror his own stasis. Spatial choreography stays clean as bodies orbit the clock, tools pass between mechanic and Silas, guitar rests on a crate. The micro-setting—moon rock in pocket—never constrains choice, so 8.8 gate remains just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ultrasonic forest is filtered through Kaelen’s skin-hearing: “deafening orchestra” becomes a lived constraint, forcing the quest. Micro-setting—the ring, fossil flower, weeping moss—act as tactile waypoints that steer choices. Ironwood trunk and crystalline rivers return in escalating beats, their texture charging the final chord. Weather and geography stay consistent; no exposition dumps, only sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Gravitational anomaly is more than wallpaper: its ‘gentle warping’ becomes the literal mechanism for accessing the past and the final ‘soothing embrace’, charging closure. Station and console are sketched sparely yet functionally; the pen micro-setting doubles as guilt totem. Sensory hierarchy follows professional filter—waveforms, frequencies—keeping detail purposeful. Lacks one environmental constraint that physically shapes the final keystroke, holding it under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harbor, moonlight, and derelict pylons are filtered through Elian’s perceptual bias toward absence; every visual note is tethered to his sign-language transcription. The collapsed pier functions as micro-setting that literally supports the final chord. Tool-as-setting (the film-less camera) constrains the climax: its click is the only audible artifact, forcing the issue. A half-step shy of 9 only because weather and water temperature never push back tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archive is not backdrop but tool: the fissure-window angles sunlight, the pressure-plate mosaic is literally stepped on, the petrified-paper scent narrows perception to dust and time. Micro-setting is charged: the tapestry fragment doubles as map and lens, constraining the final revelation. Spatial choreography is clean—he “moves deeper,” kneels at the easel, holds cloth to window—no floating bodies. One minor over-adjective (“dust-choked silence”) but overall economy drives atmosphere rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sensory lab’s metallic flora and the diagnostic slab act as micro-setting: their surfaces receive her taps and return light, directly enabling the climax. Bare feet, cold slab, water glass provide tactile immediacy. Spatial choreography is clean: corridor → slab → lagoon projection. The lagoon itself is a setting-made-manifest, charging the final image with undeniable emptiness beside her.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Port sky "poisoned bruise," frozen cranes, and aurora-green corridors are filtered through Silas’s sensory hierarchy; magnetic silence justifies compass failure. Container XB-734’s rust streaks and pneumatic drawer are tactile; spatial choreography keeps three-level depth legible. Atmosphere doubles as tool: celestial alignments on the creased map steer path choice. Final image of bruised light dancing in Silas’s eyes recharges the sky motif, tying setting to earned hush.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and lock-keeper’s cottage are sketched with sensory economy; every visual note serves the light-weaving action. The dental mirror and body-attention replace broad panorama, meeting micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography is flawless—shutter angles, reflection geometry, and guardian stance remain trackable. Environment directly enables the climax: only that exact shutter lattice can launch the star-message, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt library, magnetized grotto, and mist-bound town are filtered through Elias’s professional attention to silence and signal. Each location constrains tactics: the grotto amplifies his hearing, the library offers vantage for the ninth bell. Specificity is economical—”a blue so deep it felt like the bottom of a frozen sea”—and the telescope, loaf, and gear reprise at closure to reweight meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dock-world is sketched through Kaelen’s coiling motion and Elara’s salt-crusted doorway; each detail is utilitarian, lived-in. Sublittoral cove and petrified root-anchors emerge only when they constrain the next action—detachment—so setting earns causal weight. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (cold water, groaning shudder) over postcard vistas. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pier to chest-deep water to ascending mossy stone.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kitchen, turbines, and bouquet function as micro-settings: the turbines’ ceaseless beat supplies an audible metronome that compresses time; the dried bouquet physically houses the final offering; the oak table hosts every implement, anchoring spatial logic. Selective sensory filter (percussive thrum, steam color of rust, scent-memory of lavender) stays filtered through Elias’s hyper-attentive coping. Wind-farm realism is light but sufficient—no techno-dump, just oppressive cadence. Setting steers choice: the noise forces the “remade hush” indoors; the flowers provide the only permissible shrine.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Cobalt atrium, frozen lake, quartz pillars are not backdrop: the cold presses skin, the hum vibrates bone, the emptiness flips from threat to invitation. “Lantern-moth hush” and mineral cadence filter through Kael’s perceptual bias. The colonnade itself functions as tool and adversary, constraining his method (must dissolve boundaries to read it). Final image—lake as blank page—crystallizes setting into closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kiln heat, silver-sage stems, and the “impossibly thin” glass egg each constrain tactile choices; the resonator’s fragility dictates the gentle breath that triggers climax. Ash-and-smoke palette is filtered through Elian’s perception, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: cot against wall, cooling rack, cot-cottage route. Micro-setting (the egg) literally carries the final sound; environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    The laboratory is sketched with selective, sense-led detail—ozone, dust motes, shafts of light—filtered through Elian’s reverent gaze. Spatial choreography is pristine: the semi-circle of bells, emitter, lens mount, and console track cleanly across beats. The “golden shadows” motif evolves from atmospheric descriptor to charged final image when shadows are replaced by steady golden glow. Micro-setting qualifies: the carbide lens functions as portable setting-object that constrains the final tuning choice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory’s layered curtains and polished obsidian benches are tactile, smell-less, gravity-bound; the vellum stencil’s snip is audible, its lotus fold resilient—tools that constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final beam. Body-as-micro-setting rules: the woman’s inward-curve posture dictates sight-lines and telescope selection. No filler astronomy dumps; star names enter only via coordinates she must act on. One minus: we get no shift in temperature or echo under the dome—slight sensory gap keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rain-beaded skylight and worn steel tape function as micro-setting that constrains every beat: the rain’s percussion times the silence, the tape’s increments literalize temporal distance. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—Elara notices load-bearing details, ignores décor. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, cards, tape never drift. Environment charges the final image: storm glass above mirrors the “great and terrible thing” still coming, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its glow, scent, and projected histories constrain every ritual move and charge the final reflection. Archive is sketched with saffron veil, fissure light, ozone—selective, not catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: hand-panel-glyph sequences track without drift. Environment mirrors internal state (soft luminescence vs. her internal storm) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Damp-earth scent and filament wire turn the workshop into a tactile crucible; the prosthetic itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final, perfect fit. Starlit mist evolves from claustrophobic cocoon to permeable membrane, mirroring the protagonist’s loosened grip on suspicion without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bench to terrarium; no anchor drift.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower room, ivy vine, coffee-stained map and clouded hourglass form a micro-setting that directly constrains his ritual and final realization. Dawn light turns “sterile,” reframing earlier meteor hush into something colder—an environmental mirror of his shift. Spatial choreography is tight: cup placed on map, tunneling body bent over table, ivy’s tremor legible. One notch down from 9+ only because weather itself doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The projection booth, velvet seats, and dust motes are not mere backdrop—they absorb and radiate Arthur’s love, directly charging the final image. Micro-setting triumph: the celluloid strip itself functions as environment that constrains Elara’s psychometry. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias; every detail is filtered through gazer or projectionist urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    The brass-and-lens “soul-scribe” operates as micro-setting: its geared resistance determines the speed of her meditation and the moment she pushes it aside. Aurora light is not wallpaper; it supplies the green-violet palette that reappears in the charcoal lines on stone, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, turning gears, setting stylus, then reaching for satchel—no ghost limbs. One hairline slip: “wind-hewn archway of black basalt” is generic tourist phrasing amid otherwise idiosyncratic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    Environment (glowing sand, ghost-pale flora) and micro-object (chess clock) together constrain tactics: the luminescent dune must be kept coherent, the clock’s frozen hands mark the prohibited hour of resurrection. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—Kaelen notices internal luminescence and resin scent because these signal archive volatility. Spatial choreography clean: sand → skiff console → crystal filament sky; no impossible jumps. Final image recharges both motifs: crystalline pine branches = dune-light + arboreal geometry, scent mingled with cold air, fusing setting and transformation in one visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mechanical rainforest is not backdrop but syntax: brass canopy dictates navigation, quartz cathedral forces revelation. Micro-setting object—the gear—constrains final self-conception. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: sound-currency over visual catalog. Spatial choreography stays intact; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting is the ticket-body interface: kelp warms in palm, pulse-synced, directly steering the final decision. Larger landscape (purple ink sky, silvered cloud-sea) is filtered through Elara’s dusk-sensitive perception, never touristic. Spatial choreography holds: guides front/rear, lantern angle, promontory edge all track. Weather and light evolve causally with moon-rise; no static postcard repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cobalt-armored snow fortress is sketched in three compressed strokes yet constrains every move: the guests convalesce in opulent quiet, the staff glide in polished shoes, the staircase is off-limits—space itself enforces silence. Weather never moralizes, but the ever-present snow against armored glass becomes the hush made visible. The bolt and staircase function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory economy is expert; no filler description.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Environment is the micro-setting of body-and-lectern: the basalt pedestal, star-chart, and captured starlight dome constrain every motion. Sensory detail is selective—cold dense weight of the pellet, violet pulse—never catalog. The library’s “quiet hum between heartbeats” mirrors Kael’s restraint, charging the final fade. Spatial track is clean: aisle → scroll → scriptorium → nexus under dome.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s concrete hum and console-metal chill function as micro-setting, constraining both the drumming acoustics and the tactile memory of Lena’s touch. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Aris notices tidal gauges, salt corrosion, the “bleached white bones” outside—never tourist filler. The viewport’s transformation from boneyard to living reef is a spatial anchor that charges the final image. One nip: no smell or temperature shift during thermal inversion, a missed immediacy that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    The repair bay is rendered through ambient decay—scorch rays, dormant gantries, dust—not tourist checklist; the obsidian monoliths function as micro-setting that literally constrains her posture (kneeling, palms flat) and dictates the story’s acoustic physics. Bare feet provide sensory cold-to-vibration arc, grounding the fantastic in flesh. Spatial track clean: she moves from threshold → conduit trip → circle center → standing under broken dome; no impossible positions. The “bruised purple and rust” twilight is brief but sets the color key for bruised hope. Setting could have tightened the clock—no mention of patrol windows or orbital dusk length—but atmosphere supports the hush required for the hum.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hot-spring minerals, thermophilic algae, and vent pressure are not backdrop but reagents; temperature and chemistry decide viability. The embryo’s shelf of “smooth, dark basalt” is a tactile micro-setting that literally supports the climax. Sensory hierarchy skews geothermal—sulfur, ozone, wet earth—mirroring Elara’s internal heat against the cold reconstruction. Environment constrains every beat; swap the vent chemistry and the amber never dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Glass-paneled arboretum, cliff surf hum, and resin scent are filtered through Anya’s horticultural eye; every detail either narrows choice (muted roar permits her vigilance) or mirrors internal pressure (shadow slides across the living fossil). The watering can and pocketed photograph function as micro-settings that constrain final action. Spatial choreography holds: she never drifts from the pine’s pot. Environment and tool jointly charge the closing image—no decorative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The circular stone room, rotating lamp beam, and salt dust are sharply sensory and filter through the artist’s painterly eye. The broken tarot coffer becomes the micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice: he arranges its splinters into the new map, so the object-as-setting charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Wind-carved sandstone basin doubles as canvas and portal; its tactile wear guides Kael’s fractal reading. Light after eclipse is rendered as “remembered pain,” fusing setting with albino physiology. Spatial choreography holds: drone distance, ink spread, foot landing are trackable. The environment constrains the final choice—the basin’s smoothness invites the ink map that alone permits disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cryo-vaults, frost-rimmed cabinets, and archaic terminal are tactile and POV-filtered; snow both insulates and threatens. The setting constrains the act (only one hidden terminal reaches the ghost grid). Minor over-reliance on visual; other senses appear but are sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dome, canvas scrap, and knife function as micro-setting that constrain kneeling, hiding, and moral choice. Silica dunes, glass panes, and rose rows are filtered through Elara’s plant-biased eye, never touristy. Spatial choreography clean; no prop teleport. The boxed blade returns in final image, recharging “quiet” with menace contained.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The garden is not backdrop but physics: “valleys of muted bass notes absorb the light,” forcing Kaelen to zig, to hush, to strike. The rail spike’s changing resonance—feral ring → dead thud—acts as micro-setting that steers each beat. Final image literalizes the spike as stylus engraving silence; environment charges closure. Sensory economy is strict—no tourist checklist—every acoustic detail bends choice or foreshadows the anti-sound climax.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory’s rotating dome and star-dusted glass walls constrain Celeste’s solitude and supply the final image; the mahogany desk anchors prop handling. Sensory selectivity favors sound (hum, click dead) and tactile coolness of nib. Spatial choreography clean: she moves from desk to curved wall without teleport. Environment mirrors internal orbit but avoids overt symbolism. Slight overreliance on visual; scent of rain is the only non-visual cue.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    City-nebula, bruise-sky, and sterile server rows are filtered through Elian’s tattooist gaze—star-charts on skin vs circuitry on metal—so setting constrains the final etching pattern. The amber’s tactile presence acts as micro-setting that charges the closing image. Spatial choreography clean: studio → desk drawer → lab terminal tracks without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mist-wrapped grotto, damp archways, lavender-grey shroud body the story’s pressure: moisture deadens sound, forces tactile strategies. Micro-setting—thumbnail tile flake—functions as portable acoustic memory, constraining Elara’s pivot to visual language. Spatial choreography holds across drifting spectators; no impossible distances. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV priority—touch over hearing—mirroring society’s sensory loss.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The plaza is sketched with static ash and crystalline sky fractures, but every detail is filtered through Kaelen’s fatigue—what he tastes, hears, and finally releases. The tessera’s lapis coolness and the coarse wool blanket act as micro-settings that constrain gesture and charge the renaming beat. Spatial coherence is perfect: Kaelen kneels, presses, stands, turns; no floating bodies or teleporting props. The shattered sky is reused as the final mirror of an unhealed world, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining Kaelen’s endless march.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The maze, bench, Chronos Tree, and tarot coin function as micro-setting: the tree’s out-of-season blossom is the final charged image that would fail without the garden rule-set. Sensory triage is POV-driven—Julian notices color-chords, scent-honey, temperature-shifts—never a tourist checklist. Spatial choreography stays clean: drift, layer, wash, nudge—no impossible positions. Only nit: “mystic orchard garden” is named twice without concrete agricultural detail, a hair below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    The studio’s cavernous dark is immediate and functional: it erases visual confirmation so somatic attention must take over, weaponizing the setting. Camera remote, LED wands, and muscovite sliver are micro-settings that constrain every move. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, lights, and shutter clicks track cleanly. Only the geode’s literal presence at the end could have carried slightly more sensory weight to hit 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cave is rendered through tool-mediated perception—colors projected onto stone, tide meeting fresh water—so environment and body co-function as setting. Spatial choreography is clean: squeeze, archway, cathedral chamber, meter-high float. Sensory hierarchy obeys her method: “faint blues of lingering sorrow” precedes smell of ozone, mirroring analytical-to-immersion arc. The fossil and sensor act as micro-settings that constrain choice (she must switch from active scanning to passive surrender), satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber warehouse is rendered through selective sensory filtration—gritty light, resin-caked windows, canyon shelves—each detail doubles as emotional filter and physical constraint (access to buttons = access to fate). The wooden toggle’s burn scar literally charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.Spatial choreography stays clean across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist-as-ally is more than mood; it justifies the meeting, the dead-drop method, and the zero-record stakes. Zephyr Bluff is sketched in three sensory strokes—silver hush, damp rock, crunch of old snow—then used: the damp air softens footprints, the melting canvas accepts coded glyphs, the watery dawn lightens as Elias turns away. Pillbox functions as micro-setting; its mirrored lid gives rear-view surveillance and its weight steadies his hand. Spatial choreography is flawless: ten-pace distance, stick-tip lettering, boot-scuff erasure all track.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fog-bound crossing is not backdrop but pressure: it forces the pause that distills memory, makes the river’s indifference audible, and lets the ferry hammer count heartbeats. Micro-setting objects—loose chain, mossy pylons, rain gutters—are handled, sounded, timed; their cessation marks the precise moment of internal shift. The yarn needle’s cold eye literalizes the act of mending what can never be whole, charging the final image. Environment, body, and tool together constrain the only possible choice: forward, with the ache repurposed.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hexagonal hive-shadows, marrow-thrum, waxy thyme, and clay-packed channel walls deliver sensory hierarchy filtered through a potter’s proprioception. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track his kneeling at rose bush, palm against clay, glass at eye, all within a single depression. The lantern glass recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image; its clouded surface becomes the literal lens through which time distorts, marrying tool to terrain. Weather is used sparingly—flattening smoke as temporal hinge—keeping description lean yet atmosphere soaked into every motion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit harbor, fire-escape iron, and bitting-gauge micro-setting constrain her reach and optics; the steel tooth’s etched mark literally measures the gap she must bridge. Sensory selection skews visual, but the rocking cadence recruits kinesthetic rhythm that charges the finale. Cold salt air and dormancy of other plants track causal time without encyclopedic listing. Spatial choreography keeps line, tooth, and window-slit in consistent triangulation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “atomically reflective floor” is not scenery; it literally supplies the creatures that force the reconfiguration. The tidal library’s mist-starlight-sea triad is filtered through Kael’s curator gaze, never touristy. Spatial choreography is immaculate: circle → central stone → floor mirrors → creatures. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (hum in bones) under pressure. The setting’s rule—reflections are benign, not resurrections—charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The radio station as micro-setting is tactile—dust, ozone, bakelite, VU meters—and every tool (charts, waveform generator) is handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography stays clean: desk → corkboard wall → monitor feed of the quad. The “ethereal grit” tone is anchored in specific sensory grit (dust, ozone) rather than adjective fog, and the final image of the low thrum charging the air is inseparable from the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nexus is rendered through hostile specificity: “walls leaned without falling,” “sweating granite,” starlight that “barely penetrated the gloom.” Body-as-setting is equally precise—breath hitches, palm sweats—so environment and physiology together constrain every move. The compass point and keystone micro-settings literally charge the final image: their collision carves the only stable passage. All sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s explorer-proprioceptive bias; no tourist catalog appears.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quarry, ribbon, mist, and stone recur as micro-setting that constrains palette and最终决定：the cold rock literally scrapes the ribbon, determining the color clash Elias must paint. Sensory selection skewed to tactile (cold wet mist, frayed silk) mirrors Elias’s face-blind reliance on texture over sight. Final image—the canvas left staring into fog—crystallizes setting as both literal and symbolic void. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Weather station’s “grey water” air and the weeping basalt monolith are tactile, selective, and directly constrain the drone launch and the hand-press beat. Micro-setting (copper nail, rock cavity) functions as setting and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: map librarian notices pressure logs, lichen streaks, pitch-sealed leather. Spatial choreography clean: 5 km drone range, head-lamp beam on page 1 of the true logbook.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mountain pullout, resin scent, updraft rippling green mesh—each detail is filtered through Elias’s musician-perception and constrains his decoding of the flutter rhythm. The glass flake functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. No static cataloging; environment evolves with action. Meets 9+ gate: tool/object (flake) directly shapes the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lion-tamer’s carriage, rust-flavored air, and child-sized slipper on a stump are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly pressure the CEO’s retreat. Circus detritus constrains Elias’s tactics: chalky forint symbols and music-box waltz are literally lying around to be repurposed. Final image of “quiet, dusky harmony” recharges the opening atmosphere, closing the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory is not backdrop but active crucible: the dome slit literally narrows options to a single star, the refractor’s gears echo the “rhythmic pulsing” that becomes grammar. Micro-setting objects—telegram, eyepiece, brittle box—are handled in every beat; their texture (dust, dried petals, copper chill) constrains the dream transition. Sensory hierarchy skews visual → haptic → olfactory, matching astronomer’s trained gaze. Spatial choreography is flawless: body at telescope, slide of box, fingers on journal track across 360° without drift. Only minus: no sonic detail undercuts the “profound silence” claim, minor at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black lake, bone-pale trees, and swirling orchard vortex are rendered through Elara’s tactical perception—each detail filters her druidic survey circles. The vortex constrains her ritual range and later supplies the exact spot for the seed, charging the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and kinesthetic over visual catalog. Micro-setting (gloved hand on petrified soil) grounds the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Weirwood throne, ozone + moonpetals, and the clipping’s waxy green against twilight blue are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain action—she can’t move, must use what’s within arm’s reach. Micro-setting (her fused bark-legs, the burning clipping) directly shapes the final image. Spatial choreography across psychic link remains coherent. Meets 9-band gate: environment and recurring object charge the closing vector.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The catacomb orchard is not backdrop: the femur Elara’s root finally touches is the literal marrow that lets the sapling live, and the card stuck in that soil becomes a talismanic constraint. Spatial choreography stays crisp—moss, ribs, tendril, card—so environment shapes the win condition.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The trailer, quarry void, and grille cloth function as micro-setting: the empty pit mirrors the emptied self, the cloth’s frayed weave is handled under the loupe light, constraining the final gesture. Sensory selection skews tactile and sonic (hum of fridge, ripping sound), filtered through an audio guy’s ear. Spatial choreography clean: box → cloth → recorder → desk, no impossible moves. Tone of echoing absence is sustained and charged by the final placement.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor’s magnetic field lines act as both environment and tool, constraining seed placement and tuning the final filament. Cloud-top world rules remain consistent; no exposition dump. Setting is filtered through translator’s bias (cuneiform syntax, waveform vocabulary), never tourist gaze. Micro-setting qualifies: the seedbed becomes the entire cosmos in miniature.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting (creel, forge-basin, moonlit water) constrains every choice; creel’s weave limits how memory-ore is held, basin’s shape dictates smelt geometry. Salt-crystal floor, brass joints chiming, and water temperature are filtered through POV bias (“optical sensors catalog with serene precision”). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: creel lifted → carried → tipped → hands submerged → fish gathered. No filler exposition; each sensory detail (polished-bone moon sliver, starlight fish) advances atmosphere and stakes. Meets 9+ gate: recurring creel and basin charge final image; only micro-slip is “great, slow breath” cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Torlan crystal cave is not backdrop but instrument: facets refract light during climax, conch fossil supplies mechanics, quartz pillars act as transmission rods. Sensory triage narrows to touch (pearl warmth) and sound (resonant hush) under crisis. Spatial choreography clean: conch → obsidian plate → central pillar gap tracked without drift. Environment constrains final act—only the crystal tips can receive the pearl—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Damp-ticket hall, ivy-choked eaves, smashed porcelain, and the accordion’s duct-tape patches are tactile and POV-filtered. The station constrains movement—only one stall bears the message—so setting actively funnels the climax. Weather (mist, river breath) stays off-stage but the built decay mirrors the “raw” internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    The watch-face functions as micro-setting that literally constrains movement—its silver-inlay pulse dictates every repositioning; the pearlescent mist and readerly triangulation are kinesthetic, not postcard, forcing Elara’s dancer-like choreography that the final image freezes into charged stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Refrigerated observatory air, velvet drape, and marble pedestal are used, not toured: the cold keeps the violin alive, the velvet blocks sky-light so the stain can be read. The vine cutting inherits the glacier memory and becomes the tactile future; environment thus constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-anchored (coffee bitterness vs. refrigerated chill). Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Micro-setting (the cup, the offshoot) charges the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Skyborne grotto, crystalline walls, aurora curtains—these are not postcard scenery; the green-violet light IS the raw material Elara siphons, so setting literally supplies the stakes. Micro-setting of obsidian slab and velvet niches constrains her precise hand movements; aurora’s “respectful waltz” at the end is a direct environmental response to her theft. One hairline slip: no sensory smell/temperature inside the cavern itself, but the visual metaphor chain remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Grotto geography is lived-in: luminous water veins, shadow decay patches, and scalloped soil constrain Elara’s every micro-move. The hairpin doubles as micro-setting, its obsidian edge literally carving the new riverbed that powers climax. Basalt, mist, and cloud-sea elevations stay spatially coherent through the climb–descent arc. Environment materially shapes tactics; without scalloped loam the Heart-Bloom fails—setting stakes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Salt-eaten iron catwalk, brass vs. shell chimes, ash-smell of dead campfire—every sense filtered through narrator’s professional attention. Lighthouse structure constrains choreography: single door, spiral stairs, narrow railing—bodies track cleanly. The hollow shard functions as micro-setting; its “distorted, empty view” recharges final image. Weather (North Atlantic wind) literally tears cloak away, co-escalating external and internal stakes. No static cataloging; each detail either mirrors state or enables choice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, and mirrored pond are not backdrop; they actively enable the lesson—grotto keeps the stone airborne, pond provides the reversible medium that enacts the rule-shift. Starlight “sharp enough to cut” and the “sycamore hush” are selective, tonal, and filtered through Kael’s impatience. Spatial choreography is clean: stone drops, rings widen, reverse, collapse—bodies never ghost. Micro-setting (pond surface) literally constrains the final choice; without its reversible physics the epiphany fails—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bone towers function as both geography and instrument: their acoustic ribs literally amplify Kaelan’s harmonic skim, making environment = tool. The arrowhead’s volcanic glass and the fossilized rib ramp constrain how Kaelan can act (gentle touch, climb, perch) while charging the final harmonic flick. Sensory selection stays urgent—sound over sight, grit under knees—mirroring the vow of stillness. Setting details never stall motion; each is discovered through goal-directed appraisal, so the micro-setting test is satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The spire’s atmospheric pressure (thin air, bruised-plum sky) is not postcard but causal: it forces the mist-walk arrival and justifies the obsolete method. The garden folly keystone is micro-setting-as-tool, constraining the final choice once the diagnostic heap is jettisoned. Sensory hierarchy stays inside Kael’s bias: he notices luminance, snow-muffled thud, cold against palm—never tourist inventory. Final image reuses the “brilliant dimness” idiom, now re-weighted as sacred sight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sea-level pier, black water column, and tilted silted library are sketched with economical, sensory strokes that never stall momentum. Brass tag functions as micro-setting anchor; rebreather gauges supply tactile reality that later contrasts the metaphysical color bloom. Spatial choreography holds across descent—no impossible positions. Environment actively squeezes options: only in total darkness can the color be “heard,” satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ambered deck, copper coin, and console hum are recycled as micro-setting that constrain every tactic (power budget, dish alignment, memory receptacle). Sensory economy favors auditory and tactile detail over visual clutter, mirroring Kael’s radio-tuned perception. The coin’s green patina re-appears in the closing image, charging the final reconfiguration. Enough specificity to breach 9+ gate; capped at 8.9 only because exterior spatial anchors remain sketchy.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Observatory ribs, copper dust, apricot-violet dusk, and the prism-as-micro-setting all constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Sensory selection stays inside Kael’s reaper-biased perception; spatial choreography is clean and pressure-guided.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sapphire viaduct is not backdrop but instrument: its crystalline surface conducts the bell-hum outward, turning setting into sounding board. Dawn light is repeatedly filtered through Kael’s perception (“beauty felt hollow”), anchoring description in POV bias. The ochre patch that darkens is a micro-setting object that literally charges the final image with moisture. Spatial choreography is clean—feet, bell fragments, railing, canyon floor track exactly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is weaponised: each drop of water lost exposes more bone of Aethelburg, tightening Elias’s ethical vise. The sapphire label’s return on the corkboard finale recharges the drowned tavern as communal relic. Spatial clarity maintained—mud suck, attic dim, archive dust—without tourist catalog. Micro-setting rule met: the ledger as physical object receives the decisive ink stroke that reconfigures history.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard is not backdrop but crucible: moss-soft earth, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and gnarled apple tree constrain sightlines and reveal the crystal. Sensory hierarchy is alchemist-biased—notice of dew geometry over bird song. One nit: “kaleidoscopic” risks dazzle-overload, yet it pays off in refracted light that charges the vapor image, so waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arbor’s lattice-branch walls, thin air, and ozone-tasting moss are not backdrop: the thin air justifies the console’s crystal calibration sensitivity, and the lattice supports the magnetic-lens array Kael must retune. Parachute buckle functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture; its cold bite steadies the tremor, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean—console, dial, buckle, screen form one reachable arc. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s profession: radio hum, lens whine, star-vector graphics dominate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock, glass jar, and churning temporal sky constrain tactics: only here can opposing psychic forces be balanced; only this jar can receive them. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Kael’s detachment—visual dust motes, haptic jar warmth—never tourist catalogue. Weather flicker (purple→orange) externalizes the timeline convulsion that pressures the ritual. Micro-setting (the jar) literally carries the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The brook-side haven is not postcard backdrop; its quiet current becomes the literal pacing device for orthogonal thought, then the contrasting silence after the decision. Micro-setting (wicker table, magnifying lamp, terracotta pot) constrains choices: the pot’s depth dictates soil mix, the shelf’s darkness determines placement. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s puzzle-maker bias—texture of cardboard corrugation, machine-cut edges, scent of damp earth—rather than tourist catalogue. Weather (“storm-born silence”) is thematic, not decorative, and returns in the final hush. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Final image recharges the brook metaphor: patience now internalized as seed-time.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory economy—“plastic housing faded,” “pull cord handle hung like a silent promise”—grounds the tool-as-setting and keeps the tunnel’s acoustic properties causally active: the roar bounces, leaves shred, song warps. Weather and season are externalized through brittle brown leaves tracked indoors, mirroring the family’s emotional drought. Spatial choreography is flawless: garage → hallway → wife steps into wind. The leaf blower’s two-stroke specifications are accurate and materially affect the noise texture that carries the lullaby. Final image—hair strand across face—crystallizes setting, body, and memory in one tactile moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen garden operates as both arena and mirror: skeletal roses echo his emotional ossification; perpetual mist externalizes memory loss. Pendant’s gleam on frosted grass supplies micro-setting detail that later constrains tactics—its metallic cold anchors his decision to repurpose rather than destroy. Spatial choreography is clean: from den to oak doors to tear-heart; no impossible shifts. Final image—mist gently swirling, now quiet—recharges prior motif with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus is not backdrop but crucible: its dying ley-line embers supply the heat for every trial and the final transmutation, while the “warm, ashen dust” subtly mirrors Elias’s spent hope. Micro-setting rules—silver fragment size, ember temperature, dew source—are taught through action and constrain tactics (no ember, no reaction). Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: alchemist notices mineral glint, botanical taxonomy, and the “greasy soot” residue that marks defeat. Final image of moonlight-flower radiating “gentle coolness” recharges the earlier twilight bleed, locking setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The needle tower and gorge are not backdrop; their sway and cable-creak constrain her micro-moves—she dares not breathe too hard. The fragment’s “cool hum” against her palm is a micro-setting that literally tunes the silence. Sensory hierarchy obeys her profession: radio hiss before wind taste. Final image of the city “waiting” recharges the gorge’s black lip as a mouth now ready to speak—setting becomes a character reborn.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is not backdrop but tool: crystalline walls reflect the starlight sequences Finn must match on the radio dial. The ferry wheelhouse shrinks to console, frost patterns, and the hourglass—objects that literally guide his fingers. Sensory economy is strict: no tourist catalog of the grotto, only the data Finn needs to survive. The restored harbor fog at the end is the precise negative space that proves the spectral grotto was real and now gone, recharging the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The optical gallery is not backdrop but tool: the moire walls and black-glass floor physically freeze to match the memory shift, constraining Elias’s final stance. Sinew thread functions as micro-setting—handled, scented, color-shifting—its tensile limit dictates when the eruption occurs. Sensory triangulation (ozone-salt smell, marble-cold touch) is selective and POV-filtered, never catalog-like. Spatial choreography is clean: Elias steps forward, hand hovering, lattice locked in place—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Benthic city is more than postcard: pressure checks, sonar sweeps, recycled-air fragility actively constrain thought; the rusted iron’s cold weight is tactile shorthand for surface death. Anchor link re-appears at lectern, charging final image—obeys micro-setting rule. Phosphorescent barnacles, plasteel domes, abyssal plain give precise, POV-filtered sensory triangulation; no visual monopoly. 9+ gate missed because environment does not literally constrain the council decision—air supply never at risk during speech—but the metaphoric gravity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: glass/steel echo chamber literalizes “reeling hush,” constraining how far sound/pulse can travel and why Elias must walk slowly. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—auditory pulses guide camera-like sweeps. Fog and marble root the twilight window without seasonal cliché. The fountain bench becomes the charged spatial pivot where photograph object, pulse, and grandson converge—setting directly enables closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The wet-concrete tomb, fossil-cable snakes, and luminous chronometer are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain movement and time; the gold fleck micro-setting charges the final image when it clicks into the star-shaped slot. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias’s body tracks through the jagged mouth, floods, and hub without drift; environment actively tightens options as tide and rock close.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Opal observatory, snow burial, and slate-as-terminal are specific, integrated, and constrain her tools (no standard keyboard). The porcelain shard’s tactile edge recurs, charging the final image when laid down. Cold, silence, and ink viscosity filter through her heartbeat perception, satisfying micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography is tight: console → slate → lens-axis alignment tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Bone-tower materiality constrains final alignment choice; chill shadow, grit sandstone act as micro-phrases. Spatial choreography clean: precipice, wind, hand-tremor track without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys copper-veined POV—world felt more than seen. Environment charges closure image: tower’s own texture becomes first word.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underground garden is a character: droplets hover, moss spirals, subway myth used as anchor. Arrowhead and orchid function as micro-settings that constrain final choice. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Julian’s covert gaze—sound of static precedes visual bark-skin. Final image of trembling sapling reweights the entire space without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Compressed lyricism—“apple blossoms the color of old bruises”—grounds the orchard as both wound and womb. The violin, body, and shell act as micro-settings that literally channel her heartbeat into the earth, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: descent of spiral stairs, gate slip, center-tree placement all track. Weather (ozone) is felt but not allowed to stall motion. World rule (mechanical sentinels) is established early and consistently exploited at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted postbox, pulsing cobalt sign, and brittle hush are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s tactical gaze; the bottle itself acts as micro-setting that constrains choice. The setting charges the final image: the arcade lights recede into darkness just as the promise is re-lit in the ether, meeting the 9-band gate. Geography is crystal-clear across the 30-second corridor, no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is the micro-setting of the derelict train car: velvet-stripped seats, peeling gilt, splintered poplar mare—every surface is tactilely engaged during carving. Weather (focused gust) functions as plot agent, not backdrop. Spatial choreography clean: fragment travels from mane → palm → bench → brow without teleport. The halo fragment itself serves as portable sky, constraining his choice to crown the horse and triggering song. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Scientific-poetry library is more postcard than crucible—no shelf, aisle, or patron obstructs or aids the warp. Micro-setting scarf fares better: its geodesic tension literally bends the scene. Sensory triad (visual shimmer, ozone stink, sub-audible thrum) is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography clean; bodies track. Environment does not actively constrain choice, capping at 7.8.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Steel-grey water, prismatic fog, petrified-wood palette, and candle-lit developing basin are tactile tools that constrain every action; removing any one collapses the ritual. Easternmost islet’s “stark, beautiful loneliness” mirrors Silas’s inner vacancy, while the library’s salt-and-paper scent anchors return. The micro-settings (boat, basin, vellum) charge the final image when the glow lifts off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The salt-white stone circle doubles as crucible and instrument: proximity to the stones permits the ritual, and their pale surface becomes the screen on which the lattice must appear for the spell to succeed. Starlight is not backdrop but agent—its thousand-year travel and precise angle are the enabling mechanics. Sensory selection narrows to silver filaments and ozone, matching the POV’s obsession with resonance over breadth. The final return to “ordinary starlight” re-anchors the cosmic in the terrestrial, charging the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drowned greenhouse is not postcard scenery; the warped panes fracture starlight into the cipher Elias reads, so setting directly enables the plot engine. Micro-setting inside the submersible—brass knuckle spotlight, fogged viewport—constrains angle of approach and heightens the tremor beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: folklorist notices rusted iron ribs as “cathedral,” not tourist list. Spatial choreography is clean; submersible drifts, claw-hand descends, moss ring is center-point—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting dominates: velvet-draped pedestal, scuffed floorboards, and tea-dregs slate act as tactile arenas that constrain how knowledge can be extracted. The playground-swing creak outside threads through as auditory clock and exile metaphor without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clean despite Kael’s backward shuffle; scroll-collapse lands as physical obstacle that Elara re-orders. Environment does not merely echo mood; it furnishes the only tools (cube, leaves, dust) that can be traded for passage.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Waterfall-mist, obsidian seed, and cliff-orchard are filtered through Elian’s synesthetic bias; each detail either enables the essence-capture (mist = veil) or mirrors internal shift (emerald deepness returned). Spatial choreography is clean: parapet → waterfall spray → clay pot in contiguous breath. The setting constrains the final tactic—only here can mist be woven—so 9+ gate met. Minor slip: “world exhaled a constant, shimmering mist” edges toward postcard, but immediacy returns with tactile drift-weed of color-threads.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystalline chamber, star-shard floor, salt-dark net—details are filtered through restorer’s professional eye for texture and fracture. Spatial choreography holds: apex net, adjacent knot, shared breath, needle passed. The prism sanctuary literally focuses the “interlaced hush,” so setting constrains the ritual and charges the ending image of starlight “less frantic.”

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault functions as micro-setting that literally houses the hidden rectangle; its lichen skin is a mutable prop whose altered state triggers the decisive insight. Archival glue scent, projector hum, and cool air are filtered through Elara’s conservator gaze, anchoring POV bias. Spatial choreography is flawless—projector beam, frozen frames, pen tip all tracked. The vault’s evolution across two film eras is the only environmental change and it directly constrains her final choice, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is the micro-environment of the library and the snow globe itself; both constrain every manipulator-arm move and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (sonar fluke, velvet fused by heat). Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies/objects track. The globe’s internal light is the setting detail that reconfigures meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    The courtyard is not backdrop but circuitry: pearl-stone conductivity, receptacle seam, cloud-sea ground. The bolt plate itself is the micro-setting that dictates gesture and final image; mist swells into Lyra’s bloom, charging the closing beat. Spatial choreography is pixel-clean—slot, beam, wall, warm metal in palm.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Icebound spire and crystal elevator function as micro-setting: the ascending cage mechanically paces revelation and literally supplies the angled light that decrypts the diary. Goggles act as tool-setting hybrid; their optical physics constrain decryption and charge the final image when Kael removes them and words vanish again. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—glacial shell, weightless lurch—integrated into action rather than catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: diary, goggles, vellum tracked across laps and pockets without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Gondola micro-setting constrains every choice—limited oxygen, no steering, telescope the only tool. Brass telescope’s chill and the indigo void act as body-extensions; spatial choreography is flawless: sweep lower, twist knob, lower again. Sensory selection warps under altitude: sound reduced to pen-scratch, sight magnified to fractal ice. Final image reuses the dusty starlight motif now charged with memory, making environment charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tree-trunk library is not backdrop but tool: its concentric rings become the combination interface, its heartwood the final lens. Micro-setting success—dust motes, rot scent, light-eating knot—constrain Elara’s movements and supply the literal circuitry for the sky. Spatial choreography immaculate: every shelf, shelf-shadow, and groan of superstructure tracked. Environment charges the final image: the living grain becomes star-veins; without this oak the cosmos cannot be soldered to mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Airship is sketched via brass fittings, aging canvas, lantern-lit hold—selective, not touristic. The hopscotch board functions as micro-setting: its worn squares physically constrain Elias’s knees and later his interpretive leap, qualifying for 9+ gate. Starlings supply kinetic scale that mirrors internal revelation. Only gap: engine-oil scent is dropped once and never re-accessed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Frozen library above clouds is not postcard scenery—it supplies the literal frost that seals the Orrery and demands the eclipse counter-move. Micro-setting of the obsidian vial acts as portable void, constraining the only tactic that can succeed. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies, mirrors, gear, and planetary arms remain trackable. Hauntingly bright light is returned to as thermal, visual, and moral pressure—earns its descriptor every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dust that "tasted like rust and regret," floating rock arches, and the seized bronze bell are tactile, selective, and filter through survivor priorities. The bell’s silence and eventual resonance reweight the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent during the arch climb. A couple of tourist-catalog lines ("immense, silent rock arches") slightly dilute economy.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse lens functions as both environment and tool, constraining the only possible action—light-embroidery—while dusk star-loss externalizes Elias’s internal fading. Micro-setting inside the lantern room keeps bodies and objects spatially coherent; the crystal’s hum and dusting into motes evolve with the plot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: the hush is felt between atoms, not heard. The missing star-field is never described generically; its absence is the final atmospheric cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Copper-etched mechanical birds, frost filigree on granite, and the “drop of solidified night” nut are tactile, selective, and filter through Elias’s practiced eye. The cliffside perch and lethal frost constrain timing and tool-use, charging the final frozen armor image. Spatial choreography is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ravine, milkweed stalk, chrysalis, and granite slab are all tactile, POV-filtered, and physically interacted with; the braided channels literally constrain where Aris can walk and think. Final image of canyon-as-cathedral is charged by the prior “Lena’s cathedral” cue, re-weighting the setting from tomb to nave.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystalline floor, glass trees, and bottled moonlight are not ornamental: the smooth unbroken tree materially constrains the final act—only its flawless surface can receive the inaugural wound. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elian’s priorities—soundless bells, refracted absence—so description never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track his path from shop to orchard to heart-tree without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Desert fortress, rain-scoured flagstones, and the frigid coral spire are rendered through Kaelen’s chef-tactile lens: temperature, texture, scent drive every beat. The ephemeral puddle “language” and frost-rimed coral constrain his choices—he reads, then acts. Micro-setting (fossil, kitchen pin, frozen motes) functions as environment that alters tactics. Final image of white powder merging with sand recharges the opening bruised-creosote air with new, lighter dust.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Starlit clock-tower chamber, brass console armature, and dense iron cuckoo weight are tactile, selective, and constrain the final calibration. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Spatial choreography holds as Elias hooks the weight, nudges dial, listens—no impossible moves. The micro-setting (weight as pendulum) directly charges the closure image when it hangs “perfectly still,” satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canyon walls as “pages of stone,” moonlight as “silver ink” filter through Elara’s engineer-poet perception and literally guide her choice of hiding place. The rock hollow’s hum of salvage and wind stays tactile, lived-in. Mirror shard evolves from prop to neural portal—meets 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The inverted grotto is not backdrop but obstacle course: footing, stalactite pillars, upward-falling water droplets force Kael’s floating parkour. The vellum-cum-retina tool literally reframes vision, turning fungi into star-map; this body-tool coupling charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—only touch (damp stone), sight (phosphorescent lines), and kinaesthesia survive. Spatial choreography is exact; no impossible positions across the scramble.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    The porcelain insulator constrains every tactical choice and is palpably present in the final image; the stress-cracked Old One functions as micro-setting that dictates the entire score. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sound is texture, light is angle of grain, cold is porcelain density. Weather (“cool air that followed the hedgehog”) is both calendar and metronome. No static cataloging; each detail is filtered through the need to find a resonant site.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Obsidian ridge, purple sun, tooth-aching magnetism—sensory triangulation is vivid and selective, filtered through a chess-master’s taxonomic eye. The nexus functions as micro-setting: its magnetic pauses literally provide the “squares” Kaelan plays on, constraining his method and final revelation. Weather and geography evolve with the eclipse, mirroring internal shift without symbolic overstatement. Missing 9 only because the stone’s physical texture is under-used mid-story; one more tactile beat would have locked the object-as-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The workshop’s ozone-and-paper scent, velvet-cushion center, and calipers-on-brass micro-moves texture every beat; the pin-prick stars outside mirror the interior “velvet fabric” of night, converging in the final glass-rattle under fireworks. The diary-as-micro-setting constrains the climactic action and charges the final label. Only a hairline slip: fireworks’ physics (concussive blast) is noted once, not exploited for tactic change.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The treetop village is not postcard scenery; swaying bridges and neighbor chimes become visceral obstacles during the wind assault, constraining her ability to shelter the seed. Micro-settings—terratta pot, moss cradle, wrapping-paper canvas—are handled in tactile, lived-in ways that alter tactics (she can’t flee the stench because escape means dropping the pot). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: every odor is filtered through her hyper-nose and ranked by threat to the seed. Final image of “wildflower hush” is environment-as-emotional-state, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is never backdrop: inverted river functions as reversible road, floating geode as vault of memories, droplets as ticking clock. Skiff and arrow tip act as micro-setting that constrain maneuvering and sampling. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot’s priorities—engine note, instrument vibration, canopy sight-lines—never tourist catalogue. Final image of glowing shard inside insect-chirp quiet re-weights whole journey.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The haze-taste, steel towers, and salt-rust grit are filtered through Kaelen's professional hunger for signatures; every sensory detail is selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography is flawless: containers stacked seven high, intersection stain, upward sensor tilt all track cleanly. The refrigerated-unit micro-setting literally delivers the patch that pivots the plot, satisfying the 9+ gate. No world-rule drift; port city silence feels lived-in rather than tour-guide.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ice cavern, sinew-threaded frozen bells, and aurora slit constrain Kael’s precise choreography; every sonic hue is yoked to a celestial color, fusing setting with instrument. Selective sensory economy (“tasted of new grass…smelled of lavender”) keeps density high without cataloguing. The cavern’s hush-as-pressure and the aurora’s shifting spectrum supply the final charged image, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice and coloring the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon is not backdrop but pressure system: the “avalanchingly quiet” atmosphere constricts breath and timing, forcing Kaelen to play a whisper-question instead of a command. Driftwood, body, and flute together form a micro-setting that literally channels “unseen currents”; their arrangement determines whether the veil opens or seals. Sensory selection narrows to touch and hearing under crisis—no visual fireworks, only heat-haze shimmer that softens stone edges. The final image charges the same environment with felt cost: the empty silence now “holds his understanding,” reweighting the canyon from courtroom to repository.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The workshop’s honeyed topaz and iron letterpress function as micro-setting: their glow guides attention, creaking platen supplies the decisive tool, crystallized light is literally “handled” in two beats and returns as the charged final lens-flare. Star-death interval tightens the clock. Sensory triangulation (visual honey, auditory clacks, kinesthetic press-thud) filters through Elias’s engineer gaze; no filler description. Spatial choreography holds across lever-pull and card extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ridgeway shale, breath-plume, aurora river—selective, cold, tactile. The pendant itself becomes micro-setting when its vibration alters time and space. Crystalline garden is the final environmental charge that crystallizes choice. Weather and altitude remain consistent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz arbor, frosted windshield, and prism micro-setting constrain every tactical angle of the light experiment; frost patterns literally dictate the final knowledge. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—cold glass, spectral splash, metallic snap—never tourist catalog. Environment evolves with causal event (ice thickens as night deepens). One minor drift: “pale, crystalline stone he had built” repeats quartz image; could trim.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orchard/bamboo grove functions as micro-setting that isolates and quietens; loom grooves and amber bead are tactile tools that constrain every motion. Sensory economy favors hush, rustle, cool amber—selective, never catalog. Spatial choreography clean: bead travels from neck → palm → tapestry hollow. Setting mirror works via “raveling silence” without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating stone arches, petrified dust, geode lattice—details are filtered through Elian’s smith/orchard eye; visual and tactile hierarchy obey his priorities. Environmental pressure is real: dust ruins fruit, blue veins restore it. Micro-setting of silk-as-conduit constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly down shaft and back. Final image of arch “solid grace” recharges earlier crumbling motif. Tool (cold forge) could have constrained more on-page, else 9.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The repair bay is not backdrop but instrument: gantry geometry guides line-of-sight for shard-gazing, concrete temperature cues urgency, and residual coolant scent flags the breach moment. Spatial choreography stays clean as Kael shifts from floor-sit to energy-channel push. The shard itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the final tactic. One minus: “abandoned spaceport” status is declared, not exploited for social context or further physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Spray-choked skiff, iron stair cut into cliff, and the hulking Fresnel receive only the sensory detail the crisis warrants—no tourist catalogue. The oilskins, cobalt shard, and stone stacks function as micro-setting that literally guide choices and encode meaning. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist, forcing mooring in cove and slick ascent. Environment charges the final image: circle of stones on the same shore where earlier pyramids spoke.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Emerald Lighthouse, obsidian cradle, cosmos of silent stars—selective, urgent sensory hierarchy. The glass wick functions as micro-setting: its facet angles constrain every tactical choice and charge the final white-hot nova image. Environment mirrors interior: the bruised violet storm echoes his manic ecstasy. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating tea-house is sketched with tether-chains, valley mist, and eastern-window sun angle; each detail later constrains the chalk-trail experiment. Micro-setting mastery: the morpho wing on dark wood becomes the lens that reframes color theory. Spatial choreography clean—patrons’ hush, steam curls, her hand-over-heart exit—no floating bodies. Weather thickens across the season, cueing the final mist exit. Meets 9+ gate: the wing/tool charges the final image; only the absence of tactile tea-house routine keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower, storm, and broken sextant constrain every tactical move: rain drives him inside, cracked lens enables dream-mapping, moonlit aperture heals the shard. The sextant’s brass spiderweb is the micro-setting that literally refracts choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no object drifts or teleports. Only the forest’s off-stage existence prevents the 9+ gate—environment does not charge the final image, it merely frames it.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is protagonist: the greenhouse’s breathing flora supply light, lyric, and final sun-matter. Recurring mica window refracts the dawn, literalizing the abstract. Sensory economy favors bioluminescent particulates and dew—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; body, plant, and orb positions track through the vortex swirl. World rules (alchemical songs = operative physics) established early and paid off without late cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Athenaeum is evoked through scent, weight, and the hush of “dormant knowledge,” all filtered through Elias’s sensory priorities. The laundromat façade is named once and never used to constrain choice, so the “hidden-in-plain-sight” promise stays decorative. Micro-setting of oak table and green-shaded lamp does charge the final image when the invitation is re-placed there. More tactile negotiation with shelves or exits would have nudged this past 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting is literal: the crumbling marble and ivy-choked statue constrain where she can lever mortar gaps, guiding trowel placement and seed choice. The petrified rye heel functions as portable setting-in-hand; its mapped crumb links to vanished bakery interiors and charges the final image when returned to bag “like a fossil.” Weather is not backdrop but tactical—it “bites deeper,” forcing the cloak and the guard’s early dusk patrol, tightening the encounter. Spatial choreography is spotless; guard’s shadow precedes his boots on named flagstones, bodies remain tracked through one contiguous courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen library is not backdrop but active constraint: the hoarfrost floor forces quiet footfalls, the casket marked “Extinguished” literalizes failure, and the cloud-sea below provides the visual proof that memory has already fallen away. Micro-setting objects—the resonator’s spun-silver cradle, the dead slide now “simple glass”—track state change precisely. Spatial choreography is clean: vault → apparatus → window → ledger. Atmosphere modulates from “quartz hush” to “more absolute” silence, mirroring the vow’s fade without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brine, mildew, phosphor-kelp stall, and splintered crate are filtered through Elara’s thief-senses and guide her stealth choices. The pier’s rotting geometry is tracked without spatial drift; the recorder as micro-setting constrains the final tactic. Weather (rising tide) mirrors ticking clock but never alters physical possibility. Enough specificity to reach high band, though not quite charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bluff’s crushed lavender, airborne ozone, and auroral curtain are filtered through Elara’s meteorological palate, never touristic. Micro-setting of the tin ring in her fist acts as a tactile compass-stand-in that constrains her method and recharges at closure. Spatial choreography stays clean as three carriers ascend from distinct paths. Weather is not backdrop; it is the decisive medium that externalizes her epistemic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal refraction sequence literally unlocks the box; cave light filters every beat, from shimmering floor to phosphorescent pigment, constraining the final choice and charging the tear’s glint—setting is agent, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse city’s recycled air and ochre smog remain a constant pressure filter, while the fern on the workbench functions as micro-setting that constrains Elian’s perception of customers. The arboretum’s cool purity is a tactile reversal of that pressure, charging the closure image. Details are selective, lived-in, and never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bluff, cloud-sea, and ice lenses are not backdrop but instruments; the mobile’s spatial choreography is tracked to the millimeter. The sun catching the thinning shards at crescendo is the micro-setting beat that re-weights all earlier detail, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The desert rose farm under a glass sky is not backdrop; its crystalline facets “cut light” and later vaporize a dome pane, making setting an active accomplice. Micro-setting objects—obsidian shard, silent bell, dried petal—function as childhood’s mineral surrogates, each reweighted when compressed into the final jewel. Spatial choreography is flawless: box placed at formation’s base, energy beam angled through the same lattice that will fracture. Sensory hierarchy stays robotic: ozone, static, “abrasive shock to my sensors,” never warm-blooded poetry.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Courtyard is sketched via coffee scent, damp earth, brick wall—selective, not touristy. The locket doubles as micro-setting and constraint, its filigree literally shaping the final act, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as neighbors orbit Elias. Weather mention (“dawn”) is brief but sufficient for timing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Quartz-glass walls, nutrient-light pulses, and the bone dice’s chill are filtered through Elara’s coder-tactile attention; the sunken lab’s pressure hum constrains her pacing and finally modulates into the mother’s chord, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Salt crystals act as micro-setting: they refract lamplight into “a thousand shivering stars,” forcing Silas to shield his eyes and orient by sound, then serve as the slate for the coffee-ground map. The whale-stink and brine drip are tactile, never touristic. Spatial choreography is tight: ladder descent, lamp placement, hand sinking into thickened air. Only the town itself stays a sketch; the chamber and dock are enough to constrain every move.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The brook, moonlight, and origami wing function as micro-setting: the wing anchors the magic, the water provides the baseline silence, and both constrain her posture and ritual. Detail is selective, sensuous, and filtered through her priorities; spatial choreography is immaculate. The environment never evolves or pushes back, so the 9+ gate (environment must constrain final tactics) is missed, but atmosphere is vivid and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the co-protagonist: drafts under doors, chipped plaster as argument, sun-bleach as cat testimony—each detail is filtered through Clara’s architectural POV and later revealed as Elias’s literal body. The rooftop garden during the Perseids supplies the only open sky in the piece, letting the cosmic scale mirror the building’s memory scale; the seal pressed into the planter’s soil gives a micro-setting object that physically anchors the closure. Spatial choreography is flawless (7B door crack, hallway palm-press, rooftop ivy pot) with no white-room gaps. For 9+, the environment could have constrained a tactical choice on the roof (e.g., trellis blocking escape), but it already charges the final image enough to land near ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Garden’s velvet dusk, muffling moss, and crystal spires that “sang memories” ground every beat; setting choices constrain posture (muffled steps, physical alignment with spire) and supply the extraction tool. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and auditory murmur, matching POV’s introspective bias. Micro-setting object—seashell—guides hand placement and literally unlocks plot. Final image of vanishing star integrates time, place, and emotional cost. No geographic or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Arctic marble, aurora light, and iron-gall ink are filtered through Kaelen’s selective attention; every detail constrains temperature, tool choice, and bodily risk. The rose thorn functions as micro-setting: its curve dictates the precise serif he can carve. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible hand or scroll positions across the slow-motion prick. Final image of stalactites dripping into “a peace he had wisely, and treasonously, forged” recharges the opening pearl twilight with new, colder weight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Serpentine nexus under starlight” is never decorative; the stone corridors literally guide her steps and constrain the acoustics that must match the crystal’s frequency. The seashell half functions as micro-setting: its temperature change against her palm marks the moment the universe’s hum clarifies. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions. The final crystal formation is seeded early by shape, so when it charges the ending the image feels inevitable, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ice shrine, candle flicker, million-year cold—each detail is filtered through Elara’s salvage urgency, not tourism. The melted snow globe constrains her tactics: its distortion dictates the dream-route she must map. Spatial choreography is immaculate: globe shelf, control panel heat source, final shake inside dream. Setting charges the final image: the globe’s new stillness mirrors the released souls.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Micro-settings (whispering parapet, moonlit cobble mirrors, living loom of meadow) are not backdrop but tactical guides: each pool reflection literally steers footfalls toward climax. The bamboo whisk’s 100 tines and the tar-scented shuttle charge the final image when re-seen as “whistling” tools. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kaelen’s professional eye—knots, tines, broken moon geometry—so environment constrains choice without tourist cataloging. No spatial drift; bodies tracked cleanly from parapet to meadow center and back.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dust-coated exterior versus green orchard is sketched in three sensory strokes; the antenna, diamond, and shimmering circle function as micro-setting that directly enables the final discovery. Spatial choreography is flawless—every object stays tracked from belt to rooftop to ground. The constraint gate for 9+ is met: the orchard’s anomalous fertility and the pinpoint circle physically shape Kaelen’s tactics and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Spire, portico, and storm are tactile resources—lightning through cobalt glass literally re-patterns the alien map, constraining the final choice. Micro-setting (observatory console, velvet dust) guides hand placement and tactile discovery. Sensory economy favors immediacy; no static catalogue. Final gold vs blue re-colors prior motif with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Driftwood ribcage, salt-bleached timbers, porthole stripe on sand—selective sensory triage rooted in the poet’s scavenger gaze. Micro-setting dominates: the box’s swollen mahogany and tarnished silver physically block restoration, steering him toward sonic alchemy. Marram grass, razor-clam edges, foghorn hum act as tactile tools that constrain which sounds can be harvested. Final image—pearlescent shell atop a mute box—recharges every prior coastal particular, making the loft itself the instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop: shifting floes’ groans supply the very sound-waves Elara weaponizes; the crystalline containment field refracts the same light that bled across the opening, charging the final image. Body-level setting (boot soles as sensors) and tool-level (star-forged key) constrain every turn—no move is made without vibrational contact through metal or stone. Spatial choreography is flawless: gallery → spiral stair → bedrock crypt; distances contract as tension rises. Selective sensory economy (sound, cold, vibration) keeps detail purpose-driven and never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and rain-slick viaduct are not backdrop but instruments: the lake locks the world into stillness necessary for alignment; the viaduct’s wet skin becomes the mirror that focuses Lyra’s reflection into a harmonic weapon. Spatial choreography is flawless—window scratch, bowl gimbal, console switch—each object handled on-page and altering next action. The Authority city is implied in flicker, saving words while maintaining scale. Environment passes 9+ gate by constraining the final tactical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel’s wet-earth/iron smell, the high-water mark on brick, and the distant train rumble are filtered through Elias’s investigator gaze and directly shape his evidence reading. The lantern functions as micro-setting: its corroded frame is handled twice and its clouded lens literally refracts the past, constraining Elias’s interpretation and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—boot prints, scuff marks, half-buried notebook all track. One sentence of weather cliché (“the sun never touches”) is the lone hairline slip keeping it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dust motes, brass teeth, and the storm-lit gutter are filtered through Arthur’s clerical eye, fusing sacramental hush with tactile repair-shop grit. The window’s “single, brilliant spear” is re-activated at closure, re-weighting the premise. While the broader city remains generic, the micro-setting of bench, gears, and puddles constrains the final metaphor and earns its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Acid sea, corroded platform, and arrow-tip kaleidoscope are not backdrop—they constrain every tool choice and supply the final anchor point. Brass eyepiece and whalebone struts track cleanly across spatial moves. Environment literally dissolves failure, so the suspended glider charges the image. No other setting could impose this specific physics.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archive is rendered as a lived-in body: “server noise,” “recursive code loops,” “corrupted cluster of music files” all double as cardiac telemetry for Elara’s hunt. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Elara’s trembling hands, Kael’s corporate-circle avatar shimmering behind her—every object is placed, never floats. The Seraphim-7 patch constrains the climax: its cool metal anchors the moral flip and recharges every prior numeric echo. One minor slip: “audio kernel” drifts toward tech-exposition without POV color, but it is brief and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes” is not postcard scenery: the grinding ice is the existential antagonist, the frayed anchor-line is tactile, cold narrows perception to breath-clouds and cracking rope. Apple boughs versus sea-ice create an impossible, memorable micro-setting that charges the final image of fragility. Spatial choreography is clean—crowd, Jorn, Mara, Kael’s body in the middle—no impossible moves. Milky quartz shard and clouded mirror function as setting-in-hand, constraining Kael’s only viable tactic; removal would collapse the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure engine: splintered pier denies stable footing, diesel-salt wind erodes performative grief, calving ice sonically performs the release she seeks. Micro-setting of the parasol tip in gloved palm equally constrains—its blunted filigree a tactile reminder that her own “point” is already dulled. Spatial choreography stays clean as she moves from yacht carcasses to mud slurry. Final image reuses environment as emotional tuning fork, earning high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amber pavilion, slanted autumn light, and ferment-scented air are filtered through viticulturist perception, grounding exposition in sensory labor. Micro-setting (brittle paper edge, cypress shade) doubles as metaphor engine, constraining interpretation of the breakup. Spatial choreography is minimal yet sufficient; no geography drifts. Weather and season mirror internal thaw without overt symbolism. Professional detail (Mourvedre vs Grenache needs) is accurate and choice-relevant, charging the thematic analogy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Desert and machine are rendered through Kael’s bodily attention—sand drag, ceramic cool, lens glow—never catalogued. The parapet itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the finale; without its obsidian rings the sealing is impossible. Spatial choreography is flawless: spiral descent, center stance, sphere coalescence. Sensory hierarchy narrows to breath and light under pressure, matching the whisperfield calm.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lavender sea and rusted factory are not backdrop but tools: the lavender scent displaces coal smoke in the first paragraph, enacting the very transmutation Elias seeks. Micro-setting inside the map-case—photographs as portable geography—supplies the tactile constraint that keeps Elias kneeling season after season. Spatial choreography is impeccable: case → plank → overlapping prints → final spiral tracked visually. The factory vines reach the roof at the exact beat the mosaic closes, charging the final image with environmental inevitability; setting passes the 9+ gate but caps at 8.1 because the lavender itself never actively alters a tactical choice—it embodies the achieved stasis rather than testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Shadowed library, dawn cold, Bohemian glass, Isfahan rug—selective sensory triads establish preserved hush without cataloging. Micro-setting rules: the crystal itself becomes the terrain that constrains every next move. Light prism and “suspended hush” echo in final image, charging the closing beat. Spatial track clean: chandelier → rug → chair, no impossible jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog garden is not backdrop but instrument: it swallows sound, enforces slowness, and supplies the altar-slab where the final act occurs. Micro-setting objects—chalk, driftwood markers—constrain navigation and choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Silas’s bias: magnetic-tape metaphors, copper-wire synesthesia. Final image reuses condensation-slick basalt, now charged with the echoed hum he once sought to trap.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cracked portal window, moon’s white face, and brass hand become tactile constraints that guide the final alignment. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s lens-centric worldview—visual precision over sound until the leaf-falling hush. Micro-setting (the hub’s magnetic field) directly shapes the decisive action. Environment charges the final image: the motionless hand silhouetted against the moon.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory rock, brass automaton, and key-rings function as micro-setting triad that every tactical decision rubs against. Light vs. folded-darkness is not backdrop but apparatus that enables the final projection; environment dictates method. Sensory economy obeys POV bias—only optic and tactile details that bear on rune topology survive. This is textbook “tool-as-setting” that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hedge maze operates as environmental crucible: walls funnel to single focus, dirt under roses delivers the box; spatial choreography holds from trowel-clink to kneel. Rowan-wood grain, moon-petal wilt, velvet fade all filter through Elias’s taxonomic healer gaze—selective, tactile, grief-narrowed. Secret garden functions as micro-setting that literally disgorges proof, forcing the epistemic pivot. Only reason not 9+: setting never actively resists or wounds him; it offers, doesn’t constrain.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine grotto is not backdrop but tool: mist swallows stars, forcing earthbound craft; damp stone supplies the leather strip’s grit; walls curve protectively only after the glow reveals them. Micro-setting (body, glass, leather) constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—salt-taste, cool air, cataract-dull surface—never tourist catalog. Final image recharges the grotto itself as luminous map.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The moss-covered racks, drip metronome, and sunlit slate form a micro-ecology that literally guides choice: the pattern she reads becomes the argument she proffers. Sensory triangulation—petrichor, velvet moss, amber warmth—keeps the body inside the machine. Spatial choreography is clean: aisle walk, pendant transfer, slate gesture track without drift. Final image (moss in crevices) recharges setting as living circuitry, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The spiral shell’s micro-setting functions as setting; its broken edge constrains the kneeling gesture that resolves the arc. Mist and damp earth are selective, never generic; “swirling hush” returns as tonal shorthand that tightens to the final breath. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, press, bury—no floating white-room. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and aural, mirroring the POV’s narrowed crisis attention.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Verdant arbor is rendered through living detail—latticed roof, central post, vine lineage—rather than catalog; weathered wood and golden lattice constrain the only possible stage for the ritual. Sensory layering (chill air, luminous coin-moon, soil-thrum) is selective and tied to POV attention. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track as Elian moves. Setting does not cap a tactic but the arbor itself becomes the vessel that must accept the memory infusion, so it charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Subarctic crater orchard is never backdrop: the frozen soil dictates Kaelen’s kneeling posture, the “brittle twigs” become arrhythmic arteries, the rust flakes color the map’s blood-toned paths. Micro-setting (his own chilled marrow, the copper plate’s bite) constrains the tactile sequence. Only the city’s streets are off-stage abstraction, but that absence is intentional—Kaelen’s never seen them. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the final ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marble cavern, steel pins, fissured skylight—all tactile, specific, and causally active: the geometry literally rewrites the machine. Selective sensorial hierarchy (pale shaft, faint glints, low hum) mirrors Elian’s peripheral attention instead of tourist catalogue. Setting constrains every tactical move: he can’t speed the sun, must work within the slow sweep, so time and stone become antagonist. Final quartz facet throwing golden light on wall is closure-charged micro-setting, earning the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bronze walls, star-drilled ceiling, and the burner’s brass teeth are not postcard flourishes—they limit Kaelen’s reach and literally hold the stone at the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and weight, mirroring the thematic obsession with heft. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the burner is lowered, tipped, and the stone placed without floating props. Micro-setting (burner gallery) functions as crucible, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rain-beaded skylight loft functions as both macro-environment and micro-setting: the kettle’s shrill crescendo and the overhead rain create spatial pressure that times the carving decision. The ash blank acts as portable setting/object; its cool solidity and fresh-cut scent constrain hand movement and mark irreversible change. Sensory economy is precise—three senses interleave without catalog. The loft’s isolation mirrors her interior isolation, charging the final silence. Meets 9+ gate: the blank’s altered state directly shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The kinetic lagoon and crystallized rail are not backdrop but instruments of pressure: the drop forces Kael to kneel, the mist swirls counter-clockwise to mock the halted ride, and the plastic wheel’s teeth are sharp enough to cut—tactile danger that constrains how he handles memory. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: an engineer notices gyroscopic ozone, not tourist color. Spatial choreography is airtight; the wheel is found exactly where a tourist would have dropped it beside the exit rail. Only capped at 8.9 because the lagoon never re-enters the final beat; it frames but does not directly charge the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Electro-chromic ceiling as living star-map is the dominant environment; it literally reconfigures at closure, charging the final image. Micro-setting tools—greasy napkin, tarnished brass slot—constrain action: only that shard fits. Spatial choreography is clean: drift of confetti, gantry climb, floor-center stance all track. Ozone/popcorn mix ties carnival ghost to spaceport decay in one sniff, economical and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crystal forecourt is not backdrop but tactile constraint: wet slate soaks trousers, droplets mirror nascent light, spatial center anchors the ritual. Weather (post-rain) determines the hush’s timbre and the exact shimmer that transfigures the bells. Micro-setting (lead coffer, thumb-sized bells) doubles as emotional architecture. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible moves across the single open square.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Golden Dock, snow, receding fog, and fulgurite glass form a micro-setting quartet that constrains every action: cold narrows finger dexterity, fog enforces isolation, fulgurite’s weight limits viewing angles, dock’s end removes retreat. Selective sensory economy—visual whites, haptic stiffness of rope, oceanic hush—mirrors Elias’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: rope section laid flat, glass lifted to eye, journal positioned on planks. Final image of fog withdrawal recharges the opening palette, reconfiguring stakes from entombment to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Autumn garden is not backdrop but instrument—cold bench sharpens physical attention, decay scent mirrors thread’s faded dye, wisteria skeleton frames final “mournful fire.” Thread-as-micro-setting constrains the only path to Elara; without it, projection collapses. Selective sensory hierarchy avoids tourist catalog; only three smells, two colors, one texture earn page space. Meets 9-gate but for absence of lived-in tool manipulation beyond initial cradle.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The suspended palace, dripping stalactites, and geothermal vent are not backdrop but tools: the vent powers the incubator, the height isolates, the dripping signals time. The egg’s phosphorescent shards function as micro-setting, constraining every assembly hypothesis. Spatial choreography is clean—Kaelen kneels, shuffles back, watches the crack propagate upward. Environment charges the final image: the city’s halted pistons mirror the stalled heart of the observer.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian lagoon and charred banyan are not backdrop but tools: lagoon provides the talismanic sand that reframes at the end; the banyan’s “vast canopy crown of fire” literally becomes the graft site that charges closure. Sensory hierarchy follows firefighter POV—smoke density, heat signatures, trunk-scar assessment—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the two shards; distances (lagoon → Ridge Road → banyan) track. Environment constrains: only scorched limb is reachable, dictating graft choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Orrery’s cracked bowl, fallen leaves, and shattered oculus are not backdrop but instruments that constrain every move; the pedestal discoloration is the literal pivot point. Light, dust, and spiral-shadow are tracked with spatial coherence across each micro-rotation. The goose flats outside the walls act as environmental clock, tightening the window. Environment charges the final image: the white spiral of light on dry marble is the city’s memory made visible, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nebula garden is more than postcard: hydrogen veils and falling-petal light-motes constrain visibility and timing, shaping the sonar method. The gear’s impossible solidity against the gaseous backdrop supplies the micro-setting prop that forces the conceptual pivot. Selective sensory hierarchy—cold nullity versus swirling color—mirrors the emotional shift from scarcity to emission.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Greenhouse glass, damp-earth rot, and monarch flight paths are filtered through Elias’s stone-carver eye (texture first, color second). The bench, slate, and ribbon function as micro-setting that literally supports every beat; their spatial relations stay coherent. Weather moves from orange-winged calm to pane-rattling storm, tightening the final image of a web that must “endure” like the glass. No credibility stumbles; greenhouse botany and carving tools read accurate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Brass, gear-oil, salt-spray, obsidian shards, and pendulum weight are filtered through Elias’s professional gaze; each sensory pick is purposeful, never tourist. The tidal ridge memory is anchored to present touch (torn-hand scar) and constrains the moral calculus—release must happen above those same waves. Micro-setting object—the rake handle—literally carries the town’s grief and charges the final image when Elias imagines it swallowed by the tide. Tool-body-environment triad all constrain choice and meet the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The silo’s “velveteen gloom,” the tapestry’s “language of knots,” and the lantern’s silver spill are selectively deployed so that every sensory detail either impedes or enables the deciphering action. The cobalt curve and star charts literally guide the final placement of the shelf, so the micro-setting charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Proper-noun economy is flawless: only “Whisperwind Ridge” is named and it is the promised destination. Spatial choreography is invisible but irrelevant—Elias never moves more than an arm’s length—so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Obsidian spire, milk sky, and blank frozen lake compress macro-world into tactile pressure. The kingfisher quill operates as micro-setting, a portable shard of habitable color that constrains the final gesture. Spatial anchors (“stood at the summit…below him…”) fix position within 50 words, sustaining choreography. Environment charges closure: the act of writing on white vellum mirrors thawing the lake—setting becomes instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember alcove, mist-pressed window, and jade dial glow function as micro-setting: every sensory beat is filtered through Elias’s copyist eye—stone niche geometry, vellum tooth, shortwave hiss. Spatial choreography is exact: knees folded, spine straight, pot lifted from hollowed book; no object drifts or teleports. Weather outside (cool gray mist) lingers as accomplice, never symbolically over-declared. The radio dial’s color wavelength literally enables the closure image, passing the 9+ gate by constraining the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery’s ventilation whisper and scorched-brick kiln are not backdrop but tools that constrain how Elara performs the ritual; the kiln’s heat literally enables the powdering. The shattered-porcelain mask sits within “veins of gold” that catch light—an object whose reweighted meaning is foreshadowed when Kael is drawn to its “painful beauty,” prefiguring his own future breakage. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the urn’s tilt, the shaft of sunlight, and the chair’s deceleration are tracked in one coherent arc. The rocking chair functions as micro-setting whose slowing gear is the final clock that forces the scattering decision.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sewer-gallery is evoked through tactile micro-setting: “dry cistern ledge,” “brackish drip,” “chalky residue of dissolved plaster”—each detail pulls double duty as both texture and archaeology. Spatial choreography is flawless; the girl’s silhouette against the gray light orients the vertical axis of drowned city vs. underworld in one beat. The brass cog operates as portable setting, constraining Silas’s fingers and future choices. Only the Sun-Kissed shore remains generic postcard; because the story never climbs there, the omission is strategic, not lacuna.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    The velvet library and autumn window are vivid but mostly backdrop; the zither rosette functions as micro-setting and is the only object that constrains a choice. Spatial choreography in the circle-breathing scene is clean and tactile. Sensory balance favors visual; more air-movement or bodily contact could elevate. Setting does not evolve with events, but the carved-air metaphor charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rusted greenhouse, broken panes, twin moons—selective, atmospheric, filtered through chef’s senses. The greenhouse constrains movement and channels the celestial light that powers the plant; its decay mirrors the cultural rot he edits. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. The plant itself serves as micro-setting/tool, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lightning tower is not backdrop but live resource—rationed watts arc overhead while citizens queue, forcingSilas’s rationing choice. Ozone-sweet dusk and sun-bleed pollen compress the city’s sensory collapse into one inhalation. Spatial choreography is pristine: booth, window, box, tower axis never drift. The lacquer box serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Only micro-gap: no tactile description of the box’s weight in hand, a missed haptic beat that could have charged the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Salt-mud, bruised-lavender sky, and the jagged rhizome create micro-setting objects that constrain tactics (covert scent, tangible mis-placements). Spatial choreography is clean from rock garden to stoop to lawn. The “quiet bay in spring” never lapses into postcard; each sensory note is filtered through Elara’s bias against sterility. Final image—garish flamingo on perfect lawn—crystallizes the reconfiguration and is inseparable from the closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Forgotten underwater city is not backdrop but tactical environment—filtration membrane directly redirects sabotage to salvation. Bioluminescent flora and “crushed pearl / obsidian” paths are filtered through Mara’s shifting moral lens, anchoring sensory hierarchy. Garden constrains final choice: only because it lives does poisoning it become unthinkable, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Infinite staircase is not backdrop but active constraint: its absolute homogeneity forces Elian’s epistemic method and later redefines the canvas. Sensory selectivity—“thin, sterile air,” “whisper-faint echo”—mirrors emotional desiccation while staying POV-filtered. Micro-setting objects (dice, flint shard, stone risers) handled tactually across beats and charge the final image when chip becomes “key.” Spatial choreography remains clean through single POV; no impossible positions. Environment directly shapes the climax choice—step selection determines rupture locus—clearly satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: the clean air inside versus the smog canyon outside determines when Elias dares to open the glass and project outward. The moon’s filtered glow is not backdrop but catalyst—without it the visions and therefore the paintings do not occur. Spatial choreography is flawless: six canvases, ledge, spotlights, body stance tracked without drift. Final image of scattered lit windows reprises the moonlight motif at larger scale, charging closure. Meets 9+ gate; only a single generic “city hum” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Grotto, phosphor-moss, stone oven, and emerald lens are tactile and POV-filtered. The waterfall-as-ice-curtain evolves from spectacle to threat to sounding-board, directly enabling the sonic solution. Spatial choreography holds as the chorus moves to the frozen base. Micro-setting (lens in palm, bread steam) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Granite foundations, ozone brass, and the hunger stone’s pocked surface are tactically used: the stone’s vacuum literally drives the plot. The lighthouse’s curved walls echo the chronometer’s curves, mirroring the temporal inversion. Micro-setting qualifies: the yoyo-turned-gear constrains the final assembly beat. One minus: the black rocks “like bones of a forgotten leviathan” glances toward generic sublime; still, the setting charges the final image of the violet-void stone.</answer>

    <comment>Dominant stake—escape deterministic time—is signaled early and tightened once: the lever pull forecloses every future. Escalation is situational pressure: silence at low tide compresses choice to one irreversible act. No reversal, but the deepening (scars fading) makes the cost visceral. The tightening is efficient; however, the absence of any external antagonist or second option keeps the pressure curve from punching into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Funhouse macr0-setting is filtered through cursed perception: every rotting canvas glows with stolen joy, forcing tactical path choices. Micro-setting object—the clasp—constrains the final reversal and is tactilely handled twice. One hairline slip: “dust-furred pedestal” is the only non-POV sensory gift; all other detail is routed through protagonist’s warped lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.5)
    The driftwood raft’s creak-grid functions as both topography and instrument; every physical detail (salt-apple scent, heaving cedar spine) constrains where Kai can kneel and strike. The xylophone mallet operates as micro-setting—its felt head “softened and grayed” tracks tactile history and limits usable surface. Environment actively shapes tactics: wave timing dictates percussion tempo; orchard leaves become choral witnesses. Final image of timbers “humming with the memory of the storm’s song” reweights the whole spatial orchestra.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Shell-tower, salt-table, reed whistle, sun-bleached shimmer—every object is tactile and also semiotic (maps, music, warning). Turtle-city movement is learned through causal friction of grinding shells, never dumped. The watchers’ light acts as both geography and message, constraining Kaelen’s final tactic. Micro-setting qualifies: the cracked whistle literally changes the acoustic outcome and images the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Station rendered through selective decay: ivy-choked glass, cracked tiles, dust motes. Details funnel through Thorne’s curator eye, guiding bench distance, ticket grille, spatial anchoring. Ivy as living metaphor constrains the moral choice rather than ornamenting. Environment frames micro-movements and supplies the charged final image of suffocation, participating in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inkwell and the pavilion’s dome function as micro-setting that constrain every move: water depth dictates wading height, fissure size dictates vellum fold, brass chill dictates grip slip. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through surveyor training—he notes new “wounds” in stone before he registers his own scraped knuckles. Marsh mist, brackish scent, and groaning timber are not backdrop but immediate pressure: the mist swallows sound, the tide times the drop/retrieval, the drawbridge’s silhouette is the final locked gate. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: pack-unstrap → water-entry → pavilion base → fissure → surge → drop → surface → hut lamp.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    The phosphorescent moss is not mere scenery—it is the only usable light source, forcing Elias to contort his body and read the stamp match; environment literally shapes tactics. The crystallized-sealed drawer’s shriek sacrilege is the micro-setting’s audible cost, mirroring the archive’s larger sealed lie. Saline-treated paper, kelp-vellum, and leviathan-hide bind the city’s drowned identity to the tactile truth Elias unearths. Spatial choreography is flawless: from dome drip to shelf-base moss to secretary desk, every object’s distance tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the mnemonic gem doubles as tool and world-rule tutor; its stardust adheres to fingers, grounding physics. Spatial choreography across crystalline stairs is impossible yet coherent within taught anti-gravity logic. Final image recharges lotus-lantern + gem pair, reweighting their meaning from unfinished craft to grief engine. Tea garden returns as promised future, fulfilling closure gate for 9-track.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—shape grief into bearable form—tightens with each ascending step and abrasive facet; visible price paid in raw knuckles & inhaled gem dust. One meaningful deepening: polished dream reframes loss as current rather than void, foreclosing suicide or denial options. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible; missing 9.0 only because escalation is incremental rather than a single decisive reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Orbital observatory is sketched with spare, sensorial strokes—ticking capacitor bank, viewport curve—each filtering through Amal’s urgency. The geode micro-setting constrains her final choice by literally reflecting the coordinates. No spatial drift; bodies and objects stay tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory’s brass, stone, and weathered dome panels are filtered through pilot-POV: she notices seams, weight, corrosion. Dusk air and Lyra’s zenith are choreographed to force the drone’s spiral and the exact lens alignment. The dome iris becomes the micro-setting that literally reframes starlight onto her console—an object-as-setting that charges closure. Sensory economy is flawless; no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt terrace, bruised-purple dusk and sea-cast wood are selective, not touristic; each detail refracts Elias’ grief. The gouged oak functions as micro-setting and final constraint—its hollow groove literally channels the withheld truth into him. Weather and color serve as emotional corollary without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves between terrace, steps, and shore.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mist-salt-stone triad is filtered through Elias’s tongue and gloved fingers, never touristy. The spire’s height and exposure are continuously used to justify why treachery is impossible, hence why the moon ritual exists—setting shapes protocol. Micro-setting qualifies: the lion pull becomes the on-page terrain that must align with the flagstone recess. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies never occupy impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Salt-stink, bruised twilight, and lapping water are filtered through mariner senses—tide as accusation, horizon as jury. Micro-setting of the launch ramp (damp sand inches from boots) forces the final step. Compass brass and yellow kayak flash as charged objects inside the larger setting. Environmental mirroring is implicit: sky “bruised” matches his self-laceration without overt cue.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-settings (baseball, case, lake) constrain every beat; the lake’s bioluminescence literally lights the only path to the letter, charging the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent—beam of flashlight, wet-stone air—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless from fissure mouth to islet.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is not postcard backdrop: the moon-drenched orchard supplies the only venue where ritual can succeed, and its silver leaves and beasts serve as witnesses that literalize the reforged bond. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—scent is the magic vector, so saffron/cardamom/star-anise are foregrounded while visuals are filtered through lunar pallor. Micro-setting (his feather-scaled arms) becomes the final charged object. One minor slip: “zero-gravity star anise” is briefly world-rule breaking, but the line is single and does not disturb closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The midnight glade is more than postcard: the ozone air and phosphorescent moss constrain breath and movement, while the saucer’s crack functions as micro-setting that literally cuts Elara’s palm and later reframes breakage as character. Final image—fresh linen under starlight—recharges the setting’s scale, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the off-stage nursery remains a white-room blip.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Scrap-Ark is sketched with industrial ghosts—grated deck plates contracting in sympathy, microgravity core—just enough to anchor the body-weight piston that powers each beat. Kwan Yin’s Tear operates as micro-setting: its cool ovoid feel constrains how long Elara can stay inside a memory before she must float or sink. Sensory economy is tight; no tourist catalog of corridors. Final dome aperture inherits the metallic symmetry, so environment participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black glass sand, basalt circle, and tidal pool glyphs are handled, not catalogued; they guide Kael’s path and mirror the celestial alignment. The spiral shell functions as micro-setting that redirects plot; the empty bottles return in the final beat as relics of spent light. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual excess; no white-room lapses. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Phosphorescent algae-walls and moss-slick stone are filtered through Kael’s sentry priorities; sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and sound under blackout. Sundial as micro-setting constrains the key angles and charges the final image when its bare stone face becomes the fulcrum of revolution. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gate to courtyard to tower windows. Environment actively guides the clandestine action rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is sensory and selective: basalt under magnetic boots, frictionless sea, aurora as ceiling-river. The painted-stone spiral functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid, constraining the final placement of star dust. Spatial choreography is clean; eel-pen location and bluff edge remain trackable. Environment directly enables the gravitational hack—setting is not backdrop but actuator.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve the patterns and honor Elara—signaled early. Escalation is single but meaningful: the vision tightens from abstract tide to annihilating wall, forcing the star-dust gamble. Cost is visible: Kael’s slumped knees and the spiral’s near-loss. Coincidence absent; tide and aurora are external pressure, not savior.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory is sketched with cinematic economy—skull-dome, iron catwalk, dead-eye telescope—each detail later re-used (key fits the motor panel). Storm below is both vista and mirror, but never stalls action. Space is tracked cleanly; no floating bodies. Micro-setting (timer, negative) constrains the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass-atrium light and brook-murmur are filtered through Kaelen’s thinker-fencer dualism; the burnished brass arm catches sun in a way his flesh cannot, a micro-setting detail that later refracts the needle constellations onto marble. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every lunge and retreat is trackable against the sundial quadrants. The environment never actively threatens, so it supports atmosphere more than choice, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted library dome under a “sliver of bone” moon is not backdrop; the gaping entrance literally allows the drifters to enter and force choice. Starlight through the skeleton becomes the lighting by which the poem is read, charging the final image. The coffee tin’s false bottom is handled twice—first as ritual (“Time to plant the garden”), then as gift—so the micro-object alters tactics. Spatial choreography is exact: Elara “slides” the tin across the floor, Silas rises, steps forward, hand extended; no floating bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arbor is rendered through motion—bobbing lightwood, flowering vines brushing the keyboard—so the setting actively constrains posture and sound. The monochrome film strip against twilight clouds provides a sharp sensory contrast that charges the portal’s final white rectangle. Micro-setting (the piano lid as workbench, the pocket compass jittering) keeps geography intimate and tactile. No external reference is wasted; every detail either limits movement or supplies the next beat’s tool.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sky-plume blossoms, damp earth, and pollen scent constrain Elara’s posture and seed placement; impossible blue deepens to “painful vibrancy” in closure image, charging the stake. Micro-setting (seed, body, ridge crest) functions as tactile arena—every move is uphill, wind-shoved, rain-lashed. Spatial choreography clean; weather front tracked causally. Slight over-reliance on color adjectives keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory selection is POV-driven: salt air, velvet bed, granite underfoot, cerulean sky echoing Elara’s dress. The juniper, compass, and lace function as micro-settings that constrain action—every snip or knot matters. Spatial choreography is clean from cottage to bluff; weather (wind against tide) is integrated into the decisive beat. The environment does not merely mirror mood; the tide-turn literally triggers the compass behavior that reweights grief.

    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a charged micro-setting that constrains and shapes every choice. Sensory detail (silt smell, humidity as “physical weight,” grime on ferns) is filtered through Aris’s scientific bias yet evolves with his perception. The polycarbonate pane becomes both object and lens, culminating in the wiped circle—a tactile, spatially coherent gesture that charges the ending. Environment directly enables thematic insight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    The canyon isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes stakes: wind directs frost patterns that decode the ledger; cold enables revelation; isolation permits quiet archaeology. The cobalt shard on the windowsill functions as micro-setting, constraining the pivotal discovery. Sensory detail (ghost-heat, brittle charcoal, webbed ice) filters through Kaelen’s artist-perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. Final image charges the setting: melting frost becomes a transient map only she can read.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: its frosted panes become Elara’s score, directly enabling the climax. Thermal mapping ties environment to emotion—the glass’s cool blues contrast the cereus’s violet potential, charging every choice. Specificity avoids cliché: “chilled flagstones,” “humid air,” “velvet-lined tuning fork case” ground the world without stalling momentum. The setting constrains and catalyzes, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The broken lighthouse lens functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (only it can activate the astrolabe) and charging the final image. The underwater library’s basalt shelves and inert coral astrolabe are filtered through Elias’s professional gaze—undertaker as archivist of souls. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: early salt-stain and hum give way to crushing depth, then ethereal script on stone. Environment directly enables the climax; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: its skeletal frame becomes the stage for Elara’s vow and the garden’s birth. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven (“wind whistled through the clay pillars,” “scrape of hoes on hard earth”). The bell’s etching ties object to lost province, grounding memory in tactile specificity. Environment actively shapes choice—ridge location enables visibility, anonymity, and symbolic elevation—and the final image gains resonance from this charged spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The twilight viaduct isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its mist, jasmine, and ancient stones constrain Elara’s focus and charge the final revelation. The camera obscura functions as both tool and sanctum, its mechanics shaping perception and choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—moon-jasmine scent, cool air, veined petals—all serving the thematic pivot. The setting’s melancholy beauty mirrors her “foggy lucidity,” yet avoids overt symbolism by grounding emotion in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    The living bridge garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and amplifier. Hornbeam leaves flicker with dissolving memories; the yew-centered clearing is the geometric and emotional origin point. The hyperbolic maze physically mirrors Elias’s collapsing cognition and enables the final act. Crucially, the setting charges the ending: without the garden’s sentient greenness and non-Euclidean logic, the fragment couldn’t be neutralized, and the final image would lack its haunting poise.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prize redemption center functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: claw machines, Skee-Ball lanes, and ticket dispensers become tactical resources, not backdrop. Sensory detail (dust, rusted tin, vacant plush eyes) filters through Elara’s familiarity, avoiding tourist cataloging. The chain and piano bench are tactile anchors that evolve with action (bench moved to reveal panel). Final ray of light charges the setting with thematic resonance without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, salt-streaked glass, and skeletal shipwrecks aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints shaping Elias’s ritual and worldview. The setting charges the final image: shipwrecks shift from symbols of ruin to emblems of endurance only after the crystal is forged. Sensory specificity (moss’s bass hum, fish-scale chimes) filters through Elias’s synesthesia, making atmosphere inseparable from character perception. The micro-setting—the ashen forge—directly enables the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Emerald Station’s green-tinted glass actively shapes perception and meaning—filtering moonlight into spectral green that charges the jar’s luminescence and Silas’s epiphany. Setting functions as micro-setting: spatial choreography (rusted hatch → solitary pedestal) constrains access and amplifies sacred silence. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—visual dominance early gives way to tactile (“cool glass”) and proprioceptive (“weight... immense”) under pressure. Final image hinges on environmental specificity: without emerald glass, the moonbeams lack their transformative hue and symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned control room functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: rust, dripping pipes, tilting floor, and flickering warnings shape Elara’s urgency and eventual flight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—metallic tomb, wet earth, weak sunlight—filtered through her contemplative, artisan POV. The environment mirrors internal states without overt symbolism (e.g., melting ice ↔ thawing grief). The recurring object (bookmark) and tool (furnace) are tactile and charged, culminating in the final image where external warmth catalyzes internal change—directly fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ruined library under stars functions as micro-setting: girders enable height-based tension, encyclopedias conceal the cast, and the maintenance phone enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective—rusted metal, weak starlight, grime on plaster—and filtered through Leo’s stuntman attention to spatial risk. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* the final action beyond providing tools; it supports but doesn’t dictate tactics. Vivid yet slightly passive in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort isn’t backdrop but active crucible: granite shapes the wind into a “blade,” the stone slit frames the dying star, and cold flagstones ground Kaelen’s ritual. Sensory detail is purposefully narrowed—saline silence after waves, ice-thin pauses between howls—mirroring his perceptual focus. The flaking gold leaf booklet and ambered hush function as micro-settings that constrain choice (fragility demands precision) and charge the final image (gilded specks as embers). Every detail serves the Accumulative lens without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    The frozen courtyard isn’t backdrop but micro-setting: frost-crusted flagstones dictate movement, twilight governs sensor function, and the barren fountain spatially centers the anomaly. Sensory detail is selective (violet light, fractured rainbows) and filtered through machine perception. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the violin only appears at sundown—and charges closure: the empty dark after the loop breaks feels colder because we’ve lived 8,192 twilights. No white-room syndrome; every stone matters.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt” and wet park paths are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s perception, but setting rarely constrains choice—Elias could’ve followed Lena anywhere. The projector lens functions as micro-setting/tool, yet the environment itself doesn’t pressure decisions beyond mood. Sensory detail (jasmine, wet gravel) enhances atmosphere without shaping tactics, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The garden maze functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choices—its hidden rot, mossy sundial, and floral asymmetry constrain and reward Elias’s methods. Sensory detail (bees, cobalt butterflies, smoky quartz fractures) is filtered through his professional bias. The final image of the cracked marble on stone ties environment to theme. Every atmospheric element serves the central conflict, avoiding white-room or tourist-description pitfalls.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as both macro (gas giant, Great Plains of Xylos) and micro (the lever, hydraulic-stained hands, synth-caff tremors), all filtered through Elias’s sky-mechanic perception. The “hush of beating wings at rest” isn’t backdrop—it tightens the temporal window and charges the experiment’s stakes. Crucially, the station’s “icy warmth” and the device’s “mechanically warm energy” constrain the emotional palette and culminate in the final image where cold becomes cradle. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome, no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The flooded opera house isn’t backdrop but active constraint: water enables the ghost’s message yet threatens the artifact, forcing Elias’s pivotal choice. Lanterns shape perception (trembling light reveals then obscures), and the cello case’s silent presence charges the final departure. Sensory details are selective (damp velvet, glistening ink) and filtered through Elias’s obsession, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting directly enables the climax—without this exact environment, the code remains unreadable.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain weather station functions as micro-setting: its instruments (barograph, anemometer) and cold air constrain perception and action, while the west-facing windowsill becomes the altar for the final image. The auroral light charging the illustration’s “uncertain story” ties environment directly to closure. Sensory detail is selective, professional, and emotionally filtered—no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting: its condensation, resistance, and spectral turning directly constrain the protagonist’s final choice. Sensory details (rust, oily water, steamy hiss) are filtered through drowsy alertness and escalate with pressure. The tunnel and mill aren’t backdrop—they’re active agents that channel history into haunting. The environment charges the ending: cold concrete against slumped body echoes the earlier “physical pressure” of silence, now transformed.

    Setting functions as active constraint: the library’s oppressive archives force escape, while the obsidian refuge and silent river physically enact “regenerative silence.” Sensory hierarchy shifts perfectly—from moss-damp stone and papyrus decay to ozone and liquid starlight—mirroring mental unmooring then cleansing. The black sand and soundless current aren’t backdrop but agents that scrub echoes from the mind. Every detail serves the closure image: the river’s yielding flow reconfigures the keeper’s relationship to time.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sage Ridge functions as micro-setting: the dried sagebrush mirrors Lena’s brittleness, the dusty ground receives her offering, and the eclipse’s ethereal light transforms perception. The kalimba’s resonance “coaxes quiet from the stones,” tying sound to place. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices—it enhances mood but isn’t instrumental beyond atmosphere. The baby curl and eclipse matter more than the ridge itself, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The reclaimed silo library functions as micro-setting: its curved walls “cupping memory like water” directly enable Kaelen’s method and charge the closure. The “bronze quiet” atmosphere permeates sensory detail (dust-moted light, charred paper texture) and mirrors internal desolation. Crucially, the fireplace yields the diaries—a spatial constraint that shapes discovery—and the oak desk focalizes the final tableau. Every detail serves pressure or theme; no white-room syndrome or generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: its beam guides ships and agents alike; its isolation enables secrecy; its lantern room is both observatory and prison. The sea fog, bell, and coastal road are filtered through Elias’s professional attention, never touristy. The final image—his shadow cast by the great lamp—reweights the entire setting as a metaphor for controlled illumination now relinquished. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dimensional anchor functions as micro-setting: its hum shapes tactics (loop pedal use) and charges closure (silence becomes weapon). The artist’s palette evolves from oppressive symbol to discarded relic, its gray thinning as stakes shift. Sensory detail is selective—silver mesh, bone-deep hum, clatter of wood—filtered through Alistair’s ritual focus. Final image of drying gray paint reconfigures it from totality to mere pigment.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass spire and frozen lake aren’t backdrop but active micro-settings: the spire’s hum shifts with resonance, the ice enables the mirrored horizon that catalyzes closure.

Sensory detail (lavender dawn, scent of rain on asphalt) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Kaelen’s obsessive POV. Final image—the luminous sphere with spire at heart—is irreplaceably tied to setting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glowing viaduct isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint that reconfigures with Kael’s psyche, pressuring his tactics. Rain, ozone, and light function as micro-setting, narrowing perception during crisis (e.g., droplets like “fallen stars”). Final image of grey dawn reweights the sterile glow into earned peace. Body (buoyancy) and object (tablet) also serve as setting, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drum maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: stone transmits vibration, enabling Elara’s method and culminating in shared somatic resonance. Sensory hierarchy prioritizes touch and proprioception over sight/sound, aligning with POV. Final image (“resonant heart of the earth”) charges closure. Lanterns, damp earth, and hanging drums are purposeful, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting: its layered tranquility initially offers refuge but becomes a pressure chamber when the pigeon arrives. Damp ivy, cooling stone, and vanishing light aren’t backdrop—they shape Elias’s sensory baseline and heighten the intrusion. Crucially, the setting supplies the object that triggers the turn (pigeon on flagstones), and dusk’s deepening blue charges the final image with urgency. Environment directly constrains choice by providing the anomalous messenger.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: its extinct flora, UV lamps, and condensation directly enable the plot and charge the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s profession and trauma—smell dominates, but sight (crystal shadows, violet light) guides action. The Somniflora’s twilight petals and ozone-linen scent are specific, irreplaceable details that mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Environment constrains choice (only here can the vial be read and the flower bloom), fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting: earthen, womb-like, humming with “silent energy,” it constrains Elias’s choices by offering shelter that mirrors his internal state—protected yet isolated. The rope, starlight, and clay bowl are handled with tactile specificity that charges the final image: the rope isn’t just remembered; it’s touched during his epiphany, linking escape to awareness. Sensory detail is selective (cool earthen air, resonant tones in the skull) and filtered through Elias’s poetic attention. The setting doesn’t just reflect theme—it enables the climax by grounding cosmic abstraction in physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)

Sensory detail is selective (ozone, dust, crackling static) and filtered through Kael’s professional focus. The obsidian slab and crystal phial constrain action—tools handled with tactile precision. Final image ties setting to theme: amber glow charging the phial as he isolates joy, making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    The seaside library setting is economically rendered through sensory specifics (“salty night air,” “starlight on silver hair”) and functions as micro-setting: its proximity to the concert hall enables Alina’s ritual and Elias’s plaque placement. The locket and envelope are tactile anchors that evolve meaning. Deduction: while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices—it facilitates but doesn’t pressure the climax. Still, the final image of starlight on tears ties environment to emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor aren’t backdrop but active constraints: Kaelen’s knowledge of “overlooked spaces” enables the discovery, and the arbor’s permanence defines his existential contrast.

The final lattice projection onto the damp wall ties closure directly to spatial specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “shadowed library at dawn” functions as micro-setting: flickering lights dictate timing, dust and pipe chases enable Elias’s access, and the oak table anchors the offering. Sensory detail is selective (sapphire hush, rusted grate, desiccated silverfish) and filtered through Elias’s practiced attention. The environment constrains choice (he must move between watchman and librarian) and charges the final image (dawn light coinciding with Anya’s arrival). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is exact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mossy trellis, rain-slick and skeletal, functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s literally unrepairable, forcing Elias toward reconstruction. Weather (storm season) and tools (hammer vs. saw) are tactile, profession-specific, and evolve with plot. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: early focus on wind and splintered wood narrows perception; post-storm mist allows calmer noticing of new tendrils. Final image of ruin charged with “quiet potential” ties environment directly to thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal island isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: causeway access depends on tide, storm runoff etches paths that guide action, and western bluffs are revealed only because sea “rarely surrendered” them. The amber brooch functions as micro-setting: its warmth against cool air, trapped fly, and tarnished pin charge the final sketch. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s painterly urgency—mud’s slickness, resin’s texture, gulls’ silence—all filtered through his sleep-deprived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    The musical crystal cave is not backdrop but active agent: its melodies stutter, shadows merge, light refracts to guide Kael.

Environment directly enables the climax: without this precise pocket of green and light, the promise could not be fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse, predawn sea, and clinging fog are rendered with precise, selective detail that serves both atmosphere and function—the lens is not just glass but a conduit, the vial cork a tactile anchor to memory. Sensory hierarchy narrows appropriately under pressure: Elias shuts out visual dawn to focus on scent and internal vibration. The setting constrains choice (only the lens can transmit intent) and charges the final image (sunlight replacing fog after a silent act). Weather and time (“after the heat wave breaks”) aren’t decorative; they create the clean, sharp air necessary for the “whisper” to travel, making environment an active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The starlit signal station functions as micro-setting: its gantry, dead wires, and skeletal dish constrain Elias’s actions and supply materials. The patina bronze censer foot—a recurring object—charges the final image, its weight and hum shaping the climax. Sensory detail is selective (wind’s moan, starlight “so bright it felt solid”) and filtered through Elias’s grief. The environment doesn’t just mirror mood—it enables the lighthouse’s construction and broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    The hanging orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: its precarious beauty mirrors Elias’s internal state, and its survival (“battered but had held”) charges the final image of fractured grace. Storm mechanics constrain the ritual (turmoil required for attunement), and the reinforced glass home’s limpet-like grip reflects his tenacity. Sensory detail is selective (rain hammering glass, wind stealing words) and filtered through a truffle forager’s tactile awareness. The setting functions as micro-setting, shaping both stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints. The stolen horizon mirrors the man’s absence; the beam’s rhythm structures Silas’s thoughts; the tower’s height isolates him physically and emotionally. The Edelweiss—a mountain flower on a sea-worn piling—charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity. Every detail filters through Silas’s keeper POV: salt-bleached pilings, sea glass, sextant—all lived-in, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming cavern constrains choice—it only appears midsummer, lit by bioluminescence that renders headlamps unnecessary—and charges the final image: its beauty frames the doorway’s revelation and dissolution. The creek’s rising water functions as micro-setting, tightening time. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s focus: damp soil, jasmine, glowing moss. Environment directly enables the climax and underscores thematic stakes of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is integral: the cobalt grotto constrains the climax, its bleeding starlight directly shaping Elara’s choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “grit of the rock,” “humid air” for fireflies). The mountain’s indifference contrasts court emptiness, and the grotto’s beauty becomes menace. Only minor deduction: cloud-line transition slightly abrupt, but lunar imagery compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Ember Nexus isn’t backdrop—it’s a charged micro-setting where residual magic enables Elara’s work and twilight pressures urgency. The nautilus shell and pocket-sun function as tool-objects that constrain choice: the former embodies failed method, the latter becomes vessel for transformation. Sensory detail (crystalline dust, chirping crickets, purple-orange sky) filters through Elara’s scientific romanticism, avoiding tourist catalog. Final image—the living sun’s warmth—directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The birch bark scroll, charcoal, pine scent, and cabin knots are purposefully filtered through the narrator’s distressed perception. Setting constrains action: the confined space intensifies claustrophobia, driving the trance-flight. However, while the cabin charges the opening and mid-point, it doesn’t directly shape the final writing act—the scroll does. Thus, environment lacks full 9+ closure linkage; the micro-setting (scroll) compensates but doesn’t fully elevate the spatial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The water clock shop functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: clepsydrae dictate rhythm, glass surfaces reflect inner clarity, and fog-to-sunlight arc mirrors Elara’s shift. Sensory hierarchy is flawlessly POV-filtered—Elara notices texture, temperature, sound because scent is gone. Final image of “hazy shafts of light onto the dusty floor” earns 9+ by tying environment to earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating granite platform isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its isolation enforces focus, its coolness contrasts internal heat, and the “abyss below” supplies currents that carry away shed crystals. The crow quill and crystalline veins function as object-as-setting, constraining choice (ink fails; only dry touch works) and charging the final image (quill repurposed, skin revealed). Sensory detail narrows under stress—Elian notices only breath, crystal, quill—then expands post-release into “saturated hush.” Weather (“receding thunderheads,” “promised gales”) mirrors emotional stakes without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sheet music archive functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: decaying paper mirrors Elara’s unfinished legacy, the lectern anchors the ritual, and the approaching dawn literalizes the deadline. Sensory detail is purposeful—ozone, lilac, vibrating teeth—not decorative—and evolves with the scene’s pressure. The perfume bottle and manuscript are tactile extensions of setting, their interaction enabling the climax. The final grey light and diesel engine tie environment directly to irreversible loss, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Ancient Temple Library isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: obsidian floors, spiraling shelves, and the “resounding hush” constrain choice (silent movement, inward pilgrimage) and charge the ending (the dictionary falls soundlessly into plenum). Sensory detail is selective (tactile paper, visual creases, auditory absence) and filtered through the Witness’s archivist POV. The setting’s rules—temporal marooning, semantic bleed—are shown through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fjord station functions as micro-setting: granite shelf, copper pipes, and glacial water directly constrain action (ice forms only because of ancient melt). The Grand Chronometer isn’t backdrop—it’s active terrain where Elias navigates brass arcs and obsidian edges. Final image charges closure: ice refracting sun on the razor edge crystallizes theme. Every detail serves pressure or perception—no tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm isn’t backdrop—it generates the dimensional friction that forms the barrier, supplies the mycelial network for resonance, and its glow pulses like a heartbeat during the climax. The Fae Caps’ light and ozone-damp air filter every perception, grounding Kael’s spatial gift in this specific ecology. The setting constrains the entire conflict: no caps, no barrier; no mycelium, no resonance. Final image recharges the luminescence as stasis restored.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rainwashed library, subway cars, and rail-yard balcony form a coherent urban pilgrimage where grime and geometry mirror Aris’s internal shift. The candle lantern functions as micro-setting—its mica pane constrains deciphering tactics and charges the final image when lit. Sensory detail (clover pollen, smoky shields) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the rail yard lacks tactile specificity that could elevate it to 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The subway utility tunnel isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible: damp earth, ozone, bundled cables, and distant train rumbles constrain perception and charge every beat. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting; its use alters tactics by punctuating pauses with musical question marks. Final image (“adjusted a knob… waited for the next wrong number”) gains weight from this environment’s acoustic and spatial logic. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Silas’s professional attention.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the archive’s scent of aging paper, the ceramic dish of iron-gall solution, and the salt-scrubbed jetty all constrain or charge choices. The blooming sea-lavender on the jetty directly echoes the locket’s wild flower, transforming a boundary into a site of covenant renewal. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “milky, water-damaged blur” seen through an archivist’s eyes). The jetty’s phosphorescent buds evolve causally from the restored truth, fulfilling the 9+ gate by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)

Final image ties environment to theme: community rebuilding within decay.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the ultrasonic forest isn’t backdrop but active pressure that constrains Kaelen’s perception and tactics (e.g., filtering noise, timing journey to celestial lull). Recurring objects—platinum ring, ironwood trunk, fossilized flower—charge the final image by embodying thematic progression. Sensory detail is selective (tingling fingertips, moss dialects) and filtered through Kaelen’s POV, avoiding tourist catalog. The Stillpoint’s revelation hinges on environmental logic established from first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its warping pressure shapes Kaelen’s physical posture, mental state, and the very mechanics of the plot (folding time). The dried-up pen—a tool-turned-talisman—constrains his final choice: he won’t refill it, rejecting utility for testament. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (cool metal, dim light, hum), filtered through his professional and emotional priorities. The station’s silence gains texture through contrast with cosmic static and inner turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    The luminous harbor functions as both setting and micro-setting: its moonlit water, corroded pylons, and collapsed pier directly constrain Elian’s choices (where to stand, what to frame) and charge the final image—the “absolute blackness beneath the collapsed pier” becomes the nexus of amnesia he must disrupt. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (silver water, brittle rust, bone-felt chord), filtered through Elian’s artistic perception. The environment evolves causally: each mapped silence alters the next location, culminating in the ferry landing’s active void.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)

    The Scrap-Ark isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its groaning metal mirrors Elara’s weight shifts, and microgravity enables her floating ritual. Kwan Yin’s Tear and stitched photos function as micro-settings that charge every choice. Final aperture emerges from table-top constellation, making environment inseparable from resolution. Sensory detail (grated decks, spun starlight thread) serves pressure, never stalls it.

    The black sand beach, obsidian grains, tidal pool glyphs, and planetary glow aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. Kael’s bare feet sinking, the shell’s pearlescence, the basalt circle: all tactile details shape his detour and ritual. The setting culminates in the final image where sand warmth and mountain heartbeat fuse environment with closure. Vivid multi-sensory specificity avoids white-room syndrome or generic lyricism.

    The luminous fort isn’t backdrop—it’s active infrastructure. Its phosphorescent algae walls pulse like a heartbeat, the moss-slicked stone muffles footsteps, and the blackout isolates the citadel as both sanctuary and target. The half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting: its coded numerals constrain Kael’s method and charge the climax. Final image—flickering panes against ink-black city—reweights the fort from prison to liberated node. Every detail serves pressure, choice, or closure.

    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless world aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints. Magnetic boots groan under strain; basalt conducts the hum that splits the wave; aurora light solidifies as trigger. The micro-setting (spiral stones, star dust sphere) directly enables the climax. Final image (“dawn… might be his own”) gains weight because the environment shaped every choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: tactile (boots, dust), visual (aurora), then auditory (hum).

    The stormlit observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible. Clouds churn below like his psyche; lightning reveals the “dead eye” telescope, mirroring his censored vision. The alcove, catwalk, and control panel spatially choreograph his choices: retrieving the envelope, then seeing the locked motor. Final image—the receding storm revealing a city light—is charged by the setting’s evolution from prison to threshold. Micro-setting (timetable, negative, key) constrains every turn.

    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial form a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the climax: light angles dictate blade placement, the brook provides rhythmic counterpoint, and the half-painted dial embodies the thematic void. Kaelen’s mechanical arm catches light purposefully, linking body to environment. Every sensory detail (whispering brook, whirring chronometers, chime of steel on marble) serves momentum or theme. The sundial’s seam—a spatial detail—directly enables the closure click.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ruined library isn’t backdrop but active constraint: girders claw stars, marble floors are grimy, water-warped spines dictate sorting labor. Every detail serves the central conflict—decay versus curation—and culminates in the moonlit dome framing the new community. The coffee tin’s false bottom and teetering book stacks directly enable plot turns. Final image charges the setting: silver light on four figures sorting books makes the ruin sacred through action, not description.

    The tidal arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains and enables. Woven lightwood and vapor-ocean establish physics later exploited: music vibrates the air, forging a path “using its strange physics.” The broken clock atop the piano charges the final image (his “resolute glance” promises its hands will move again). Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “ozone and old celluloid” smell grounds the fantastical doorway; twilight clouds contrast monochrome film. Every environmental element ties to tactic or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ancient ridge isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: its highest point receives the seed, its blossoms lean in response, and its pollen symbolizes fragile memory. Weather (approaching monsoon) constrains timing and raises stakes. Sensory detail (metallic rain tang, impossible blues) is filtered through Elara’s urgency and profession. The environment charges the final image: raindrops become “promises of renewal” only because the ridge held the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    The islet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its granite bluff forces Kenji’s confrontation with verticality (“pointed… straight down”), while post-rain air sharpens sensory clarity for deciphering lace. Objects double as setting—the compass and shears physically mediate his internal state. Final image charges the juniper (tool + environment) as vessel for “shaping silence,” fulfilling the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.
