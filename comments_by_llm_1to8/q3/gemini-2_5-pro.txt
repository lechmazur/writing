  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    The archway and storm are not backdrop; they dictate options and supply the very materials of the solution. Sensory texture is vivid and POV-filtered (“turbine-hum reverie,” slick wall, water to the thigh), and weather meaningfully alters tactics. The projector and slide function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial and environmental logic remains coherent through the strike and recession.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cathedral, rose window, and melting winter are tactile and purposeful; the window’s material and the lantern/filters directly shape options. Sensory detail stays POV‑filtered through an artist’s eye, avoiding museum‑tour blandness. The environment evolves with time (dawning hush) to unlock the anomaly. Only restraint: the amber pavilion frames tone more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the zeppelin’s isolation seeds the new approach; the obsidian lagoon’s silence dictates nonverbal parley, constraining tactics. Sensory detail is precise and POV‑filtered (“polished brass,” “sting of salt,” “perfect, dark mirror”). Objects-as-setting (urchin, stone, seaweed) charge the final turn. No museum‑tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cove, lanterns, and anchor stone are tactile, selective, and purpose‑driven; the environment is inseparable from tactic and outcome. The amber bottle meaningfully charges the final image as conscience and focus, and the lanterns register as a soul‑city under construction. Sensory hierarchy matches Kaelen’s vocation and grief. World rules are learned through action without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is lush and purposeful: orchard atop the Spire, caramel‑colored wax, diamond stylus, and the Maritime Museum throttle the senses through Elian’s bias. The foghorn as object/setting recharges the final image and rule‑set. While the garden doesn’t physically constrain choice, the sonic environment and archival apparatus meaningfully charge the stakes. Vivid sensory balance avoids tourist‑listing.

Minor note: a few lush descriptors risk density, but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The world is tactile and selective: red dust, scratchy static, geothermal steam, phosphorescent fungi, each filtered through Elara’s priorities. Environment and objects actively constrain choice (the cylinder’s grooves, the hinged rock, the geothermal vent that makes the garden possible), charging the final image. The scrapyard settlement and cracked flats shape risk calculus and departure costs. Specificity serves action rather than cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observation deck, accretion disk, and pulsar are vividly filtered through Elara’s sensorium and shape the experience of time. The recurring objects (sketchbook, jacket, compass rose) are integrated and return to charge the final image. Environmental specifics remain consistent with the world rules. Setting does not merely decorate; it frames and pressures the central realization.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Vivid, selective details (viridian nebula, Crysolith ice, sterile observatory) are filtered through Kael’s priorities. Environment and tools constrain tactics: the nebula’s green light via the sundial/prism makes the distraction possible.

Details are selective and filtered through Elias’s purpose, avoiding touristic catalog. The environment and object decisively charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ravine orchard and storm are vivid and purposeful, not postcard—weather conditions are required to attune the relic and leave visible aftermath. Professional perception (roots, truffles, grafted orchard) filters detail. The glass eye as micro‑setting/object charges the final image and constrains tactics. Sensory balance (wind, rain, reinforced glass, cold weight) supports mood without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is rich and specific: mist, opal dock, the lighthouse’s beam as metronome, and lived‑in tools (sextant, sea glass). The lighthouse and beam subtly charge the ending image without becoming overt symbolism. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV‑filtered by a keeper’s eye. It stops short of constraining choice, which keeps it just under the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The blooming cavern, glowing fungi, and archway aren’t postcard detail; they shape access and charge the final image. The chip-as-tool and archway-as-threshold directly constrain the choice. Sensory specificity is vivid and filtered through a map dealer’s priorities. Environmental logic is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain, cloud‑sea, cobalt grotto, and “bleeding starlight” are vivid and tactile, integrated with action. Environment constrains choice by making the temptation concrete and singular; the setting’s rules (unraveling into the light) govern the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (the hum, the viscous drops, the pool’s patterns). The final stance is charged by place, not just decorated by it.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Ember Nexus, vesper crickets, crystalline dust, and residual magic are vivid and POV-filtered, shaping tone and plausibility of her craft.

    The floating tea platform, blue air, cedar table, and abyss provide vivid, selective detail that supports tone and charges the final dust‑into‑light image. The micro‑setting (arm, quill) functions as a meaningful environment that constrains action. Rules are learned by observation, not dumped, and weather/time (“between storms”) subtly guides cadence. While the platform doesn’t force a tactical constraint, it consistently deepens atmosphere and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The archive is tactile and charged—dust, iron gall ink, decaying paper—and the micro-setting directly affects method (clips on staves, oscillator hum). The lilac perfume and ozone fold into the environment to shape action and final image. The impending chainsaws and windows’ light modulate atmosphere and pressure. Specificity serves both mood and mechanics without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: obsidian hall, resounding hush, and the lost‑in‑time library charge the mood and final image. The setting’s properties (hush, timelessness, concentric architecture) meaningfully contour the ritual and end state. Sensory detail privileges sound/its absence effectively. It stops short of physically constraining a choice, hence just under the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fjord station, hydraulic clocks, obsidian escapement, and glacial melt are vivid and functionally integrated. Environment constrains and charges the final image—the glacier “reaching into” the mechanism is both literal and thematic.

The final image is charged by setting as the harbor’s atmosphere literally transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Xylos Archive is vivid and tactile (basalt walls, petrified paper, vellum, fissured sun) and its properties constrain choice: the window’s light and the tapestry’s weave are required to reveal the text. Recurring objects (tapestry, vandalized canvas) charge the final image. Environmental tools (ancient pigments/binders) directly inform the closing decision. Detail remains purposeful and POV‑filtered rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sensory lab (“sound wave garden”) is not decorative; its emitters and receivers translate her drumming into light and literally enable the climax. Tactile navigation (bare feet, climbing the slab) integrates space with action, and the metallic flora idiom charges the tone. The environment constrains/permits her tactic and saturates the final image. World rules are learned via use, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth, storm-charged air, and tool ecology (map keyed to constellations, cipher-key on the plate) are integrated and constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The laboratory, carillon, and miner’s lens are vividly rendered and handled as operative tools rather than set dressing. Sensory texture (ozone, dust, golden shafts, prism-songs as light) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The miner’s lens and the bell’s “resonance matrix” constrain tactics and directly charge the final image. Minor bias toward the visual is justified by the premise of seeing sound.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory’s “curtains of intention,” telescopes, obsidian bench, and forge integrate with action and constrain choices (only intention opens the sky; the dais becomes a lens).

This environment is inseparable from the piece’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    The basalt archway and aurora aren’t postcard backdrops; they shape method and meaning (arch framing the pole, the instrument within it, the aurora’s “silent symphony” teaching the story’s cadence). The instrument functions as micro-setting, constraining attention and then being set aside to charge the final image. Sensory detail is precise and POV-filtered (brass polish, smoked glass), supporting tone and theme. World rules are consistent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glowing dune, non‑space archive, and skiff are vividly rendered and filtered through Kaelen’s professional bias. Environmental particulars (ghost‑pale flora, stuttering light) participate in the conflict and in the solution’s form. The chess clock recurs to charge the final image. Strong sensory balance (scent of pine) deepens atmosphere without bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and integrated: wind‑languages function as terrain logic and propel movement toward the quartz tree. Sensory specificity (oils, brass canopy, serrated ironwood) feels POV‑filtered and purposeful. The recurring gear charges the final image. Environment constrains tactics by making sound the navigational tool.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and functional: misted ridgeway, sea of clouds, and the lantern’s “captured firefly” light guide movement and mood. The star‑stamped kelp ticket acts as a charged object in the final image, constraining meaning if not literal passage. Environmental cues (moonlight shimmer, jasmine on breeze) drive the indirect route and suit the character’s altered attention. The atmosphere supports theme without heavy‑handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt fortress and spiral stair are vividly realized and functionally constraining: safety presses inward while the unused stair enables secrecy and thought. Weather and glass (“armored‑glass,” snow) reinforce isolation and reshape tactics (interior, hushed acts). The bolt operates as object‑as‑setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Athenaeum is vivid and functional: aisles, scriptorium, lectern, and dome of frozen starlight directly shape tactics and the ending image. The iron gall pellet and star‑chart act as charged tools within setting logic. The environment constrains the ritual and pays off as the dome resumes motion and the library fades. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station isn’t decorative: the alarm triggers the window, the console is the instrument, and the viewport frames the charged final image. Details feel lived-in and filtered through his vocation, with the dead reef vs. bloom contrast sharpening the emotional field. Economy of specifics supports tension without digression.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vivid, selective specificity: ferrocrete, monolith circle, broken dome, ghostly consoles, and the acoustic character of the bay all matter to tactics. The opera glasses and “margin of daylight” function as micro‑setting constraints that shape action and the ending image. World rules (stones respond to resonance, not brute force) are learned through action. Spatial choreography is clear and charged without excess cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The geothermal pool and its extremophiles are not decorative; chemistry and heat actively constrain tactics (a specific vent, enzymes, thermal regulation).

Excellent economy with object‑as‑setting integration via the amber and basalt shelf.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The arboretum, cliff, glass walls, surf, and Wollemi pine are not postcard decor; they actively supply the grounding tactic (geologic sound, soil grit) and charge the ending image. Professional bias colors detail selection credibly. The recurring micro‑setting (tree, soil, water) constrains and enables her choices. Atmosphere deepens theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse library is integral: circular room pressure, sweeping lamp as metronome, spiral staircase mirrored in his design; the environment supplies materials (rope, atlas, charcoal) and shapes the final image. Sensory detail is selective and motivated by his artistic gaze. Setting charges the ending; it’s not postcard décor but an active constraint and resource. Spatial and atmospheric coherence hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The wind-carved encampment and sandstone basin are vivid and purposeful; the basin practically enables the ritual, and the environment mirrors Kael’s cold focus. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a tracker’s eye. The artificial hummingbird’s intrusion against the consciously wild world builds tone and stakes. Strong integration without the environment itself overtly constraining movement at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)

    The setting is not a backdrop but the story's primary engine. Every detail of the storm-damaged greenhouse—the silt, humidity, buckled steel—applies pressure to the protagonist. The pane of polycarbonate with butterfly dust functions as a "micro-setting" that actively constrains perception and directly charges the final, resonant image of wiping it clean.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.8)
    The setting is not a backdrop but the story's central engine, fulfilling the highest potential of this category. The canyon is transformed from a place of isolation into a "shifting page," with its frost patterns and topography becoming the very language that resolves the plot. This integration is seamless, charging the final image and making the environment an indispensable character in its own right.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional and indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    The topaz walls and crystallized halo bathe every action in star-honey luminosity, directly constraining Elias’s calibration choices, but workshop layout stays vague; spatial choreography is marginally off. Sensory detail is lyric yet occasionally overactive, creating a slight shimmer-overload around the press.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ridgeway’s shale, frigid air, and auroral river are filtered through Kael’s courier priorities. The pendant and crystalline growths act as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory selection narrows under stress; no static postcard. Environment evolves causally with the light-seed germination.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The quartz arbor and frosted windshield are not backdrop; they are instruments that constrain the experiment and shape the final revelation. Sensory selection is urgent: “brittle layer of ice,” “pale, crystalline stone” filter through Elias’s scientific gaze. The prism’s weight at the end charges the closure. Only the valley mist feels ornamental rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loom, bead, and puzzle-frame function as micro-setting that constrains every move; the orchard’s rustling bamboo supplies acoustic pressure that sharpens the hush. Sensory detail is selective—cool amber, grooved wood—never touristic. Final image of the star-map tapestry recharges the orchard’s forgotten sky.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating arches, dust-sour orchards, and geothermal cavern are filtered through Elian’s tactile priorities; the geode-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The repair bay’s rust, ozone, and fractured gantry are filtered through Kael’s sensory priorities; the shard itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors are immediate; the bay’s silence after the redirect is charged with new meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Granite spire, iron door, Fresnel facets are precise; storm chop is visceral. Circle of stones at final beat satisfies environment-as-constraint test. Minor: beam flicker described more from mainland porch than clifftop POV.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse, crystalline wick, and cosmic storm are vivid and selective; the tower's shudder and glass nova constrain the final moment. Spatial choreography is clean; only the "dark continents" remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Floating tea-house, valley mists, and chalk-dust sun trails are tactile and selective; the wing-as-micro-setting constrains the final insight. Spatial anchors are clear by line 5; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stormlit tower, broken sextant, and crystallized shard function as micro-settings that constrain every action; moonlight’s angle literally determines success.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse’s humid flagstones, Moon-Petal pollens, and mica window constrain every move; the Lumina tree’s droop sets the ticking clock. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elara’s caretaker bias. Final image of distorted glass turning dawn into “abstract painting” recharges setting as both canvas and cage.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hidden laundromat façade and the rotunda clock anchor space and time, but while the scent-of-paper motif constrains Elias’s tactic of dissolving into the library, it is the emotional shelter—not the physical space—that constrains the final choice, just missing 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The moss-eaten colonnade and petrified bread function as micro-setting that constrains every action; thyme in mortar gaps literalizes the theme. Sensory hierarchy is tight, but the palace’s spatial layout could be one degree sharper to earn 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library is not mere backdrop; its quartz hush and cloud-sea altitude constrain every motion—boots scrape, breath freezes—and the resonator’s spun silver is handled in tactile detail. The lantern slide’s transformation from living light to inert glass charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no white-room syndrome. The setting subtly mirrors Kaelen’s internal freeze without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rotting pier, brine, kelp glow, and brass recorder are selective and POV-filtered. The recorder’s cold weight and final warmth bookend the arc, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no static cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystal cave is not scenery but pressure: refracting light literally becomes the unlock code. Micro-setting (the selenite wall) steers the final welter of color that defines the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Gear hum of “humming maintenance shafts,” chill of long-dry conduits: specificity is purposeful, guides choice. Silver-Vein fern acts as micro-setting barometer limiting whom Elian trusts; in final scene, plaza planter becomes site of felt cost. No white-room, yet ozone smog stays background—could tighten further to charge clutch moment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The whispering bluff, the rare updraft, and the kinetic sculpture itself constrain every action; the final mist rising from the melting ice charges the closing image. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elian’s craft. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass dome, crystalline roses, and lead-lined box are not backdrop but tactical terrain: roses become crucible, box becomes containment vessel. Final image of jagged doorway reweights earlier perfection. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—ozone, dust, distant rain—anchoring POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The courtyard at dawn—coffee scent, grief-tainted air—pressures Elias to sit long enough for gossip to land; the locked boxes’ star-shaped keyholes, not merely decorative, determine the locket’s final fit. Specificity anchors universals without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sub-aquarium gloom ("quartz-glass walls", "bioluminescent algae") is never mere wallpaper; the water pressure modulates into the final sound-shift. Micro-objects (dice, journal, console) serve as tools that constrain and charge the final image. Only the lab’s spatial layout could be sharper when Elara dances among terminals.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “gleaming silence” of the salt chamber, lantern-broken into “a thousand shivering stars,” is not mere scenery; its gravity wells literally compress the world and constrain Silas’s hand. Spatial chords are intact (ladder, slate tile, lantern placement on crystal), anchoring every action. Details remain sensory-specific (crush of lavender, summer dust) rather than postcard-generic, and the chamber’s resonant hum fuses theme and environment into the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    The brook, mossy stone, and moon-drenched clearing are sketched with selective sensory strokes; sound hierarchy (water baseline vs. coded rustle) guides attention and choice. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt. Yet the environment never fights back—no wind disturbs the paper, no night creature interrupts—so setting supports mood without constraining tactics, keeping the score just shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Althea breathes through selective, sensory detail: “groaning pipes,” “dust and dried lavender,” “sun-bleached spot.” Rooftop garden’s meteors act as both setting and thematic mirror. The brass seal functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when Clara presses it into dirt. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Garden’s velvet dusk and crystal spires constrain movement and supply the resonance interface; the seashell’s cool curve becomes micro-setting that charges the final silence. Selective sensory detail—“moss that muffled his footsteps”—serves mood and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Sanctuary’s “pearl twilight” and aurora pulse become a living constraint: the chill marble dictates glove usage and cold-steady breath control for micro-calligraphy. Light refracted on vellum helps Kaelen eye the exact intersection. Micro-setting (fox-fur bristle, drips ticking like heartbeat) reweights stakes underfoot. Spatial track is clean from altar to exit.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The serpentine nexus is evoked through tactile motion (“soft boots making no sound”) and the crystal formation that literally completes the shell; environment constrains the final harmonic act. Starlight, dust, and stone are filtered through Lyra’s grief-sharpened perception. Only the cosmic “hum” edges toward abstraction, slightly blurring spatial edges.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shrine’s ice, candlelight, and globe are not backdrop but active constraints: the cold preserves memory, the candle’s breath mirrors trance depth, the globe’s distortion anchors the quest. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“blue, million-year-old cold” felt on skin). Final image recharges the shrine and globe, meeting the 9-gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    The parapet, moon-cobblestones, meadow, and the bamboo whisk as micro-setting are vivid, integrated, and serve metaphoric function—each constrains sightlines and tactile choices (e.g., the whispering stone anchors the philosopher-gaze). While not a prop that physically redirects plot, the setting’s reflective surfaces literally guide his path, so it satisfies gate but stops short of altering final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a pressure engine: irradiated dust vs defiant green, derelict station, Seraphim peaks—all constrain sightlines and tactics. The orchard’s micro-zone functions as a tool that limits movement and supplies the stillpoint. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“fine particulate…cremated cities”). Spatial choreography from perimeter to antenna is clean and causal.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stormlit observatory is tactile—pitted iron, humming tubes, bruised-indigo glass—and constrains every move: the portico frames visions, the static is the medium, the spire groans under wind. The cobalt glow becomes a beacon for the settlements, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The loft, dunes, and tide are filtered through the poet’s selective perception; the driftwood ribcage and salt-bleached timbers constrain movement and frame the final performance. The pearlescent seashell placed atop the box charges the closure image. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is sensory, selective, and purposeful: drift-ice marina constrains movement and supplies the resonant ice-song; lighthouse architecture channels every action. The crystalline containment field and iron staircase are micro-settings that shape tactics. Final image of violet dusk recharges the opening gold bleed. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, and rain-slick viaduct are not backdrop; the wet surface’s reflective fidelity is critical to the harmonic key that severs control. Micro-setting (obsidian bowl, brass scope) constrains action and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven and purposeful. Weather actively alters the magnetic field, guiding choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel’s wet-earth reek and iron chill constrain oxygen and footing, directly enabling the fatal slip; the lantern’s tactile corrosion charges the final image as both promise and cage. Selective sensory triage mirrors Elias’s forensic gaze. Micro-setting (body, lantern) functions as setting.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The antique shop’s hush and brass gleam function as micro-setting that constrains Arthur’s prison-honed reflexes; the storm-light through the grimy window becomes the literal mechanism of revelation. Sensory selection is filtered through Arthur’s chaplain’s eye—light “didn’t choose the clean spots.” The heart itself serves as portable setting, its gears a tactile map of Thorne’s despair. Only the brief static postcard of “wet street” keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating workshop, acid sea, and arrow-tip kaleidoscope are not backdrop but instruments: the sea threatens, the workshop supplies parts, the arrow-tip provides the grammar. Final image of the glider “gripping” a fold in air is charged by every prior sensory cue. One minor slip: “green acidic vapors” is slightly generic amid otherwise razor-sharp specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archive is rendered through sensory selectivity—“tomb-like quiet,” “server noise,” “silver threads cool against her skin”—and the patch itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean: Elara bypasses layers, Kael’s avatar winks out, the packet shoots outward. One minor cliché (“digital gloom”) is offset by specificity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse orchard is sparingly drawn—wind-bitten apple boughs, grinding floes—but gives one tactical beat (Kael’s mirror rummage) and returns dialogically in Mara's sigh-cloud. Body/micro-setting meet the 9+ gate threshold once.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drift-ice marina is rendered through salt sting, diesel reek, splintered masts “like praying hands,” and the ice’s final lullaby—details filtered by Elara’s muted perception. Environment constrains movement and supplies the culminating sound that reconfigures her quest. Micro-setting (parasol tip in palm) doubles as tactile anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Autumn light, fermented-earth scent, amber pavilion—all pressure his mood and prune the visual final image. Pavilion and opposing vines ground spatial stakes; the closing frost on glass is a tactile meter of time.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Desert heat, bleached leviathan rib, cool subterranean air—all tactile and POV-filtered. The kinetic parapet’s obsidian lenses constrain the ritual; the sealed dune recharges the opening image. One missed chance: pavilion interior could have pressed harder on Kael’s senses.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lavender field and rusted factory form a charged micro-setting that constrains Elias’s ritual space; the scent and skeletal walls filter every beat. The vines’ slow climb mirrors the mosaic’s outward spiral, charging the final image with earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shadowed, post-dawn library and the prism-lit chandeliers perform as environmental conscience: their suspended hush and crystal echo constrain every decision, culminating in the final image where Elias is both seated and suspended—choice and setting fused in a single, costly stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog sculpture garden is not backdrop but pressure system: mist occludes markers, dictates pace, and finally swallows the chalk circle. Micro-setting (the basalt slab) constrains the final act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—salt, wet stone, chalk dust—never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cupola workshop, brass chronometer, and moon portal are vivid and selective; the lens itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final fix. Spatial choreography is clean; the crack in the portal glass tracks escalating pressure. Environment guides choice: lunar gravity drives the resonance, the lens counters it.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Glass walls, gravity-spun blanket, perpetual cloud sea are vivid and selective. The Eyrie subtly constrains choice—transport and privacy are dictated by altitude and oxygen—but the body-as-micro-setting (Mr. Aris’s roadmap hand) more powerfully charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating observatory, brass automaton, and crystalline eyes are not backdrop but instruments that constrain tactics and deliver the final image. Micro-setting (the key’s rings, the silk cushion) doubles as setting and tool. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s scholarly priorities. Environment charges the closing projection.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    Walls of hedge, river-smooth stones, moon-petal roses: each detail does both aesthetic and tactical work, guiding the dig and fore-shadowing the find. Setting never drifts into wallpaper; instead the maze and the box constrain hand and time. Micro-setting (trowel, tooth) carries final symbolic charge without ornamental load.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine grotto’s mist and salt air are not backdrop; they pressure Elara’s need for an interior light and literally supply the cool medium that makes the luminescence legible. The teal shard itself becomes micro-setting, constraining how light can be held and shared. One more sensory tether to the body (cold stone under knees, etc.) would have nudged 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moss-coated server racks and dripping slate panel are not backdrop but active constraint: humidity levels matter, the drip pattern literally writes the thematic map. Sensory detail is selective (petrichor, damp earth, green velvet) and filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze. The amber pendant functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Only the off-stage “confession went viral” keeps it from 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The feral nexus is evoked through selective sensory cues—damp earth, cold pressure, pearlescent light—filtered by Elias’s fatigue and wonder. The clearing where mist thins becomes a micro-setting that constrains the final ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment subtly mirrors interior erosion without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Arbor's pre-dawn chill and leaf-lit roof guide Elian's hush; sensory filtering stays within tinkerer ear. Micro-setting (weathered central post) actively serves as conduit, not backdrop. Specificity occasionally drifts to ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    The withered orchard, frozen soil, and rust flakes are not backdrop; they supply the literal material for the map and mirror Kaelen’s stripped persistence. Micro-setting (crater rim, brittle twigs) constrains posture and tool use. Sensory selection is urgent—cold ozone, bruised twilight—filtering through Kaelen’s marrow-listening. Environment charges the final image as he turns back into its silence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its curvature dictates reflection angles that Elian must obey. Micro-setting—the steel pins and sunbeam—literally constrain every tactical move. Final image reuses the cavern’s surfaces as resonator, charging the closure. Sensory selection (cold marble, faint glints) mirrors Elian’s narrowed focus under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rain-beaded skylight loft, copper kettle, and fresh-cut ash provide tactile micro-setting that constrains movement and mood. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; the scent of ash and chamomile steers memory and action. The loft itself does not force a tactical choice, so it stops short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Platform, mist, and carousel fragments are filtered through Kael’s sensory narrowing under pressure; the kinetic lagoon supplies immediate spatial threat and metaphoric reflection without ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terminal’s layered decay (ozone, popcorn, greasy napkins) is filtered through Elara’s engineering gaze; carnival detritus and hidden conduits alike constrain her improvised circuitry. The resurrected star-chart ceiling reconfigures the setting itself into the final image, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal forecourt is not mere backdrop; its wet slate and dripping eaves constrain Elias’s movements and mirror his internal thaw. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his monkish attention. The bells themselves function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Environment constrains the choice to place rather than destroy the bells.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canal’s bruise-colored water and the radio’s static create a tactile, time-pressured environment that constrains Kael’s tactics; the dawn line recharges the opening twilight. A few descriptors verge on atmospheric excess, but none stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is active partner: fog’s invasion tightens visibility and sound, the dock’s length and snow-crack define Elias’s bodily reach. Final receding mist supplies the charged environmental shift that frames the sketch as cartography, tying micro-setting to closure. Falls one tick shy of 9 only because fulgurite more than dock constrains the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden, thread, and journal function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the chill bench forces the projection inward, the thread is the literal map, the journal the only permissible action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“rust-colored chrysanthemums and fallen pear leaves plastered to the mossy ground”). The dying light charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The suspended palace, geothermal vent, and crystal aviary are rendered with tactile specificity that constrains Kaelen’s choices (scraping lichen, harnessing steam). The final hybrid bird recharges the mechanical world below, making setting integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Obsidian lagoon and charred banyan are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice (the lagoon as solitary church, the tree as graft site). Spatial choreography is clean; weather and light evolve with emotional beats. The red thread and black sand function as micro-settings that charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    City fountains, cracked oculus, and stained glass box function as micro-settings that constrain every move. The pedestal’s discoloration and the oculus’s jagged rim guide placement and timing; the box’s spiral clasp dictates the final rotation. Sensory selection (dusty twilight, saline flats, kaleidoscope light) is filtered through Elara’s skeptical gaze. Environment charges the final image: the luminous sigil on the basin floor is inseparable from the setting’s geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nebula garden is never mere backdrop; its “troubling serenity” modulates with Xylar’s stance, and the final blooming is charged by the setting itself. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The gear’s impossible solidity against the garden’s physics subtly constrains Xylar’s realization. One hairline slip: “dust of ancient light-motes” edges toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    The greenhouse’s decaying glass and damp earth mirror Elias’s internal rot and growth; vines “like skeletal fingers” constrain his movement toward the bench. Butterfly flight paths overhead become the final metaphor for networked grief, charging the closure. Selective sensory detail (cool slate, storm-rattled panes) stays inside Elias’s stone-carver priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The brass clockwork, salt air, and obsidian ridge are filtered through Elias’s weathered perception; each detail presses choice (the ridge as burial ground, the handle as relic). Final shot of inscribed wood falling into tide re-weights the setting as site of absolution. Only minor drift in belfry geography.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt silo, lantern light, and tapestry’s frayed threads are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Elias’s movements and charges the final shelf placement. Micro-setting (the felt-lined tray, the curved wall) functions as active constraint. No orientation drift; world rules remain consistent. The environment subtly mirrors internal shift from shroud to cherished blanket.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and vellum act as micro-setting that cages choice: the reflective ice becomes a literal temperature constraint referenced by the sun-farm modeling, the spire’s altitude exposes the wind’s chill, the blank page is the irreversible frontier. Details are filtered through Kaelen’s perception bias rather than catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ember alcove is so tightly rendered—the soft green dial, chill mist pressing glass—that it becomes an extension of Elias’s skin. The shortwave radio is not set dressing; it is the conduit that changes his choices each night, and it reappears in the final image to charge dust motes. Spatial anchors are vivid and never wobble. This single micro-setting constrains action (confined stone nook prevents flight) and charges the luminous exit.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    The gallery’s “charcoal dust and old paper” scent is filtered through Elara’s curatorial eye; setting constrains choice when only the rocking-chair angle will serve for the scattering. The kiln room’s “scorched brick to gleaming silver” guides Kael’s hand toward surrender, making the physical layout complicit in the ritual. No placeholder white-room, though the vanishing point itself isn’t spatially mapped; it’s atmospheric rather than architectural leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drowned city is not scenery but a hydraulic archive that forces literal dig and metaphorical descent. Rust, chalk, brine—each sensory note constrains reach and timing; a dry cistern perch later becomes the charged vantage that crystallizes his vow.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Velvet library and autumn decay are vivid yet selective; the rosette functions as micro-setting that constrains the final pedagogy. Sensory hierarchy filters through Elias’s woodworker-musician eye. Final image of “resonance in a quiet room” recharges the library’s stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rusted greenhouse, broken panes, drifting moon-twin light: concrete, micro-setting that constrains every step and cut. The pot and salvaged earth remain tactile tools; the synaptic-plant functions as living setting. Atmosphere breathes decayed grandeur and imminent bloom—yet never overwhelms the surgical urgency. Enough specificity to pass the ≥7 gate but lacks literal wall constraint to carry it to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tower’s “syrupy, nectar dusk” and ozone air filter every perception; the lacquer box and matchbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Silas notices pollen and lightning arcs, not civic blueprints. Final image of arcing lightning recharges the opening dusk with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bay’s salt-heavy air and bruised-lavender dawn are filtered through Elara’s biased perception, guiding her route and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underwater garden is not backdrop; its bioluminescent flora and filtration gill directly constrain Mara’s tactics and charge the final image when the vine on Galen’s shoulder pulses brighter. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“crushed pearl and obsidian” noticed only as she swims the path). One minor slip: “ghost-white skate” feels ornamental rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The staircase is the entire cosmos; its granularity (“gray stone of risers and treads”) doubles as mathematical surface. Environment constrains tactics—flint is only sharp against stone that is itself logic. Final shimmer makes setting the very fabric of price and possibility; no world-rule drift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse reeks specific, humid, clean — a crucible that supplies physical constraint (clean air, isolation) and moral resource (plants as covenant audience). Tool detail: moon-tipped brush catches light; later the city itself turns into an echoing canvas. The smog is not mere backdrop; it filters moon to trigger visions and threatens to swallow the glyphs, affecting tactics. Consistently filtered through painter-sight: colors, solvents, plant gloss. Object-as-setting satisfies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s phosphorescent moss dimming under frost, the yeasty warmth against sterile cold, and the emerald lens filtering glare all constrain tactics and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Granite foundations, slick black rocks, and brass clock-casing create tactile specificity. The hunger stone’s pockmarks and the yoyo’s silver band constrain choices. Setting evolves with tide’s exhale, guiding final timing. Micro-setting (workbench tools) charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Funhouse is textured and selective (“ghosts of sugar and rust,” “spectral light of a thousand terrified collisions”). The clasp and mirrors constrain the final choice; environment actively shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)

    Basalt bluff and magnetic boots actively constrain movement during climax; star dust's weight and aurora's light become tactical tools that charge the final image of "dawn felt like it might be his own".

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Observatory as active constraint: telescope's locked panel requires the key, timetable functions as literal map. Final city light recharges "stormlit thought" skull imagery while altering tactics—environment directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Micro-setting mastery: the needle card’s metallic surface casts light patterns constraining Kaelen’s fencing choices, while the brook’s "whispered argument" mirrors philosophical tension. Final image of the scroll tied with silken cord charges closure—tools become active constraints, not static decor.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Library skeleton constrains choices: rusted girders and water-warped spines force meticulous sorting, charging the final image of four people amid ruins. Micro-setting (coffee tin’s false bottom) directly enables poem distribution, reweighting "blooming resistance" through tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Tidal arbor’s "strange physics" actively enables the portal, while the film reel’s physicality (monochrome frames against twilight) charges the climax. Micro-setting constraints tactics: piano keys translate visual code into sonic keys, making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Knowledge fruit seed functions as micro-setting that charges final image; sky-plume blossoms deepen to "painful vibrancy" as memory rewinds, constraining the singing act through sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The islet’s wind/tide timing actively constrains Kenji’s actions ("wind turning to push against incoming tide" triggers climax). Recurring compass charges closure, though "cerulean regret" borders on overt symbolism.
