  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: broken panels admit wind that redistributes dust nightly, waterlogged netting frames the butterfly wing discovery, ceiling joists host improbable tomatoes. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (crystallized salt, fine powder catching light). The final image—dust on Mara's palms—is charged by prior material and forecloses her impulse to clean/control. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon under stars provides concrete sensory anchors (warm stone, silver shadows, frost retreat at dawn) that are filtered through Elena's glass-artist lens ("light could become trapped and transformed"). The frost patterns function as micro-setting, constraining her investigative method by modeling how "invisible streams beneath the surface" guide her reading of the ledger gaps. The kiln's "heat capacity" detail seeds the patron's mapping. Minor gap: the patron's monthly visits and cash payments are told rather than shown through a recalled micro-interaction that would have grounded his presence more vividly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly specific (frost patterns that never melt, perpetual winter roses) and functions as both literal workspace and thematic mirror. The conservatory's eternal winter aesthetic directly charges the "unshaken marvels" motif and the final light-refraction beat. The tuning fork, tablet, and sensors are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and Marina's selective attention (mathematical frost spirals, fern curls) filters setting through her new perceptual lens. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater library's impossible architecture (rooms folding into contradictory dimensions, the four-position reading room) directly constrains and enables Meridian's solution, driving the climactic lens-reassembly and soul-housing. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "phosphorescent light," "water pressed against ancient windows," "books floated in their cases." The body-as-setting moment when Meridian "felt herself occupy multiple positions at once" charges the closure by making the final threshold-keeper stance physically legible. Spatial choreography across the flooded corridors and the central reading room remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor recurs purposefully as a ritual site and the ridge setting frames scarcity and isolation effectively. Sensory detail is selective: moonlight on tarnished silver, breath clouds in freezing air. The arbor does not constrain a tactical choice in the middle, but it charges the final image as the gathering place where anonymous giving becomes communal. Spatial choreography is clear when figures emerge and work beneath the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct and blooming wisteria anchor setting early and return at closure with charged imagery. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting, constraining perception through Kwan Yin's tear and shaping the healing sequence. Sensory detail is purposeful: "violet waves," "breathing in shallow, rapid bursts," "light radiating...golden and soft as pollen." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The twilight atmosphere modulates pressure subtly, supporting the foggy-lucid tone without becoming static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly anchored with root-woven spans, hedges, and pools that reflect memory rather than sky. The hyperbolic maze's impossible curves constrain Miriam's journey and charge the final dissolution. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her designer's perspective. The halo fragment embedded in roots and the fading photographs function as micro-setting objects that participate in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carnival setting supplies the key-arrangement code that drives the puzzle, making it essential to plot mechanics. Spatial details (northeast corner, counter, midway) guide action clearly. The dusty shelves and prize remnants establish decay without catalog bloat. The chains function as micro-setting, constraining movement ("each step calculated") and charging the final image when they fall.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse, its calcium-webbed dome, geothermal vents, impossible apples, and the forge positioned beneath the aurora are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Mira's synesthetic perception. The ashen forge and the aurora's green-to-violet shift charge the final beat, and spatial choreography (spiral staircase, northern curve, layers of water and wreckage above) remains coherent. The environment doesn't constrain a pivotal choice in the escalation, but it saturates the ending image and makes the setting inseparable from Mira's work—her battered marvel of a greenhouse becomes the frame through which transformation is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Emerald Station is anchored early with jade-green tiles, amber light, western bench, and eastern skylights that create the impossible overlap of gold and silver. The station's architecture (pillars, skylights) enables the moonbeam curtain and transforms the space into "something cathedral-like, sacred" at closure. The jar of moonbeams constrains Mira's final action (uncapping, pouring upward) and charges the ending image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the stakes—light, color, arrangement—without wandering into catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned control room is vividly realized through rusted panels, static monitors, and humming units, anchoring Mira's isolation. Sensory details—frost-rimed windows, meltwater, groaning pipes—are filtered through her artist's POV and evolve with the thaw. The annealer's eighteen-hour cooling cycle and the spring landscape meaningfully constrain her rhythm and mirror the thematic work, charging the final image of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library—iron shelves as skeletal orange fingers, open roof pooling starlight—is vivid and specific. The seashell's rough edge and the UV-revealed cipher on the cast anchor micro-setting in tactile choice. However, spatial choreography during Carson's approach and the officers' arrival is vague; we lose track of stairs, distance, and Maya's positioning. The setting contributes atmosphere but does not constrain the final confrontation; Carson's hand hesitates on dialogue alone, not because of environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge fort constrains choice throughout: ancient stones, gap in battlements, remaining door, central hearth all shape her movements and frame her vigil. The booklet functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image when she adds her entry. The ambered hush operates as atmospheric texture that becomes navigational tool—environment as phenomenological map. Sensory detail (wind clawing cracks, gold leaf crumbling, marbled quietude) is selective and POV-filtered, building density without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard functions as both prison and constraint, with ice fractals, seized fountain, and "twilight never changed" creating a coherent pressure-space. The violin—grown from ice, warm-cold, producing amalgamated notes—directly enables J-7's epiphany and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (sweeping paths, approaching fountain, setting down violin) remains clear throughout. The "perpetually caught between memory of day and promise of night" grounds the liminal tone without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal forecourt and glass chimes establish atmospheric specificity early and return at closure ("chimes sang their endless song"). The projector lens becomes a concrete investigative tool. Spatial choreography (pavilion → booth → archive stairs) remains clear. The rain-washed tiles as "scattered evidence" charges the final image purposefully. Minor: occupational systems (registrar duties, archive work) are gestured at but not pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The garden maze provides spatial constraint (junctions, paths) and the marbles function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when light catches their fractures. Sensor readouts and botanical dyes anchor the Empire's measurement regime. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout excavation and positioning. Minor gap: the maze's physical evolution (six inches overnight, new roots) is described but not deeply integrated into Elara's tactical movement or the Council's spatial verification process.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    The xenobiology station, triple sunsets, and crystalline moths establish vivid setting anchors early. The magnetic nexus and viewing platforms constrain when and how Renna can work. However, spatial choreography within the maintenance bay is vague—disassembled projectors and a "jury-rigged apparatus" lack tactile specificity. The hologram's physical presence (cold light that "radiated warmth") borders on contradictory metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with water at knee-height, flickering lanterns, and submerged stage. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: pit → podium → music stand → floorboard gap. The environment pressures one key choice (plunging into murky water) and charges the final image (water lapping, lanterns settling). Sensory selection is strong early but becomes generic in the final paragraph ("water lapping gently," "steady flames"). The micro-setting (the pit itself, the gap between floorboards) successfully functions as setting that constrains discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The weather station supplies the snowpack sensors that become the instrument of change; the mountain air and altitude contextualize the avalanche and Eva's death. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, constraining the smudge action and charging the final image with Eva's method (edges inward). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (auroras, thin air, translucent paper in backlight). Does not quite reach 8+ because the station itself remains somewhat generic beyond the instruments; no unique spatial feature of this particular station alters a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered—"walls wept with condensation," rust, valve assembly, junction chamber—and the beaded valve wheel constrains her appraisal choices and charges the final image (it "clinked against her back... a rosary of evidence"). The setting shapes her investigative tactics and the closure decision. Spatial choreography is clear throughout descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacombs are vividly rendered with purposeful decay (mushrooms on spines, roots drinking from springs) and the setting charges the final image—the swan placed among illegible volumes completes the cycle motif. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (her lantern, the stone's cool density). The underground ecosystem functions as micro-setting that constrains her method (preservation through decomposition), satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice. Minor dock: spatial choreography of her descent and return ("weeks or years later") remains vague, but does not obscure present action.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with vivid specificity ("hush of dreaming roots," "ancient oaks," western terrace). The eclipse's sensory details (strange shadows, temperature drop, bird silence) are concrete and atmosphere-building. The wooden box and curl are handled physically. The setting charges the final image (oaks above, roots below frame the conversation), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the terrace itself doesn't constrain any choice—it's staging rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silo library is vividly particular: rust patterns as script, books spiraling against curved walls, the displaced axis made spatial. Micro-setting details (the table, the tapestry wedged between theology texts, the fireplace three levels down) constrain the historian's movements and charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects archival attention (texture, vibration, visual layering) filtered through the POV's professional priorities. The recurring tapestry dragons and the silo's tilt serve as both setting and symbolic architecture without becoming merely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Crake Island, the Barnacle pub, and the lighthouse anchor the piece early with vivid, purposeful detail: "scarred wood," "black water," "fog," and the beam "regular as a heartbeat." The lighthouse functions as both setting and recurring object, charging the final image when Margaret steps out and the beam sweeps past, embodying the "open secrets" kept in plain sight. Sensory selection is filtered through Margaret's familiarity (the floor's tilt is "the island's familiar character"). The microdot—small, tactile, obsolete—grounds the spycraft premise in a concrete object. The only gap: occupational detail about fortune-cookie writing is minimal, but the scene's pressure doesn't require it.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dimensional anchor is vivid and functional: "peculiar vibration where three realities pressed against one another," walls that "breathe," distances that "refuse to stay fixed." The loop pedal and palette are handled concretely and constrain Micah's tactics. The white paint—"presence of all colors unified"—directly enables the climactic philosophical move (Elena as already-complete vessel). Spatial choreography (basement, altar, Micah's placement of tools) remains clear throughout. Does not reach 8+ because the dimensional anchor's properties, while atmospheric, don't visibly alter Micah's choices mid-exorcism; it's more backdrop than active constraint at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass spire and mirrored horizon are rendered with vivid specificity ("sky and ice indistinguishable, the world folded into perfect symmetry") and the setting directly shapes Maya's ritual by providing the suspended, liminal atmosphere she seeks. The nautilus shell segment functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout (inside/outside, shell/pen/drawer). The frozen lake's transformation from mirror to distinct elements tracks causally with the sun's rise, and this environmental shift corresponds to Maya's loss of productive window, making setting a functional constraint on her work.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is vivid and specific, with the inverted gravity creating memorable spatial pressure. The setting actively constrains choice: it appears only every forty-three days, exists "between the drop and the ripple," and its periodic manifestation shapes Maya's tactics. The final image of Maya touching "real ground" and walking through "ordinary rain" charges the closure by contrasting the viaduct's impossible physics. Sensory detail is purposeful—"rainwater dripping upward," "phosphorescence"—and filtered through Maya's exhausted perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    The drum maker's cavern functions as more than backdrop: Mira hangs fabrics to absorb echoes, uses the stone floor to transmit vibrations, and the space's "mirrored hush" directly shapes her method. The broken phonograph needle, workbench, and drum frames are handled across multiple beats and constrain her choices. However, the setting details remain somewhat generic (heavy fabrics, stone floor) without the specificity that would make this cavern irreplaceable, and the seasonal timeframe ("autumn's last breath met winter's first whisper") is more ornamental than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting throughout: fountain, iron gate, bench, ivy anchor the space and recur with purpose. The sensory filter is consistent (moisture from wetlands, smell of growing things) and reflects Maren's professional attention. The final image charges the courtyard motif—"surrounded by walls and ivy and fading light"—linking her physical sanctuary to her intellectual method. The pigeon's brass tube and the tin of seeds are handled concretely. However, the zone itself remains abstracted; we get exposition about barriers and farmers but no on-page spatial constraint that alters a choice in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    The terra-cotta grotto supplies vivid sensory detail ("rippling with patterns," "liquid terra-cotta under starlight") and the environment constrains movement through the descent. The rope's physicality ("frayed coil," "worn fibers") is present but doesn't meaningfully alter a choice. The patterns shift as Marcus moves, creating micro-setting engagement that charges the final image moderately, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken greenhouse setting constrains choices materially: ankle-deep water, shattered glass panels, wind patterns from shipwrecks all shape the violinist's acoustic perception and tactical approach. The mendicant's bowl functions as micro-setting, discovered half-submerged and repositioned with purpose. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she hears the "low, sustained note" others would miss, notices how "sound bounced between water and glass." The final image of rust turning to gold charges the closure without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber grotto functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent walls create liminal atmosphere that supports Maren's threshold work and dual purposes ("beauty and function"). The blotter petal as recurring object charges the closure—its return to Maren's wrist makes the cost tactile. Sensory detail (amber light, static electricity, fragrance molecules) is filtered through Maren's professional priorities and the honeyed-tone dusk mirrors her manufactured peace without shouting. Spatial choreography is clean (worktable, entrance, temple touch) and the setting's dual-purpose design constrains her choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The Maritime Library's rooftop garden with "shelves built low beneath the open sky" provides vivid, purposeful setting that enables the meeting. Starlight illuminates the locket photo, linking environment to the thematic work. The "breezy library terrace" and "gentle wind moving through the open-air shelves" create coherent atmosphere. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—the conversation could occur in many locations with minor edits, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with consistent sensory specificity (glass-like trees, iridescent soil, bioluminescent memory). The setting constrains the sculptor's search (teaching her "secret paths") and the arbor serves as the spatial anchor for community gatherings and the sculpture's placement, directly shaping the final image. Micro-setting via the reeds she carries and the crystalline fibers merges her past with present, charging closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rooftop canals and the Throat's suspended cages create vivid spatial pressure. The pendant functions as micro-setting, warming and cooling to signal time malleability and constraining her choices (aging the lock, releasing borrowed time). Sensory hierarchy is selective: "water barely rippling," "suspended quiet," cages "swaying without wind." The canal system supplies resources (proximity, momentum) that enable the climax. The body-as-setting threshold is met when the pendant's temperature shift signals tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites is vividly realized and functionally layered: mineral water nourishes amber fruit, mosaic stones guide movement, shadows dovetail with cracks. Sensory selection (glowing fruit, century-slow drips, eroded face on stone) charges atmosphere without catalog excess. The mosaic stone—half-eroded woman's face—constrains Marius's planting choice and returns reweighted when his tears fill the cracks, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography (stepping stones, tree locations, moonlight shaft) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sapphire-blue dawn light, pipe chases, ventilation grate, and children's-section table provide concrete spatial grounding. The ferromagnetic tape's smell triggering her grandmother's voice is a strong sensory anchor that charges her purpose. Slight miss: the "crawl spaces beneath the old building" and "narrow passages between floors" remain architecturally vague—specific ductwork or beam dimensions would add constraint. The setting enables her reveal (security down, accessible supplies) but doesn't force a tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mossy trellis and post-storm setting are vivid and return at key moments, and the linden tree functions as both physical anchor and constraint (wires cutting into bark). The wild plants in the back corner provide a contrast that shapes Marcus's realization. However, the setting mostly serves as backdrop and metaphor rather than pressing immediate choices; the storms pass through but don't force a decision in real time—Marcus acts in their aftermath, reducing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal rhythm constrains every choice: twice-daily causeway drowning governs when she can cross, the receding tide exposes objects that seed her work, rain trails reveal hidden topography. The basin's flooding forces her to carry the wet canvas "awkwardly above her head"—micro-setting pressuring action. Sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered: "ash-gray sand," "crushed shells and rust" as paint medium, the brooch's "golden catastrophe." The island's drowned/resurrected cycle charges the final image of meaning "pooling in low places."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cave is vividly realized through selective sensory detail (luminescent fungi/obsidian, acoustics transforming breathing, stalactite wind chimes) and filtered through Vera's professional lens. The cave pearl returns with reweighted meaning at closure, constraining the ending image. Spatial choreography remains clear (deeper into throat, pooling shadows at feet, rising around them). The setting pressures choice: the accumulated enchantment in this specific space draws the unseen forces, making location causally active. Minor note: "cathedral of bright darkness" and similar phrases elevate register slightly beyond strict necessity, but the effect supports tone.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivory Harbor after rain is vividly anchored with sensory specificity: limestone cliffs weeping, salt-taste air, spray at dawn and high tide. The environment constrains Maris's observation windows (she must wait for spray conditions) and the herald's valve, mounted in the tower at closure, charges the final image. Micro-setting (tower instruments, spray patterns) shapes her method and validates the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pavement arrows, fog-architecture, and crystallized-silence fortress create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that guides Mara's path and constrains her movement. The starlit vault and impossible geometry are filtered through her analytical-artistic eye. The phantom punch functions as a key (tool-as-setting) that opens the gates—a micro-setting move that directly enables the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the journey, and the setting charges the final image of the self-drawn map.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tower's "walls crumbling just enough to let the wind carry whale songs inland" and its function as "vast recording device" constrain Elena's understanding and charge the final image of her remaining. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV: "felt it in her teeth, in the instruments that trembled without cause." Spatial choreography stays coherent across the tile discovery, visions, and transcription beats. The micro-setting (tile, tower-as-instrument) actively shapes her choices and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prismatic escondite supplies vivid sensory grounding ("crystalline walls," "auroras dance," "magnetic storms") and its dimensional-fault convergence makes it the mutiny's epicenter, directly shaping Vesper's access to the threshold. The impossible beach and salt-water smell extend the setting's pressure. The fragment embedded in her wrist functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and pulling her forward at each turn, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prep room is used actively: Mira arranges tools, performs routine examination, the drainage system becomes the discovery point, and the space's nocturnal isolation enables the vigil. The formaldehyde opener and "high windows" at dawn bracket the night and charge the closure. The ink pot on her workstation functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its presence reminds her of inherited sin and primes her refusal to forge. Spatial choreography is clear (Pavel in corner, Elena on table, Mira at workstation). Minor: occupational detail (medical examiner oversight, logbook protocols) is sketched rather than lived-in, but at this length the prep room does constrain and enable the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bonsai labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cherry blossoms, wisteria, miniature geometries) and the fluorescent lamp anchors the workshop. Spatial choreography remains coherent across workshop and labyrinth. However, the labyrinth does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the stationer's final action—it functions primarily as backdrop and thematic mirror. The invented girl's encounter with the labyrinth (time compression, aging seven years) is more causally integrated than the stationer's walk through it.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The container labyrinth and tide rhythm create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The poison label anchors the inciting discovery, and the port's spatial choreography (roof, lowest level, high tide retreat) remains clear and functional. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond mood; the protagonist moves freely without environmental friction. Strong sensory detail and consistent world logic elevate the score, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory's ruined dome and "bruised twilight skies" create vivid atmosphere, and the cliff-wind resonating through the cello strings constrains the final discovery. Micro-setting (seashell, cello, acoustic sweet spot) charges the closure image effectively. However, orientation delay (cliff-top location unclear until mid-story) and the observatory functioning as passive backdrop in early beats prevent higher scoring. Spatial choreography remains clean once established.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The raft city's rotting platforms and fraying cables constrain Mira's tactical choices (resist vs. negotiate), and the carnival's chaos provides cover for her graffiti work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("paint-splattered overalls," "drunk on sugar and spectacle"), filtered through Mira's mediator perspective. The setting participates in closure (graffiti murals glowing at sunset), but spatial choreography across platforms remains somewhat abstract—we don't track distances or adjacencies that would further tighten tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The moonlit summit and crater environment are vivid and purposeful: regolith texture, temperature swing physics, and the terminator line all ground the setting. The chemical beacons (copper sulfate, magnesium) are specific and shape her method. Spatial choreography is clear across descent and ascent. The setting constrains choice (three-hour window, temperature trigger) and charges the final image ("amber light," "golden"). Small excess: some details (shocked rock, melted glass) are catalogued without immediate tactical pressure, and the portable darkroom materializes late without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rail depot, harbor sounds, mist, and workbench tools are vivid and purposefully filtered through Mara's non-visual perception. Sensory hierarchy is strong—thermal feedback, water vibrations, and sound replace sight consistently. The copper pitcher, glass basin, and microwelder constrain her repair method across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment charges the atmosphere without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted outpost, condensation on glass, and frozen lake are purpose-driven and layered: rust-red residue links windowsill to lakeshore; condensation patterns teach her the convergence logic; ice darkness signals subsurface currents. The falcon and its canister ground the opening beat. Micro-setting (window glass, corroded frame) constrains her method of discovery and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Millhaven's cobblestones, archway, and spatial choreography (square → main street → alleys) are vivid and purposeful. The ebony tuning fork as micro-object charges multiple beats and the keystone strike seeds the final bell-ringing image. Sensory detail is selective (dissonant chime, "wild hush," weeds through cobblestones) and filtered through the tuner's professional ear. No occupational systems exposition, economy maintained. The archway and cobblestones constrain the walking ritual and shape the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "coral-encrusted pillars...like bones," "cathedral of stone and shadow," brass helmet and preservation field shimmering with "impossible technology." The submersible's manipulator arms and energy probe constrain Marina's rescue attempt, making setting tools integral to the climax. The collapse of the temple at closure charges the final image with visible consequence. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the shift from temple interior to ascent through "dark water" to "stars" provides a clear environmental arc that mirrors the thematic movement.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse prison is vividly particular: copper-stained walls, confessional lattice casting amber light, spiral staircase scuffs worn smooth. Sensory detail is purposeful—copper light blesses each word, rocks emerge like dark teeth—and the setting creates genuine constraint (the reef, the tides, the warden's rounds). The lattice window functions as micro-setting that frames Marcus's daily ritual and charges the final image. Strong execution with clear pressure from environment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (silver apples that sing, plums that weep mercury, pears with phosphorescence), and the eternal night frames the entire atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no on-page choice hinges on a spatial constraint, tool availability, or object proximity. The carved stone bead is placed "at the greenhouse's heart" in the final beat, but this is a symbolic gesture rather than a tactical necessity that alters outcome. Without a choice-constraining role, Q3 caps at 8.8 per the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The red canyon, tide pools, and carved labyrinth are vivid and purposeful; the wharf suspended above creates spatial constraint. The illustration plate and dyed threads ground Mara's craft in sensory detail. The labyrinth's physical structure enables the overlapping-path revelation and the natural gathering spaces discovered by walkers, directly shaping the story's central choice. Micro-setting (loom, textiles, white stones) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains Mira's choices: roots breaking through ceiling guide her wandering, the pear-root chamber houses the sundial discovery, and the final placement among wild trees charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—cool darkness, white blossoms as childhood flash, bone-rich earth—and filtered through Mira's "warmly curious" rather than repelled perception. The sundial base's inverted state (timekeeper below ground, gnomon lost) supplies both a concrete constraint (she must carry it up, piece by piece) and charges the thematic inversion motif. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across descent, lateral wandering, and ascent without floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden arcade is richly particularized—vaulted ceiling, stained glass satellites, tessellated floor—and the dawn light actively constrains Maya's twenty-minute window. The ebony clipboard's hidden graphite property is a purposeful micro-setting detail that enables her resistance. The chalk patterns and the arcade's multi-purpose present (café, museum, pod rental) ground the futuristic-nostalgic world, and the smearing of codes integrates setting into action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt observatory is grounded early with blue walls, eternal candle, scholars overhead. The candle and Mira's embroidery frame constrain her final insight: holding fabric to flame reveals the hidden pattern. Autumn leaves bookend as metaphor but don't constrain choice. Spatial choreography is clean—Mira at her station, visitors consulting different cartographers. The observatory supplies the light, the overheard conversations, and the embroidery tool that becomes her evidence map, meeting the 9+ gate test of environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and specific: twisted roots, brackish water, moonlight filtering through canopy, spirits singing in harmonies. The hanging window between mangrove trunks and the gargoyle shard both appear as tactile objects. The setting pressures Isla's journey (she navigates by spirit-voices) and the moonlight is essential to the shard's function. The mangroves frame the medium's dwelling and the spirits' song becomes a luminous path home, directly shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mist-clad atrium provides sensory grounding (purple-gray twilight, fountain mist) and the cast functions as micro-setting—its dense script constrains Maya's approach and charges the ending commitment. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, fountain, glass ceiling). The brain coral as handled object (twice: shown, traced by the girl) reweights meaning at closure. Minor: the recovery center's broader layout remains vague, but at this length the localized atrium and tactile objects do the necessary work.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog functions as both canvas and constraint, shaping Mira's choice to amplify rather than impose new images. Skeletal apple trees with "silver-gray stone" bark and the fresco jutting from a collapsed wall create a vivid, decayed world. The projectors and batteries impose a time limit that pressures the scene. The orchard's spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the fog's acceptance of light charges the closure image: "some things—the best things—only needed to exist for a moment."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sound wave garden is vivid and particular: sculptured hedges that redirect sound, humming stone pathways, whispering fountains. The amphitheater's curved walls and the garden's acoustic properties constrain Marta's choices—her sung note transforms into "Are you certain?" and the wall's sonic opening charges the discovery beat. The hobo nickel functions as micro-setting, its carved face shifting across cycles to pressure her understanding. The environment directly participates in the final image, singing her "deeper" as she releases into another layer.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    The greenhouse functions well as micro-setting: humidity-thick air, condensation-fogged glass, terrariums, click beetles, and incubators create vivid sensory grounding filtered through the conspiracy's needs (off-grid, no cameras). The gourd rattle's tactile presence—cracked open, seeds spilling into palm—constrains the reveal and charges the final moment when the new rattle "sounded different." However, the community gardens themselves remain generic postcard descriptions; no dirt under nails, no specific layout or neighbor tension pressures the planting scenes. Spatial choreography in the greenhouse is clean but static—characters don't move or use the space under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly anchored and recurs purposefully: pearlescent interior, spiral chambers, soil in the deepest chamber. The bulb's planting in that chamber ties setting to closure. Sensory detail (starlight, dust plains, wind howling) is selective and POV-filtered. The shell constrains the action by offering the only soil for the bulb, which elevates integration and directly charges the final collaborative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal library's translucent walls, climate-controlled alcoves, and eastern wing anchor spatial choreography throughout. The cracked bamboo tube and glass fragments constrain Miren's tactical choices on the page. Sensory selection—rose and amber light, the wheeze of the broken tube, the hum of orchids—filters through Miren's professional attention and reinforces urgency. The floating library three miles above clouds charges the final image by isolating her preservation work from the world below, making the cost of her devotion legible.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archive's "sealed containers holding the final whispers of dead tongues" constrains the emotional stakes—they work among voices that died in silence. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting, passed between them and reweighted at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear (table, satchel, notebook positions). The single lamp's amber light filters perception consistently, though the archive itself could pressure a choice more directly—it remains evocative backdrop rather than active constraint on their reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amphitheater's volcanic breathing—stone expanding/contracting with thermal cycles—is vivid and recurs purposefully, charging the final image of the building as "steady and eternal." Spatial choreography (terraced seats, orchestra, floodgate chamber descent) remains clear. The surveyor's chain and hidden valve are handled tactilely. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric without becoming a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The attic is vividly rendered with crossbeams, skylight, wire-and-wood pigeon architecture, and dust motes that serve as both atmospheric detail and Elena's mapping ritual. The Mars meteorite pressed in a hymnal and the recording device are tactile, specific objects. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting pressures Elena by containing evidence of her past (shoeboxes of messages, the pigeons) but doesn't directly constrain the confession choice—the device does that work—so it falls just short of the 9+ gate requiring environment to shape the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting and lyric anchor, charging the final image ("prismatic fragments, each carrying a different frequency of loss"). The oak planks and drafting table ground tactile engagement (grain-reading, touch). Spatial choreography is clean. Does not quite reach 8+ because the terrace's metaphysical properties (why it drifts, how panels shift) remain ornamental description rather than constraint that alters Maya's tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater facility is vividly anchored: pressurized dome, barnacled corridors, bioluminescent glow from ruins 300 feet below. Sensory detail is selective and evocative (synthetic coffee and kelp, salt-dark mystery, curved glass). The setting provides spatial convergence (ley lines, stellar processionals mirrored in architecture) that drives Mara's discovery, and the final plankton bloom charges the closure image. Micro-setting (observation dome, burnt feather, Chen's mugs) constrains movement and primes the revelation, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The iridescent cave's geode walls and crystalline surfaces actively constrain Calla's method—she presses the crater glass against leaves, traces vines, and plants seeds in mineral darkness. The cave pulses with light that reflects her emotional state and the temporal swallow's arrival/departure brackets her discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (outcropping, wall, her open hand) and the cave's "soft rainbow light, beautiful and cold simultaneously" charges the final beat when the walls pulse brighter as if approving. The setting shapes both her process and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered (weathered pillars, residual pools, bioluminescent plankton, starlight) and the twice-daily cycle constrains her window. The bishop becomes a charged object—held up to catch starlight, it draws the elderly man and anchors the convergence. Spatial choreography is clear (third pillar, exit trajectory, tidal pools). The "twelve minutes" clock and rising tide whisper impose urgency. The setting does double duty as metaphor (liminal space) and tactical grid.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden functions as micro-setting that constrains Kael's practice space and provides the conditions for moonstone dust to appear. Sensory details—"starlight thickening like honey," silver fruit that never ripens, time pooling like quicksilver—are filtered through a dancer's perception of rhythm and gaps. The garden's perpetual dusk creates atmospheric pressure and the "chrysalis" image charges the transformation. Spatial choreography (hedges, trees, her movement patterns) remains coherent throughout and the environment enables the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism atrium is rendered with concrete sensory detail (condensation beading, skeletal luminosity, geometric panels, corroded door) and functions as an instrument, not backdrop. The maintenance hatch and glass floor panels enable Samuel's discovery. The bay water beneath and the dawn light through mist are causal: without them, the ripple-refraction phenomenon cannot occur. Pearl Bay at dawn is precisely timed to the light quality needed. Micro-setting (the hatch, the stones, the leather satchel of tools) all constrain and enable the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.7)
    The moonlit ridge, Douglas fir, and valley lights below provide coherent spatial anchors. The cracked porcelain box is handled twice (opening it, placing it at the tree) and its surface details (webbed fractures catching moonlight) recur purposefully. Sensory selection—silver light on clay, ash settling, embers below—filters through Marcus's professional firefighter lens. The ridge setting constrains the final choice (returning the box to where his father died) and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3, but the valley and celestial bodies remain postcard elements without tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The grotto's three arching mouths and limestone walls provide a vivid frame, and the tide's presence bookends the piece purposefully. The gauge appears in Maya's hands multiple times and its needle movements track the convergence mechanics. The decorations (shells, glass, driftwood) are arranged with specificity, though their physical presence never constrains a choice—Maya places the silver sea glass "where mathematics suggested maximum resonance" without dramatizing what that placement costs or enables. The setting charges the atmosphere but doesn't pressure tactics at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage constrains movement and signals building sentience early, the fireplace delivers the diaries, and the corridor's acoustic anomaly becomes a tactile presence. Sensory hierarchy tilts toward sound (equipment whine, echo patterns) with touch (ivy whispers, recoils) and sight (film negatives, dim light through ivy). The climate-shift premise remains scenic rather than pressuring a choice; "after the shifts" frames backstory but doesn't tighten present options. Spatial choreography is coherent (passage → fireplace → exit), and the ivy parting as she leaves charges the final image with reciprocal awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and wet flagstones create a vivid, purposeful stage where light physics (prismatic splitting) directly enable the mirror work. Sensory detail is selective and tied to the ritual: "beveled stone edge splitting the emerging twilight into ribbons of color." The mirrors function as micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the spring evening timing tightens the window for her attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ancient terrace, twin moons, and urns of soil are vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual spatially. The celestial alignment functions as both atmosphere and tactical clock, tightening the window for action. Spatial choreography is clean (arrival sequence, kneeling at the altar). The valleywood trees and combined soils charge the closure image, making the setting essential rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Salt flat setting directly enables the closure: Marcus "murdered rivers to find this exact spot," and the "white expanse" frames the final walk-away image. Micro-setting (egg in cradle, device humming, thunder approaching) constrains the release action and times the departure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "salt that crunched like old bones," "first raindrops fell." The environment's transformation (lake → salt flat → rain returning) mirrors and charges the thematic arc. Strong micro-setting usage; no occupational excess.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver courtyard under snow is anchored early and consistently, with the snow's prismatic shimmer and geometric patterns guiding Celestine's movements. The setting provides concrete constraints—the cold air, the stone witness to "centuries of careful performances," the crystalline map beneath snow—that shape her ritual. The prism sanctuary itself materializes through sensory detail (fractured light walls, echoes hanging "like fruit") and the final image of dawn turning "the color of pearl and promise" effectively charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the transition from courtyard to sanctuary and back.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The decommissioned radar dome is established early with strong sensory detail ("curved walls," "concrete shell," "peculiar half-darkness"). The campfire story stick functions as micro-setting, handled physically across beats and charging the final image when the drunk returns it. Spatial choreography is clean (stage, audience, back row). The setting subtly mirrors theme (old military structure repurposed for subversive art) and the dome's acoustic properties affect the argument's echo, constraining Marcus's emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto is vivid and purposeful: "moss-thick walls cradling clouds," aerial garden with moths, spatial details (spiral twenty feet across) remain coherent. Setting constrains Sera's choices—she must descend by nightfall, the moss allows dowel planting—and the final image is charged by the grotto's improbable elevation and verdant enclosure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("paper made from whispers"). Micro-setting (the spiral structure itself) functions as a spatial anchor that holds the monarchs and the reader's attention, meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor: the forest canopy below is mentioned once but never revisits to pressure the descent, a small missed opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound sanctum constrains choice (preserves the rope, enables aurora-light readings) and charges the final image when light shafts through punched holes. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: aurora colors, ice-cold air cooling bronze, rope texture. The ceremonial rope functions as both setting and tool, directly shaping Maren's work. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Strong micro-setting integration elevates this into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bunker and storm create concrete pressure: the approaching storm forces urgency, roots and rain shape the physical experience, and the pedestal positions the wafer seal as a focal object. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (moss-thick concrete, electric smell of transformation, cold floor, golden light through vines). The rewilded forest functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. The wafer seal's translucent, shifting symbols constrain her action by requiring "precisely playful" touch.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace—ziggurat terraces, salvaged solar panels, reclaimed stone, lattice windows—grounds the setting in concrete scarcity and post-collapse rebuilding. Candle rationing and precious paper anchor frugality in physical terms. The star chamber and cooling floor constrain Mara's work spatially, and the palace's liminal status (between regimes) subtly pressures her to finish before seizure. The morning star appearing above the terraces at closure charges the final beat with environmental resonance. Sensory detail (violet hour, dusty amber glow, cool tile surface) is selective and tied to her priorities. Minor gap: the palace's interior spatial choreography (how she moves from star chamber to telescope) remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sanctuary's soundlessness and reality-shifting walls function as purposeful constraints: silence amplifies body truth, translucent walls show alternate pasts, and the setting "reappears for those who need it most," shaping Elena's timing. The music box as micro-object recurs with evolving charge (broken pin → symbol of frozen relationship → container for grace). Spatial choreography is clean, though the sanctuary's "folds of reality" abstraction occasionally drifts toward placeholder mysticism. The final image—sanctuary fading, music box remaining broken—charges closure by anchoring the internal shift in a concrete object-state that persists after the emotional work.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ruined orchard district, fog, and Eliane's workshop are vividly anchored through selective sensory detail ("twilight frost," "fog-choked streets," "impossible geometries forming in the mist"). The mirrors and sextant function as micro-setting elements that constrain her approach: she must angle each mirror, match her breath to the dream's pulse, and physically carry the captured dream. The final image—frozen apples clinging to phantom branches—charges the closure by layering the district's decay with Gregor's failed star-charts. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The impossible orchard—gnarled trees threading roots through stone and timber, fruit among crossbeams—pressures Mara's climb and provides the medicine-growing context that bridges their crafts. Spatial choreography is clean: branch by branch, beam thirty feet up, legs dangling. The half-finished quartz eye as micro-setting object charges the final teaching moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ripening pears and old incense," "dappled sunlight," "copper hair in a practical braid." The orchard constrains movement and enables the closure collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The astral orchard and greenhouse dome are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—silver fruit blooming backward, luminous unease, breath forming crystals. The pistachio shell cameo and the carved tree at the orchard's heart function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (greenhouse → bathroom → orchard at midnight → tree's trunk). The bathroom as the quiet place for breakthroughs is a specific, character-filtered anchor that shapes a key choice. Minor gap: the asteroid's rotation and distant galaxy ribbon are scenic but don't alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain's "labyrinthine bookstore," "obsidian study," "Philosophy section," and "Cartography of Hours" are vividly particularized and purposefully chosen. The botanical diary (object-as-micro-setting) constrains Mira's solution by providing temporal-preposition entries. Sensory detail ("shelves that hummed," "mountain whispered") is selective and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography across sections remains clear despite scope.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival ship, fog, and carousel horses create a vivid, purpose-driven atmosphere that constrains Isla's movements (she can "walk anywhere but arrive nowhere"). The emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting, its unchanging green anchoring her amid flux and charging the moment she holds it toward the fog to trigger the garden's appearance. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Isla's professional lens ("breathing wool," "copper tag"). The setting participates directly in closure when the garden emerges from mist and the ship fades, fulfilling the micro-setting gate for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly particular (tick-tick-tick, escapement, pendulum shaft) and the impossible geometry of the archive pressures Marin's careful movement. The ceremonial rope—its braiding pattern matching the wax seal—directly enables the closure choice. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint; Marin's methodical navigation feels unopposed by the environment, and no tool or spatial limit tightens her options in the braiding act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harmonic caves, ice gallery, and echo chamber stone constrain the mapkeeper's choices throughout. The frozen pool's crack patterns function as micro-setting, directly enabling her method and charging the final image with phosphorescence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "gently luminous," "electric scream," "hammered repose." The ice patterns and geode structure are irreplaceable to the plot's hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass humming pavilion functions as both setting and constraint: its translucent walls enable her retrocognitive visions, the floor's shadow reveals the shard's location, and the constant hum creates a sensory anchor throughout. Spatial choreography is clean—silk cushion, foundation dig, wall-stuck thistle seeds—and the wasteland context pressures her isolation without becoming a postcard. The pavilion's hum ceasing when she holds the shard, then returning, is a concrete sensory shift that charges her discovery and final assembly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal whispering forecourt are vivid and purposeful, filtering sensory detail through Maris's professional priorities (shadow angles, inscription magnification). The environment constrains her work (storm provides "perfect illumination," fog's unpredictable moods create urgency) and charges the final image (softening fog at dawn). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor limitation: the city below remains abstract conjecture rather than a tactile pressure point, but the immediate setting—monuments, pillars, crystals—functions as micro-setting that shapes her method and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming fortress and moonflowers anchor locale and mood early; the mosaic functions as both setting detail and mechanism, constraining Mara's interpretation and charging her choice to act. Kerosene rags and the highest tower provide micro-setting that shapes the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (purple walls, white faces, kerosene scent implied), filtered through Mara's itinerant lens without tourist exposition. The final image of moonflowers closing at dawn reinforces cyclical time and partial transformation, charging the closure beat with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and hermit crab function as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Mei's understanding throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (Mei at water's edge, Lin on boulder, then kneeling beside). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("indifferent scatter of stars," "interior weather" of jade). The tidal cycle provides both concrete constraint (six-hour window) and thematic mirror without becoming overt symbolism. Deduction for occupational detail (chronicler work) that remains atmospheric rather than pressuring a specific choice in this conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The xenial trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Lina must secure herself with vine loops, and the specific spot where she spilled water becomes the site of the flower's appearance. Sensory hierarchy is strong—"blue and cool, like river stones" for morning silence, "jagged edges" after arguments—filtered through Lina's particular collecting practice. The gilded hush's synaesthetic rendering ("tasted like honey and sounded like light") is vivid and POV-specific. The trellis, clouds-below-feet inversion, and the flower's gold-veined petals all charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; no floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drifting terrace is vividly particular—floating three hundred meters above the valley, anchored to nothing, sound behaving differently—and the prisms' light-breaking function shapes the man's experience on the page. The storm glass vial appears in multiple beats (Mara checks it, shows the man, he touches it at departure) and constrains her professional judgment. Spatial choreography is coherent: gondola docking, western edge, prisms, descent. The train whistle echo provides a sensory anchor that recurs and charges the quiet. Environment actively pressures the emotional arc rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, orchard with circuit-bark trees, and painted walls supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Vess's expertise. The wall's paint layers constrain her method and charge the mural discovery. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent. The throne chamber at sunrise provides a resonant final image that integrates setting with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ashen sanctuary under starlight is vividly rendered and serves as more than backdrop—the scorched ground, the freestanding gate, and the tactile doorknocker constrain and charge Maya's rituals. Spatial choreography is clear (threshold, ash/grass boundary, phone placed "between them"), and the setting's desolation mirrors Maya's carved-out isolation. The final image of collaborative fire integrates environment into action, pushing this toward the micro-setting threshold where place shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom setting constrains choice at closure—the "fault line between mushroom chambers" becomes the literal threshold, and the fungi's glow "blazed brighter as reality stabilized," charging the final image. Sensory detail (blue/green pulses, salt-crusted bolt, flickering glimpses of parallel farms) is selective and purposeful. Micro-setting (the cellar, the bolt as tactile anchor) meets the 9+ gate criterion by shaping the ending, but the "parallel Mayas" glimpse remains visually vague and the spatial choreography of the threshold itself lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room is established early with curved walls, acoustic panels, and the bolted gramophone—details that constrain Mara's search method and guide the climactic discovery. The standing waves as micro-setting (audio architecture) directly enable the hidden compartment's reveal. Sensory detail (amber light, dust motes swirling at intersection points, golden shadows) is selective and filtered through Mara's focus. The room's acoustic design is not decorative but essential to plot mechanics, charging the final image when "golden shadows pooling at her feet" closes the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly established with "copper pears, mercury plums, trees whose bark ran with liquid starlight," and the "endless night" functions as both constraint and canvas. The orchard's multi-timeline fruit in the ending directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear as she moves through orchard rows. The micro-setting (glass panels, silver apple tree) anchors action and choice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The file room's dust patterns function as Sarah's investigative text—a micro-setting that constrains knowledge and shapes choice. The button held to lamplight, the basement's windowless quality, and evening settling outside create atmospheric pressure. Sensory detail is purposeful: dust thickness, tarnished brass, water-stained ink, lamplight catching the pinned button. The setting charges the final image when Sarah lights another lamp in the basement, embedding her commitment in spatial terms. Minor gap: the Philadelphia Foster Care Bureau location doesn't actively constrain tactics beyond providing the archive itself.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The auric lagoon with bioluminescent plankton is vivid and the puddle-map carved into stone is a memorable micro-setting detail that enables the key discovery. Spatial choreography is clear (embankment, passage, room, lagoon). However, the setting functions more as backdrop and puzzle than as constraint—Mira moves through it without environmental resistance shaping her choices. The stars-doubling-in-water motif appears twice but remains decorative rather than charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    The grotto is vividly anchored—moss-covered stones, jagged opening, light filtering through cracks, mist turned luminous. The prism atrium constrains her choice: its geometric suspension holds prophecies from coalescing, forcing her to play through negative space rather than melody. The body and instrument (saxophone, fingers on keys, breath control) function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through musician's perception (frequencies, overtones, resonance).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen arbor with upward-falling seeds and transforming leaves creates vivid, impossible physics that constrain Miren's sorting work and obsessive watching. The moonstone speck's moss-sprouting property provides a concrete mechanism that alters her understanding. Sensory detail ("mossy delight, damp and green despite the arbor's ashen appearance") modulates with the emotional arc. Spatial choreography remains clear across sorting table, monument building, and arbor bloom, though the arbor's scale and Miren's exact position in the final beat could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conservatory's neglect and the subterranean cavern constrain Ellis's choices (she must use her crowbar, follow darkness with phone light) and charge the final image (waterfall mist, stone pedestal, niches of clocks). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "ochre, copper, rust" leaves, "cold air rushed up," rainbow fractals in spray. Spatial choreography remains coherent across three locations. The compass rose and toolkit function as micro-setting elements that enable action. Minor gap: the naval chronometer and its letter feel slightly under-anchored in the opening; we learn of the estate sale in summary rather than through tactile discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-washed foundry provides concrete sensory anchors (dripping rafters, amber forge light, slick floor, cold anvils) and the transmutation circle functions as the ritual's stage. The zodiac coin's warmth "despite the rain-cooled air" charges the moment, and the forge heating the coin grounds the mystical act in physical process. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The foundry does not, however, constrain Mira's choices—she has access to every tool and material needed without friction, and the rain serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than complicating her work.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Echo Gorge is vividly realized through acoustic peculiarities that trap confessions, and the cold breath creates immediate atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, flat stone, deeper shadows). The setting constrains Mara's method (distorted notes slip between confessions) and charges the final image (canyon rim painted gold). Sensory hierarchy is strong, filtered through Mara's professional lens. Minor gap: the harp's physical handling and the stone's texture could ground the peak beat more tactilely.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and selective: bioluminescent bark responding to movement, trees dimming where she touches them, glow intensifying where tears fall. Sensory detail is filtered through her proprioceptive enhancements ("microscopic tremors of insects beneath the surface"). The environment constrains choice—she carves into living trees, and their molecular response to salt and emotion becomes the model for her equation. The forest charges the final image: dawn breaking violet through the canopy as she completes her night's work. Spatial choreography (stumbling forward, bracing against trunk and ground, carving symbols) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The suspended market is vivid and specific—platforms strung between spires, vendors selling "bottled starlight and crystallized memories"—and establishes a world where metaphor is literal. The workshop anchor is functional but minimal. The lighthouse lens fragment acts as micro-setting: its "elusively tangible" glass constrains Mira's method (she must hold it to each painting) and charges the final image when her grandmother's reflection appears within it. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's trained perception as a translator who "learned to see what others missed."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned circus setting is vividly anchored with sensory detail ("rust and old popcorn," "peeling paint and warped floorboards") and the pressed tin ceiling tiles with deliberate fracture patterns constrain Marcus's discovery path. Dust accumulation on cables is mentioned but never shown affecting his analysis. Spatial choreography across elevator shaft, ceiling crawlspace, and office floor remains clear. The horologist's mainspring barrel wedged in the pulley system charges the closure image when it loosens as the ghost fades, creating a resonant mechanical-spiritual link.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard and cloud-sea are vivid and voice-filtered through the concept of negotiable reality. Frost patterns return with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. The crystalline trees and transparent floors create a coherent spatial frame, and the press as a tactile, recurring object grounds action. However, the environment does not constrain a middle choice—Margritte moves freely without tactical friction from the setting's physical properties.

    The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: Matthias must cover mirrors before storms, the gilt corridors house stone panels left by prior inhabitants, and the crystal shard refracts differently during temporal auroras. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (luminescence refracted into "prismatic ghosts," copper-and-gold time streams). The mirrors-as-hazard and the stone panels both charge the closure by proving the aliens knew the danger first. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves; the setting evolution (covered/uncovered mirrors, storm arrival) tracks causally and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber as curved-wall amplifier is vivid and specific, shaping Cornelius's humming method throughout. The philosopher's chip returns with reweighted warmth at closure. Tools "sang their readiness" and the swan's garnet eyes anchor the first box. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, workbench, high windows) tracks cleanly and the setting charges the ending image when all seven boxes braid melodies below.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean lagoon constrains Mara's collection method—she cannot bottle conventional petrichor and must adapt to "condensation of earth's own breath." The narrow entrance, weeping stone, and interference patterns are filtered through her professional lens (molecular chains, synthesis). The compass and seven vials function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (crack, shore, perimeter, passage out). Minor: the factory and cliffs above receive summary treatment without sensory anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-tossed archway constrains Iris's initial choice (shelter) and the slide discovery there charges the closure image through the coordinate system and spiral driftwood patterns. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "turbine-hum of wind," "storm-light," and the physical handling of the slide anchor perception in the present. Spatial choreography remains clear across the archway, van, and final beach. The archway's structural logic (curve redirecting weight) mirrors the thematic scaffold, integrating setting into the conceptual frame without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber pavilion is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("honeyed pools," "frost-jeweled refuge") and tracks seasonally across the residency. The cathedral's rose window and its hidden etchings constrain Marina's discovery in a purposeful way. Spatial choreography between pavilion and cathedral is clean. The setting charges the final image when Marina paints on the pavilion's glass panels, creating a micro-setting that serves the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon charges both the retrocognitive beat and the final debris-message moment with physical specificity—"volcanic glass pooled in the desert's secret hollow" grounds the anomaly. The zeppelin library and navigation-room-turned-archives provide concrete workspace anchors. Spatial choreography remains clear across the time jump and return. The black sand functions as micro-setting in the closure, enabling Maya's message-arrangement and echoing Elijah's method. Minor limitation: the desert and sky remain somewhat generic between anchor points.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cove's sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: tide pools, tattered lanterns, the pier that "groaned with rot." The workshop's "abandoned instruments and dusty phials" ground the alchemist's isolation. The bottle's warmth and the lighthouse projecting "intricate patterns of possibility" charge the final image. Micro-setting (the bottle, the square, the lanterns) constrains and enables the closure action, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient orchard atop the Tessler Building is vivid and purposeful: "gnarled apple trees, branches skeletal against the violet sky" anchors both mood and spatial constraint. The setting's history (transplanted in 1889, "older than the skyscraper beneath it") charges Miriam's action—pressing her hand to the bark to access its memory of "different soil, different air" is a micro-setting choice that enables the prophecy's activation. The tactile detail (bark "rough, warm from the day's sun, alive") and the childhood field-trip memory ground the orchard as a lived-in space, not postcard scenery. Spatial choreography is clean; the reader tracks Miriam's position among the trees and her descent at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound atrium, frost-covered tables, frozen fountain, and starlight are vivid and filter through the protagonist's professional and emotional priorities (seed storage, grandmother's workspace). The ice pillar constrains her choice—she must touch it to feel time's texture, and its melting signals the vortex's danger. Spatial choreography (kneeling, prying, pressing palms, walking toward the door) tracks cleanly. The acorn cap functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when she pockets it and steps into the frozen night.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cathedral suspended in cloud, spiral stairs, bell tower, and open arches create vivid spatial anchors. The rope's physical vibration ("hemp fibers," "decades of dust") and the storm's "violent upheaval of wind and ice" constrain Mira's choice and charge the ending. Micro-setting (the rope as antenna) functions as setting and drives the climax. Slight deduction: the sanctuary's interior layout (quarters, arches, number of inhabitants) remains vague during the crucial sealing sequence, creating minor choreography uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory is vividly anchored (copper dome, spiral stairs, amber glow transforming shadow and light) and the yellow lantern glass—with its trapped bubbles—constrains Kael's understanding and charges the final image by proving imperfection creates beauty. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Kael notices star trajectories and lantern patterns because they serve his ritual. The micro-setting (desk, lantern, charcoal, paper) functions as tool-as-setting that shapes his nightly choice to trace rather than measure. Minor cap: while the mountain's edge and abandoned instruments are evocative, they do not pressure a choice as directly as the glass does.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    The apiary setting constrains choices throughout: cracked windows and wax seals ground Silas's isolation, abandoned hives provide the spatial pattern that unlocks the box, and the "last good wood" frames the closure commitment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("scorched breath," crystallized honey, stained glass colors "impossible in this bleached world"). The wasteland charges the oasis as a pocket of preservation against erasure, directly shaping the final stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The emerald silo is vividly described with purposeful detail (green-tinted glass filtering light into "wavelengths that helped the brain process duration differently"). Spatial choreography is clear: ladder, curved chamber, concrete floor, time capsule position. The silo's function as meditation chamber constrains Marcus's learning process, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the body and tool details remain generic; no recurring object charges the final image beyond the urn fragment, which functions more as plot key than setting element.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain, wet sand, and smooth stone anchor the setting concretely and early. The drake's awkward landing and the kite's erratic pull function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices: Maya retrieves the feather because it's "half-buried in wet sand," and the young man must balance kite tension, leading directly to the snap. The "burnished hush" and tentative sunlight modulate atmosphere without becoming static postcards. The final image—kite tumbling toward the horizon where lagoon meets sky—charges closure by spatially enacting the theme of incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The living stone pillars that "breathe through mineral pores" and release mist constrain Marina's choices throughout: she must plant where pillars lack trees, drill holes for copper threading, read mist color as feedback. The orchard-as-structure concept charges the final image when Marina dies "against her favorite pillar," completing the human-stone-tree integration. Spatial choreography is clear across temple, orchard, and nursery grove. The micro-setting (copper wire, pillar pores) directly shapes her restoration tactics and the closure's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed tower, monastery gardens, and reddish dust between sculptures create a micro-setting that constrains Kira's movement and charges the convergence point. Sensory detail is purposeful: "bronze quiet," rain dripping from eaves, moss-covered saints as "green ghosts." The dust formulae serve as environmental notation that guides the final recognition. However, spatial choreography between tower chamber and garden descent could be sharper, and the sculpture garden's decade-long closure is asserted rather than shown through gate rust or vine thickness.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming jetty is vivid and specific: morning glory wrapping pilings, barnacle hollows, soil pockets between planks. Sensory filtering reflects Erasmus's ecological priorities (nitrogen pockets, tide patterns). The jetty constrains his seed placement and charges the final image of submersion. Spatial choreography (jetty edge, water, shallows) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and fallen-dish-antenna shelter provide concrete spatial grounding and reinforce the post-war desolation. The preserved leaf in wax functions as micro-setting: its amber translucence constrains Finder's discovery (she must hold it to lamplight at the right angle), and the object charges the final image when paired with Crow's maple leaf. Sensory detail is selective—"wind whistling through gaps," "twisted metal bones"—and filtered through Finder's tracker perspective. The communications hub and satellite bones anchor the journey's endpoint with purpose-driven specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observation deck setting constrains Kira's action throughout: the glass bubble's transparency enables her witnessing, the temporal stretch traps her, the compass rose applique provides both physical anchor and thematic charge. Sensory details are filtered through her POV (warm metal, echoed silence, supernova light reflecting off gold). The deck's temporally stretched nature is not mere backdrop—it creates the unmappable sky she chooses to map. The final image ("Inside, temporally stretched and impossibly isolated") directly charges the closure choice. Micro-setting via the sketchbook and compass rose both constrain and enable her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (crystalline stairs, wind screaming, ice forming in eyelashes). The chess board carved into living ice and the pocket sundial's warming response provide micro-setting constraints that guide Seren's choices. Spatial choreography is clean (climb, summit, board, descent). The spire's humming and ice singing charge the swap sequence, and the setting pressures the character through cold and verticality, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The whispering gallery's curved acoustics and marble chessboard constrain Mara's archival method throughout: survivors walk patterns that "spelled names, dates, tiny moments," and "footsteps in certain patterns created resonances" that the building learns. The gallery's acoustic properties enable her discovery that "the architecture was becoming the archive," directly shaping her project's tactics and the final image. Nomadic penumbra (shifting firelight) charges both atmosphere and metaphor, filtering perception through "luminous absence." Spatial choreography remains coherent across all beats, and the micro-setting (chessboard, chalk marks, resonant dome) drives the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly particular—books growing like mineral deposits, seventeen turns through poetry/philosophy, greenhouse level where words sprout—and these details constrain Isla's movements and frame her ritual. The feather dropping through the ventilation shaft is a concrete spatial event that triggers the breakthrough. The lost language stone functions as micro-setting, its textured surface enabling the tactile-reading discovery that charges the closure. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout; the mountain's scale and the bookstore's strata create a coherent pressure-vessel for memory work.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The time-frozen village—ivy mid-growth, dust motes suspended—creates atmospheric constraint and the tapestry as micro-setting drives Elena's tactical engagement: she sits, plucks threads, decodes the border. The platinum labyrinth's metallic threads "catching what little illumination" recur and charge the final image when they "shimmer" and "warm beneath her hand" at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (chapel, altar, tapestry, village streets). Minor drift: "distant thunder" and "cleansing rain" function more as symbolic mood markers than concrete environmental pressures that shape her decoding choices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bone towers constrain her tactic (using echoes as instruments) and charge the final image (pale spire patient as bone). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: smooth as polished ivory, fog that breathes, echoes fragmenting and multiplying. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (among towers, toward the heart, walking toward the spire). The canyon functions as micro-setting, shaping choice and accumulating pressure across the night.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vivid and purposeful; the tilting platform and shrieking gears escalate pressure, and the porthole frames the rising wave that forces the climax. The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting—a physical constraint that guides Mira's choices beat by beat. Sensory details (acid hissing on brass, vials glowing softly, golden light erupting) are filtered through urgency. The key ring charm is handled twice (opening brush, final touch) and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cave constrains Marina's choice by existing as "temporary eternity," pressuring her to abandon observational distance. Mineral deposits, light-shaft, hermit crabs, and anemones are selective and purposeful, filtered through her painter's eye yet forcing present participation. The coastal path, quay references, and tidal pools anchor locale early. Spatial choreography (passage narrows, chamber opens, rock shelf placement) tracks cleanly. The cave's fragility ("next storm surge or rockfall") directly charges the final image of impermanence. No occupational depth issues; the painter lens shapes what's noticed without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, salt-scrubbed garden, and dock are vivid and purposefully deployed. The vial's scent becomes a sensory anchor that charges the reconciliation moment. Spatial choreography is clean (base, stairs, beacon, dock). The garden's night-blooming flowers and the beacon lit at dawn subtly mirror the shift from fury to vulnerability. The setting constrains the ticking clock (supply boat arrival) and the lighthouse itself becomes a silent witness, elevating this beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The starlit signal station is vivid and purposeful: broken hydraulics, cliff perch, maps on walls, the bronze censer foot as tactile anchor. Moon phase detail (waning crescent, new moon signal strength) constrains the navigation system with specificity. The station's disabled hydraulics appear twice, grounding the setting as a broken-but-functional space that charges the ending when "she'd learned to hear solace in malfunction." Spatial choreography is clear, though the valley-below and submerged temple remain postcard elements rather than live constraints on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hanging orchard constrains movement (rope bridges, swaying trees) and recurs as the final image charging closure: "swayed in the wind, resilient and storm-scarred and surviving." Storm pressure is embodied (rain striking horizontally, battering the cabin) and the ravine's acoustic threat (broadcasting loneliness) shapes Mara's prior isolation choice. The glass eye and textbooks function as micro-setting objects that enable the final turn. Spatial choreography stays coherent across cabin, bridges, and cliffside.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight create coherent atmosphere and the lighthouse beam functions as a recurring anchor. Spatial choreography is clear: dock length, where the body floated, the water's edge. The flower's "crystalline structure" and "silicate compounds" provide plausible SF grounding for memory storage. The final image—boutonnière floating then sinking—charges the ending, making the setting micro-choice functional, though the broader Norwegian coast remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The creek rising, the limestone outcropping, the constellation-tunnel, and the blooming cavern all constrain Marcus's path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: shop floor → alley → crack in rock → tunnel → cavern → door. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("glimmered with moisture and something else—veins of crystalline mineral"). The cavern's impossible bloom at midsummer functions as micro-setting that makes the door's appearance credible within the story's logic and charges the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the ridge's treacherous ascent, the ember grotto as false destination, the cobalt grotto's impossible suspension. The "bleeding starlight" detail is striking and specific. The fireflies ascending at closure create a strong visual anchor that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the climb, and the environment subtly mirrors the queen's internal journey without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember nexus functions as more than backdrop: the converging embers and brazier establish the meeting place's significance, and twilight's progression mirrors the emotional arc. The pocket-suns as micro-setting objects constrain Mira's demonstration and charge the final image when held "between their joined hands." Sensory detail is purposeful—"dying light," "drifting sparks," "ember-glow"—and filtered through alchemical perception. The nautilus shell's physical presence (silver chain, spiral catching light, warm between palms) grounds the abstraction and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cabin (pine sap, old smoke, lamplight, birch bark preference) constrains Mara's choices—she uses organic materials for "organic memory," isolates at altitude, and the lamp's flicker marks time's uncertainty. The valley cemetery and the grave are handled with purpose, the headstone discovery charging all subsequent action. Spatial choreography is clean: cabin interior, valley below, pines outside. The micro-setting (birch bark, lamp, floor where she wakes) charges the final image when even the lamp's state becomes uncertain. Scope fits this length; no occupational detail overload.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    The water clock shop is vividly rendered (copper gears, verdigris, morning fog) and the repurposed midwife tools create a micro-setting that charges the final image of Elena carrying the clock home. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (she recognizes the screw from childhood museum visits). The shop setting enables Mr. Chen's philosophy and constrains the conversation to intimate repair work, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor: the "transforming morning" in the final paragraph drifts toward stock metaphor, and spatial choreography of hanging timepieces could be more precisely anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform constrains choice (precarious space, ritual formality) and charges the final image ("the platform swaying" as another storm gathers). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "mist rising from the canyon below," "brazier's coal-glow," "cloud-silence and stone-stillness." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The micro-setting (parchment, inkstone, crow quill) functions as tool-as-setting, constraining the rune-writing action. Minor slip: the canyon setting could be more tactilely integrated into Kael's embodied experience during the peak moment of inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive's "paper ghosts," amber light, and Baroque shelves create tactile atmosphere; the orchard outside functions as both countdown clock and thematic mirror. The perfume bottle recurs as anchoring object and constrains Mira's final gesture (setting it on the score). Spatial choreography is clear: shelves, filing cabinet, window sightline to trees. Minor gap: the "neutral ground" claim tells rather than shows how the space uniquely enables this confrontation, and occupational detail (musicology, archival work) remains ornamental rather than pressure-generating.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    The library is vivid and specific: "corridors of crystallized knowledge, past shelves carved from single pieces of stone that predated language itself." The architecture's secret—organization by degree of illusion—subtly constrains Kael's path and charges the ending image of thinning walls. The dictionary functions as micro-setting, handled in two beats (opening and junction) and returning with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail is selective but could be more embodied; the "resounding hush" is mostly asserted rather than felt through sound or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The horizon measurement station and hydraulic clocks are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("whisper of liquid, softer than breathing"). Spatial choreography is coherent across observation deck and clock chamber. The mantle clock key, glass cylinders, and pendulum-over-spiral constrain the final choice: Maren must use the key in a specific place to trigger the revelation. The fjord quiet functions as micro-setting that charges the atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Maren's philosophical attention rather than a neutral catalog, and the horizon line as a "razor edge" recurs to frame the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rain-on-skylights, watercolor windows, and clover-with-raindrops motifs charge the final image and frame Mira's shifting stance. The candle lantern's mica pane and the library's unmowed lawn provide micro-setting that modulates emotional beats without heavy exposition. Spatial choreography (desk, windows, lawn, phone) remains coherent. The rainwashed clarity directly mirrors the thematic shift toward acceptance. Professional detail (reference desk, campus office clearance) is purposeful and proportionate. Gate satisfied: environment charges the final image ("world remade and temporary after rain").

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subway utility tunnel, phone booth, and glass harmonica disc anchor space and texture vividly. The disc's prismatic shadows and the tunnel's breath work as micro-setting that charges atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Iris operates freely within her established workspace. The setting supports tone and concept but does not pressure the protagonist at a decisive beat, capping entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The blooming jetty at twilight constrains the choice: this specific location where ashes were scattered forces Mira to confront memory. The walnut ink (hulls, nails, time) functions as micro-setting that charges the final act. Sensory detail (salt, sweetness, roses) is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's professional lens. The tool—fountain pen and fresh ink—actively enables the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The disused railway station with ivy is signaled early and returns in the final line ("ivy rustling"), creating a charged frame. The vine-strangled bench, rusted cart, and overturned bucket provide micro-setting that grounds action. However, the station functions primarily as atmospheric container rather than constraining choice—Vera could conduct this work anywhere with phone and laptop. Sensory detail (ivy as "curious parishioners," "rails led nowhere") is vivid but ornamental at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ultrasonic forest constrains perception (Mara absorbs frequencies through skin, not ears) and the platinum ring functions as a tactile navigation tool across multiple beats. The clearing's "absolute silence" charges the final image, making the stillpoint spatially legible. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—touch and vibration dominate—and the moss, stones, spider's web, and fallen log supply concrete anchors for the note-gathering sequence. The forest's resumed symphony in the closing line bookends the silence, reinforcing the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting, constraining her work and enabling the pen's resonance effect. The bent starlight and warped space are filtered through Vera's professional lens. The console, pen, and viewport recur purposefully. However, the station's interior lacks tactile grounding—no mention of temperature, sound, or the physical effort of weeks alone—and the Meridian colony remains abstract. The exotic nib's "split crescent moon" shape charges the final image by echoing the double truths theme.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harbor supplies concrete sensory particulars—water lapping through dock planks (tactile), wind creating visible surface patterns, moonlight pulsing with earth's rotation—that directly enable Marina's discovery of rhythm in silence. The camera functions as micro-setting, its focus ring and aperture adjustments teaching her fingers a new vocabulary. Spatial choreography (pier's edge, dock planks underfoot, boat disturbing water) remains clear. The setting charges the final image: harbor rhythms become the score Marina and Celeste translate into movement, making the environment essential to closure rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The basalt archive is vividly rendered (carved narratives, stone alcove, dry air, headlamp catching wall after wall) and constrains Marina's choice by existing as the sole proof source. The tapestry fragment and vandalized portrait function as micro-setting, charging the final documentation decision. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marina's conservator training (texture of hide, meticulous border symbols). Spatial choreography remains clear despite the mountain interior. The archive's hidden location and preservation conditions make the stakes legible: this evidence exists nowhere else, so Marina's upload is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized with purposeful sensory detail: "visible ripples," "colors that shouldn't exist," the auric lagoon as "liquid gold" made of overlapping frequencies. Setting constrains Maya's ritual (she must come during silent hours, drum to activate the garden) and charges the final image when the lagoon "faded back to ordinary silence." Spatial choreography is clean (gate, path, lagoon rim, return path). The micro-setting of her hands on the stone rim and the drumming surface functions as both body and tool, grounding the abstract concept in tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth, storm-lit and humming with harmonics, is vivid and specific. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the pursuit, and the geomagnetic storm directly constrains surveillance, enabling the smuggler's method. The tablet's folding maps anchor Mira's expertise and recur with purpose. However, the environment functions more as backdrop than crucible—Mira navigates it effortlessly, and no physical obstacle tests her or forces a trade-off. The zodiac coin is handled twice (pocket grip, flip in negotiation, warm in palm at closure), which charges the final image, but the setting itself does not constrain a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt dock, rain-slicked surface, coiled ropes, and canal shutters are vivid and purposeful. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains the guardian's method and charges the final image when Mara places her own mirror on the dock. Sensory selection is strong (silvered light, fragments of twilight, stillwater tension) and filtered through Mara's urgency. The piece does not over-index on occupation or world-building at this length; setting details integrate smoothly into action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library in mist is established early and returns at closure, charging the final image. The magnetic grotto is described vividly (lodestone, flame patterns) and used on-page during the gathering. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations (library, shops, grotto, town square). The mist and cobalt recur purposefully, and the grotto's magnetic properties constrain the lantern display, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sublittoral fringe is vivid and purposeful: "barnacled rock," "anemones bloomed like fists," kelp as tactile presence. The disappearing island functions as both setting and constraint, tightening the window for action. The scrimshaw wedged between rocks and the whale circling below charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects Marina's practiced familiarity without tourist cataloging, and the tidal rhythm mirrors her internal release. The ending—touching each living thing softly—uses micro-setting (tidal pools) to embody the shift, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turbines and their hum function as both acoustic constraint (masking grief) and symbolic weight (overshadowing the farmhouse "like a forgotten gravestone"), charging the ending when Maya stands "in their shadow, lighter now, emptier." The whittling knife and driftwood are handled across multiple beats, their physical reduction mirroring the thematic stake. Spatial choreography is coherent (kitchen window, sink, windowsill). The dried bouquet's tactile disintegration—petals falling "like manufactured snow"—supplies a micro-setting moment that alters the protagonist's stance. Setting detail is selective and purposeful, though the "processing centers" reference (beaches) floats slightly without grounding the farmhouse's geography.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt atrium and quartz colonnade function as active setting elements: the humming responds to Lyren's presence, the pillars warm under her touch, and the carved phrases constrain her approach by demanding paraphrase rather than replication. The frozen lake groans in response to her work, charging the final sunrise image. Spatial choreography remains clear (threshold, colonnade center, between pillars, writing), and the atrium's translucence and winter context frame the aesthetic stakes. The quartz's stored resonance directly enables her breakthrough, satisfying the constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The courtyard, ash, ferns, moss, and easel anchor space and texture early. Mira's colorblindness filters detail through shadow and form rather than hue, creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, the setting remains largely static—props appear but don't constrain choices. The hidden vase is the only object that pressures a decision, and it materializes late without prior spatial groundwork. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; other senses are underused.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The laboratory and its sound-capture equipment constrain the bell ringer's demonstration and enable the layering action that drives the turn. The miner's lamp lens functions as micro-setting: it pulses "in rhythm with the emerging soundscape" and casts golden shadows that charge the final image, linking tool/body/environment in one coherent system. Sensory detail is selective (carbide lamp fractured light, church bell echo, wind through broken windows) and filtered through Karim's professional attention. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene. The "golden shadows" recur purposefully at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory's copper dome, spiral stairs, and open telescope frame every beat and supply the starlight that charges the pendant at closure ("the Pleiades distorted into new constellations"). Spatial choreography is clear—worktable under the dome, observation platform above—and the setting's timeless quality mirrors Mira's collapse of past and future. The toolset (diamond-tipped carvers, resin cure) constrains her method and anchors occupational credibility without drifting into catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The loft setting is well-anchored: workbench, skylight, wall of threaded cards. Rain functions as both atmospheric detail and thematic constraint, returning at closure to reweight the pattern-seeking motif. The measuring tape recurs purposefully across beats. Minor limitation: while the cards and threads are vivid, the city beyond the skylight remains generic; no street name, district, or regional marker grounds the "Brooklyn traders" reference in lived space.

    The bronze prism pagoda is vividly rendered ("facets catching the dying light in ways that hurt to witness") and recurs with charged meaning at closure ("dimmed behind her as night fell"). The archive's "steadily unpredictable" hum becomes both environmental detail and thematic constraint. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (approach, entrance, console, shelves, exit). The preservation field's unpredictable rhythms constrain her mental approach to the console, elevating setting beyond backdrop. Sensory selection reflects urgency appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Cloudspire Library setting is vivid and purposeful: golden hour, impossible gardens, flowers that "never died because they'd never truly lived" anchor the theme. The river stone functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, pressed to glass) and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Preservation Wing, library edge, transparent walls). The setting supplies thematic pressure but does not constrain a present-tense choice or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The misty workshop is anchored early with sensory specificity (fogged windows, dripping water features, humidity tanks) and recurs throughout to frame choices. Prism's terrarium and the act of lifting him constrain the final decision, qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's caretaker priorities, filtering the space through her professional lens with tactile, lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tower setting and body-as-setting (the scar, her warming hands) constrain multiple choices: examining the scar, studying coffee rings, touching the window where ivy presses. The frosted hourglass, ivy, and coffee rings return with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's healer perspective. The "meteor hush" dawn image charges the final beat. Spatial choreography (windowsill, window box, corner ferns) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("hot metal and old celluloid") and the film strips function as micro-setting, constraining her method (touch, cataloguing) and charging the final image (threaded into projector, light splashing onto screen). Spatial choreography is coherent: booth floor becomes a "map of longing," booth to theater sightline tracks cleanly. The setting shapes the closure—without the projector and theater, the release mechanism fails—so environment acts as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit archway is vivid and central, shaping Lyra's positioning and the meteors' trajectories. The astrolabe constrains her method: she must align its circles to unlock the threshold. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"cold granite," "liquid revelation," "wound" in the air—filtered through Lyra's perceptual lens. The observatory setting and celestial mechanics charge the final image, making the archway indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune, phosphorescent flowers, and cargo container supply vivid anchors. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ash-dark sky, luminescent sand, equations that shift when observed). The dune blooms brighter as evidence of her work, charging the final image. The recurring environment constrains her method and supports closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly specific—copper whistles high, iron groans bass, brass hums near-words—and the sensory palette (clicking leaves, chiming droplets, rust on coat) grounds the surreal setting in tactile detail. The small gear functions as both tool and key, constraining Kael's choice to unravel rather than flee. The forest directly enables the climactic act: applying the gear to each tree trunk to reveal blueprints. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the grove-mapping sequence, and the wind-song modulates with discovery, charging the final dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The veiled ridgeway and fog anchor the liminal setting early and persist through the journey, though spatial choreography (cairns, narrowed ridge, final station) remains generic. The brass punch is handled across multiple beats and its warmth/weight in Maya's palm charges the final image. Sensory selection favors visual fog and tactile stone/metal; the setting guides the ritual structure but does not constrain a choice where an alternate path was available. Micro-setting via the punch and card elevates the score, though the ridgeway itself could be replaced with minimal structural loss.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt fortress, spiral staircase, and piano indentations constrain Marta's choices and charge the closure. The ash marks on the steps become the pivot that shifts her understanding and tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "four deep indentations," "slight discoloration," "snow that never seemed to melt." The stairwell itself becomes the crucible where discovery happens and where she later hums, making the micro-setting essential to the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient temple library is not postcard description; its "luminous cracks," "gossamer scrolls," and translucent walls function as a ticking clock that narrows Kael's window to three cycles and forces urgency in her messaging campaign. The backward-flowing spring and the ink's "purple-black iridescence" are selective, POV-filtered details that feel rooted in her ancient expertise. Spatial choreography (columns, archives, her small stature, the void beyond) remains clear. The library as micro-setting charges the final image: its dissolution is simultaneous with Kael's fade, making environment and protagonist inseparable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The monitoring station is vividly anchored: stilts groaning fifty meters below, moored to bedrock yet drifting with the tide. Micro-setting details—the torn atlas page, the desk, the window where sunrise hits the Coral Sea—constrain Maya's workspace and charge the final image when she tapes the page to glass. Sensory selection is strong (the station's creak, the comm crackle, the three-two rhythm felt against surfaces). The ocean's "memory" and the bleaching-event dots function as both setting and thematic engine, enabling the discovery that drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Spaceport detail (warm concrete, oil stains, shattered dome) grounds early. The stone circle constrains her choice: she must stand barefoot to feel the hum, and the hum drives her revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (barefoot grounding, chest-cavity vibration). The circle's alignment with stars supplies the pattern she translates into action. Micro-setting (stones, opera glasses, bare feet) charges the final image of resonance and home-path memory.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The volcanic hot springs setting is vivid and purposeful: the steam renders the cave "dreamlike," thermal pools supply light for decoding, and the environment provides the network of roots that the embryo connects to. The pine's roots clutching volcanic rock and the amber embedded in volcanic glass are specific anchors. The setting constrains choices (must climb, must decode by the springs) and charges the final image (new shoots through volcanic soil), meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arboretum functions as micro-setting: glass walls provide the tactile anchor for the freeze ritual, Mediterranean specimens reflect survival tactics, clifftop exposure mirrors vulnerability. The helicopter intrusion demonstrates spatial constraint—she must walk to the glass to re-ground. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (rosemary scent "sharp and clean," soil texture under fingers). The setting charges the final image: pressing into "dark, rich earth" contrasts the salt wind and automated beacon, grounding the choice to tend rather than flee.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse library is vivid and functional: circular room, salt-smell, contracting walls that literally pressure the protagonist. The tarot cards as physical objects constrain her problem-solving. The lighthouse beam's rotation provides recurring sensory punctuation that charges key moments. The contracting walls shift from metaphor to literal constraint, effectively grounding the psychological crisis in spatial terms. Minor deduction: the spiral stairs and some book-tumbling details feel slightly ornamental rather than integrated into choice-making.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The wind-carved sandstone encampment supplies specific tactile detail (twisting pillars, hollowed chambers, pale rock) filtered through Kael's tracker sensibility. The ceramic bowl and disappearing ink constrain investigation choices. Spatial choreography is clean (edge of encampment → sheltered alcove). The environment charges the final image through the wind carving "new shapes...patient and relentless," mirroring Kael's resolve. Some details (pink eyes sensitive to sunlight) feel ornamental rather than choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen library is vivid and purposeful: snow muffles sound, ice transmits data, temperature gradients become the hidden network. The vault that "pulsed" under Kael's palm and the glowing ice at closure both constrain her choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—"dizzying quiet," "crack of splitting glaciers"—and filtered through Kael's professional expertise. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glass dome functions as micro-setting, constraining atmosphere and pressuring the father's restlessness ("disturbing the roses"). Spatial choreography is clear: entrance, rows of roses, kneeling positions. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—amber light, dust, leather creak, sand texture—filtered through Mara's perceptual bias. The dome's "tranquil blaze" charges the final image. The post-tower wasteland anchors timeframe and stakes without over-explaining. The ballast canvas as handled object (pressed into soil, handed to the father) bridges setting and action effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sound wave garden is realized through vivid, purposeful detail: crystalline terraces vibrating at visible frequencies, emotional echoes pooling like salmon, dissonant chords from Cassiopeia's drunken W. The rail spike—cold iron inscribed with equations—constrains the climax by pinning the frequency. Spatial choreography (skiff above terraces, spike through hull) remains clear. The garden's acoustic memory and resonant atmosphere supply the resources that enable the catch.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is vivid and participatory: the dome amplifies her footfalls and voice, creating an "acoustic mirror of her inner chaos"; the height above clouds literalizes her retreat from consequence. The rosewood pen nib functions as both relic and evidence, handled twice with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, base meeting, desk). The observatory constrains her final choice by forcing her descent—"return to earth"—and the evening star in the final image charges the closure with the contrast between honest orbits and human lies.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and purposeful, filtering detail through Mira's professional lens (obsolete recording equipment, temporal sensors, firmware). The amber pendant constrains the final choice—she opens it, uses the firefly dust in her tattoo ink—charging the closure image with materiality. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single location, and sensory details (meteor hush, nebulae-colored ink) are selective and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The whispering grotto is vividly rendered with its limestone parabolas, acoustics, and perpetual mist, and these details are purposefully integrated: the amplified sounds mirror the thematic concern with listening and meaning. The mist thickens at the climax, contributing to atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Isla could have worked in most quiet, echoic spaces without changing the arc. The grotto charges the final image but does not gate a decision, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The shattered sky and ancient plaza function as more than backdrop—the fractured atmosphere mirrors the moral fracture, and the mosaic tessera constrains the central choice by providing access to retrocognitive truth. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "fractured light," "sounds like wind chimes made of knives," "warm coldness of metal on ancient stone." The environment charges the final image when Vessa walks away under the reconfiguring sky.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mystic orchard is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: silver fruit, perpetually twilit sky, blossoms and rot occupying the same branches. The fractured timeline is not mere backdrop—it responds to her song, swaying and opening/closing in rhythm, and the tarot coin heats in her palm as images spin. The garden's temporal currents constrain her method (she must navigate them synesthetically) and charge the final image (three decades of blossoms blooming simultaneously). Spatial choreography is clean; the progression from shop aisles to hidden door to orchard is legible, and the setting's strange temporality directly enables the plot's core action.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The light painting studio functions as more than backdrop: LED arrays enable the inciting shock, long-exposure photography captures the pathways, and studio walls displaying hundreds of images become the proof Dr. Chen studies. The muscovite geode's piezoelectric properties constrain the mapping method, qualifying as micro-setting. Spatial choreography (Maya adjusting array, thrown backward into Iris, holding sliver between palms) tracks cleanly. The one-year-anniversary return to the studio charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coastal cave network is vivid and specific: bioluminescent algae, flooded passages, air pockets, tidal breathing. Sensory detail is well-distributed (green-black water, salt, darkness, glowing walls) and filtered through Mira's scientific-mystic lens. The cave constrains movement (she dives, surfaces, unpacks equipment on a shelf) and the tide turn provides a rhythm, but the environment doesn't force a pivotal choice or dramatically alter tactics at closure. Micro-setting (the rocky shelf, the fossil placement) charges the final tableau without making it indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The warehouse, cliff setting, and buttons are grounded early and returned to purposefully. The hourglass functions as a time anchor and the buttons constrain Maren's method—she sorts them by emotional signature, not arbitrary category. The canyon echo jar is handled across multiple beats and its glass container catching light recurs. However, the warehouse itself remains largely atmospheric; it does not block or enable a key choice in the way a micro-setting should at the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Zephyr Bluff functions as more than backdrop: the "mist rolled up…like whispered secrets," the zephyr winds that shape snow into readable codes, and the "silver hush of the observation room" all ground the protagonist's patience and the method of communication. The March-to-spring transition mirrors Claire's thaw from stasis. Spatial choreography is clear (bluff, station house, gravel path). The pillbox and snow-codes link setting to plot constraint. One missed opportunity: the barometric-pressure response method is mentioned but not shown in tactile detail, reducing the weather-station setting's participatory weight at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog-bound crossing constrains the choice to wait and provides sensory texture ("mist curled around the lanterns," "fog pressed thick as wool"). Rain gutters ticking and then stopping function as both atmospheric detail and temporal constraint that shapes the woman's readiness. The ferry platform and opposite shore track spatially. The yarn needle as micro-setting object charges the closure by shifting from legal fixation to "simple promise beneath all the complicated rewriting," fulfilling the 9+ gate of constraining choice or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oasis is anchored concretely: twelve hives, stone well, three olive trees, cracked earth. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—chimney smoke flattening, light through the lantern glass casting prismed colors—and filtered through the potter's craft-oriented perception. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining her method of seeing the fractured timelines and later used to cast light across the hives. The environment charges the final image: her pottery will resist time through attention, mirroring the oasis's survival through layered care.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fire escape garden, harbor, boathouse, and lighthouse are vividly anchored with sensory detail (moonlight, water, rusted railings). The lighthouse windows and flashlight angles provide micro-setting that enables the climax. Spatial choreography across multiple locations (apartment, dock, water, lighthouse) remains clear. The brass tooth is handled twice (pocket, then shown to children) and charges the thematic frame, qualifying as object-as-setting that constrains the lesson Mira teaches.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Tidal Library setting is vivid and purposeful: atomically reflective floors, cloud tides that rearrange shelves, extinct species as co-inhabitants. The brass sundial and stone circle hum constrain navigation choices concretely. Sensory detail (photon reflections, compressed cloud-matter, golden clouds at dawn) is selective and anchored to Kael's survival needs. The cartography wing appearance and the sundial's shadow-pointing create spatial choreography that drives the final beat, lifting this above postcard description into functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lotus temple and lily pond anchor space early and recur purposefully (golden pond light at closure). The thrush nest installation is vivid and specific, its "near-invisible threads" and magnified scale grounding the central metaphor in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (wet stone path, courtyard, lowest tier of spiral, temple eaves). The installation constrains Mei Lin's choice—its presence and Jun's framing catalyze her release—pushing this toward the 9-band gate, but the temple itself remains more atmospheric than a live pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The basement studio supplies vivid anchors (dust, ozone, astronomical charts, transmission array) and the oscilloscope/subsonic generator constrain her tactical choice at closure. Spatial choreography is clean. The charts are handled twice (annotations, trembling on walls) and charge the final documentation beat, satisfying the micro-setting standard. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency appropriately when the lights flicker with impossible colors during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed nexus under starlight is vividly rendered with selective detail (five corridors, collapsed roof, faded numbers). The compass point and organ vibrations function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice: Mara must trace the pattern the compass indicates, and the organ's resonance reshapes the space she navigates. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, reaching through stones). The setting directly enables the closure beat when the flagstones dissolve, making environment indispensable to the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quarry is vivid (mist, stone walls, chisel marks) and the descent structures the investigation spatially. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Vera's realization about the mask workshop could occur anywhere. The ribbon and sketch pad function as micro-setting objects but neither limits her options at closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("topology of murder"), but the quarry remains atmospheric rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The weather station is vividly sketched—"rusted sentinel," "spongey dread," reinforced windows, sound-absorbing surfaces—but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. The copper nail under magnification is the only moment where setting (the scope, the light) enables a key discovery; otherwise, the cliff, storm, and isolation color mood without altering tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain pullout, scaffolding, and fluttering wrap constrain Maria's discovery—she must scramble down, wait for wind, and recognize that photos won't capture the secret. The micro-setting (her fiddle case, the thermal updrafts, the green mesh) charges the final image when she places the glass flake beside her rosin. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "pine needles sliding under her boots," "thermal updrafts," "reflective silver." The spatial choreography of her descent and the wrap's behavior under wind are coherent and essential to the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    The circus train micro-setting constrains choice throughout: the loose window grants access, the velvet seats and broken skylights anchor mood, and the train's creaking becomes a rhythmic cue for Luka's breath-matching final image. Sensory selection is purposeful (dust, twilight through skylights, evening wind) and filtered through Luka's reflective state. The perimeter walk and stone placement use the environment as both crucible and canvas. Spatial choreography is clean. The fox at the window charges the territorial theme without overt symbolism. Minor gap: the train's interior details could further constrain his physical stance or micro-choices during peak reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is anchored early (dome, telescope, red light) and the setting constrains action: Mira tracks Algol, Kove climbs stairs, dawn marks the breakthrough. The telegram with dried daylilies functions as micro-setting, charging the final desk scene. Sensory detail is selective (winter sky, rust-colored petals, lightening sky) and filtered through urgency. The environment enables the collaborative revelation and the final image of the shared vigil, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraint on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The swirling orchard vortex is vivid and spatially coherent; lily pads in winter and skeletal trees create atmosphere. The setting constrains Kael's approach (spiral ritual, water-walking) and the vortex anchors the central conflict. However, sensory detail is heavily visual with limited tactile or auditory texture, and the lakeside environment does not evolve with the curse-breaking—trees "sink peacefully" without dramatized environmental feedback. The final image of stillness feels postcard-like rather than charged by prior spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt glade is vivid and distinct (blue-barked trees, dusk luminescence), anchoring place and tone early. The topiary clipping functions as a micro-setting object, held and recognized, but its constraint on choice is implied rather than enacted—Mara holds it up, understanding ripples, but no tactical decision hinges on its presence. The glade's cobalt shadows and crystallized-possibility maze charge the final image with specificity, and the "shadows stretching like fingers" opens with purposeful menace. The wheelchair and scars provide embodied anchors filtered through Mara's POV, though the prophecy-child and eyeless woman remain spatially generic. No orientation debt; the environment supports atmosphere and closure participation without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific: gnarled trees with roots threading through skulls, phosphorescent fruit, carved symbols. Mira's lantern and the burned tarot card are handled objects that recur and the setting's macabre details (bones, half-lit corridors) support the tone. The setting constrains the final moment—Mira and Kael step "into the web of meanings she'd inlaid everywhere"—charging the closure image with the orchard's symbolic architecture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quarry functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: "excavated down to nothing...leaving only this hollow place where sound traveled strange" mirrors Marcus's stripped expertise and echoes his search for meaning in emptiness. The trailer, grille cloth texture, dust motes, and backstage-pass wall create tactile specificity filtered through his roadie past. Sensory detail is purposeful—dust and decades, the weave under magnifying lamp—and the final quarry silence reweights his isolation as he turns on the lamp "against the gathering dusk." Setting constrains by trapping him in a place defined by absence and echo.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly anchored—electromagnetic hum, transparent floor, clouds below—and its function as "threshold" directly enables the climactic seed planting at the field's center. The clay dust and magnifying dome are tactile and purposeful. The arbor's dual role (preservation device and liminal gate) charges the ending image when the plant grows "with impossible speed," making environment essential to closure rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered with glass walls, rising water, migrating shelves, and the copper basin—all filtered through a librarian's working relationship with fluctuating space. The titan-gear exoskeleton constrains her reach and synchronizes with her heartbeat at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail (bronze cogs whirring, salt-dark bamboo, glowing water) is selective and purposeful. The setting genuinely shapes Maren's method: the basin's tide-cycle becomes the mechanism for smelting meaning, fulfilling the micro-setting test for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal caves constrain and charge throughout: the "ancient frequency" and "latent radiance" create the acoustic and visual environment that makes the ritual legible, the quartz formations reflect light to reveal the shell inscriptions, and the "resonant hush" shapes Mara's final recording. Micro-setting (the wooden chest, cushion circle) structures discovery beats. Sensory hierarchy filters through Mara's professional attention (unsealed door, protocol violations) before shifting to wonder (nautilus spiral, luminescence). The caves function as more than backdrop—they enable the confessions to be read and the pearls to glow, directly shaping Mara's transformation and charging the final self-crowning image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused station, ivy, and river are rendered with specific, POV-filtered detail that supports atmosphere. The accordion's patched bellows and the ancient pump provide tactile grounding. The bathroom graffiti constrains her path by triggering the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (river moving through ruins) without becoming a postcard. Minor: occupational detail (river chronicler's methods) is mentioned but not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glowing library with amber-breathing windows, mist-shrouded marshlands, and shelves stretching into luminous fog creates vivid atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and consistent: the watch ticks backward, spectacles reflect nothing, purple light glows at the staircase peak. The spiral staircase that "hadn't existed moments before" and books with blank spines concretely anchor the unspoken-library concept. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature constrains a tactical choice or charges the final image with cost—Elena simply ascends and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet observatory, ice violin, coffee cup, and ferns anchor the single scene with selective sensory detail (purple-draped walls filtering light, cool glass of display case, coffee residue spreading like continents). The micro-setting (display case, corner desk, potted ferns) constrains Iris's tactile ritual (palm-pressing, tilting cup) and charges the final image (sketching at her desk while ferns cheer). Orientation is clear and sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus—she notices violin lattice and coffee patterns more than ambient sound. One friction: "bruised twilight that never quite resolved into clarity" is evocative but slightly ornamental; the provenance-research occupation is gestured at but not deeply proceduralized, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora light, stone table, and "consecrated winds" are vivid and purposeful. The emerald chip and aurora-melt basin function as micro-setting tools that constrain Kael's ritual. Sensory detail (green/violet aurora, soft crackling static, collected aurora-melt) is selective and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image—"threshold of stillness" and the descent aperture shape the weaver's passage—meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The umbral grotto is vividly rendered with purposeful contradictions (dark/luminous, mist/stone) and sensory details filtered through Mei's caretaker perspective. The Pool of Reflection and pearl-bark trees function as concrete setting elements that enable story choices (guiding souls, climbing to think). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not dramatically constrain a peak choice or charge the final image in a way that would elevate to 9-band, but it supplies the frame and tools for all key actions. The "vineyard hush" tone anchors atmosphere consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse gallery, wind chimes, and dawn light are vividly rendered and purposefully selected: the chimes function as both atmosphere and narrative device, the breeze becomes Mara's diagnostic tool, and the vertical setting (spiral stairs, campfire ashes below) mirrors the emotional descent. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional lens (she interprets chime patterns as data). The brass chimes constrain the scene's pacing and charge the closure by falling silent, then resuming softly. Spatial choreography is clear, though the campfire's symbolic bookend (opening/closing) reads slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, rainwater pool, and stone are vividly rendered and integrated into the teaching beats. The pond's dark crescents and starlight shimmer recur with shifting emphasis, charging the final image when Maia drops her own stone. Spatial choreography (kneeling beside the depression, cross-legged posture) remains coherent. The environment does not constrain a tactical choice—Maia could receive this lesson elsewhere—but it charges the closure image and mirrors the theme, meeting the 9+ threshold's spirit without crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly particular, with femurs and skulls creating "melodies of memory" and dust layered through centuries. The setting directly constrains the protagonist's method—navigation through resonance rather than movement—and the bird flock's descent transforms echoes, enabling the skimmer's appraisal. Sensory detail is filtered through the skimmer's auditory bias (pitch of human hands, frequency matching vibration), and the arrowhead's placement "at her feet" charges the final stillness. The environment is indispensable to both method and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, cloudline, and mist are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (ice layers revealing vine patterns, fog as solid ground). The keystone itself functions as micro-setting, its "lingering luminance" quality charging the closure image when light echoes through the spire's ice. Spatial choreography is clean: climb, cloudline, mist walking, apex gap, placement. The setting constrains choice (the climb is arduous, the gap specific) and the final image of light through ice fractals directly supports the thematic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken *Meridian* as "cathedral of rust and barnacles" and the waterproof cases create vivid micro-setting that constrains Marcus's dive choices. The sky lanterns create atmospheric pressure ("meteor hush") that charges the opening and closure. The hotel key tag functions as recurring object that reweights meaning at the ending ("lighting each one with new reverence"). Spatial choreography (pier→dock→water→wreck→surface) tracks cleanly. Minor opportunity: the library's brine-suspension could have imposed a physical constraint during retrieval rather than simply housing intact journals.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber-lit observatory deck is vivid and recurring, anchoring the piece spatially. The coins function as micro-setting objects handled across multiple beats, their textures and weights felt through POV. The "contracted universe" timeframe supplies conceptual pressure but remains abstract; no environmental constraint (access, proximity, resource scarcity) alters Kael's choices. The final image reprises the amber light and coins, charging the closure moment modestly. The ancient receivers and foreign coins carry specificity that roots the world without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory functions as micro-setting: the cracked dome filters light that enables crystallization, the telescope angles toward horizon during her ritual, dust motes model the transformation she seeks. The atlas page as recurring object constrains her naming ritual and charges the final departure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The copper dome oxidized to green and scattered light are filtered through Mara's focus on loss and transformation, not tourist description.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct is established early, grounds the action spatially, and its dew-dripping stones become the mechanism for reversal, directly shaping Maren's method and the climax. Dawn light, cobalt glow, and the dried canyon bed create vivid sensory anchors. The "dripping rate" motif ties setting to stakes and closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The viaduct constrains choice (she must be there at dawn) and charges the final image (she remains on the bridge, ensuring rhythm).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The midnight ridgeway, exposed lakebed, and Dutoit's storefront are vividly rendered with selective detail (mudbank, skeletal structures, sapphire-hued label behind cracked glass). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional lens (water levels, seep points) and the emerging ruins constrain her path down Main Street. The wind chime bookends the piece, charging the final image when it "began ringing again... with something like restoration," a purposeful return that reweights the mirrored hush. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, perpetual-dawn orchard, and frozen dew crystal supply vivid, purposeful detail that anchors the magical frame. Spatial choreography is clean (through waterfall, kneeling at thornbush, watching sky, return journey). The frozen crystal functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic choice when she dissolves it into flame. Sensory selection is strong (cold penetrating wool, dew suspended, copper-gleaming fruit) and filtered through the alchemist's professional lens, though some descriptors veer toward stock lyricism ("ancient apple trees heavy with fruit").

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The arbor setting pressures Vera's choices: three thousand feet of isolation, the parachute as constant option, silver leaves that must be read through touch and arrangement. The nocturnal arbor constrains her to midnight work and embodied pattern-seeking. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—bark, leaf moisture, wind-carried rain scent—filtered through professional attention. Micro-setting through body and tool (fingers on bark, buckle at belt) charges the final image. Minor gap: the "mechanisms Vera had long ceased questioning" gesture toward world-building without payoff, a small pocket of unexplored specificity that doesn't constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating dojo and reality-rewriting landscape establish vivid SFF atmosphere and anchor the world's instability as thematic backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean (wooden platform, jar placement, courtroom aisle). The jar—amber fluid, electric light, handwritten label—is specific and purposeful, constraining Kenji's confrontation with his past self. However, the reality engines and shifting geography function mostly as symbolic color rather than material constraint on choice; they decorate rather than pressure tactics. The dojo's physical qualities (cables, wooden platform) are mentioned but don't enable or block action at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel is specified early with acoustic properties that constrain Marcus's method (limestone bends sound). Autumn leaves, ventilation grates, and the estate's honeycomb pathways all serve the plan. The pull cord, leaf blowers, and tunnel walls recur with functional pressure. Spatial choreography is clean across three locations (tunnel, kitchen, brother's bedroom). Minor cap: while the tunnel enables the action, its specific limestone texture doesn't visibly constrain a mid-scene choice or alter Marcus's tactics under stress—it facilitates rather than restricts.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen roses, thornbush, stone columns, and mist constrain movement and choice throughout (she waits, moves on all fours through specific obstacles). The pendant's position "three yards away" and the light-shadow boundaries on its surface provide concrete spatial anchors. The final transformation where shelves of frost-books appear charges the closure image by revealing the garden was always her library. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her altered perception (ice in hair, cold chain burning her sternum).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember nexus constrains the vivification act—five forge-rivers meeting at twilight supplies both material and symbolic pressure. The broken crozier's physical transformation (gold leaf burning, wood grain illuminating, metal threads fusing) is vividly rendered and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling at the center, lifting from the nexus). The micro-setting (the nexus pool, the staff in hand) functions as both tool and environment, altering tactics and enabling the climactic act.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge provides vivid spatial grounding with purposeful detail (cables, broken windows, skeletal frame). The hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting, its warmth and pulse charging the final discovery. The gorge's "depths lost in shadow" and the swaying city create atmosphere that mirrors Mira's search for hidden frequencies. The lunar perigee constrains the timing and intensifies the signal, directly enabling the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's bioluminescent constellations and the radio as navigation tool constrain Marcus's approach and charge the middle section. Sensory details—salt spray, limestone glow, water reflecting stars at noon—are vivid and purposeful. However, spatial choreography inside the grotto remains vague; we don't see Marcus manipulate controls or move through space in a way that shapes the final beat. The hourglass as micro-setting object does recur with shifting meaning (empty → filling), meeting the 9+ threshold partially, but environment doesn't constrain the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Escher Wing's impossible geometries and sinew thread constrain Marina's choices throughout: she maps sightlines, calculates reflections, and the gallery's illusions reorganize as she works. The Penrose triangle containing her brother's shadow and the infinite corridor reflection charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across seventeen rooms, and the subsonic vibration adds tactile specificity that tightens the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The benthic setting is vivid and purposeful: "three thousand meters beneath the Pacific, where darkness was absolute" establishes both literal depth and thematic isolation from starlight. The observation dome's amber light and thick acrylic create tactile constraint. The chain link as micro-setting object charges the final exchange. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Yael's professional lens (acoustic positioning, inertial guidance). The contrast between abyss and surface stars drives the central tension and shapes her choice to go up.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium with potted ferns creates a distinct atmosphere that recurs and charges the final image ("the mist began to lift"). The hearing aid functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's method and providing tactile detail ("grew warm, then hot"). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The carnival as off-page destination is economically sketched through the photograph, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The facility is vividly rendered with selective, pressure-driven detail: "barnacled walls," "rusted walkways," "pools of standing water starting to freeze." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through four descending levels. The rising tide creates urgency and the monitoring station provides a concrete goal-object. The codex's gold flecks shift from decorative to conductive, constraining perception and charging the final image. Micro-setting (codex, equipment, screens) alters tactics and shapes the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal observatory, snow, moonlight, and radio telescope are vivid and atmosphere-rich. The opal floor serves as the functional surface for the ink ritual, directly enabling the climactic vision, which meets the constraint test. Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent (cold glass, mechanical hum, ink catching light). The setting does not evolve or exert pressure on Marcus's choices—he could perform this ritual almost anywhere with a reflective floor—but the specificity and the floor's role in the final image lift this into solid mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and the diamond itself function as micro-setting that constrains her encoding method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (copper veins catching light, microscopic ridges, diamond hum) and filtered through Maerith's technical focus. The towers become her library, a concrete spatial anchor that evolves causally as she inscribes them, and the final press against bone completes the setting's role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The underground garden is vividly realized with gravitationally playful plants, moisture beading on limestone, shifting oak-to-birch trees, and a microclimate that freezes tears. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elena's academic lens. The arrowhead among roots and the copper-wrapped phone antenna ground the space in layered history and constrain Elena's final choice (pocketing the antenna signals tactical preparation). The upward-falling snow at closure charges the final image by extending the gravitational motif beyond the garden's boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mechanical city contrasted with the enchanted orchard is vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean: sky-bridges, fence, statues at perimeter, roots beneath. The orchard's tarnished-silver fruit and rusted iron fencing create a coherent atmosphere of decay and forgotten wonder. The locust shell grounds the transformation motif in a concrete object that Lira handles, and the trees' mobile escape constrains the final action by requiring her to lead them to untended land.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly realized with blue-tinted glass, defunct fountain at the territorial line, and metal shutters closing in practiced silence. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's professional filter: he notices drones, sight lines, and the invisible border markers. The bottle's "tiny lightning" is a tactile, recurring object that charges the exchange beat. However, the arcade itself does not constrain a choice—Kael moves through it without spatial obstacles shaping his decisions—so the 9+ gate is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and layered: rusting circus trains, blackberry thorns, willow-shaded clearing, crimson train car with golden light bars. The halo fragment and carousel mechanism constrain the carpenter's restoration work and the wind bells mark time, contributing to the final image's charge. Sensory hierarchy is strong (chiming bells, misting hush, dust motes) and filtered through the carpenter's restorative focus. Micro-setting (the single train car, the carousel inside) functions as pressure vessel for the transformation. The recurring motifs—wind bells, halo fragment gleam, misting hush—all converge to charge the closure moment when she leaves the carousel turning.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    The converted observatory setting is vivid and purposeful, grounding the scientific-poetry hybrid. The translucent sheets, desk lamp shadows, and the scarf draping across the model create tactile micro-setting that charges the discovery moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (outer rings, deepest section, desk). The grandmother's scarf functions as both object and setting anchor, settling into valleys and peaks to reveal interference patterns—environment directly enables the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering archipelago, eastern cliff, and ferry schedule create a coherent micro-world that constrains Marina's ritual to dawn hours. The watercolor palette functions as a recurring object that charges the final image when its hidden inscription is revealed. Sensory detail is purposeful (fog "like a living thing," honey light through aureolin) and filtered through Marina's grief. Minor slip: the maritime library and three-island triangle are named but don't constrain later choices; they read decorative rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed nexus, shifting key-sign, and astrolabe-music-box device are vivid and voice-filtered. The lock of hair charges the final image (threaded with starlight) and the waiting-for-Venus beat anchors time. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, window, roofline, doorway). The device constrains the middle choice (Mara must accept disorientation to proceed), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: "three alleys converged" and "twilight surrendering to night" trend toward stock phrasing, and the walls-breathing effect is gestured at rather than grounded in Mara's specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken orchard, fairy rings, and broken-constellation geometry create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The greenhouse's shattered roof refracts moonlight into impossible star-roads, a detail that directly enables the detection method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (wade → kneel → stand), and the shipwrecks form an "accidental cathedral" that enriches tone without mere decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The forgotten library, eastern alcove, warped windows, and the playground swing provide spatial grounding and atmospheric pressure. The swing's "rhythm like breath" anchors the timeframe and charges the final image when it "stilled as Kael stepped into the gathering dusk." Shadow-glass objects and the chipped teapot constrain ritual and choice. The archive of shards functions as micro-setting that enables the mentor's method, though occupational detail (how shards are catalogued) remains light—appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The parapet, waterfall mist, and "radiant hush" function as more than postcard—the thin-reality geography directly enables Esme's essence-gathering, and the mist's shimmer gates access to other gardens. Micro-setting (wet stone, spray) grounds her kneeling posture and tracks time (dawn mist burns off, sun rises). The shears carry generational weight but remain held rather than used, a missed opportunity for tool-as-constraint. Sensory hierarchy reflects her pruner's attention (light through leaves, wind through branches), and the spatial choreography of threshold/parapet/glimpsed-gardens remains coherent. The waterfall's constancy anchors the work's duration and the final image, charging closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prism sanctuary fracturing starlight into "nervous colors" sets tone and recurs as her mask reflects "fractured starlight" at closure, charging the final image. The net is tactile ("salt-stiff," knots resist then yield), and Mara's tools (needle, silver wire) constrain her method. The boy's phosphorescence and the cliffs above provide spatial pressure. Minor gap: the sanctuary's vault and stone floor are noted but don't actively shape a choice mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault is established early with vivid specificity ("ghostly suggestions," moisture-damaged saints) and returns implicitly at closure ("ruined frescoes above her workspace"). The dual-screen setup and the henge's grass spiral provide tactile anchors. However, the vault functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; it does not pressure Elena's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate despite strong sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: "shelves had collapsed into geometric avalanches," brass cylinders "scattered like dropped cigarettes." The snow globe constrains the final image, its "artificial snow still suspended in glycerin, frozen mid-fall" directly charging Marina's realization about transformation. Spatial choreography (descent → spine → library → captain's quarters → communications chamber) tracks cleanly. The submersible's mechanical arm and sample container function as body-extensions that enable Marina's choices. Micro-setting (confined submersible space, waterproof housing) pressures her tactile engagement with artifacts rather than remaining postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    The misty courtyard, prayer-wheels, and bolt plates constrain the protagonist's encoding method and supply the circuit she completes. Sensory detail is purposeful: lightning flashes reveal the ghost, thunder rattles bolt plates, pigments from the workshop enable the graffiti. The floating monastery's mechanics are integrated into action (repairing prayer-wheels, pressing bolt plates) without museum-tour excess. Spatial choreography is clear across the courtyard. The environment directly enables the final act—completing the circuit—so it meets the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor slip: the "ancient mechanisms" floating the monastery are mentioned but never constrain a choice, reading as atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    The elevator's ten-floor climb creates a live ticking constraint; the spire's "frost-etched window" and "thick ice walls" filter scattered light that enables the goggles' function, directly enabling the discovery. The brass cage, amber lenses, and refracting ice are tactile and purposeful. The captain's quarters on the tenth floor anchor the destination. Micro-setting (goggles as tool, diary as object) charges the final image when Maren tucks both into her apron. Spatial choreography is clear. The clouds at the end—"patient ghosts"—return the spire's isolation to the reader with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The gondola's altitude, severed tether, and brass telescope constrain Mara's choices: she must study from this isolated vantage, use Victor's instrument to track his hypothesis. Sensory detail is purposeful—"cold observation glass," "dewpoint, wind shear" instruments humming—and filtered through professional lens. The telescope's "patina of a thousand flights, fingerprints oxidized into permanent ghost-touch" charges the final touch where Mara's fingerprints layer over Victor's, making the object a micro-setting that drives the memorial theme and enables the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tree library is vivid and purposeful: shelves carved into living wood, books pressed into sap-weeping alcoves, spiral interior—all anchor the guild's attempt to contain infinite knowledge in organic limits. The demolition equipment and predawn timing create urgency. The coin itself functions as micro-setting, its microscopic engravings a tactile constraint that the protagonist engages through macro lens photography. The library's imminent destruction directly charges the final image of limits discovered through reaching. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail (tarnished metal, battery lamp light catching indentations) grounds the philosophical material.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The antique airship, hopscotch grid, and phrasebook function as micro-setting elements that constrain Maren's choices. The brass hull, planking, nail holes, and tool kit are handled concretely and guide the solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (golden glow, chicory bitterness, starling shrieks). The spatial choreography of Maren kneeling, placing the bolt, dragging her boot through chalk is clear and tactile. The final image of descent toward "navigable airways" charges the setting with forward motion, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library, ice-encased shelves, and hall of mirrors are rendered with vivid, selective detail that supports atmosphere. The "hauntingly bright luminescence" and "pale amber" light filtering through crystallized walls create a coherent visual signature. The mirror chamber's reflections showing different life stages is purposeful and charges the revelation beat. However, spatial choreography wavers—Celeste spreads gears "across a frozen reading table" then walks deeper without clear transition, and the vial of starlight spilling "onto the frozen floor" while gears materialize lacks tight physical logic. The mirrors constrain perception but do not pressure a tactical choice with cost; they serve revelation more than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    The orchard planet with floating rock arches, low gravity, and butterfly gardens is vivid and specific, filtering through Mirela's spectral perception (droplets "hung suspended," "drifting like tears"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the settlement's sectors and domes. The copper bell and chalk materialize as tactile anchors that recur with purpose. However, the nebula of respite is described beautifully but does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure-bearing element. The setting charges the final image (arches, orchards, violet sky) without directly shaping the climactic vote, placing it in the mid-range for setting utility.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse and lantern room anchor spatially; dusk provides atmospheric charge. The puppet head as micro-setting object constrains the ritual (its history must be "read" by the fractals) and charges the closure (crumbles to dust, purpose fulfilled). The pane of hush functions as both setting and mechanism, shaping Mara's work. Sensory details—"wounded gold," "glow softly," "broken edges catching light"—serve mood but remain somewhat ornamental. The environment enables the action but does not force a difficult choice or tactical shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside orchard, mechanical birds, and shifting paths create vivid spatial pressure. The nut's microscopic engravings and the "air feels warm" directional cue constrain Maren's rescue tactics concretely. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("brass wings catching light," "breath above the earth"). The environment actively shapes the final choice—Maren must return into the labyrinth as dusk approaches, with the setting's danger charging that image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The braided ravine is rendered with sensory specificity (three tributaries, overlapping rhythms, foam patterns, slick stones) and the setting constrains Maya's movement and perception throughout. The chrysalis discovery is spatially grounded ("wedged between two rocks") and the foam patterns around her ankles provide a recurring micro-setting that charges the final insight. The ravine's physical properties—separation and rejoining of water—directly shape her conceptual breakthrough, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image. Minor deduction: the "afternoon light turned the water golden" at the end is the only postcard moment, slightly decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered with crystalline trees, transparent floor, and incisions that catch moonlight. The setting constrains Mira's work—she uses the floor's grooves as her dataset—and the floating context above the cloud-sea charges the final image of release. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: pooling moonlight seeking "the lowest points, finding the incisions" integrates discovery with action. The micro-setting (the incised floor) functions as both constraint and closure vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fortress, breach, coral pavilion, and tidal pools anchor spatial choreography clearly. Sensory details—frost on coral despite warm air, copper taste of the first memory, char of impossible choices—are vivid and filtered through Maren's chef palate. The wrapped hands recur as a tactile constraint that matters (she must unwrap to work, rewrap to leave). The pavilion's collapse at closure charges the final image and forecloses return. Minor gap: the "light from some unseen source" remains unexplained and slightly undermines the otherwise grounded world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly realized with brass meridians, gears catching starlight, and the cuckoo-clock weight driving the pulley system. Spatial choreography is clean; the seven silos map coherently across the prairie. The tower's mechanics constrain Mira's broadcast method (gravity-driven, salvaged parts) and the final image of gears turning charges the closure metaphor. Sensory detail is purposeful—borrowed starlight, static, pine-cone shape—without catalog excess. The setting qualifies as micro-setting that shapes tactics and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    The moonlit canyon is vividly established ("walls rose around her like the curved interior of a skull") and the dried creek bed anchors spatial choreography. The periscope mirror's fractured surface and the neural interface are handled on the page. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the canyon's "mineral deposits" shield the tech but this detail does not shape Maya's final decision. Micro-setting (mirror, interface) charges atmosphere but does not drive tactics at closure, capping high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's serpentine passages and the inversion-hour mechanic actively constrain Celene's route and timing. The hidden chamber revealed by rising sediment depends on the inverted gravity, and the doodle's marginal luminescence functions as a micro-object that charges the final connection. Sensory detail (mist, floating stone tears, glowing walls) is selective and filtered through urgency. The environment shapes the closure beat—sediment rising to expose the second opening—meeting the 9+ gate test for setting constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grove is vividly specific—siskin alders, silver bark, root systems, telegraph insulators—and the porcelain/copper apparatus constrains Mara's method. The stress-cracked sculpture anchors the workspace with purposeful detail. However, the setting primarily stages action rather than forcing a tactical choice; the grove responds to Mara's strumming but does not resist or complicate her execution. Sensory detail is strong (cool porcelain, wire tension) but the environment remains cooperative rather than pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magnetic nexus supplies concrete sensory anchors (iron/ozone taste, compass needles spinning, static electricity) and the charged air manifests the beings as crystalline geometries, grounding the abstract. The chess set as micro-setting constrains the translation method and charges the final image when the beings manipulate pieces. Spatial choreography is clean (center of nexus, pieces arranged, beings swirling closer). Minor gap: twilight deepening is mentioned twice but doesn't evolve with the action or pressure the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed workshop with open roof panels and starlight filtering through is vividly anchored early and sustained. Sensory detail is selective: "copper dials," "purple-stained fingers," "brass clasp," fireworks overhead provide concrete anchors that reflect Marcella's priority (the lock, the tools). The diary positioned between speakers and the warming clasp under her touch function as micro-setting that shapes the climactic beat. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The treetop village is vividly established with rope bridges, swaying platforms, and spatial hierarchy (Lirien at "the highest reach," Marin "two platforms below"). The corpse flower pot "at the platform's edge, where wind could carry away some of its eventual perfume" constrains her choice of placement and charges the final image of swaying with the village. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lirien's olfactory bias ("faint musk, like distant thunder"). The micro-setting—her garden platform—serves as the pressure vessel for the entire arc, meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating arches, inversion mechanics, and water-flow navigation create a vivid, constraint-laden environment that directly enables Kael's route through the Arch Maze. Spatial choreography is clear throughout: skiff positioning, water columns as pathways, the seven-arch convergence chamber. The broken arrow tip anchors the final discovery in concrete, verifiable detail. The Turning itself constrains the timeline and narrows her tactical options, charging the discovery sequence with urgency. Micro-setting (the suspended water sphere, skeletal tree) charges key moments without tourist-catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The container labyrinth is vividly particular: "rust-orange walls," "precise columns of light," wind charts pinned to metal, circular clearing with fifteen containers "like petals." Spatial choreography is clear across vertical levels. The setting constrains Mara's investigation (she follows charts deeper, finds reinforcement cables, ballast stones) and charges the closure image (the containers "hummed with contained force"). Sensory selection reflects professional priorities (atmospheric sensors, stress points, angles) filtered through her father's aviation legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with concrete details (bells "thimble-small to cathedral-vast," aurora casting "emerald and crimson sheets," the center bell "whose silence rang loudest...as pure white"). The environment constrains Kael's ritual: he must work "through the colors of the aurora" and position himself at the center bell, and the cavern's architecture (multiple chambers, the ice ceiling) shapes his movement through the performance. The micro-setting of the bell itself—warming the ice-cold metal, feeling its "potential song thrumming"—charges the final image of silent possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Thunder-echo range's "thin places" where sound dissipates and barriers grow gossamer directly enable Mira's investigation; the natural amphitheater's textured silence constrains her final act (she can only glimpse, not restore). The flute (ocean-coast driftwood, gilded reeds from a riverbank touching three realities) functions as micro-setting, its dual-world erosion the story's hinge. Spatial choreography (canyon split, three-wall amphitheater, stone texture) remains clear and the final gesture—touching the wall—charges closure with the canyon's tangible quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The topaz glow and "unraveling heavens" are vivid and purposeful. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting object: it's handled with tweezers, placed on the press bed, shatters under pressure, and its luminescence flows into ink—each beat constrains the operator's method and charges the closure. Spatial choreography (slate table, press lever, doorframe) remains clear. The vanishing stars operate as both atmosphere and ticking clock, reweighting every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and filtered through Kessa's POV; sensory details (green and violet sheets, stones, cold air) anchor each beat. The pendant's copper-green patina and dragonfly-wing structure constrain her action (she presses it to extend encounters). The spatial choreography is clean across the path, rise, and herbalist's location. However, the setting pressures choice only mildly—Kessa could walk any path—so it does not fully charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    The quartz arbor and frost patterns are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Mara's professional mystic lens. The prism constrains her method (she uses it to read frost) and the arbor's "battery" function charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action (prism warming, frost speaking). Minor: the arbor's function as an emotional repository is told rather than shown altering a tactic, but the frost-reading beat demonstrates setting-as-tool effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest frame the action, and the loom itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the weaving process. The puzzle pieces and amber bead are handled tactilely across beats. However, the spatial relationship between orchard and bamboo remains vague (are the apple trees within or adjacent to the forest?), and the environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint—nothing about the setting alters the spinner's tactical choices during the seven-day weave.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard planet, petrified trees, floating arches, and mine shafts create a vivid, specific setting. The magician's silk threaded through tunnels with acoustic properties constrains Kael's method and charges the final image. Sensory detail (cobalt light, tremor in bones, azure petals) is purposeful. The micro-setting (central shaft with seven tunnels) structures the climax and the silk's tension matters to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay as crux point is established early and its multi-universe variants (garden, underwater, snow-filled) are vivid and serve the mapping journey. The green glass shard functions as micro-setting object, constraining her path and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaia's professional filter: she translates "touch and taste and the weight of silence into coordinates." Minor gap: the pristine pocket universe with active engines lacks the spatial grounding of earlier variants—what she sees, hears, smells there beyond "impossible colors" would sharpen the mother's material presence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lantern room is vividly anchored: Fresnel lens, brass fixtures, sea-weathered glass with scratched messages. The cairn-building recurs across three beats and constrains Vera's response—stones are her only tool for reply. Micro-setting (glass panels, seaward windows, spiral stairs) charges the final dawn image when pale gold light fills the space. The lamp's darkness enables discovery of hidden inscriptions, turning environment into revelation. One note: the lighthouse's automated status is told rather than shown through a missing hum or control panel detail.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass wick, and stellar alignment charts supply vivid, purpose-driven detail that constrains ritual sequence. The wick's "total internal reflection" channels constrain the light-steering action at closure. Sensory hierarchy (rainwater, copper bowls, green beam slicing rain) is filtered through Mara's occupational lens. The micro-setting of the lamp room and the glass wick's internal galaxies charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock tea house is vividly anchored (suspended boulder, moss-thick chains, cloudberry tea in whisper-thin cups) and the eastern window constrains her ritual of tracking sun trails. The morpho wing functions as micro-setting, its changing iridescence guiding her perception and charging the final image. Valley mist, pearl-and-amber dawn light, and golden thread sun trails create a coherent sensory palette filtered through the dye master's professional attention to light and color. The tea house's spatial specificity (her usual seat, the proprietor drifting closer) supports choreography, and the setting's quiet isolation suits the confessional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The labyrinth's growth-ring walls, the storm-wracked turret, and the moonlight's angle all constrain and enable Kael's final reconstruction. The sextant's broken mirrors catching moonlight drive the climactic beat, and the "thousand-year oak" keystone anchors the closure. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (stone textures, silver light pooling, storm intensifying), and spatial choreography tracks cleanly from staircase to astronomers' corridor to labyrinth heart.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: skeletal trees, mica window layers, luminous fragments. The mica window constrains Elara's action (she must align fragments "just right") and charges the closure by resonating with her songs. Spatial choreography is clear across the greenhouse and settlements. Minor issue: the "mirror world" frame remains abstract; "where everything existed in reverse shadow" never affects a choice or tactic on the page, reading as ornamental high-concept rather than functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dryer-portal and impossible library dimensions establish a clear fantastical premise. The shelved paradoxes (war/peace, solitude/community) provide atmospheric texture and thematic grounding. However, the library itself remains a backdrop for exposition rather than constraining Eleanor's choices—she wanders freely, pulls one volume, and the space offers no resistance or resource scarcity that shapes her decision. The crumpled invitation returns at the end but as a symbolic gesture rather than a tool that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (moss creep, vine accumulation, brambles, broken windows). The tea house functions as micro-setting that charges the encounter and final image. Sensory hierarchy fits Mira's botanical focus (caraway seeds, chrysanthemum tea, sage between stones). The east wing detail at the end—"stonework looked somehow younger each week"—adds a fresh constraint that will shape her next planting, satisfying the choice-shaping test for high-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Frozen Library functions as more than setting—its crystalline architecture, quartz chamber, and cloud-suspension actively constrain Celeste's work and charge the final image of descent. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "breath forming constellations," "quartz hush," ink freezing as she writes. The Resonance Chamber's pure quartz walls that "dampened even the sound of the heart" directly enables the transformation work. Spatial choreography remains clear through ice-veined corridors to chamber to library's edge. The magic lantern slide as micro-object constrains multiple choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pirate market is vividly rendered with barnacle-crusted ladder, rotting timber, oil lamps, and lobster-trap throne; these details are filtered through Della's mission-focused perception. The watch fob's physical warmth and the sensory detail of "salt-thick darkness" ground the scene. Minor gap: spatial choreography between Della and Kern could be sharper—her movement "closer" lacks specific distance or positioning that would charge the confrontation stakes. The sunrise timeframe bookends effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lavender bluff and aurora are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (metallic taste shifts, heat distortions, mist columns). The tin compass ring functions as micro-setting, returning at closure to charge the final image when Kaia offers it away. Spatial choreography is clear (bluff's edge, valley below, weather-carriers approaching). Minor penalty: the "forests holding elections" remain distant backdrop; their specific mechanics (pollen exchanges, root-network voting) are described but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Kaia's decision on the bluff.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered ("crystalline formations caught her headlamp's beam, fracturing light into spectral shards") and functions as confessional space, but its role remains largely atmospheric. Charcoal-stained fingers recur purposefully, linking her current work to the buried painting. The cave's specific features (loose panel, broken lock) enable plot progression but don't actively constrain Maya's final choice—she could have decided anywhere. Museum above provides spatial contrast but minimal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse city under toxic rust-colored sky is vivid and pressure-laden, establishing scarcity and suffocation. The setting constrains movement (narrow studio between mushroom farms, tunnels with air recyclers) and the Archive's physical presence—zinc-etched plates lining walls—charges the final image. Micro-setting (her calligrapher's studio, the postal depot) shapes the search. However, spatial choreography during the journey through tunnels lacks concrete waypoints, and sensory detail tilts heavily visual (amber light, sepia glow) without embodying smell or touch that would reflect Mira's hybrid nature more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Whispering Bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—rainbows refracted across palms, bells swaying in counterweight cradles. The ice's diminishing and the sculpture's gradual transformation are tracked cleanly and charge the final image. The bluff "whispers its approval" at closure, completing a lyric frame that grounds the conceptual repricing in setting.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass dome and desert roses supply both constraint and resource: the roses' "strangely organic composition producing oils that combusted at precise temperatures" enables the ritual, and the enclosed space contains the smoke that allows Unit-47's inward compression. The dome's ventilation, the sand beds, the spiral arrangement at the center—all are integrated into the climactic action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the android's sensors (petals "more flesh than bloom," amber sun refracted into fragments). The spatial choreography from rows seven and eight to the dome's center is clean and the micro-setting charges the final image of planting in ash.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored: bougainvillea "the color of fresh wounds," fountain gurgle, terra cotta walls, dawn light, mosaic tiles. Spatial choreography is clean (mailbox in basement, courtyard above). The setting functions as gathering space that holds the community's healing rituals, and the final image explicitly uses the courtyard's "gentle rhythm" to support Iris's return. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome—it serves as backdrop and thematic amplifier rather than active pressure. Mr. Hernandez's tai chi and Mrs. Okoye's herb garden add texture but remain illustrative.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken laboratory is vivid and specific: corroded walls, kelp hymns, bioluminescent algae, coral-encrusted floor. The environment constrains Mira's methods (guards above, sealed doors, tidal rhythms) and charges the final image (ancient water rushing in). Sensory detail is filtered through her lyrical perspective (cathedral/prison duality, "kelp seeking light"). The setting directly enables the climactic dance and lock response, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The salt crystal chamber, dock lanterns, and coffee grounds are vivid and selective, with sensory hierarchy filtered through Maren's patient, methodical POV. The chamber constrains her method (mineral saturation stabilizes pockets) and charges the final image ("searching for stars reflected in dark water"). Spatial choreography is clean across locations. The whale itself functions as both setting and concept anchor, grounding the fantastical premise in tactile, barnacled specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nocturnal haven beside the brook is anchored early and returns at closure (dawn sanctuary). Sensory details—cricket songs, rustling leaves, cool night air, burbling brook—are vivid and filtered through the summoner's trance state. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice; it provides ambiance but never alters tactics or imposes cost. The origami wing as micro-setting object appears in multiple beats and charges the final image when it crumbles, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower anchor the confrontation scene effectively; the bronze griffin catches meteor-light in a purposeful sensory moment. The "cluttered apartment where books towered like miniature skylines" provides strong spatial grounding for the middle. Micro-setting (the desk seal) recurs with tactile handling. Minor gap: the city "spreading below" remains generic—no specific brownstone or limestone detail filters through the narrator-architect's professional lens at the rooftop moment when that expertise would naturally sharpen perception.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet garden functions as micro-setting, its phosphorescent mist and memory-flowers providing tactile atmosphere. The seashell's calcium chambers and fractured edge ground sensory detail. The garden constrains Mara's demonstration choice (she kneels beside specific blooms) and charges the final image as flowers pulse in response. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: pathways, tower, shadows, kneeling positions.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The marble sanctuary and aurora provide vivid sensory anchors (cold light, shifting greens/violets, dripping stalactites). The heritage rose thorn is handled twice—pressed to thumb, later embedded in marble—and the blood-ink mixing constrains her method. Spatial choreography is clean. The aurora's shifting colors modulate tone across the night, and the dripping stalactites mark time's passage. The sanctuary's symbolic weight (permanence as illusion) supports theme without becoming postcard description. Minor: some details (pearl twilight, wisely enduring) repeat as labels rather than evolving through action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    The serpentine nexus supplies vivid spatial detail ("corridors that curved back upon themselves like chambers of a vast seashell") and the whispering seashell half becomes a functional tool that enables eavesdropping. Starlight filtering through crevices appears in the opening and final image, charging the closure with atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—Kael moves freely through passages without spatial friction or access barriers that would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glacier shrine with seventeen candles provides strong sensory anchors (ice walls, reflected light, breath crystallizing). The melted snow globe constrains Maya's understanding (she reads its tilted ship as the Katerina). The aurora metaphor in the final paragraphs charges the closure image with borrowed-light resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting enables discovery without merely decorating.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering parapet after rain is vivid and purposeful: slick stone, moonlight pools, firefly currents, and the harbor below create a micro-setting that charges Chen's philosophy. The bamboo whisk's asymmetry and the nets' knotwork ground her method in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clear (parapet, village below, harbor). The setting does not constrain a present choice but it charges the final image when Chen picks up the nets again, linking place to practice. Strong sensory economy with POV filter (she notices shadow maps and firefly constellations). Qualifies for the 9+ gate by charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard's impossible greenness against rust-colored dust establishes vivid situational pressure early; "dust seemed to flow around the orchard rather than through it" makes the anomaly concrete. The shredded-paper reconstruction provides tactile micro-setting that constrains Maya's investigation method across the night sequence. The wasteland exterior charges the final stakes—destruction of the diamond means "the last pure place would become as poisoned as everything else"—but spatial choreography inside Vera's cottage (table, stove, window) remains generic and doesn't pressure the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt glass portico and stormlit observatory are vivid and purposeful, constraining Vera's isolation and charging the closure scene where she watches the storm break. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("ozone and burnt coffee," "taste copper"). The portico becomes both pulpit and prison, a recurring anchor that shapes her public role and final realization. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the setting participates in the ending image with intentional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The feral loft is rendered with concrete specificity—salvaged shelves, wind-hollowed space, ghost crabs—and constrains her isolation while enabling the sound-preservation work. The music box's "mechanism thick with sand" and her grandmother's watch-repair skills integrate tool, body memory, and setting into a tactile sequence. The beach's "positively wistful" morning silence charges the walk toward town. The dunes function as both boundary and resource throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drift-ice marina is anchored early with sensory specifics—groaning pier, amber-glowing icebergs, crystalline voices—and the sunset modulates tone across the confrontation. The key's warmth and vibration constrain Maren's tactical choices (she presses it to ice, channels intention through it), and the ice's song returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment pressures every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen lake, basalt columns, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and purposeful. The viaduct's iron-rich hum after rain directly enables the escape by masking the exodus, constraining both timing and route. Spatial choreography tracks clearly: sanctuary → beneath viaduct → ten miles north to the next basalt formation. Sensory detail is selective (boots silent on frozen basalt, breath clouds, magnetic pull felt) and filtered through Kael's professional lens as a horizon mapper. The frozen lake's mirror image bookends the piece, shifting from prison reflection to beautiful impassability at dawn, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subway tunnel is richly textured (dripping water, concrete chamber, brass lantern, silt boot prints) and constrains her investigation spatially. The lantern provides light and thematic weight but does not materially alter a tactical choice—she could work with a flashlight. Sensory detail is well-filtered through investigator priorities (scratches, fibers, water marks). The setting participates in closure (emerging into "rain-washed daylight") with tonal charge, qualifying for mid-7s despite the lantern's functional replaceability.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The repair shop is vividly rendered ("dust motes hung suspended," "oil, old wood, and patience") and Mrs. Chen's magnifying glasses and tool use ground her expertise in concrete action. The clockwork heart as micro-setting object constrains the central choice—Marcus cannot deliver it broken—and charges the ending image ("clockwork heart would beat again"). Spatial choreography is minimal but clear (counter, lamp circle). Storm clouds appear late as symbolic backdrop without altering Marcus's path. The shop's "vibrant hush" permeates the tone but does not pressure a choice within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating workshop, acid sea, brass hull, and kaleidoscope are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("yellow fog," "acid kissed metal," "gears turned, grinding out their purposeless harmonies"). The micro-setting (kaleidoscope as tool) is central and handled across multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Fennec works unimpeded. The kaleidoscope charges the final image thematically but does not force a trade-off or limit her action, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archive setting provides atmospheric detail (server clusters, deletion logs, cache sizes) but functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The patch is handled twice (wall, fingers) and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. The digital environment doesn't materially narrow Mira's options—she accesses backdoors without friction. Spatial choreography remains abstract; we never feel the physicality of her workspace under investigative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse orchard—apple trees thriving in salt-wind, ice floes groaning below—constrains the peace talk spatially and charges the final image (boys collaborating for the branch). The circular room with maritime windows and vintage mirrors grounds action. The setting's impossibility (fruit in cold) is purposeful, mirroring the impossible peace Kael seeks, and the shifting ice becomes a resonant metaphor for reconstitution without being stated.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drift-ice marina supplies concrete sensory grounding (cracking bergs, blue-white channels, ancient ice scent) and constrains action (shrinking ice pan forces the rescue). The parasol functions as micro-setting, recurring with shifting weight (intact heirloom → broken tip → "delicate and improbably strong"). Spatial choreography is clean (dock, boat, shelter). The ice itself mirrors the theme of dissolution/persistence without becoming overt symbolism. Minor note: "prefab shelter" is generic; one interior detail would sharpen the space.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber pavilion, autumn wind, and vineyard anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail filtered through Marco's professional lens (grafting, frost watch). The lantern and paper walls contribute atmosphere. However, the pavilion itself does not materially constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it remains a backdrop. The burned letter fragment and vineyard metaphor do more causal work than the physical setting, keeping this in the strong but not indispensable range.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    The kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion, and singing dunes constrain choice: only line walkers can read the stones' language, and Maya's ritual walk engages the structure actively. Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (vibrations, pressure-sensitive stones, harmonics). The parapet's response to Maya's steps charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the pavilion and parapet beneath) drives the consecration act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lavender field and rusted factory supply vivid, purposeful detail (purple blooms, broken windows, vines climbing walls) that mirrors the theme of reclamation. Spatial choreography is clear: Mira kneels, arranges photos on the ground, Thomas approaches from the field's edge. The micro-setting (photographs on lavender-covered ground) constrains the arrangement activity and charges the final collective gaze. Sensory selection is strong (lavender scent at dusk, afternoon breeze) and filtered through the reflective lens, though the piece leans descriptive rather than using environment to force a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed library at dawn is vivid and purposeful, with rose-gold light refracting through the crystal across the definition of "complete"—a charged micro-setting moment. The crystal as object-setting constrains her method (tuning fork, facets) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (lectern, floorboards, shelves) remains clear throughout. The setting filters through Maren's scholarly attention without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with corroded steel, rust, and mist that create atmosphere without postcard cataloging. The sculptures constrain Marcus's search pattern, and the driftwood markers function as micro-setting that structures his navigation. The final corroded arch frames the climactic moment where he hears the sound. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Marcus touching surfaces "as if reading braille"), though the garden could press harder on tactics in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory setting constrains Mira's work (foundations shaking, tools rattling, telescope array synchronization deadline) and the spinning clock hand becomes a micro-setting element that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: the hand's hum "like wind through a paper forest," clouds "like a second ocean," the seismic rhythm felt through feet. The spatial choreography between workbench, dome, and window remains coherent. Does not reach 9+ because while the clock and tremors shape choices, the broader observatory environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint in the climactic repair.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    The hospice setting is vividly anchored (Mount Serenity's peak, clouds, white corridors, upright piano in Room 14) and the broken vinyl record recurs with clear transformation (fracture → mending symbol). However, the environment remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choices—neither the mountain altitude, the room layout, nor the piano materially narrows Richard's or Maya's tactical options during the reconciliation sequence. The clouds function as mood ("cotton-sea," "rose and gold") without applying spatial or situational pressure to the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory, brass dome, crystal walls, and hidden chamber are vividly realized and integral to the mystery. The clockwork key's magnetic resonances and the floor keyhole provide micro-setting texture that enables the turn. Spatial choreography (Mira sitting before her own case, the dome opening to pre-dawn sky) charges the final image. The nocturnal timeframe and "midnight pressed against the glass like dark water" anchor atmosphere without becoming ornamental. No occupational depth is required here; the scholar-rune work functions cleanly within the fantasy frame.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The secret garden functions as more than backdrop: "exhaled twilight even at noon," crystalline flowers with bioluminescent star-maps, and the physical constellation of bones all constrain and enable Maren's final choice. Spatial choreography stays clear—Thomas cross-legged on moss, Maren kneeling beside him, her hands guided to touch the bones. The hedge maze as threshold and the garden's "nostalgic innovation" charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the opalescent tooth "shifting colors like oil on water," harmonics that "made her teeth ache." The clinic and manor receive only minimal sketch, but the garden's micro-setting (moss, bones, feather, stone, tooth) materially shapes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The serpentine grotto functions as sanctuary and frames every polishing beat; mist softens edges and charges the light-diffusion effect. The flat stone table and wall niches constrain her method. The eastern-wall gap awaiting morning sun charges the final placement. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Cap at 8.8 per the 9+ gate: the grotto pressures tone more than it narrows a tactical choice in a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is established vividly with sensory detail (emerald silence, honeyed hush, bird chirping in cooling ducts) and the icicle-drip pattern charges the final image by recurring throughout. The setting pressures choice: the woman sits on a moss-covered bench, the green stillness creates space for vulnerable exchange. Micro-setting (the amber pendant, the moss, the dripping water) constrains and charges the interaction. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting evolves organically (seasonal thaw, water patterns) without static repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The feral nexus where three rivers collide constrains the novelist's entire physical and thematic frame: she observes currents fighting in six directions, the mist transforms perception, and the location charges the final image of standing where rivers meet. The seashell fragment and the swirling water function as micro-setting elements that recur with shifted meaning. Sensory detail (mist, white churn, perpetual atmosphere) is filtered through the protagonist's grief-laden attention and directly supports the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor, dew, harvest moon, and dawn light are vivid and selective, filtered through Maera's craftsperson attention (bark texture, tendril coolness). The vine tendrils function as micro-setting tools that constrain her ritual method and charge the final glow image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency as the moon fades and she sings faster. Minor slip: "green twilight" is a visual metaphor that slightly tensions the established dawn light without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The withered orchard and frozen aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystallizing breath, verdigris plate). The setting constrains the ritual spatially and thematically. The illustration plate and discarded items—rusted lids, broken glass, wire—are handled with specificity and recur with reweighted function at closure. The cold and the crater's basin shape the alchemist's movements and frame the daughter's memory. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the micro-setting of arranged refuse charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    The marble cavern is vividly realized with gold veins, acoustic geometry, and seasonal shifts that structure her visits. The broken timer mechanism functions as a tactile puzzle that constrains her method and enables the harvest-of-echoes reveal. The setting's acoustic properties directly shape her experimental approach (dawn/noon/midnight angles), satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. Minor: spatial choreography within the cavern is somewhat vague, but the cave's properties charge the closure image when she seals it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail ("oxidized glory," "geometric shadows," "shingled hush") that filters through the weaver's perceptual lens. The lamp burner's cracked chimney and the calcified weights constrain her method across multiple beats. However, the environment does not force a choice or alter her final stance; it remains a rich backdrop rather than a tactical pressure. The body and tools are present but do not charge the closure image in a way that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-beaded skylight, workbench, ash wood grain, and kettle all constrain micro-choices and charge the final image. The skylight frames the "here and gone" of raindrops, priming the theme. The blank's grain and the knife's weight anchor sensory perception in craft detail that reflects Mira's professional lens. The cooling tea in the final beat supplies a temporal marker and embodied neglect that deepens the closure's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kinetic lagoon supplies the dominant image and its perpetual motion contrasts Kera's stillness, charging the final acceptance. The camera wheel (micro-object-as-setting) appears, is handled across beats, and the click mechanism becomes the vehicle for forward motion. Spatial grounding is present (lagoon edge, floating stones, twenty-foot distance to ghost) but the cloudline setting remains somewhat abstract; it pressures mood more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terminal's physical systems—water stains, ducts, solar panels, heat buildup—constrain Maya's choices and enable her solution, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (concourses, executive lounge, atrium, gate areas), and sensory detail is selective ("dust motes danced in shafts of light," "calliope music"). The micro-setting of the sextant piece functions as a recurring charged object. Minor cap: the carnival's physical traces (cotton candy wrappers, ticket stubs) are mentioned but never used, and the children playing tag in the final scene arrives without prior spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    The crystal forecourt constrains her approach ("excruciatingly gentle steps") and charges the closure: the crystals "whispered their approval" as she plays, anchoring her private reconciliation in the sanctuary's responsive acoustic. Petrichor, mist, and translucent pavers filtered through her memory create a micro-setting that mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent (forecourt → kneeling → playing → wrapping → walking away). Minor note: "ancient stones" recurs without added specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The barge canal is vivid and selective: "amber reflection and diesel shimmer," "deck groaning," charts that "crumbled at his touch." The setting constrains Marcus's search (pilot house, hold, crates) and the dawn imagery charges the closure ("serene upheaval of morning" modulates from opening twilight to final sunlit departure). Micro-setting (sundial, maps) drives the core revelation. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the industrial-ghost atmosphere supports tone without overwhelming action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden dock, harbor fog, and snow are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail ("each flake dissolving into the harbor's dark water with a whisper"). The rope and fulgurite function as micro-setting objects that enable the central discovery. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Maren kneels, reads, understands, rises without spatial friction. The fog thickens atmospherically but imposes no cost or urgency on her work. Strong descriptive execution but the setting remains backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed autumn garden anchors early and charges the final line ("lonesome and splendid, full of transformation's quiet promise"). Bronze leaves as "forgotten correspondence" and the crimson leaf spiraling like a falling thread tie setting to Thomas's craft, constraining the metaphoric vocabulary. Camphor for aching joints and the stone bench provide tactile micro-setting. The garden's "deepest corner" functions spatially to isolate the encounter. The recurring autumn-decay motif supports tone and theme, though the garden itself does not materially alter a tactical choice—it provides atmosphere and symbolic charge more than direct constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vividly particular and constrains the prince's work—"a crystal chamber jutting precariously from the palace's eastern wing" houses his fragile apparatus while "the palace swayed in the cavern's artificial wind, groaning." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "clockwork servants clicked through marble halls," "steam-driven fountains," the egg held "to the lamplight," the creature's "eyes that glowed with soft bioluminescence." The cavern's "darkness seemed less absolute" at closure, charging the final image. The body and lab tools (glass tubes, copper incubator, microscope) function as micro-setting that alters tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and grafting site are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (kelp-drift peace, grain catching light, dune grass whisper). The grafting tools and plants function as micro-setting that enables the central therapeutic action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The lagoon constrains the scene's possibilities and charges the final image, though it does not force a difficult choice between competing paths in this session.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fountains anchor space throughout and the constellation map constrains the final choice, satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, the "oldest quarter" and "Fountain of Sidereal Patience" appear abruptly in the second half without spatial build-up. The stained glass box "exists slightly outside normal time" via assertion rather than tactile discovery, reducing embodied interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered through purposeful sensory detail (phosphorescent blooms, rose and amber convergence, sonar-mapped clouds) and the calculating machine gear functions as micro-setting, constraining the Keeper's verification ritual. The environment charges the final image: the luminous clouds frame the protagonist's solitary transit and the seed-release action. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the sequence; the garden's "approximates infinity" quality subtly mirrors the Keeper's unending task, though the constraint on choice is light.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: "cracked panes and rust-eaten frames," "orange light filtered through glass and vine," monarchs migrating through the open roof. It functions as both a retreat and a teaching space, constraining Elena's attention and charging the final departure. The ribbon roll—a micro-object as setting element—guides her new carving method. Setting shapes choice and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The obsidian ridge, tide pools, and tower foundation constrain Mara's ritual timeline and charge the final image with the interplay of permanence and encroachment. The "impossible pause" in the pendulum's swing functions as micro-setting, enabling the transfer and differentiating this world's physics. Sensory detail—volcanic glass glints, cold iron railing, bioluminescent glow—filters through Mara's professional attention and grounds the ritual in tactile specificity. The tidal cycle bookends the piece (retreating tide at open, lowest point at close), making the ridge's exposure a spatial actor that mirrors the story's rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt silo is vividly anchored with "painted surface drinking in starlight, transforming it into something between midnight and sapphire" and houses the workbench, magnifying glass, and floorboards that enable the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and supports the setting's function. However, the silo does not constrain a choice at closure; Mira could plant the rose and preserve the letters regardless of where she found them. The cemetery itself remains generic, with "velveteen gloom" and "headstones" offering atmosphere but no spatial pressure or resources that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and circular chamber are vivid and purposeful, grounding the reader in a specific, cold, high-stakes environment. The spire's volcanic history becomes a narrative resource (thermal vents), directly affecting the third future and thus the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional lens. Minor slip: the kingfisher quill is described repeatedly but its tactile reality doesn't evolve or constrain a choice; it remains a beautiful object rather than a micro-setting element that pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember alcove is vividly micro-setting: mist for cover, dying coals for light, hidden floor panel, all constraining Maren's work rhythm and detection risk. Sensory detail is selective (mist, amber glow, cobblestone footsteps) and filtered through her copyist's priorities. The luminous dust functions as both atmospheric detail and conceptual anchor, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (alcove behind chimney, radio beneath stones, boots outside). Minor gap: the concert hall's larger geography and the watch-towers' sightlines remain vague, limiting the tactical pressure of her hiding spot.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    The gallery space, charcoal tools, porcelain shards, and rocking chair all constrain choices and charge the ending. The chair's slowing tempo operates as both clock and environment, pressuring Mira's drawing speed. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's occupational lens (charcoal powder, smudge technique, exhaust vents). Spatial choreography—easel, chair, wall mask—tracks cleanly. Minor: the "back room" filters are mentioned once without prior grounding, a small late anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken city is vivid and purposeful: "fish now nested in judge's chambers and coral grew on subway tiles" grounds the world in specific ruin. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through storm drains, collapsed archways, and sedimentary layers. The setting constrains Marcellus's movements (patrol boats overhead, waterproof cases, pipe networks) and charges the final image—his ascent through "drowned streets" reweights his solitary mission. Micro-setting (the chronometer cog, the archive) functions as both tool and metaphor without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet library and autumn light are vividly rendered and consistently present across beats. Sensory details (frost on windows, leaves spiraling) are selective and mood-appropriate. The zither as micro-setting object constrains the teaching method and charges the final image when students hold it. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, meeting the constraint test for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored with broken glass, corroded frames, and fractured roof panels; the three-moons alignment provides both atmosphere and a time constraint. The greenhouse's "earth that remembered abundance" and the tactile details (Mara's hands clearing space, the warm shears) ground choices in the environment. The setting charges the final image—ruin reclaimed—and the micro-setting (soil, broken structure) directly enables the central action of planting and pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning collection tower functions as both setting and constraint, with the spiral stairs and capacitors grounding Mira's world. "Amber sky," "honey-colored haze," and "nectar-colored dusk" create a cohesive sensory palette that charges the final image. The lacquer box (painted bees and flowers) and glass vials of pollen serve as micro-setting elements that constrain choice. Spatial choreography remains clear through the toll booth, gate, and tower climb.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bay, abandoned house, and spring evening are rendered with selective sensory detail (lilac and salt, hammered silver water, amber streetlights) that consistently filters through Maya's noticing lens. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining the revelation beat and charging the closure when placed on the windowsill where "pale rectangles in the paint suggested something had always rested." Spatial choreography through the house rooms is clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater garden is vivid and specific: coral threading marble, kelp-forests replacing rose trellises, scored columns and compromised walls. The ampoule's "foxglove-stained glass" and "bioluminescent light" anchor sensory detail in action. The garden's architectural sabotage (deliberately weakened structures) directly informs the thematic revelation and charges the closure when the statues animate around the woman. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment constrains the woman's understanding, making it a micro-setting that shapes the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The infinite staircase functions as both setting and constraint, shaping Elena's methodology (every hundred steps, temperature shifts, harmonic frequencies). The chipped dice and stone walls serve as tactile anchors. The "hundred landings" of equations and the cold stone steps create spatial coherence without catalog description. The staircase's properties (predictable temperature changes, dimensional curvature) constrain her proof-building tactics and charge the final image of perpetual climbing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop greenhouse with smog-filtered moonlight is vivid and purposeful, creating "amber uncertainty" that charges the final vision. Sensory details (waxing moon as "pale yellow smudge," "saffron quiet," withering tomatoes) are filtered through Mira's exhausted POV and reflect her stake (preservation, beauty in decay). The moon-tipped brush is handled concretely and its carved Tangut script links setting to theme. Spatial choreography is clear. The environment does not constrain a choice in a high-stakes beat, limiting high-band access, but it charges the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto setting is vividly anchored (limestone corridors, bioluminescent fungi, waterfall roar) and constrains social life ("no crime, only collective survival"). The opera glass lens positioned to catch vanished sunlight charges the ending's hope motif. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the tour; sensory details (eternal thunder, water-damaged manuscripts) reflect Celeste's curatorial priorities. The bakery ovens function as micro-setting that will enable the next day's lesson, closing the loop from recipe card to grinding stones with tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and tide cycle anchor space and time effectively. The yoyo's bronze axle and crystal seed constrain the climax choice—Silas must reconstruct the mechanism to activate reversal. Sensory detail (slick rocks, salt wind, corroded bronze) filters through POV priorities. The recurring backward clocks and the hunger stone's dual appearance (emergence, then blazing beneath waves) charge the final image with purposeful reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The funhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: warped mirrors multiply her distortion and the green luminance charges the space. Sensory detail is selective (mirrors, shadows, warm metal, pale green light) and filtered through Vera's POV. The mirrors constrain her choice by forcing confrontation with her blurred face, and the clasp's glow charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Slight penalty for the advisor materializing "from the shadows between two funhouse mirrors"—spatial choreography wobbles when his form is "as indistinct as her own face" yet he produces a book and speaks with physical presence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating orchard supplies vivid constraint: roots drinking seawater, driftwood framework as instrument, spatial isolation on open water. The xylophone mallet and resonance points (tree trunks, ropes) are handled tactilely and shape Kael's survival tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—blue hour indistinguishability of sky and ocean, salt taste in the apple. The orchard's circular drift and the fractal cloud patterns charge the final image of "alive and singing still," meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The turtle-shell city, brass sea, and perpetual white sun-glare establish vivid, consistent atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "brine and ancient reptile musk," "phosphorescent gases," "millions of [shells] formed the sediment of decades." The shells constrain Mira's method and the undersides of the turtles supply the navigation map, so environment shapes choice. The watchers charge the final image by moving closer when the turtles stop. Spatial choreography remains clear across descent and cavern exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    The disused station is vividly rendered with selective detail (pigeons, broken glass, ivy, cracked windows) and the rosebush provides a recurring frame. However, the environment remains primarily atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint: Helena moves freely through the space, and no physical feature alters her tactics or complicates her goal. The illuminated letter's discovery location (loose brick) is the only moment where setting enables plot, but this feels convenience-driven. The micro-setting test is not met; the body, tool, or recurring object does not constrain a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The submerged pavilion supplies concrete constraint: knee-deep water, shifting light columns, the fissure in the central column that enables his offering. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("sunlight filtered through the surface in shifting columns"), filtered through Garrett's professional and grieving perspective. The inkwell, water, and stone all recur and charge the final image. The pavilion's transformation from celebration site to ruin directly mirrors the story's thematic concern with absence, and the physical space constrains his movement and shapes the ritual act at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken city library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail: "pressure-groan of the sea," "water damage darkened the lower drawers," reinforced glass holding back "crushing dark." The blackout functions as a concrete constraint that unlocks the magnetic archive door and shapes Marcus's tactics (headlamp navigation, memory-based escape). The setting pressures every choice and charges the final image of ocean pressing against glass while Marcus holds salvaged truth. The bronze stamp's weight and the portfolio's leather texture ground the discovery in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating tea garden with celestial kettles and the glass basilica supply vivid, specific anchors. The basilica's optical trick ("descends while ascending") recurs to charge the final paragraph's metaphor. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbolic vehicle rather than tactical constraint—no choice is narrowed by proximity, access, or environmental pressure. Sensory detail tilts visual and remains relatively static across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory's failing systems (cooling circuits, decreasing altitude, life support) pressure every choice with a live countdown. The geode physically constrains her method—she mounts it, adjusts its position, presses her forehead to it—and its warmth pulse charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the drifting platform and the desert thirty miles below. The floating observatory as isolation chamber/weapon synthesis is specific and irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fractured dome, LED arrays casting "brilliant dimness," and the jury-rigged scanner create a vivid, purposeful micro-setting. The observatory's broken infrastructure becomes the conceptual anchor for "missing pieces" and directly enables the climactic action (drone launch through the dome opening). Dusk's "shades of gold and ash" charge the final image and the setting transitions coherently from exterior to interior, maintaining spatial clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore provide spatial grounding with purposeful recurring detail: three evenings of sifting, the carvings half-buried in sand, the watch hand "heavier than driftwood should." The setting constrains Maren's search (must sift through "dozens of similar pieces") and charges the final image with Clara appearing "haloed by the failing light." Sensory selection is strong (ocean wind threading hair, salt-smoothed wood). Minor limitation: the terrace itself remains largely atmospheric rather than shaping tactical choices beyond serving as meeting place.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and valley lights anchor the scene viscerally and charge the mood. The drawer pull is handled twice (displayed, then given) and its tarnish-to-beauty transformation under moonlight is purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean: side-by-side positioning, looking into "gray nothing," the walk home. The mist imposes "furrowed hush" and the moon's apex structures the meeting, both constraining and enabling the encounter. Environment directly shapes choice: neutral territory permits honesty, and the natural rhythm untethers them from government demands.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal kayak launch, fog, dock creaking, utility poles, and salt breeze create a coherent micro-setting. The broken compass returns with shifted weight at closure, and the rental attendant's warning about the tricky current constrains Marina's final choice: "Hesitate mid-crossing and you'll get pushed back." Sensory hierarchy reflects Marina's professional past (navigator's attention to Polaris, currents, cardinal points). No spatial confusion; the kayak cutting through water and utility poles marking the receding shore charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("blue-green light pulsed from algae colonies") and the symbiosis detail charges the thematic stakes. The cavern descent and rain during the drive anchor setting through action. However, the underground location doesn't constrain Maya's choices; she arrives and listens. The lake functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical pressure, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("silver-white," "pollen that glittered like crushed stars") and the setting actively responds to Mira's conjuring, bending branches and releasing pollen that facilitates her transformation. The spice vials function as micro-setting elements that constrain her method and charge the final image. However, the orchard itself remains largely atmospheric rather than imposing spatial or resource constraints on her choices—she walks freely, unstoppers vials without obstacle, and the environment accommodates rather than tests her.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: "silver-barked trees whose branches disappeared into distances that defied geometry," stars that "pressed close enough to warm her skin." The flat stone table and the cracked saucer at center function as micro-setting elements that charge the ritual moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the climb, ritual, and descent. The glade's "choking beauty" pressures Nadia's breath and charges the final release ("letting her breathe freely for the first time"), satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining perception and charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The recycled ship's bioluminescent strips, the recreation bay's photograph-scales, and the faint shimmer of dried tears create a tactile, lived-in micro-setting. The gravitational physics of joy constrains Ren's body at the closure beat, lifting them as they stitch—environment (and physiology) shapes the final image directly. Minor gap: spatial choreography of "rising slowly, still stitching" could be slightly clearer about hand/needle positioning relative to floating.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    The black sand beach is vivid and specific ("volcanic glass still warm," "sharp, recent, still being born from stone and fire"), and the tactile detail—sand running through Maris's fingers—directly supports the transformation theme. The volcano's imminent eruption creates temporal pressure and the setting's physicality (heat, granular texture) contrasts with Maris's prior life of "silk and marble." The environment charges the final image and constrains the scene to this moment of celestial alignment, satisfying the micro-setting test for the 7–8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort, crystalline walls, and half-painted sundial create a vivid, purposeful setting. The sundial's texture and angles constrain Mira's method and anchor the revolutionary network concretely. Spatial choreography (eastern courtyard, sundial base, gnomon hiding spot) remains clear. The blackout itself—darkness swallowing luminous stones—charges the atmosphere and enables the covert action, meeting the micro-setting test by altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bluff "where the stone held memory of friction" anchors the placement ritual, and the frictionless bay pressures Kaela's twice-wrong tide predictions. The aurora pulses "matching her heartbeat," charging the final sequence. Micro-setting (rocks, dust) participates in the closure when threads of light connect them. However, the tidal mechanics and eel movements remain ornamental description rather than tangible constraints that alter her tactics during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory dome, darkroom, storm-lit setting, and the darkroom timer all constrain and charge the work. The timer's mechanical tick and seven-minute cycles structure her labor, and lightning strobing through the door illuminates her face in the climactic beat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (red-lit space, thunder rolling, chemical smell implied). The micro-setting (darkroom) functions as crucible and the storm as both atmosphere and thematic amplifier.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass atrium, sundial, and brook anchor space and atmosphere effectively. The half-painted sundial constrains the cipher and charges the final image when Theodora points to it, proving micro-setting function. Sensory detail (brass gears clicking, steel singing, amber light) is vivid and filtered through the scene's philosophical urgency. The spatial choreography of the duel remains clear throughout. Minor: the atrium's glass walls amplify sound but do not further constrain a tactic after that single mention.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted library is vivid and purposeful: "metal skeleton exposed where paint has flaked away, vines claiming the corners like patient invaders." Books on salvaged shelves, seedlings in rusted card catalogs, and the coffee tin on a shelf all participate in the space. The moon-and-stars setting charges the opening and recurs at closure ("diamond-sharp stars," "moon climbs higher"), and the library's hybrid state—reading room and garden—constrains their rebuild choices. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the night's work.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Grand Central's lower concourse and the moonstone piano in the tidal arbor are vividly rendered with selective detail. The arbor's breathing islands and silver-leaf mist create a charged atmosphere that supports the tone. However, spatial choreography in the station (projector placement, wall proximity, commuter flow) remains vague, and the arbor functions more as postcard backdrop than constraint—Marcus sits, plays, and leaves without the environment shaping his choices. The clock beside the piano anchors one object-as-setting moment but doesn't alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient ridge, blooming irises, and warm stone marker provide vivid sensory grounding and constrain Mira's choice—she must find the oldest marker before the monsoon. The dream-space's "impossible colors" and translucent figures are evocative, and the gray mist functions as a spatial antagonist. Monsoon clouds on the horizon supply temporal pressure. The seed's burial in "rich soil" and Mira's bare hands create tactile specificity that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The islet, mist, wet stones, and breezy post-rain air are vivid and consistent. The compass and lace function as micro-setting objects that constrain Marisol's understanding and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (cliff edge, grasses, pocket, palm) remains clear. No occupational depth is required here. The setting supports tone and choices without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mara’s scientific eye (salt deposits, strata of sediment, netting, pipes). Environmental details—dust layers, flood silt, emergent plants—are not decorative; they embody the central question of decay versus transformation and directly charge the final image of dust on her skin. The setting’s altered state after the flood is integral to both plot and theme. This is near top-tier environment work, only just shy of extraordinary constraint-driven stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon, night sky, and frost are rendered with vivid, selective detail that’s firmly filtered through Elena’s sensibility as a glass artist, linking heat, cold, and light throughout. Setting is not mere backdrop: frost patterns literally model the interpretive strategy she applies to the ledger’s gaps, and the final image of wind through stone and cooling glass charges the closing cadence. The burned studio appears mostly in memory, but it too carries tactile specificity that grounds the crime and her loss. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it meaningfully charges perception and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly and economically evoked—“frozen cathedral,” non-fogging glass, frost spirals—and the setting’s wintry, refractive qualities resonate strongly with the story’s emotional and thematic concerns. Details feel filtered through Marina’s sensibilities as a scientist-artist: patterns, microstructures, and light bands all matter to her. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices in a logistical sense, but it does charge the final image of refracted light and emotional mapping. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are high-level and integrated rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater library is vividly imagined and tightly integrated: preservation spells, impossible geometries, and the pressing sea all matter to how Meridian can solve the problem. The setting directly enables the final solution (using folded spaces as soul chambers) and charges the last image of “chambers of rest” between dimensions. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the library’s architecture mirrors the thematic concern with constructed peace. It just stops short of absolute maximality because environmental constraints never force a concrete sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ridge, winter cold, and terra-cotta arbor give a concrete sense of place and isolation, and the sanctions context feels integrated rather than pasted on. The bell as a recurring object effectively charges the arbor as a micro-setting that gathers and focuses communal action. Environmental details (moonlight on tarnished silver, breath in freezing air) support mood without bogging the scene. That said, the setting rarely constrains tactics beyond “we are cut off and cold,” so its influence is more atmospheric than decisively tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight viaduct with wisteria and the tactile camera obscura create a lush, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative.

Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual but remains purposeful and filtered through her professional eye. Setting is a clear strength and supports both action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is vividly particular (named games, dusty prizes) and tightly integrated into action via the key layout and hidden wall panel. Micro-setting details like the piano bench and the counter are not decorative; they shape her tactics and literally locate the vault. The chains function as a bodily “setting” that constrain and define her movements. This all charges the final image of chains falling and hands reaching for seeds, though there’s just a hint of stageiness in the symbolism that keeps it shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken greenhouse, shipwreck ring, aurora-lit forge, and impossible orchard are strikingly specific and tightly woven to Mira’s perception—this is not a postcard but a lived, idiosyncratic environment. Setting details (geothermal vents, barnacle-scarred dome, salt-dark orchard) are filtered through her sensory focus on color-sound and repair, charging the tone and final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain discrete tactical choices, but it decisively charges the closure: the battered, impossible greenhouse becomes a metaphorical extension of her work and body. World rules feel consistent within a lightly speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Emerald Station and the overlapping golden hour/moonlight are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise—the portraits literally depend on angle, location, and time.

Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and recurring objects (jar, flowers, tiles) are grounded in place.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned control room and melting landscape are rendered with precise, purposeful detail—“burnt coffee and oxidized metal,” “meltwater carve new channels through old snow” are both vivid and thematically charged. Setting is tightly tied to character: her professional gaze repurposes lab hardware into glass tools while the thawing exterior mirrors her conceptual focus on transformation. The environment also charges the final image, with the meltwater channels paralleling her “small sanctuary for questions.” This integration of place, weather, and work feels rich and lived-in without lapsing into tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted library beneath an open, star-filled roof is an evocative, tonally apt setting, with “skeletal orange fingers” and rust-scented air grounding the scene. The seashell and UV-lit cast notes work as micro-settings/objects, repeatedly tied to memory and choice. The environment marginally constrains action (stairs, darkness, officers below) but is used more for atmosphere than tactical pressure. It richly supports mood and theme, yet could go one step further in shaping options or risk to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge fort, gale, gray beach, and driftwood shelter are vividly realized and tightly braided with the piece’s mood and ideas. Weather and architecture (cracks, groaning stone, a single hearth) are not just backdrop; they underscore isolation and the contrast between violent noise and the “ambered hush.” The ocean and wind recur to charge the final image (“the wind retell the ocean’s ancient stories”). While the setting doesn’t overtly force tactical choices, it meaningfully shapes tone and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen courtyard at perpetual twilight is vivid and specific: fractal ice on stone, a fountain “that never remembered being liquid,” and shadows moving without a sun create a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment is not just decorative; it underpins the looped-time conceit and frames the ice violin as something that could plausibly “grow” there. The prison/monastery framing and the way the ice hums in response to the music directly charge the final image and theme. Setting, object, and condition (twilight, cold, stasis) all collaborate to make the ending feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The crystal forecourt, rain-washed tiles, and glass chimes create a vivid, specific atmosphere that frames both the opening and closing, and the Memoria Concert Hall feels like a real, distinct place. The environment subtly mirrors the thematic arc (shattered light, scattered evidence, chimes carrying “truth”), and the final image of tiles “like scattered evidence” is strong. However, the setting mostly functions as tonal and symbolic rather than as a concrete constraint on choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden maze and its junctions, marbles, and sensor-laced hedges are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Setting genuinely matters: the maze structure dictates where marbles lie, how she moves, and how the resurgence manifests. The final image—the sun catching cracked marbles amid simultaneous blooming and withering—beautifully charges the theme. A touch more multisensory texture under peak pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: crystalline moths, the xenobiology station, and the magnetic nexus all feel specific and sensorially grounded (“sound like silk dragging across metal,” “triple sunsets”). Details are filtered convincingly through Renna’s technical perspective, with tools and equipment embedded in action rather than listed. The environment materially enables the discovery (moths + station + twilight) and charges the final image of them stirring outside as the humans watch time reconfigured. A slightly wider range of non-visual sensory detail could deepen immersion, but what’s present is already strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The flooded opera house is vivid and specific—water at her knees, submerged stage, orchestra pit, lanterns bending flames—and always filtered through a musician’s eye. Environment actively shapes events: the flood dislodges the program, the water damage creates the coded imagery, and the submerged pit conceals then yields the journal. Spatial and sensory choreography is clear without excess, and the imagery supports the ruinous/liminal tone. The setting also charges the final image, where water, silence, and air merge with her new artistic commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain station, thin air, aurora, snowpack sensors, and ecotone flowers are vivid and highly selective, all clearly filtered through a weather scientist’s gaze. Setting is not decorative: instruments, altitude, and avalanche history directly shape both memory and current options, and the illustration-as-object functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather and light shifts (aurora to dawn to sun) track with emotional progression. A hair more tactile engagement with the physical station during the recalibration beat could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel and junction are vivid and tactile—condensation, rust, the junction rails—and clearly industrial rather than generic “spooky place.” Setting is filtered through her professionalized eye (industrial archaeology, essentially), and the valve wheel operates as a recurring object that charges the final image. The environment constrains mood and tone more than tactical options, but it feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The overgrown library in catacombs is vividly specific and completely entwined with the premise—mushrooming books, roots, and stone all feed the core metaphor of knowledge as compost. Environment actively shapes what is possible (regenerative ecosystem, decaying texts, intrusion of roots) and charges the final image of rain and sky breaking into the catacombs. The recurring objects (the swan, the stone, the shelves) are deeply spatialized and never feel like white-room props. Setting is not just backdrop but the logic and physics of the story’s idea.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The care home on a ridge under ancient oaks, the “hush of dreaming roots,” and the sensory effects of the eclipse give the piece a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting details are selective and purposeful, reinforcing themes of age, memory, and quiet transformation rather than feeling like a tour. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, but the eclipse and terrace gathering clearly frame and charge the central moment. The return to the hush of roots at the end works as a subtle, effective environmental reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The silo library, leaning world, rusted metal walls, and dragon tapestry are vivid, idiosyncratic, and consistently filtered through the historian’s occupational gaze. Setting and objects shape both her capabilities (listening to walls, handling charred pages) and the final image, where the archive and tilted world mutually charge each other. World rules around the displaced axis and failed dreams feel internally consistent without over-explaining. The environment doesn’t quite force specific tactical choices, which is the only thing keeping this from a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Barnacle, Crake Island, and especially the lighthouse are rendered with economical, specific detail (scarred bar, black water, fog, the sweeping beam). Setting and atmosphere support tone and theme, with the lighthouse beam charging the final image as an emblem of open secrets and steady, indifferent revelation. The environment doesn’t much constrain concrete choices in scene—no strong physical pressures—so its role is primarily thematic and textural rather than tactical. Still, the world feels coherent, and the lighthouse-as-setting is meaningfully integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dimensional anchor basement is vividly imagined—breathing walls, shifting distances, and the hum where realities press together—and these details are tightly integrated with the exorcism’s logic. The environment’s rule (stabilizing contradictions) is not just decorative; Micah explicitly uses it as a weapon, and its hum tracks the scene’s tension. The loop pedal and palette operate as tools that further ground the setting at a tactile scale. Overall atmosphere is coherent and tonally aligned with the piece’s quiet, metaphysical horror.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and tightly fused to mood and theme, especially the sense of being “suspended between past and future.” The grandmother’s kitchen is equally concrete in memory, with tactile details (cardamom, porch creak, twilight through lace) that ground abstraction. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does meaningfully guide choice (she selected the spire for the horizon phenomenon) and charges the final image of the spire over the lake. The nautilus functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully chambers time and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: inverted gravity, rain “dripping upward,” the glowing viaduct, and the forty-three-day cycle all feel specific and atmospheric rather than generic. Crucially, the viaduct and the “between the drop and the ripple” window constrain what’s possible and charge the final return to “ordinary rain,” satisfying the object-as-setting gate for high scores. World rules around appearances after storms and the bridge between realities are consistent and learned via action and perception, not infodumps. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment in the climax (beyond the fall) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern, the fabrics, the phonographs, and the seasonal hush are vividly evoked and strongly filtered through a tactile, vibration-aware sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the cavern’s acoustic isolation and muting properties directly enable the backward-music technique and shape Mira’s tactics (weeks of soundproofing, one-by-one pilgrim visits). The broken needle and winter hush both return to charge the final image, giving environment and object real thematic weight. A touch more concrete physical interaction with space under pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The courtyard, weather station boundary, and rogue quarantine zone are vividly and economically rendered, with the environment filtering through Maren’s professional eye. Details like “amber-lit streets,” “ivy climbing the brick walls,” and the recovering wetlands smell all serve mood and theme rather than reading as decorative. The courtyard and pigeon concretely frame her solitude and integrity, and the recovering ecology charges the final image by embodying what’s at stake in the data war. The setting lightly constrains choices (she can act privately here, use pigeons, rely on a fragile network), though physical constraints never pinch as hard as they could.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse of extinct plants is vividly realized and tonally aligned with a mausoleum of loss, from the dead scents to the restoration lamps. Details are specific and filtered through Dalton’s sensibility as a lantern broker, intertwining light, glass, and absence in objects like the vial and the preserved husks. The environment and objects charge the final image (crystal shadows, the greenhouse, the vial in his pocket) even if they don’t overtly constrain physical options. World rules in this subtly speculative setting feel consistent and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto, mineral luminescence, and reality-warped patterns are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Marcus and Elena’s purposes. The environment isn’t just a backdrop: the walls’ shifting signatures embody the beings’ presence and serve as the literal mechanism by which layers of possibility are accessed. The rope functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and links past human desperation to current metaphysical stakes. What keeps this just shy of the top band is that the grotto itself constrains little in terms of concrete options; its influence is mostly conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and deeply functional: the sunken greenhouse, water on the floor, and ring of shipwrecks literally create the trapped resonance she must address. Environmental details are filtered through her acoustic sensitivity (wind patterns, low sustained note, the bowl’s hum), so the place directly shapes options and meaning rather than serving as décor. The shipwreck circle and orchard glass evolve into charged elements at closure (wrecks turned gold, orchard still growing, bowl left as a question). This is one of the story’s strongest craft axes, fully integrated with theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber grotto, bioluminescent deposits, and resinous walls are vivid and thematically apt, lending a tactile, scented atmosphere that feels specific to Maren’s world and profession. Details like the blotter petals and electrical sensations are integrated into action rather than tacked-on description. The setting lightly frames mood and method more than it concretely constrains options, so it charges the tone and imagery without fully governing choice. As a result, the atmosphere is rich and distinctive but not yet leveraged as deeply as it could be for tactical or moral constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Maritime Library terrace and stargazing event are vividly and economically rendered, with the low shelves under open sky and soft lights creating a memorable, specific atmosphere. Details are filtered through Marlena’s state—her cautious exuberance and sense of stepping into a new space—rather than reading like a neutral tour. The stars overhead and dockworker photo under starlight subtly echo the theme of unseen labor without straining symbolism. The environment doesn’t much constrain choices tactically, but it strongly supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly and economically rendered, with imagery that feels both fantastical and coherent (“glass-like trees refracting light into prismatic shadows”). Setting details are filtered through the sculptor’s sensibilities (materials, surfaces, light) and later constrain/enable choices—she uses reeds from home and crystalline fibers from the orchard to literalize her grafting into place. The final image at the arbor, suffused with dawn light, is charged by earlier environmental description and serves as a strong setting-inflected closure. A slight constraint is that the world’s rules remain mostly atmospheric rather than pressing tactical limits on behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop canals, leaning towers, suspended cages, and the sleeping giant’s transformed city are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s observing mind. Setting directly shapes action (gondola travel, canals only present during the giant’s nap, the narrowing Throat as a spatial choke point) rather than remaining decorative. The recurring physical anchors—the pendant, the frozen/flowing water, the swaying cages—charge the final images, especially the premature echo of her oar stroke. World rules around time, gravity, and sound feel coherent and learned in motion, not dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard is vivid, strange, and fully integrated—the dripping stalactites, glowing fruit, and mosaic stones are not postcard details but the literal machinery of the ritual and his realization. Time embodied as stalactite drops and “apples that tasted of patience” elegantly fuses setting with theme. The final image—him staying until dawn, with fruit glowing brighter and the flower as “small proof”—relies entirely on this environment’s logic. The setting constrains his choices (he needs this place to perform the experiment) and deeply charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library is vividly and efficiently rendered—crawl spaces, pipe chases, YA and children’s sections—always filtered through Maren’s survivalist familiarity. The “sapphire hush,” blue dawn, and contrast with the chaotic city outside create a strong atmosphere that aligns with theme. Setting directly shapes options (hiding, caching, watching through grates) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The tape fragment as an object is nicely specific, though its physical properties don’t constrain action beyond triggering memory.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nursery, mossy trellis, rain, and wild back corner are vividly rendered and filtered through Marcus’s professional eye, with weather and plant-training details reinforcing his control vs. wildness conflict. The recurring trellis/tree/leaf imagery nicely mirrors his internal shift and returns in the final image. However, the environment mostly reflects or frames his choices rather than constraining tactics in a way that would push this into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal island is richly realized and functionally integral: the drowning/resurrecting causeway, rain trails, and ash-gray sand all constrain movement, time, and what can be found. Environmental details like corroded batteries, a child’s boot, and the emptied sea tactically and thematically charge choices (where she sets up, how they discover the basin, the urgency before tide). Weather and water rhythms shape both action and symbolism without feeling overdetermined. The world’s macro-rules around the “water wars” are left impressionistic, but at this length that’s an effective, not weakening, choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly and economically rendered—harmonic stalactites, prisms, cave pearls, luminescent fungi—and these details are not mere decoration; they directly host and modulate the magical phenomena. The environment shapes what can happen (sound as medium, crystals singing with the shadows, the pearl humming and blazing) and is inseparable from the story’s premise and final image. The closing sense of the cave singing “a new song” charged by the inhabiting forces gives the setting an active role in closure. It stops just short of perfection because Vera doesn’t make any concrete tactical choices constrained by the space itself.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ivory Harbor, the weeping limestone cliffs, and the sea-mist are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Maris’s professional gaze. Setting is not decorative: ocean spray is literally required for her visions, and shifting currents and silted channels are what she must decode, so environment actively shapes tactics and meaning. The harbor tower and the mounted valve at the end function as charged loci that crystallize the new order. A slightly broader sense of the town beyond fishermen and tower could deepen texture, but at this length the selectivity feels purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: cracks as arrows, fog that “reveals,” impossible architecture, and the fortress of “crystallized silence” all feel integrated with the premise rather than decorative. Environmental details consistently filter through Mara’s mapper sensibility, and the micro-setting (ticket punch, cracks, stars) directly charges the final image of a self-drawn map. The mist and starlit vault not only create atmosphere but also signal the shift into an altered rule-set that justifies the metaphysical fortress. This category is a major strength, bordering on publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tower, cliff, wind, and whale songs are vivid and tightly integrated with the premise: the architecture literally functions as the recording device and shapes what’s possible. The setting’s physical openness to “whale songs inland” is not just scenic but causal, and the tile as part of the tower’s floor charges the final image. Environmental details consistently mirror her interior state (erosion, resonance, isolation) without feeling like mere symbol. The ending is strongly grounded in place, which helps it resonate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“prismatic escondite,” auroras, seven dimensional faults, impossible beach—and consistently filtered through Vesper’s awareness of cosmic geometry. Environmental conditions (converging faults, magnetic fields, solar storm) are not just backdrop but the very mechanism of the plot and closure. The worldbuilding stays coherent and evocative without devolving into static cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The funeral home prep room is specific and functional: formaldehyde smell, tools, drainage, and the high windows at dawn all shape both action (the SD card recovery) and tone. The ink pot doubles as a micro-setting object that constrains Mira’s thinking and charges the final image. Occupational detail feels plausible without bogging the scene in procedure. The environment’s pressure is moral and procedural rather than physical, but it’s tightly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly specific and fully integrated: the lamp, workshop, silent town, and bonsai labyrinth all shape what the protagonist can do and how she understands time. The bonsai maze, in particular, evolves on the page (dawn blossoms, noon transformations) and directly frames both the invented girl’s story and the ending act of hiding the history. Environmental details are filtered through her temporal obsession (frequency shifts, angles of light, “compressed” spaces), giving the world a distinctive, character-shaped texture. The final image of the history aging within the labyrinth is charged by all this prior environmental grounding, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The port and container labyrinth are richly realized and consistently filtered through her perception: “aluminum canyon walls,” barnacled pilings, tide levels tied to access and eavesdropping. Setting is not just backdrop; the maze affords concealment, channels voices, and literally houses her. The rhythms of tide and shift work structure when she can gather stories, giving the environment real tactical weight. This is just shy of top-tier because the setting doesn’t quite impose a hard constraint or crisis at the end—it frames her vocation rather than tightening a choice there.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, cliff, and twilight sky are vividly and economically rendered, with details like the collapsed dome, dust over star charts, and constant wind doing double duty for mood and theme. The setting also functionally matters: the specific acoustics and cliff-top liminality explain why this is the place where vibrations collect and the experiment can work. The recurring objects-as-setting (seashell, cello, compass rose) are tightly integrated into her actions and the final image. A slightly clearer sense of physical constraint (e.g., danger of the cliff or ruin) could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The raft-city carnival is specific and memorable—platforms, ropes, Ferris wheel undersides, hall of mirrors—so the world feels more than generic “future slum” dressing. Details often connect to action (graffiti under tourist noses, stone chip in pocket), integrating setting with character and plot. However, sensory texture is still primarily visual; other senses and more tactile use of the decaying infrastructure under pressure would deepen atmosphere. The foundation stone chip functions as a micro-setting object that charges the ending image nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lunar setting is vividly evoked—the regolith, the terminator, the temperature swing, the crater’s geology—and consistently filtered through Maya’s trained eye. Environmental constraints (vacuum, extreme temperature shifts, sunrise timing, crater slopes) directly shape tactics and lend plausibility to the chemistry-based method. The recurring images of the summit, crater floor, and dawn light culminate in a charged final tableau of Valentina “golden, eternal, and hers.” World rules stay coherent, with technical detail serving mood and stakes rather than reading like exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is excellent: the misty harbor, old rail depot, and water basin are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s non-visual perception. The environment and tools (especially the basin and light) are not just backdrop but operational, directly shaping her diagnostic method. The fog and ship sounds deepen atmosphere and theme but don’t much constrain choices beyond mood. Strong, publication-ready atmosphere, just shy of the very top band because the wider depot/harbor context doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The outpost, frozen lake, rust, and condensation are vivid, tightly integrated, and always filtered through Mara’s purpose and profession. Environment genuinely constrains and guides choice: the outpost’s placement, the rust stains, and especially the condensation patterns are not decorative but functional tools for her discovery. Weather and cold are present not as clichés but as operators (ice, mist, exhalation) that mirror and shape her thinking. The final image of the lake and the water “remembering” is fully charged by prior environmental detail, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: Millhaven’s empty shops, weeds through cobblestones, wind moving “like something searching” all build a vivid, coherent mood. The archway, cobblestones, chapel, and bells are not just decorative; they’re the physical channels for the magic and frame the threshold theme. Sensory detail is selective yet rich, and the environment evolves with the action (from “wild hush” to “held possibility”). The only thing keeping this just under 9 is that the environment shapes method more than it constrains live choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater temple and trench are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“coral-encrusted pillars that rose like bones”) that establish mood and spatial logic without bogging the pace. The environment constrains tactics—Marina must operate via submersible arms and work within alien technology—and the temple’s collapse at the end materially shapes the closure image. The crystal vial and preservation field function as micro-setting elements that charge the final moment. This is atmosphere that meaningfully matters to choice and outcome, not postcard scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef is vivid and specific, with copper-stained walls, confessional lattice, and the sea’s tide all tightly integrated. Setting meaningfully shapes circumstance—the failed escape, bodies on rocks, isolation, and the warden’s punitive mercy—and the copper light and lattice charge the final image. Details are filtered well through Marcus’s obsessions (hush, confession), avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. The environment could constrain a present-tense choice more directly, but even as-is it strongly supports mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse, endless night, and impossible fruits are sensuously rendered and clearly filtered through Elara’s lived familiarity rather than tourist cataloging. The environment does more than decorate: the liminal greenhouse-space is precisely what enables contact with the bride and defines the story’s metaphysics. The carved bead as a placed object at the heart of the greenhouse also charges the final image. A slight constraint is that weather/fields time (“winter-cracked”) is atmospheric more than tactical, but the overall atmosphere-work is strong enough to overcome that.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The red canyon, emptied tide pools, hanging wharf, and carved labyrinth are vivid and specific, and the physical environment clearly constrains action (the labyrinth only walkable when the tide pools empty). Setting and atmosphere are tightly interwoven with theme—the canyon’s erosion mirrors the labyrinth’s disuse, and the final image of walkers “sewing new stories into ancient stone” is charged by place. Details are filtered through Mara’s textile-weaver sensibility (threads, weaving, channels), lending coherence. This is near-publishable level scene-setting with minimal excess.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard-catacomb setting is vivid and thematically charged: roots snaking through bones, bone-rich earth feeding trees, the pear-root chamber, and the displaced sundial all feel specific and lived. Environment isn’t mere backdrop; it explicitly embodies the life/death interweaving that the story thematizes and literally houses the ancestors and the sundial that returns above ground. The final scene with the sundial among wild trees, branches casting “living” shadows, shows the setting directly charging the last image. A slightly more tactile sense of Mira physically working in that space under constraint could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The golden arcade, stained glass satellites, tessellated floor, and hopscotch chalk create a vivid, specific environment that feels lived-in and thematically charged. Setting is filtered through Maya’s priorities (history of the post office, dawn quiet, the arcade “belonging” to the pseudonym creators), not as a tourist catalog. Crucially, the dawn emptiness and architecture enable secrecy and the children’s codes, and the ebony clipboard plus chalked floor recur to charge the final image of her writing new codes. This environment shapes what’s possible and clearly inflects the tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn light, and especially the eternal candle create a textured, distinctive environment filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Setting details are not just scenic; the candle’s light literally allows her to see the pattern through the fabric and recurs in the final image, charging the ending. The atmosphere of fading blue walls and echoing silence subtly reflects the theme of overlooked labor and unseen conspiracies. The environment constrains less at the level of physical options than symbolic insight, but it remains tightly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth, silvered brackish water, and cathedral shard create a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels tactile and strange without over-explaining its rules. Setting details are well integrated into action (window frame between trunks, condensation revealing messages, spirits’ song forming a path back). The environment and recurring objects charge the final movement rather than functioning as postcard description. Constraints on choice are mostly emotional/ritual rather than physical, but the place still feels like a lived magical ecology.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “mist-clad atrium at twilight,” glass ceiling, and fountain mist create a liminal, almost fugue-like recovery space that suits the anesthetic haze and themes of memory and loss. Details like the brain coral’s “intricate whorls” and the multilingual scribbles on the cast are specific and filtered through Maya’s translator gaze. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it does shape tone and plausibly explains the slowed, reflective tempo. The recurring coral object effectively charges the final image as “memory made solid” between them.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ruined orchard and centuries-old fog are vivid, specific, and thematically integrated; the stone trees and “spilled milk” fog shape tone and plausibly constrain action. The fresco fragment, projectors, and fog as canvas recur and charge the final images, especially the girl’s hand and the idea of old soil bearing new light. Environmental detail is selective and filtered through Mira’s artistic eye, avoiding cataloging while building a tangible place. The setting meaningfully frames the story’s stakes and final image, so the environment is doing real structural work, not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sound wave garden is richly realized and tightly integrated: hedges redirect sound, pathways hum, fountains whisper, and the walls literally “open sonically,” all of which are used in active beats rather than as backdrop. The environment shapes what’s possible—her only way to test reality is through vocal notes the garden transforms into questions/answers, and the final charged image depends on this acoustical world. The hobo nickel and murals function as micro-settings that further constrain her options and frame thresholds. Description remains economical and filtered through her professional eye, avoiding mere postcard tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse and gardens are sensorially rich (“smelled of soil and beetle wings,” condensation-fogged glass, humidity) and tightly bound to function: Chen’s off-grid greenhouse enables the conspiracy; community gardens become both camouflage and library. Environmental elements recur and evolve—the gourd rattle’s sound, the climbing vines, the surveillance towers blinking outside—to charge the final contrast between monitored city and wild-coded resistance. Details feel filtered through Malachi’s intellect and the entomologist setting, avoiding generic dystopian backdrops. Setting constraints directly shape tactics, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shell-in-the-dust-plains setting is vivid, original, and integrated at every level: as address, sanctuary, and literal soil where the bulb is planted. Environmental details (starlight through the spiral, wind threading chambers, the deepest chamber’s soil and collected rain) are filtered through the poet’s sensibility and never feel like static backdrop. The space constrains choices—this is where they plant, where postcards gather, where rest might finally be approached—and it charges the closing image of the bulb “waiting in darkness.” A slight further use of the shell’s physical limitations to pressure tactics could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The opal library, floating above clouds, and the glass orchids create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong, specific imagery woven through action rather than static description. Environmental details (wind, chimes, opalescent walls, archival alcoves) are consistently filtered through Miren’s caretaker perspective. The tools and objects of the setting—the wind chime, phonograph, glass discs, and orchids—directly constrain tactics and charge the final image of the library “singing.” A slight bias toward visual description over other senses keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The extinct language archive, single lamp, and rows of sealed containers provide an evocative, thematically apt environment that feels lived-in rather than generic. The glass ink well functions as a micro-setting/object, constraining gesture and anchoring their exchanges; its reweighted final image (from frozen tear to prism) charges the ending. The archive itself could exert a bit more direct pressure on their choices, but the atmosphere is strong and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater is vividly rendered through heat, dust, stone “breathing,” and terraced architecture, and these details recur to frame both process and resolution. The environment meaningfully shapes access (floodgate chamber in the orchestra, channels in the caldera) and charges the final image of the building “breathing” as communities reconcile. Professional perception (toolbox, channels, valve) intersects well with the volcanic setting. Description is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bookshop attic is vivid and specific—crossbeam, skylight, wire-and-wood pigeon architecture, ruined hymnal—and it’s filtered well through Elena’s habits and profession. The environment constrains and shapes action (ladder, beam, pigeons, messages) and charges the final image as she watches dust motes and declares, “Now we see who comes back.” Recurring objects (pigeons, shoeboxes, skylight dust) are not mere décor; they mirror Elena’s state without feeling over-signaled. A slightly stronger sense of the city beyond the attic might enrich the contrast, but is not necessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifting prism terrace, oak boards, and echoing corn maze are vivid, specific, and suffused with mood; the environment feels like a liminal architecture built from her psyche and history. Setting is not postcard decoration: the salvaged floorboards and dissolving terrace explicitly charge the final choice to cross the shimmering edge. World rules are consistent in their dream-logic, and the scene never lapses into white-room abstraction. The environment constrains action symbolically rather than materially, but it’s deeply integrated into the story’s emotional geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater dome, drowned ruins, and bioluminescent life are vivid and specific, with professional detail (migration patterns, research facility history) filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Setting and atmosphere are tightly bound to theme—the city as living map, ruins as architecture of belonging—and the observation dome literally frames the final image. The environment subtly constrains them (no real sunrise, observation-only relationship to the ruins) but isn’t pushed to create harder choices. Still, the atmosphere and specificity are strong enough for high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The iridescent cave and geode walls are vividly rendered and used functionally as screens for the transliterated emotions, not just backdrop. The silver vines, seeds, and pulsing crystal integrate setting with worldbuilding and theme (memory, paths, and preservation) in a coherent way. Environmental detail is selective and filtered through Calla’s work-focused gaze, sustaining mood without dragging. Still, the setting rarely constrains options or tactics; it charges the imagery more than the choices.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arcade is vivid, tactile, and conceptually integrated: pillars, tidal pools, and starlight all inform the kinds of miracles she can orchestrate (e.g., the bioluminescent plankton photo, the time pressure from the returning sea). The environment genuinely constrains choice via the tide and shapes the social flow of tourists. The chess bishop also functions as a micro-setting object, charging the final image with “diagonal truth.” This is very strong, though one more moment where the physical risk of the tide impinges on her actions could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight garden is vivid and particular—silver fruit that never ripen, flowers off-cycle from any sun, time pooling like quicksilver—and strongly anchored in Kael’s perception. Crucially, it is not just a backdrop: its liminal rules enable moonstone dust to appear and frame the chrysalis metaphor that reconfigures meaning at the end. Environmental detail is economical yet atmospheric, and the garden’s twilight and stars charge the final image (“The stars witnessed”) in a way that feels earned. A small step up would require the setting to constrain her options more concretely, not just symbolically.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly realized—mist, pilings, prism atrium, and visible bay water under glass all feel tactile and visually precise, and details are filtered through a glazier’s priorities. Crucially, the environment isn’t just decorative: the angled panes, glass floor, dawn light, and water’s proximity are what make the noctilucent patterns and his argument possible, and the looming demolition charges the space. The final image of him walking back through Pearl Bay “carrying illumination in his satchel” is meaningfully tied to this environment. A touch more non-visual sensory texture (sound, temperature, smell) under peak beats could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit ridge, burned earth, Douglas fir, and valley lights are vivid and specific, with a firefighter’s gaze giving them weight. The ridge being the site of his father’s death and the box’s final resting place charges the environment symbolically and emotionally. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices in a tactical sense, so it reads more as charged backdrop than active pressure. Still, the final image of scars in moonlight atop that ridge has real atmospheric power.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tide-polished grotto, three arches, and refracted light are vivid and thematically integrated; the environment literally structures the parallel timelines and the multi-arch views. The brass gauge and the decorations-as-patterns function as micro-setting that constrain tactics and enable the climax. World rules around the grotto’s geometry and the gauge’s repurposed function feel consistent and are shown rather than over-explained. Setting does real work in the final image (all her selves walking toward the light), charging the closure with spatial and visual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: ivy as refugee flora, the abandoned manor, the acoustic equipment, and the climate-shifted world all feel specific and texturally rich. Environment and object-as-setting (ivy, corridor, fireplace, negatives) are filtered through Mara’s acoustic bias, so description rarely feels generic. The ivy and corridor literally and symbolically charge the final image (ivy parting, corridor sighing), giving the environment an active role in closure. This is one of the piece’s standout strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly rendered and fully integrated: the echoing terrace, prism parapet, wet flagstones, and spring rain all feel specific and sensorial. Environment and recurring objects (prism parapet, mirrors, bells) actively shape the ritual’s rules—time window, light quality, echo effect—and charge the final image of her packing up the mirrors. The terrace’s acoustics and the prismatic light are not postcard garnish; they are the physical conditions her method depends on. The closing return to dusk, bells, and prism-lit mirrors anchors theme and mood without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terrace, valley, twin moons, altar, urns, and seeds are all vivid and purpose-driven, not decorative. The environment and celestial timing actively constrain choices (this place, this night) and charge the ending image of planted seeds under departing moons. Mirena’s clipboard functions as a micro-setting object, holding history and altering how she engages the present. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual (e.g., air, stone, sound) could make the atmosphere even more immersive, but what’s here is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The salt flat, purple-bruised sky, and encroaching thunder are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marcus’s engineered relationship to water and absence. Environment is not just backdrop: the salt, the cracks as map, and the coming rain all directly charge the premise and the ending image. Weather and landscape materially affect meaning by threatening to erase the costly cartography just as the echo is freed. The specificity and integration are excellent, though a tactile interaction or constraint at the climax could push it to an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The silver courtyard, fresh snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly realized and consistently returned to, with details like patterns traced in snow and geometric light-maps integrated into action rather than static description. The environment supports the mood and magic system and charges the final image (guards at dawn, courtyard subtly altered). While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain choices—she is never blocked or endangered by it—it does function as a charged stage that transforms meaning by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome and bar are vividly sketched—the curved walls, mismatched furniture, and spotlighted stage support the “laboratory” atmosphere and the sense of marginal spaces. The campfire story stick functions as a charged micro-setting object, moving from heirloom tool to onstage prop to audience totem, and it decisively charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and apt rather than overdone, and the environment mirrors the theme of strange, echoing uncertainty without blunt symbolism. The physical space doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto above the clouds is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated—moss-thick walls, colonizing moths, and impossible sky all shape the piece’s atmosphere and the idea of an unseen memorial. Environmental detail is filtered believably through Sera’s esoteric realist gaze, and the aerial isolation charges the final image of a signal “no one would see.” World rules (floating grotto, high canopy) are consistent and legible. Setting is more atmospheric than constraining of tactics, but it meaningfully charges the stakes and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly rendered and integral: the cold, the rope, and the lights aren’t just backdrops but tools that enable her process and transform into the final “sound made visible” image. Technical details (braided rope code, punched cards, bronze casting) are concrete and feel lived-in rather than touristic. The environment directly charges the ending, where aurora light through the cards becomes the medium of preservation. A touch more tactile interaction with the harshness of the cold could deepen the sense of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, economical, and thematically charged: the vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, roots like “fingers of some sleeping giant,” and storm-turned canopy all create a strong atmosphere. Weather and environment do affect action—the storm imposes a time constraint, rain falls through the ceiling, and the forest “forgetting” the storm mirrors the world’s indifference to individual realizations. While the bunker and forest don’t heavily constrain tactical options, they do charge the final image and the metaphysics of paths choosing walkers. The specificity and integration are strong, though not quite at the level where environment directly forecloses major choices.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace is vivid and specific—ziggurat terraces, salvaged solar panels, lattice windows—and consistently filtered through an astronomer’s priorities and scarcity. Setting details (candle stubs, precious paper, old star chamber) feel lived-in and subtly constrain her choices and methods. The environment powerfully mirrors the thematic liminality between eras and between human understanding and the cosmos, and the final ascent toward the telescope is charged by that space. A slightly greater sense of the environment pushing back on her (e.g., physical discomfort, political presence) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanctuary “between the folds of reality,” its breathing, translucent walls, and imposed silence create a distinct, purposeful atmosphere that mirrors and amplifies the internal work. The environment isn’t mere backdrop: it visualizes other versions of the moment and childhood scenes, and its silence makes Marcus’s eventual sobs feel like a literal and symbolic rupture. The music box functions as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image. The one limitation is that the sanctuary could more explicitly constrain options or tactics (it mostly supports rather than pressures), but it still meaningfully charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ruined orchard district, the centuries-long fog, and the interplay of frost, glass, and mist are vivid and deeply integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment constrains and enables tactics (fog as both obstacle and starfield; mirrors and silvered glass as specialized tools; burial in the orchard as the only fitting resting place). World rules around fog and dreams feel internally consistent and are revealed through Eliane’s behavior. The setting also charges the final image, where glass-mountain-like dangers “dissolve into memory,” reweighting the earlier threats.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral orchard is vivid and sensorially rich (“ripening pears and old incense,” roots in stone, light in rafters) and strongly filtered through Mara’s awe and fear of height. The environment constrains action (the perilous beams where they must meet) and supports theme (wild growth above rigid religious architecture, Guild vs. organic care). Tools, bottles, fruit, and beams are woven into movement and dialogue rather than feeling postcard-like. The final image of apples ripening in cathedral light concretely charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astral orchard, greenhouse dome, lonely asteroid, and cramped bathroom are vivid and selectively rendered, with strong images like “silver fruit bloom backward through time” and “breath forming crystals in the thin atmosphere.” Setting is not postcard-only: the tree’s carved bark and the cameo’s physical fit directly drive the climax, and the bathroom functions as a reliable thinking tool. The final return to the mirror under the asteroid’s “eternal stars” charges the thematic realization. Slightly more tactile interaction with the environment under pressure could push this into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Codex Mountain as a labyrinthine bookstore with temporal and linguistic rules is richly imagined and tightly woven into the story’s logic. Details like the Philosophy-section pocket dimension, the Cartography of Hours, and the mountain that “provided, but only if asked in proper conjugations” feel specific and lived in. The environment does shape tactics—Mira uses the mountain’s grammar, shelves, and diary as tools—though the setting rarely corners her into hard choices. Overall, the atmosphere is distinctive and consistent, charging the final “symphonic architecture” image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Celestine and foggy bay are vividly realized, with selective details (carousel horses, groaning timbers, wool-thick fog) that mirror the liminal identity stakes. The emerald card and the garden of forgotten names function as charged micro-settings, with the card especially reweighting the final image when it “falls” and its purpose ends. Environment constrains options—she can only wander, not depart—and the fog/garden dynamic becomes the vehicle for the decisive transition. Sensory texture is rich without feeling like a tourist catalog, consistently filtered through Isla’s obsession with identity and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The clock tower and impossible archive room are vivid, specific, and filtered through Marin’s occupational eye, with tactile details like gears, pendulum shafts, and flickering boxes of documents. The ceremonial rope functions as a micro-setting object that constrains action at the climax. World rules around the door’s periodic appearance and the architectural impossibility are consistent and legible. The environment shapes options without ever feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: harmonic chambers, fossilized wave patterns, and energy beings all shape what is possible and how she works. Details like ice crack patterns, quartz-lined geode, and “lightning caught in stone” are specific, sensorial, and filtered through her acoustic bias. Environment constrains choice (she must go deeper where their presence is dimmer; she uses ice and mineral structures as instruments), and those same elements charge the final image of quiet taking root in stone. It stops just short of a 9 because the environment could exert even stronger logistical pressure on tactics or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass humming pavilion, the wasteland, the thistle seeds, and the star-mapped sky are vivid and integrated, not decorative. Environment actively matters: the hum interacts with the shard of hush, the glass walls and seeds echo the theme of fragile persistence, and the tower’s isolation shapes Mera’s options and mindset. The setting’s rules feel consistent and are learned through her interaction rather than infodump. The final image of the pavilion humming in agreement with the converging stars is strongly charged by everything we’ve seen.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: solid fog, stormlight, crystal columns, and the observatory above clouds all directly shape Maris’s methods, temporality, and emotional state. Weather and environment constrain choice—the storm enables hidden inscriptions, the fog’s moods mandate urgency, and the whispering crystals continuously color perception. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with sound (“hummed softly,” “whispered louder”) and light doing heavy thematic work. The final image—standing among “whispering monuments” at dawn—feels inseparable from this environment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The blooming fortress, moonflowers, mosaic, and starless night are all sensuously rendered and filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a “light” professional. Crucially, setting is not just backdrop: the mosaic provides the core instruction, the tower enables her tactic, the night without stars sharpens the stakes, and the closing image of the fortress “truly bloomed” reweights earlier details. Environmental texture stays consistent and purposeful without lapsing into catalog. This is strong enough for elite publication, though one more moment where physical constraints (wind, structure, crowd space) actively alter her choices could have pushed it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto, tide pools, stars, and specific creatures (hermit crab) are vivid and tightly filtered through Mei’s professional gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop; the intertidal environment directly structures the metaphor of threshold-living and charges the final sense of “the pause” and the turning tide. Details evolve with the emotional stakes (hermit crab finally committing as Mei does). The environment’s rules—tides advancing and withdrawing—quietly but decisively shape the story’s logic and ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The worldbuilding is vivid and purposeful: bunkers, inversion gravity, the xenial trellis, cloud farmers, and the breathing sky garden all feel integrated rather than decorative. Environmental constraints—gravity inversion and the need to tie herself off, the vertical trellis, the flower’s location—shape what Lina can do and when. The contrasting settings (bunkers vs. trellis above the clouds) charge the ending thematically. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through Lina’s attention to textures of silence rather than generic scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drifting prism terrace, layered soundscape, and storm glass are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mara’s operational lens. Setting is not decorative: the altitude, sound behavior, prisms, and gondola architecture all define what her job is and how passengers’ transitions work. Environmental details evolve with the scene—the whistle, echo, prisms, and wind all register in the decibel readings and emotional shifts. The only thing holding it below a perfect score is that the environment constrains mood and practice more than it forces a concrete tactical choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the kaleidoscopic waterfall, circuit-barked trees, and palimpsest walls all reinforce the fusion of nature, tech, and memory. The walls and mural are not mere backdrop—they supply the method of discovery and literally open into the stairway. World rules (waterfall as data, orchard as compressed wisdom) are learned through observation and action rather than exposition dumps. While the environment could constrain her more directly, it still meaningfully shapes the path and charges the final image of the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ashen sanctuary, starlight, and solitary gate are vivid, coherent, and thematically loaded without feeling like generic apocalypse décor. The doorknocker, ash, and threshold all function as micro-setting elements that constrain how characters move and what choices are available (e.g., crossing the ash line, placing the phone on burned ground). The environment clearly mirrors and inflects internal states while remaining tactile. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond the visual would deepen embodiment further.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, tactile, and thematically apt, with the glowing fungi echoing the story’s quantum/biological hybridity; the final image of them “shimmering with quantum possibility” nicely charges the ending. World rules about concepts becoming physical are integrated into setting details (shards, residue) rather than dumped. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond providing the threshold locus, so it functions more as atmospheric frame than active pressure. Even so, the recurring use of the cellar and light is strong enough to elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sepia reading room, amber light, dust, and gramophone create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the story’s tonal aims, and “standing waves” literally use the room’s acoustics as mechanism rather than decor. The environment constrains choice: the curved walls, placement of panels, and bolted gramophone are essential to decoding the safe. The final image of Mara in the deepening evening, with golden shadows pooling, is charged by all that has happened. A slight overreliance on visual/sepia palette keeps it just shy of the very top tier, but the integration of space and action is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical greenhouse and endless night are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her alchemist-warrior perspective (copper pears, mercury plums, hourglass fruit). Setting is not postcard: the greenhouse as a lab and refuge, the apple tree, and the glass panels all function in action beats (where she traces patterns, presses her palm, plucks the apple). The final revaluation of “endless night” as a canvas elegantly charges the environment with thematic weight. A slight limitation is the relative dominance of visual imagery over other senses, but it doesn’t harm clarity or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The basement file room, dust, lamplight, and the physicality of folders are vivid, selective, and tightly filtered through Sarah’s archivist gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop; the room’s forgotten corners and dust strata embody the theme of unknown histories and directly shape what she can discover. The button as recurring object is spatially and symbolically integrated, charging the final image. Sensory balance and historical texture feel precise without touristic over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    The auric lagoon, bioluminescent water, and carved stone embankment with rain-grooves create a striking, specific environment that feels both tactile and uncanny. Setting directly shapes action—the puddle reflections reveal a map, the stone depression accepts the key, and the lagoon provides Mira’s escape route and charges the final image. Details are well-filtered through Mira’s goals rather than touristic, and the contrast between erased villages and military-zone propaganda deepens atmosphere. The only slight limitation is that non-visual senses are less exploited than they could be, though not to the story’s detriment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, selective, and thematically loaded: foggy harbor, mossed path, jagged opening, radiant grotto, and the prism all feel concrete and sensorially rich. Environment meaningfully affects action—the grotto’s acoustics and the prism’s geometry are what make “negative space” tactics possible. Details are filtered through a musician’s ear and an inheritor’s memory, which keeps description from feeling like a tourist catalogue. A touch more tactile constraint (physical risk, space limitations) could push it even higher, but as-is the place is strongly alive and integrated with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, upward-falling seeds, bone-colored clouds, and moss growth patterns create a vivid, coherent ecosystem that feels particular to this story. Setting is not postcard-like: the environment generates the core mechanics (seed sorting, leaf transformations, moss messages) and charges the final image when the arbor blooms with color. Details are filtered through Miren’s professional and mystical attentions, keeping the world grounded in her priorities. The rules of this uncanny place remain consistent and are revealed through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conservatory, fountain, and subterranean cavern are vividly realized with tactile, specific imagery (“glass panels clouded with decades of grime,” “rainbow fractals” in the spray). Setting is tightly tied to action: ashes conceal the rose; the carved “VERITAS SUBTER” directs her to pry the stone; the waterfall chamber’s niches of clocks literalize the pattern. Environmental details feel filtered through Ellis’s technical and observational mindset rather than touristic listing. The recurring objects (clocks, fountain, compass rose) also charge the final image in the workshop, where the rose functions as a micro-setting talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rain-washed foundry and forge are vividly and economically rendered, with atmospheric details like dripping rafters and slick floors doing strong tonal work. The zodiac coin and golden ash integrate setting and object into the magic system rather than feeling like decorative props. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain action (Mira could arguably do this in any workshop with a forge), the recurrence of rain, metal, and gold culminates in a charged final image of cleansing that doesn’t erase scars. Overall, setting is specific, coherent, and meaningfully braided with the story’s mood and images.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Echo Gorge, the hidden sunrise, and the canyon acoustics are vividly and economically rendered, and the setting meaningfully underpins the premise of confessions trapped by echoes. The harp and crocodile tooth function as micro-settings/tools that shape Mara’s options and charge the final movements. Environment and objects are filtered through Mara’s professional eye, so the detail selection feels purposeful rather than touristic. The gorge could constrain choices even more explicitly under pressure, but as is, it solidly supports tone, logic, and thematic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ultraviolet forest is richly specific and consistently filtered through Kira’s altered perception; details like bioluminescent bark that responds to movement and tears feel both strange and functional. The environment doesn’t just decorate—it triggers trauma surges, offers a responsive system for her “equations,” and charges the final image of walking back to the non-glowing world. World rules around the forest’s responsiveness stay coherent and are learned through action. The integration of setting and theme is high-level and near-indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s market in the sky, the spires, the paintings, and the lighthouse lens create a vivid, coherent world filtered through Mira’s professional perception. Details like “bottled starlight and crystallized memories” are specific and tonally apt rather than generic fantasy garnish. The environment is not just backdrop: the market supplies the crucial artifact, and the lens plus paintings function as a micro-setting where the work of translation happens. The recurring lens object charges the final image nicely, though the vertical, precarious architecture does not materially constrain choices beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office, elevator shaft, and crawlspace are vividly rendered and filtered through Marcus’s technical eye, which gives the setting specificity and function. The environment meaningfully shapes action (he must work through the ceiling, the barrel is literally embedded in the building) and charges the final “building exhaled” image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, never devolving into a catalogue. This could only happen in this kind of faded, vertical, secret-keeping space.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass orchard floating on a cloud-sea, crystalline trees bearing “fruits of compressed knowledge,” and ephemeral frost patterns all feel vivid, specific, and thematically charged. Setting is not postcard dressing: the transparent floors over the cloud-sea, the frost messages, and the ripening glass fruits shape how knowledge behaves and directly charge the final image of Margritte documenting patterns at dawn. World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than infodump. This is near-exemplary environmental integration, just shy of the very top band because setting constrains mood and meaning more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    The baroque asteroid and temporal storms are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and meaning: the décor, mirrors, carved stone panels, and auroral time-streams all shape what Matthias can do and know. Environmental rules (storms, mirror feedback, shard remembering light) are consistent and drive his tactics (covering mirrors, waiting out storms, using the shard). The setting mirrors his internal state—ornate, emptied, haunted—and the final image of shard at mirror depends on this environment’s specific properties. Worldbuilding feels both lush and economical, with no white-room moments and no gratuitous cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly bound to character—spiral stairs into a resonance chamber, violin-curved walls, tools singing in perfect fifths. Details are filtered through Cornelius’s craft-obsessed perception, giving the world a coherent sonic and tactile logic. The chamber and its acoustics are not just backdrop; they participate in his method by amplifying his humming into “manifest restoration,” charging the final image of music braiding below. World rules feel consistent and self-contained, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly realized and character-filtered, with rain-scents, limestone quarries, and the subterranean lagoon all rendered through Mara’s sensory and professional bias. The lagoon and “resonant hush” are not just backdrop; they define what she can collect, what she must leave, and they charge the final image. Environmental details (weeping stone, interference patterns on the water, “stone patience”) integrate seamlessly with theme and action. The world feels specific and constraining without any white-room gaps or tourist listing.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vividly realized—the gray smear of the coastal road, the storm, the stone archway, and later the specific beach—filtered through Iris’s sculptor sensibility. The environment directly shapes action: the storm forces her into the archway, which houses the slide, and the later beach is located via the slide’s landscape logic rather than technology. The recurring archway and storm-light charge the thematic core around weight, structure, and “where the storm-light hit at equinox.” A slight weakness is that once she reaches the final beach, the physical environment there is sketched rather than fully reembodied, relying more on conceptual than sensory closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pavilion, cathedral, gardens, and rose window are vividly realized, with selective, image-rich detail that feels tied to Marina’s artistic eye. Light and season are not decorative; they directly govern what she can see (the hidden etchings) and how her own glass mural will appear at different times of day. The final image of the pavilion panels coming alive in changing light is deeply charged by this environmental logic. Setting is integral to both the epiphany and the new artwork rather than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    The floating library zeppelin, desert scroll, and obsidian lagoon are vivid and distinctive, with details like “paper yellowed like old teeth” and “black sand” giving strong atmosphere. The hidden lagoon beneath shifting dunes serves the logic of secrecy and becomes the crucible where past and present connect. Environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond providing remoteness—once she’s there, the pressure is mostly psychic and historical rather than spatial—but the final image of the drifting library carrying “cargo of remembrance” is nicely charged by the established setting. Overall, the world feels cohesive and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is vividly and efficiently drawn: the contrast between once-thriving markets and current rot gives the environment emotional texture. Recurring objects (paper lanterns, the lighthouse, specific shops) are not just scenery but participate in the payoff as vessels for redistributed knowledge and symbols of the new order. The setting’s history is smartly leveraged as “raw material” for her work, aligning place with thematic stakes. While the environment doesn’t overtly constrain tactical choices, it strongly charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard atop the skyscraper, the harbor, and the foghorn are vividly rendered and integral to the premise of transplanted memory and impossible gardens. Details like “gnarled apple trees… skeletal against the violet sky” and the remembered harbor soil are precise and thematically loaded without feeling like a museum tour. Environment and recurring objects (trees, wax shaving, foghorn) charge the final image of leaving the shaving at the tree’s base. The setting not only decorates but underpins the story’s logic about memory, place, and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound atrium with its shattered dome, frost-covered tables, and frozen fountain is vivid and specific, with details like breath crystals and starlight refracted through ice. Setting is not postcard-only: the ice pillar becomes the literal locus of the vortex and the last remnant of the grandmother’s work, charging key choices. The final image of footprints in frost under starlight meaningfully reprises the environment to underscore her new path. A slight expansion of how the physical cold or ruin constrains her body or options would push it even higher.

    The suspended cathedral, open arches, clouds below, and the storm’s physicality create a vivid and specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting constrains choices: the wind patterns justify the microclimate tracking, the open arches are a tangible vulnerability, and the bell tower’s architecture enables the rope-as-antenna concept. Weather and altitude meaningfully shape what warning systems are plausible and what failure would look like. A slightly more sensory immersion during the storm’s peak (sound, structural strain, bodily impact) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the mountain-edge station, greened dome, dead instruments, and dark sky all filter through Kael’s sensibility and mood. The yellow lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that literally and thematically charges the final image; its flaws refracting the meteors are indispensable to the epiphany. Environment and era (abandoned observatory in a star-indifferent world) deepen the sense of “temple of forgotten wonder.” Details are purposeful rather than touristic, with strong atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “Sweetwater Apiary,” honey “darker than midnight,” scorched wasteland, melted wax seals, ghost bees, and the stained-glass box all feel integrated rather than decorative. Environmental logic shapes events—the wasteland enforces isolation, the apiary history motivates the record of workers, and the glass box’s interaction with light is the key to opening it. Details are filtered through Silas’s beekeeping lens, which keeps the specificity from becoming a tourist catalog. The only thing holding this just beneath the very top tier is that the physical environment, beyond the box, doesn’t tighten tactical options in the climax so much as frame them.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald silo, prairie, and green-tinted glass are vivid, memorable, and strongly filtered through the premise (light wavelengths altering perception of duration). Setting actively charges the experience of time rather than functioning as backdrop, and the silo becomes a kind of tool/temple that shapes what Marcus can do and feel. The post-Change world is efficiently sketched with specific details (garage sales, sensation-based measurements) that feel organically tied to setting. A slightly stronger sense of environmental constraint or hazard would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the theme of post-storm quiet and healing; details like “mirror-smooth and darker than usual” feel lived-in rather than touristic. The setting supports mood and metaphor (after-storm weather mirroring grief) and the shoreline provides plausible staging for feather and kite. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics—it frames rather than forces choices. Strong atmosphere and specificity, just shy of using setting as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: living stone pillars that mist at dawn, symbiotic fruit trees, and the “sacred temple orchard” are all charged and memorable. Environmental rules (pillars need trees; copper conducts “electrical whispers”) are taught through action and directly shape Marina’s tactics. The final image of a solid, humming temple and the diary in her lap is deeply tied to this physical environment, reweighting the premise of grown architecture. A slight reason for not going higher is that sensory range beyond the visual and conceptual could be even richer under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tower, the rain, the bronze quiet, and the overgrown sculpture garden are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Kira’s scientific yet haunted gaze. Setting does more than decorate: the rain erases footprints, the dust records formulas, and the tower/garden are inseparable from her prior academic life, directly charging the closure image. The amber functions as an object-as-setting, shaping both sensory experience (warmth, taste) and conceptual stakes. Occasionally the description veers a touch toward lyric tableau rather than constraint, but overall the environment meaningfully frames and deepens the central realization.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: the blooming jetty, submerged battlefield, and encroaching sea are rendered with tactile, visual, and conceptual precision. Details like nitrogen pockets over bodies, armor rusting into nutrients, and vines wrapping pilings directly inform Erasmus’s planting choices. The environment and its altered ecology function as active constraints and resources rather than backdrop. The final image of the battlefield remembered only through a surface-reaching garden is inseparable from this setting logic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and satellite-bone village are vivid, economical, and seen through a tracker’s eyes, giving the world a tactile, lived-in feel. The preserved wax leaves function as micro-setting objects that directly constrain choice (map revelation) and also charge the final image. Environmental details like wind through corrugated walls and the “fallen dish antenna” shelter support the lonely, post-war hush without turning into cataloguing. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the wasteland journey, while mentioned, doesn’t materially shape tactics beyond a brief montage.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the glass bubble “pressed against the edge of relativity,” the compass rose, the temporal pocket where galaxies age in minutes. Time dilation isn’t just backdrop; it shapes what can be seen and what it costs (isolation from everyone else’s timeframe) and charges the final image of her sketching a perpetually changing sky. The compass rose and observation deck recur and evolve in meaning, functioning as an environment/tool that frames her choices and closure. Sensory detail remains purposeful and filtered through Kira’s observational, almost cartographic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is vivid and purposeful—the bruised sky, icebound spire, and screaming wind all reinforce the cosmic wrongness and Seren’s isolation. Environmental details (ice on eyelashes, humming spire, living ice board) are integrated into action rather than decorative. However, the setting rarely constrains tactical choices; the climb and cold are felt but don’t materially alter what she can or can’t do beyond flavor. Objects like the sundial and chessboard carry more functional weight than the broader landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering gallery, marble chessboard, ruined capital, and “nomadic penumbra” are all sensorially rich and tightly integrated into how the story works—sound physics and architecture literally shape the archive. Details are filtered through Mara’s priorities (she notices pawns missing, firelight as half-light, the way footsteps resonate), giving setting a strong POV bias. Environment constrains and enables her choices (whispers travel, patterns echo, the dome “learns”), and the final image is charged by that same space. This is elite-level atmosphere with only marginal room to deepen how physical constraints impede her or her subjects moment to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore and its greenhouse are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Isla’s sensibility (books as mineral deposits, pages sprouting from planted words). Setting is not postcard dressing: the deep chamber, the ventilation shaft, and the greenhouse all directly shape the beats that lead to discovery and resolution. The final image of new words sprouting in the mountain roots closure in this environment, charging the sense of home as something that can grow anywhere. A slight further integration of physical constraint (getting lost, physical hardship) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The time-frozen village, suspended ivy, dust motes, and chapel space are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elena’s attention, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The environment is not mere backdrop; the frozen-time rule and the chapel/tapestry micro-setting directly shape what she can do and what’s at stake, and the final rain image reweights the labyrinth motif. Description remains purposeful and thematically aligned rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The towers of bone, canyon of echoes, and pale spire are vividly rendered and deeply integrated: Mira literally uses the environment as an instrument for her tactic, and the canyon’s acoustic rule-set delivers the story’s crucial reversal. The setting’s specificity (bone as accumulated guilt, echoes as refracted truths that won’t dilute guilt) thematically mirrors and constrains her choices. The final image—pale spire in thinning mist, “patient as bone, inevitable as judgment”—charges the conclusion with place-based inevitability. This is setting doing real narrative and thematic work, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The acid sea, brass hull, grinding gears, and twilight sky are vividly rendered and clearly constrain options—the wave and the fragile floating platform are real pressures, not backdrop. The statue’s pockmarked surface and the key-ring shard function as charged micro-settings that directly shape choice and the final image. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal path, cave network, and hidden chamber are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“mineral deposits…flowing sculptures,” “shallow pool reflected the light-shaft”), and always through Marina’s artistic sensibility. Setting constrains and shapes events: the wrong turn, the forked passages, the tidal pool plan, and the cold water all matter for her choices and realizations. The seashell’s placement in the lit niche within a fragile ecosystem charges the final images with physical and thematic specificity. This is just shy of transcendent because non-visual senses are present but could be exploited a bit more under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lighthouse, garden, and dawn seascape are vivid and economically rendered, with sensory detail (scent, light, salt air) tightly woven into action. Setting meaningfully shapes events: the isolated rock, the supply boat’s approach, and the lighthouse stairs and beacon all structure Mara’s options and rituals. The garden’s night-scent functions almost as a micro-setting, charging both the middle revelation and the closing air. While the broken heat wave is more atmospheric than functional, the rest of the setting work is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The starlit signal station, the failed hydraulics, the submerged valley, and the censer foot build a vivid, coherent world filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lens. Setting isn’t postcard; the disabled rotation, the cliff, and the moon phase genuinely modulate what’s possible and how she works. The censer foot operates as a micro-setting object that constrains method (“zero meridian”) and charges the final image. I’d only nudge higher if weather or physical isolation pressed her options a bit more directly in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hanging orchard, rope bridges, ravine, and storms are concrete and atmospheric, and they actively shape Mara’s solitude and physical risk. The storm drives her indoors to the lamp and textbooks, and the precarious bridges reappear at the end as she tests her new privacy, so environment clearly charges the final image. Details like roots gripping ancient stone and oil-lamp reading feel selective and lived-in rather than touristic. World rules around the orchard and rustic tech remain consistent with the post-virus context.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The misty opal dock, harbor, and lighthouse are economical yet vivid, and the environment’s “witnessed isolation” meaningfully frames Ernst’s act and Margit’s decoding of it. Setting details are filtered through Margit’s long familiarity, which keeps them from feeling touristic. The recurring dock and water constrain the final choice—she can literally discard the flower only here. The Edelweiss-as-object functions almost as micro-setting for the mind, charging the final image of it sinking.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the sensory-rich map shop to the limestone creekside and the blooming cavern with luminescent moss and stone flowers. Details feel filtered through Marcus’s sensibility (maps, surveying, vellum, foundry matrix) rather than like a tourist catalog. The environment guides action—rising creek, limestone hollows, the ant path, the freestanding door—even if it mostly frames rather than tightly constrains his final choice. The cavern and door imagery leave a strong atmospheric aftertaste that supports the story’s tone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific from palace to ridge to ember grotto to the cobalt grotto above clouds; sensory detail feels both tactile and uncanny (“walls wept light… bleeding illumination”). Environment meaningfully constrains and shapes action—she must climb past the treeline and through thin air; the grotto’s impossible position and physics define the encounter. The final image of fireflies rising to meet bleeding starlight tightly fuses setting and theme. There is little to fault here beyond a slight risk of lush description approaching decorative in the ember grotto, which is less structurally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus, ash-roads, and drifting sparks are vivid, and the setting’s logic (a place where embers converge, their old experimental site) is clear and integrated. The nautilus and the pocket-suns function as micro-setting/tools that charge the final image and embody the story’s concerns. Environment mirrors and intensifies the emotional stakes—the nexus blazes brighter with their renewed purpose—without feeling like sheer ornament. The world feels lived-in, though the physical space rarely constrains concrete options beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain ranger cabin, birch bark, pine sap, and high-altitude cold are vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, grounding the temporal weirdness. Details like the crackling radio, flickering lamp, and pines outside are economical yet atmospheric, supporting isolation and haunting. The birch bark as “organic memory” neatly fuses setting with theme. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it does charge the final lamp-and-bark image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The workshop and morning fog are vividly particular and tightly tied to theme: repurposed medical tools literalize the idea of transforming loss, and the lifting fog mirrors her new clarity. The water clock as an object recurs at the end, charging the final image of her walking through the changing morning. Setting details are filtered through Elena’s attention and never feel like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating rock tea-platform, canyon mist, brazier, and frost-filled air create a vivid, coherent micro-setting that strongly supports the contemplative tone. Tools and environment (inkstone, crow quill, brazier warmth against breath-frost) are well integrated into action and imagery. The setting charges the final image (platform swaying in an updraft, storm on the horizon) but does not significantly constrain choices; it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Still, for this story’s scale, the specificity and consistency are notably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sheet music archive and the orchard are vividly rendered and thematically integrated (“paper ghosts,” roots like staffs, chainsaws at dawn), giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactical options, but it heavily charges the stakes—this is neutral ground tied to their origin story and to the grandmother, slated for erasure, which justifies why now and why here. The Schubert score and the bottle on it in the final image extend setting into object-level resonance. A touch more direct interaction with the physical space under pressure could push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The temple library is vividly and economically rendered—“pocket of silence,” “shelves carved from single pieces of stone that predated language itself”—and strongly filtered through Kael’s metaphysical concerns. The spatial design by “degree of illusion” meaningfully mirrors and supports the internal arc, so movement through setting equals movement through understanding. The setting also charges the ending, with the walls thinning to reveal other libraries and seekers spiraling toward the same center. It stops just short of constraining concrete choices, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The horizon station, fjord quiet, and hydraulic glass-and-bronze machinery create a distinctive, immersive atmosphere that’s consistently filtered through Maren’s attention. The edge-of-the-world setting and the razor horizon line are thematically integrated, mirroring her search for the boundary between perception and reality. Environmental and object details (the key, the pendulum over the carved spiral) charge the final image and the conceptual turn. The setting constrains choices more thematically than physically, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and conceptually integrated—those glowing caps, the spore-laden air, and the cave’s gaps aren’t backdrop but mechanism for both detection and intrusion. Environmental constraints (narrow passage, fading glow, permeable stone) direct action and echo the story’s concern with what seeps through barriers. The farm’s medicinal function ties setting and stakes together in a way that charges the final image of “healing grew in darkness.” A small deduction only because we never see the environment materially resist or endanger them; it mostly supports rather than obstructs.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rainwashed library, skylights, candle lantern, and unmowed clover-lawn create a coherent, textured atmosphere that clearly reflects Mira’s mood. Details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., clover holding raindrops like prisms, equations as graffiti), and the environment evolves toward the “clean-washed air” of the ending. The lantern functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and travels with her decision. Setting is more tonal than constraining, which is why it falls just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subway utility tunnel, obsolete phone booth, and single bulb create a vivid, coherent micro-setting that matches the story’s liminal emotional space. The glass harmonica disc and copper wires act as environment-as-instrument, charging both Iris’s method and the final image (“The tunnel sang”). The sense of being below a humming city of unspoken estrangements nicely mirrors her role. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical action, it meaningfully defines the story’s emotional and thematic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The jetty, seawater, and overgrown roses are vivid, multi-sensory, and consistently filtered through Mira’s emotional state, with twilight and bloom density mirroring her threshold moment. The setting is not a postcard backdrop: it’s where ashes were scattered and where the covenant began, so returning here constrains the ritual and charges the closure. Objects-as-setting (thermos of walnut ink, fountain pen, locket) are handled tactically and recur in the final image. The environment doesn’t overtly block or enable physical actions, but it strongly shapes the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned, ivy-choked railway station is vivid and tonally apt, mirroring her “cathedral of controlled chaos” and stalled connections. Details like the rusted luggage cart and vine-strangled bench feel purposeful rather than decorative, and the moon rock as a recurring object charges the final image. The environment doesn’t much constrain tactical options, but it strongly shapes atmosphere and reinforces her liminal, in-between status. Overall, specificity is high and filtered through her sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and integral: trees that sing beyond hearing, notes clinging to spiderwebs, and the paused constellations all feel specific and embodied. Setting is tightly fused to POV—because she is blind, sound and touch sculpt the world, and the forest’s acoustics literally guide her movement. The environment and tools (forest frequencies, moss, ring, sky) constrain what she can do and culminate in the charged silence of the clearing and the constellations’ shift. A minor hesitation is that a few phrases lean toward atmospheric ornament, but they don’t stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The orbital station, Point Lacuna, and the anomaly’s light-bending are vivid and purpose-driven, and the pen functions as a micro-setting object that literally and thematically charges the final image. Details like stars “trac[ing] impossible curves” filter the cosmos through Vera’s work and mood. World rules about the anomaly and the pen’s interaction with it feel internally consistent even if sketched economically. The atmosphere supports the reflective, slightly uncanny tone without drifting into generic SF wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor is vivid and specific—moonlight, ripples, dock planks, wind patterns—and clearly filtered through Marina’s sensibility as a former musician reorienting to visual and tactile rhythm. Environmental details do more than decorate: the waves’ interference patterns and the felt vibrations through the wood actively catalyze her realization. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or imposes material limits; it functions more as an evocative mirror than a pressure source. Still, the integration with theme and final movement sequence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The basalt-cliff archive, carved narratives, dry air preserving textiles, and the hidden chamber are vivid, purposeful details that feel filtered through Marina’s conservator eye. Environment directly enables and shapes action (the carved “trail of artistic creations,” the preserved tapestry, the difficulty of the climb back to daylight). The final image of “the watching walls” and “stone memory keeping faith” clearly charges the ending, though another sensory layer (temperature, sound, smell) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly rendered with precise, inventive sensory detail (sound as visible ripples, “colors that shouldn’t exist,” the lagoon as overlapping frequencies). Setting is not decorative: its physics (sound sculpting reality) directly enable the memory-sharing premise and govern Maya’s tactics (drumming to summon and shape presence). The environment evolves—waves complexify, the lagoon brightens, then fades at dawn—and that change anchors the story’s temporal and emotional arc. The final image of the garden paling at exhalation charges her decision to leave and return, giving the setting real closure weight.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The port labyrinth, humming containers, and storm-lit sky are vivid and functional, shaping both the investigation tactics and the thematic sense of shifting systems. The geomagnetic storm is not mere color; it disrupts surveillance and narrows the smuggler’s operating window. Professional details (maintenance harness, automated systems, map tablet) feel lived-in and filtered through Mira’s practiced eye. The coin as micro-setting object also charges the final image, though its physical environment role is more symbolic than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt dock, wet surfaces, and shuttered canal buildings are vivid, and their physical properties (reflectivity, distance, alignment) directly enable the light-language that drives the story. Setting is not postcard garnish; the canal’s architecture and water reflections are the mechanism of communication and the charged final image (“reflections that made the dark water navigable”). Weather and twilight are also put to work, shaping what light is available and why mirrors matter. The environment meaningfully constrains and empowers choice, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt library, misted windows, town square shops, and magnetic grotto are vivid and selective, with details like “mist pressed against windows like unspoken questions” doing double duty for atmosphere and theme. Setting consistently feels filtered through Marina’s sensibility, especially in the grotto scene where the lodestone’s effect on lantern flames mirrors rule-bending. Environment materially shapes tactics: the windows as public stage, the grotto as hidden lab, the library as everyday battleground. The closing return to the cobalt library with changed children charges the final image nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sublittoral fringe, tidal pools, barnacled rocks, and kelp are tactile and POV-filtered, never feeling like a tourist catalog. Setting actively shapes options: the island appears only at low tide, forcing a particular time and mode of confrontation, and the ocean/whale literally receive what she releases. Environmental and marine details mirror and constrain her internal arc without slipping into heavy-handed symbolism. The final image—walking home through tidal pools, touching each living thing—is charged by everything the shore and sea have meant so far.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The farmhouse and turbines are vivid and thematically charged, with the turbines’ hum historically masking forbidden emotion and still overshadowing the house. Objects-as-setting—the bouquet, knife, driftwood—are used tactilely and recur to frame choices and the final image, especially the bouquet’s disintegration. Environmental details (processing-center beaches, turbine groan) are selective and filtered through Maya’s numb yet observant perception. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the physical environment constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz are richly and specifically rendered, with multisensory detail (“sound like distant bells, like ice singing”) that sustains atmosphere. Setting is tightly integrated with action—the humming intensifies as she approaches and speaks, and the lake groans in response—so the environment feels alive and reactive. The final image of sun on fractured silver and the atrium’s “cobalt embrace” charges the closure. The only slight limitation is that the setting constrains little in terms of physical choice; it’s more resonant backdrop than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The courtyard, kiln ash, plants, and workshop form a coherent micro-world that feels tactile and lived-in, with the “speaking” plants and glass objects grounded in specific textures. Setting details are filtered through Mira’s grayscale perception, which reinforces both character and theme. The environment meaningfully shapes events—Mira’s plant language requires the courtyard space, and Fen’s promise to “fill this courtyard with beautiful failures” charges the final image. A slightly stronger sense of the broader city stirred by the phoenix could further enrich atmosphere without much extra length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The laboratory of lost sounds, sound-capture equipment, and the synthesis chamber are evocative and specific, and the miner’s lens physically modulates the atmosphere (“casting golden shadows”) in ways keyed to the action. Setting is consistently filtered through Karim’s work-obsessed perspective and the bell ringer’s sensitivity, which keeps it from feeling like a tour. World rules around the blackout, corrupted archives, and artificial pilgrimages are sketched efficiently through implication rather than dump. The environment directly shapes options: access to archived sounds and specialized tools is what makes this new kind of pilgrimage possible.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is richly realized—the greened copper dome, spiral stairs, and starlight falling across her worktable all feel specific and grounded. Setting is not just backdrop: the stars literally interact with the pendant at the end, charging the final image of “honestly artificial resurrections” under the wheeling constellations. Tools and materials (ash, resin, silver, vellum) are tactile and plausibly handled, filtered through Mira’s professional eye. The only reason this doesn’t reach higher is that the environment, while thematically potent, doesn’t strongly constrain her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, workbench, and web of cards and thread are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the pattern-and-geometry motif. Details like the measuring tape worn soft and the rain “tracing patterns” filter setting through Mira’s obsessions rather than reading as generic atmosphere. The closing image of rain following immutable laws nicely echoes her thesis and charges the final beat. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices, so it’s evocative more than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bronze prism pagoda and the Archive are vividly realized with purposeful detail (unnamable colors, living stone shelves, humming field) that consistently filter through Maressa’s sensibility. Setting isn’t decorative: the preservation field’s unpredictability and the console’s requirements directly shape her actions. The pagoda’s dimming at the end charges the final image and mirrors her renunciation. World rules (forbidden ruins, memory crystals, field mechanics) are coherent and learned through her interaction rather than expository dump.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Cloudspire Library, gardens in perpetual golden hour, and the void below are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Maren’s sensibility. The river stone works as a micro-setting object that pointedly charges the final image and contrasts the sterile immortality of the flowers. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it consistently mirrors the thematic stakes and makes the final contrast between "never truly lived" flowers and heavy stone land hard. World rules (floating libraries, dream-share tech) are concise yet feel coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop, mist, and stars are vividly rendered and recur in ways that mirror and charge Mara’s internal state, especially in the opening and closing paragraphs. The terrarium, humidity, and tactile details of Prism on her arm give the environment a lived-in specificity filtered through her professional eye. While the setting doesn’t physically constrain choices, it functions as a sanctuary/crucible whose “shimmering quiet” is reweighted at the end as the place where she chooses disruption over comfort. The recurring image of Prism against this backdrop meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is economical yet charged: the quiet tower, dawn light, hourglass, scar, coffee rings, and plants all function as micro-setting that shapes perception and options. The environment is consistently filtered through Maya’s healer’s eye and new plant-attunement. Recurring objects (hourglass, coffee rings, ivy, scar) meaningfully constrain and charge the final choices and images. The “meteor hush” dawn and tower of failed healers sharpen the thematic and emotional atmosphere without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Orpheum projection booth is sharply rendered through smell, texture, and function, and its specific tools (film strips, projector, empty seats) are integral to the story’s mechanics. The final image of love projected into a dusty, abandoned theater depends on this exact setting logic; another backdrop would materially change the story. The environment both mirrors and enables the thematic work of stored/unused love and its release into light. A bit more interaction with the physical constraints of the decaying space could push this even higher, but it’s already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, aurora, and archway are richly realized and continuously present, with details (“green and violet ribbons,” “stone frame alive”) strongly filtered through Lyra’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the archway is the focal constraint, the aurora provides the code, and the tool-as-setting (astrolabe) literally shapes what she can do. The environment directly charges the final image of her as “the doorway, the archway herself.” This is high-level atmosphere and specificity, just short of utterly transformative innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: glowing dunes, phosphorescent flowers, ash-dark sky, and the equation-covered container all feel sensorially and conceptually integrated. World rules are consistent and learned through observation (flowers drawing from probability fields, equations changing when seen). The environment doesn’t tightly constrain her physical options, but it strongly charges the final image—the blooming dune is the on-page evidence of her altered reality. This atmospheric integration is high-level, though not quite to the point where spatial constraints themselves force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid, multi-sensory, and tightly integrated with the premise: metallic vegetation, clicking leaves, condensate “rain,” and tonal differences between metals all mirror neural structures. Setting is not postcard background; it acts as a map of his mind, a system he can manipulate via the gear, and charges the final insight that this landscape is his inner wilderness. The environment doesn’t quite constrain a high-stakes choice, but it deeply informs how he explores and understands himself, which justifies a high score. Detail selection and integration with theme are strong enough for near–publish-ready quality.

    The veiled ridgeway, fog, twilight, and cairn stations create a strong, cohesive liminal atmosphere that matches the emotional terrain. Setting is filtered through theme (indirect paths, thresholds) more than through pragmatic constraints, but the indirect ridge and narrow third-station passage do lightly shape the journey. The environment doesn’t force specific tactical choices, yet it very effectively holds and colors the experience. The recurring fog lifting at the end charges the final image with a gentle sense of emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress, perpetual snow, spiral staircase, and missing piano are vivid and specific, with details like the four indentations and ash-notes on steps doing heavy thematic and atmospheric work. Setting isn’t just decorative: isolation, avalanche history, and “safe” hotel conversion all constrain behavior and charge her choices. The bolt as a remnant of the conservatory and the marked staircase directly power the final image. Environment and object-as-setting undeniably charge the ending without sliding into blunt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ancient, time-suspended temple library is vivid and texturally rich—“stone columns threading with luminous cracks” and walls becoming “pure light” are memorable. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: Kael cannot leave without destroying the proof, so her tactics must use books as emissaries. The environment evolves with the plot, from sighing decay to translucent dissolution that charges the final image. World rules (time currents, drifting texts) are sketched through action rather than infodump, staying coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sea level monitoring station on stilts over the Coral Sea is vivid, and the physical facts (creaking, groaning, swaying) are well integrated into Maya’s mental state and the “vigil” frame. Details are filtered through her expertise—currents, salinity, migration routes—so the world feels lived-in rather than touristic. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (atlas page taped to the window, station “moored but moving”), tying the physical environment to the thematic idea of return. It doesn’t quite impose hard constraints on her choices, but it strongly shapes tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned spaceport and the unearthed stone circle are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Kira’s perception and the story’s thematic work. Details like “ribcages of extinct animals,” warm concrete, and the shattered dome deepen mood without feeling ornamental. The stones’ hum and alignment with the Navigator constellation directly charge the final realization; the setting is effectively an instrument, not a backdrop. Environment and recurring objects (stones, glasses, bare feet) clearly constrain and shape her experience and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic hot springs and cave are vivid and purposeful: the heat/steam, volcanic glass, and precarious pine all anchor mood and action rather than serving as postcard detail. Setting directly shapes discovery (the hidden cave, the steam rendering the embryo “visible only through the water vapor it displaced”) and charges the final image of the springs “steamed with purpose.” Worldbuilding (war, regime, reconstruction) is sketched economically but feels coherent. This is just shy of 9-band because the broader world’s temporal specifics remain lightly outlined, though they don’t harm the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum on the cliff is vivid and integral: salt wind, glass walls, the sweep of the automated beacon, and the waves she counts all shape her coping tactics and the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered (Mediterranean specimens, soil moisture, coastal gales) and they track her professional competence and trauma sensitivity. The environment literally gives her the tool for survival (glass wall and sea rhythm) and thematically mirrors persistence on an eroding edge. Sensory balance is strong, with scent (lavender, herbs) in the final lines grounding the moment in “this specific now.”

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse library is richly evoked—salt-smelling books, spiral stairs, crashing waves, the sweeping beam—and all of it is thematically and structurally active. The walls literally closing in and then retreating, and the rotating light charging the threads and final image, make the environment inseparable from the story’s pressure and resolution. Details feel selective and lived-in rather than touristic. A slight further deepening of how the physical space hampers or complicates her movements could have pushed this into even higher territory.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wind-carved encampment, sandstone pillars, and prismatic drone-light create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than generic. Environmental detail is nicely filtered through Kael’s professional, feral sensibility and mirrors the theme (wind carving stone, time carving lives). However, the setting rarely constrains tactical choices; it mostly operates as charged backdrop rather than an active pressure. The recurring wind and stone imagery does subtly charge the final image and decision.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: the broken dome, perpetual snow, ice-locked vaults, and glowing frozen pathways all feel specific and lived in. Environment is not just decorative; the cold and the ice-network logic directly enable and constrain the plot and charge the final image of archives awakening. Sensory detail is mostly visual and atmospheric, but it’s purposeful and filtered through Kael’s professional lens. The world’s rules (ice as data conduit, Authority’s reliance on cold as safety) stay consistent and matter.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass dome, desert, wreckage, and roses are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Mara’s priorities. Setting isn’t decorative: the dome’s sanctuary-like atmosphere and the roses’ reactions to violence actively influence her father’s choices and the emotional stakes. The recurring materials (ballast sand, canvas) connect worldbuilding to theme and action. The final image of the glowing dome and leaning roses is charged by all the prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden, crystalline terraces, and visible harmonics create an unusually vivid, specific environment that is tightly integrated with the magic and Mira’s profession. Setting is consistently filtered through her working knowledge (fishing grounds, nets, frequencies), not presented as a tourist catalog. The environment and tools constrain options—she uses the skiff, frequencies, and rail spike to physically pin herself to the right harmonic, and the sky’s disarray changes how and where she can “fish.” The setting’s rules feel coherent and the final cosmic reset (constellations returning to their paths) subtly charges the domestic ending without overshadowing it.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, the echoing dome, and the city lights below are vivid, selective, and tightly tied to Adelaide’s state of mind. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it frames her illusion of being “beyond consequence” and then reconfigures at the end when she chooses to “return to earth.” The rosewood pen functions as a micro-setting object that bridges eras and charges the final image. Integration of weather/altitude (clouds parting, first evening star) subtly mirrors the internal reorientation without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The laboratory of lost sounds, the obsolete equipment, and the amber pendant are vivid, selective, and thematically aligned with preservation and entrapment. The lab and device physically constrain options—this is where time folds and where she can plug the amber in—and the empty pendant in the final image clearly charges the ending. Details are filtered through her professional eye (tattoos, frequencies) rather than generic cataloguing. A slight ceiling remains because the lab’s world-rules (e.g., temporal sensors) are sketched more impressionistically than causally.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering grotto is vivid and integral: its acoustics, mist, and stone directly shape mood, perception, and the core concept of “whispers” and emergent hush. The environment isn’t decorative; it amplifies voices, thickens with the mandala’s completion, and charges the final image of reborn meaning in a concretely felt space. Details like damp stone and condensation drips feel lived-in and are filtered through Isla’s artistic eye. The only limitation is that the grotto constrains atmosphere more than concrete physical options, but at this scale it still does heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shattered sky and ancient plaza are vividly rendered and recur in a way that charges the mood and the final image. The environment mirrors and refracts the theme—brokenness seeking temporary harmony—and the plaza is inseparable from the Davos story and renaming stakes. The micro-setting of the mosaic under Vessa’s hand is especially strong, functioning as both tool and stage for the ethical choice. Setting is more atmospheric than constraining tactically, but it’s deeply integrated with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rich and distinctive: the antique shop layered over the ruined theatre, the hidden door, and the mystic orchard where “yesterday’s blossoms and tomorrow’s rot” coexist all feel tactile and conceptually integrated. The garden’s rules—fractured time, temporal echoes—aren’t just decorative; they enable Celeste’s intervention and charge the final image of blossoms from three decades blooming at once. Details are well filtered through her perspective, especially via synesthetic impressions that merge environment and emotion. At this length, the balance between atmospheric detail and forward motion is strong, with only minor risk of luxuriating in imagery over pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    The light painting studio, the faulty wire, and the muscovite geode all function as lived-in, tactile elements that shape action, not just background. Worldbuilding around the pills and “fractually precise” pathways is sketched economically yet feels plausible. The final image of Maya “painting with light” in the studio meaningfully recharges both setting and tools without slipping into heavy-handed symbolism. A bit more multisensory texture (sound, smell, physical fatigue) could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is already strong and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal cave network is vividly and economically rendered—tide-breathing stone, bioluminescent algae, emotional residues—and consistently filtered through Mira’s professional and emotional lens. Environment meaningfully constrains action (she floats, dives, finds an air pocket, works with the tide) and shapes her liminal identity. The fossil as a micro-setting object charges the final image and links deep time to the present transformation. Description serves tone and theme rather than becoming a static postcard, and the world rules feel internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: the warehouse against the cliffs, the dust, the amber sand, and the canyon itself all entwine with the themes of stored time, sedimented stories, and echoing prophecy. Objects-as-setting (hourglass, buttons, jar) are not just decorative but structurally and thematically central, and the cliffs meaningfully tie to “cliff-born” and the town square beneath them. The environment doesn’t constrain physical tactics much, but it strongly charges mood and meaning, especially in the final hourglass image.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integral: Zephyr Bluff’s wind-shaped snow literally becomes the communication medium, and the isolated station credibly supports Claire’s exile and covert work. Weather and season (“March mist,” “tilt of the earth toward spring”) are not postcard details—they constrain the snow-code’s visibility and the timing of their departure (“while the spring roads are still passable”). The “silver hush” of the observation room and mountain atmospherics are filtered through Claire’s sensibility, reinforcing mood and theme. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment under pressure could push this higher, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: fog, river, lantern light, and the ticking gutters all feel tactile and are filtered through the coachman’s practiced perception. The environment constrains choice (the crossing “won’t take” them until conditions shift) and time (gutter rhythm as clock) and charges the final image (“The river murmured its approval”). Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with weather and sound meaningfully affecting action. This is very close to publish-ready in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and particular—chimney smoke flattening, twelve hives, three olive trees, the stone well—and all of these recur as functional elements, not just backdrop. The oasis and wasteland logic are consistent, and the lantern glass, well, trees, and smoke textures charge key beats, especially at the ending where the oasis “thrummed” with layered care. The environment shapes what she can do (observe timelines, tend hives, water earth) and is inextricable from the story’s meaning. This is strong enough, and sufficiently tied to the final image, to clear the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fire escape garden, sagging boathouse, luminous harbor, and abandoned lighthouse are vivid and integrated, not generic backdrops. Setting is filtered through Mira’s sensibilities (plants, locks, light) and supports tone and theme. The harbor and boats materially shape tactics—rowing out, using the lighthouse’s height and windows to multiply light—and the final image of moonlit wakes charges the closure. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint (weather, balance, risk on the water) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Tidal Library is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: atomically reflective floors, cloud-tides, extinct species, and the stone circle all shape how Kael moves, survives, and decides. Environmental rules (tides rearranging shelves, need to climb or “swim through vapor”) impose real constraints and are consistent with the world’s logic. The setting is consistently filtered through Kael’s awareness of extinction and reincarnation, so it never feels like a neutral backdrop. The final image—clouds like applause, sundial on the map—directly depends on the setting’s specific properties, charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, post-storm atmosphere, and the nest installation are vivid, integrated, and filtered through Mei Lin’s sensibility. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it literally supplies the twigs and space for the installation and charges the final images (the thrush alighting, bells over water, prismatic reflections) with thematic weight about return and resonance. Weather and water shape mood and plausibly explain the letters’ emergence. The setting’s specificity and recurrence directly power the story’s last notes, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The basement studio, ancient receivers, dust and ozone, and annotated charts create a specific, lived-in locus for the conflict. Environmental details (orientation of the broadcast tower, Jupiter’s field, the humming generator) directly constrain tactics and plausibly enable her plan. The “colors that shouldn’t exist” and trembling charts fuse atmosphere with stakes during the peak. The final return to the campus at dawn ties setting back into resolution without feeling postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: the nexus, starlight-slashed ruined cathedral, and breathing corridors all shape what Mara can do. The organ’s sound physically alters the space, and the floor itself becomes the access point once she reads it correctly, so environment and tools directly constrain choices. Images like “starlit void” beneath dissolving flagstones and “five corridors at once” strongly charge the climax and final impression. This is high-level atmospheric work that serves both plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quarry and mist are vivid from the opening line and remain a consistent, atmospheric frame that matches the story’s tonal ambitions; details like “ancient chisel marks” and “torches burning” give the place lived and historical texture. The setting is strongly filtered through Vera’s artistic eye, which keeps description purposeful rather than touristic. While the quarry doesn’t tightly constrain her physical choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image (“painted mercy into stone and shadow”), functioning almost as a second character. A slight limitation is that environmental specifics rarely alter tactics in the moment; they primarily operate as mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cliff-edge weather station, impossible storms, and “sky churned with colors that shouldn’t exist” create a vivid, tonally apt environment. The isolation and battered infrastructure subtly echo exile and marginalization. The nail as a micro-object setting is nicely charged, both materially (copper, etching) and symbolically (legacy). The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options in-scene, but it does solidly shape mood and plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain pullout, slope, old scaffolding, updrafts, and fluttering mesh are vivid and tightly integrated into the mechanics of the secret (wind + light = visibility). Setting is filtered through Maria’s attention in ways that feel lived-in (the bridge busker perspective, guardrails, info placard). Environment actively enables discovery and also charges the final image as the note is carried to the wrap. This is an example of setting doing meaningful narrative work rather than providing backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and specific—rust, velvet seats exhaling dust, broken skylights—and it’s inseparable from the story’s emotional terrain. The environment is not just backdrop: childhood play, territorial markings, and the potential restoration project all hinge on this exact place. The fox, the creaking car, and the dusk settling into darkness all contribute to a coherent, slightly haunted atmosphere that directly charges the closing image. The setting’s constraints (isolation, disuse, history) meaningfully shape what choices are plausible for Luka now.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory, winter sky, and variable stars are economically but vividly rendered, and they’re integrated into action rather than offered as static backdrop. The telescope and dome are not mere décor; they’re the literal tools through which the collaboration and thematic realization occur. The dried daylilies on the telegram serve as a charged micro-setting detail that persists into the final third. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does effectively frame and color the emotional and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated with action: the “swirling orchard vortex,” skeletal trees, and impossible winter lilies all shape how Kael navigates and performs magic. World rules feel consistent and are learned through her movement and ritual rather than exposition. The environment constrains choices (she must walk the circles on the water, commune through the tree) and charges the final transformation as the trees sink and the lake calms. The orchard-lake fusion in particular feels fresh and thematically apt, mirroring a truth that’s been drowned yet persists.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt glade, blue-barked trees, and “crystallized possibility” maze give the piece a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the speculative premise. Setting is consistently filtered through Mara’s history with gardens and mazes, which sharpens both imagery and theme. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does function as a micro-setting whose very existence (dream-created, cobalt-lit) enacts the characters’ power and charges the final image. World rules around the Acceleration and this dream-space hold together without intrusive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—roots through bones, phosphorescent fruit, carved symbols—and strongly establishes mood and world rules. Details are filtered through Mira’s professional eye, tying environment to her practice. The setting partially constrains action via the “web of meanings” they step into, but that mechanics layer stays more atmospheric than tactical. Even so, the final image of them entering the carved web gives the place a charged role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The quarry office trailer and its surroundings are vivid and thematically charged: limestone outside, dust motes, the hollowed-out pit where sound “returns changed.” Details are filtered through Marcus’s professional and personal lens—speaker cloth weave, the feel of road gear, authentication certificates—rather than generic description. The environment becomes a microcosm for “after the applause,” and the final image of the quarry’s silence and the lit desk ties setting directly into the closure. The setting doesn’t just decorate; it quietly shapes the emotional geometry of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Magnetic Arbor above the clouds is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Asha’s perception (the comforting hum, clouds “like thoughts trying to form words”). The environment is not just backdrop: the electromagnetic field explicitly becomes the “magnetic gate” and physically shapes her choice of where to plant the seed, then charges the final image of a tree bridging clay and starlight. Integrating clay dust from the tablets into the soil nicely fuses setting, object, and theme. A minor limitation is the narrow sensory range (mostly visual/aural), but what’s there is precise and thematically loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal atrium, migrating shelves, copper basin, and titan-gear form a vivid, integrated environment that constantly inflects action rather than sitting as wallpaper. The water’s rise/fall literally enables the smelting and the migrating shelves complicate librarianship, letting setting embody the theme of fluctuating meaning. Details like “rooms that expanded during spring tides, contracted during neaps” and “a astronomy text that was also a cookbook” are both imagistic and functional. The final image—gear synced with her heartbeat and the moon’s pull—directly charges the setting with ongoing significance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystal caves, quartz columns, latent radiance, and acoustics are vivid, economical, and consistently filtered through Mara’s perspective. The environment meaningfully shapes the ritual (crystalline acoustics, glow on shells and pearls) and charges the final image of her crowning herself in the cave’s hush. A slight limitation is that the physical constraints of the cave don’t significantly alter her tactical options; they are primarily atmospheric rather than obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The disused, ivy-strangled station, the bathroom, and the river are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Maya’s sensibility as a river chronicler. Environmental details (ivy waterfalls, cracked mirror, ancient pump, river over stones) support mood and theme without feeling like a generic ruin. The river and ruins charge the final image, though the setting doesn’t much constrain tactical options beyond being the accident site. Still, the place feels integral to the story’s emotional geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing library in mist, breathing amber windows, and luminous shelves are vivid and consistently filtered through Elena’s focused, quasi-scientific attention. Setting meaningfully shapes action—its cyclical manifestations, internal time dilation, and emergent staircase constrain how and when she can access the unspoken library. The watch and the staircase-door sequence turn the environment into a kind of apparatus that governs choice, not just backdrop. A touch more sensory breadth beyond the visual/temporal (sound, texture) under peak moments could push this to the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet observatory, “bruised twilight” light, transparent ice violin, and whispering ferns create a vivid, coherent micro-world filtered through Iris’s sensibility. Setting details aren’t postcard-only; the observatory, glass case, and coffee cup function as tools and constraints that shape how she investigates and chooses. The atmospheric consistency (velvet, mulberry, bruised light) underwrites the emotional tone without feeling like decorative excess. The recurring objects (violin, plants, cup) also charge the final image conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skyborne grotto, three miles above the cloudline under the aurora, is powerfully concrete and atmospheric, with details like aurora-melt and consecrated winds feeling both original and functional. Setting is not mere backdrop; it shapes the ritual mechanics (open ceiling, aurora light charging the emerald, the descent to the winds) and charges the final image. The professional specificity of Kael’s workspace (kit, stone table, basin) further grounds the fantastical altitude. A slight additional sense of daily constraints in this extreme environment could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The umbral grotto, condensed mist walls, pearl-bark trees, and clouds below create a vivid, distinctive atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Mei’s perception. Setting supports theme and mood (rebirth, hush, patience) and provides functional elements (Pool of Reflection as the mechanism of confrontation, trees as a thinking tool), though environment rarely constrains tactical options. The hairpin works as a micro-setting/object charged with history and closure weight. World rules (souls arrive, see lives, move on) are introduced economically and stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, dawn, constant wind, and chimes are vivid and integrated, not postcard décor: the wind literally enables Mara’s method and charges the final image. Details like brass chimes, salt-thick air, and the dying campfire anchor place and mood through the whole scene. The setting subtly mirrors internal states—transition from night to dawn, ashes scattered—without feeling over-explained, and the environment constrains the story’s ritual-like encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and memorable—the floating rock platform over a magnetic grotto, aurora-like shimmers, sycamore hush—and strongly charges the story’s tone and final image. The pond and its ripples function as a recurring micro-setting/object that structures the teaching and Maia’s realization. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, its liminal, suspended quality underlines the thematic “between states” in a way that feels integral rather than decorative. World rules (temporal resonance, magnetism) are gestured at just enough to feel coherent without exposition drag.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is striking and original: “towers of bone,” “canyon of endless echoes,” dust and bone-sung histories all feel specific and lived-in rather than decorative. Environment isn’t just backdrop; echoes and bone towers literally enable her method of navigation and teaching, and the final image of dust settling on her shoulders is thematically charged. World rules around resonance and accumulated sound remain consistent. A touch more sensory variety beyond the auditory and visual might deepen immersion further, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and actively shapes choice: mist as traversable ground, the altitude and icebound spire as obstacles, the keystone as a physical architectural element restored to its gap. World rules (automated magic vs old magic) are conveyed via concrete institutions and artifacts, not pure exposition. The recurring spire/keystone/luminance complex strongly charges the final image and constrains what’s possible in the scene. Sensory detail is primarily visual but specific and purposeful, with atmosphere tightly aligned to the story’s contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, pier, and submerged *Meridian* are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Marcus’s perceptions—the sky lanterns, “cathedral of rust and barnacles,” and labeled cases all feel specific and atmospheric. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the festival and calm tide enable the dive, the wreck’s tilt and library layout guide his movement, and the final parallel between rising lanterns and rising vows charges the closing image. Environmental logic is consistent and the maritime details feel plausibly researched without bogging the scene. The only reason this doesn’t quite reach the highest band is that physical constraints of the dive (time, risk, navigation) remain somewhat idealized, never materially limiting his options.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amber observatory, contracted universe, and survival-era tech are vividly evoked and tightly filtered through Kael’s attention. The coins and amber light recur to charge the final image, and the observatory’s isolation from the colonies below meaningfully frames her role as detached witness. World rules around backward prophecies and contraction/expansion feel internally consistent without exposition dump. The setting could further constrain concrete choices, but as a microcosm for her charged stasis, it’s strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vivid, tactile, and thematically central: the oxidized dome, dust motes as galaxies, and telescope all reinforce mapping and looking into darkness. Setting isn’t mere backdrop; it enables the light-based crystallization and the echoes that return her words in her daughter’s voice, charging the final images. The atlas, instruments, and architecture function as a micro-system that shapes her choices. A slight deepening of how dusk/encroaching night constrains timing would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, dried canyon, absent river, and behavior of dew are vividly specific and tightly woven into action and magic mechanics rather than functioning as backdrop. The environment genuinely constrains tactics: her whole method depends on dew patterns at this particular bridge and the vantage where water once ran. The final image of her atop the viaduct timing drips charges the setting with ongoing responsibility. Minor sensory breadth limits (emphasis is mostly visual/conceptual) keep it just shy of the highest band, but the place feels real and thematically integral.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The reservoir, ridgeway, mudbanks, drowned town, and wind chime create a vivid, lived-in physical world filtered through Mara’s professional gaze. The resurfacing landscape actively shapes what’s possible (exposing the town, enabling the memorial visits), and the recurring wind chime charges the final image. Some description leans slightly toward the lyrical-touristic, but overall it’s purposeful and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the kaleidoscopic waterfall, perpetual dawn, coppery apples, and suspended dew all create a distinct, charged environment rather than a generic magical grove. Environmental features enable key actions (the impossible frozen crystal, the vantage for watching starlings) and mirror the liminal thematic space “between knowing and becoming.” World rules feel consistent for a mythic-lyric piece, learned through her movement and observation. The orchard’s “ancient freshness” and its readiness for “the next seeker” effectively charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vivid and particular, with silver leaves, height, and the valley below all tied to her role. Setting isn’t just postcard: the height underpins the parachute, the arbor’s geometry and leaves are literally her instrument, and the final image (“scent of distant rain,” “stars wheeled”) recharges theme. Some sensory breadth beyond the visual and a bit more direct constraint from the environment on her options would push this higher. As-is, the world feels lived-in and tonally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating dojo and courthouse above a reality-rewriting landscape are vivid, economical, and thematically apt, and the “brain in a jar” functions as a charged object that anchors the premise. World rules—tethering cables, reality engines, floating sanctuaries—are clear enough and consistently applied. The environment mirrors the identity instability (shifting Montana, stable sanctuaries) and subtly underwrites the theme of negotiable history vs anchored memory. Setting mostly charges meaning rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

    The mill, the nocturnal escape rooms, and Whisper Creek create a distinctive, sensorially grounded atmosphere that supports the story’s mood and theme. The corpse flower and the brook recur and converge in the final image, charging that last scene with place-specific resonance. Setting details feel selected through Miranda’s sensibility as a puzzle designer, not like a neutral tour. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it does meaningfully distinguish her haven from the corporate chains stalking it.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The echo chamber tunnel, limestone, leaf blowers, and scattered leaves form a vivid, integrated environment that strongly shapes the action and the “magic” of the piece. Setting is not decorative: the acoustics enable the central tactic, and the tunnel’s under-the-house geography underlines the theme of buried grief leaking upward. The pull cord and leaf blowers function as tools in a ritualized, tactile way that charges the final image. A slightly wider sense of the estate grounds above might have deepened contrast, but what’s here is focused and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the frozen roses, mist, stone columns, and later frost-books and melting call numbers create a vivid, coherent liminal space. Environmental details are filtered tightly through her librarian sensibility (light as categorizer, books of frost) and directly charge the final image of her reading. The garden/library boundary and the mist materially shape what is possible (waiting, ferality, then restored uprightness) rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember nexus and forge-rivers are vividly realized and recur meaningfully; they are not backdrop but the physical engine of the climax. The nexus constrains action (this is where the Great Work must be attempted) and charges the final image when it “pulsed once, twice, like a heart that had learned its rhythm from watching hers.” Details are well-filtered through Maren’s professional and spiritual lens, integrating metal, heat, and twilight with her alchemical concerns. World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and particular: the suspended radio tower city over a gorge, rusted steel lattices, cables “thicker than redwoods,” and moonlight through broken windows all feel lived and tonally apt. Details are filtered through Mira’s professional lens (broadcast equipment, signals, resonance), integrating worldbuilding with her obsession. The fragment and the tower cradle both subtly mirror the thematic concern with endings and repurposing without veering into overt allegory. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it charges the atmosphere and final images in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ferry amid noon stars, the harbor wall opening into a bioluminescent grotto, and clocks running sideways all create a distinct, coherent world. The grotto and its “limestone constellations” aren’t postcard backdrops; they actively enable Marcus’s tactic by mapping infinite routes and amplifying the radio signals. The hourglass functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and encodes the story’s rules about time dispersing and recombining. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Escher Wing and its impossible geometries, illusion panels, and vibrating sinew threads are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Marina’s artistic sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop; sightlines, reflections, and optical tricks are the very mechanics of the experiment and directly shape the final shared pocket of reality. The gallery’s evolution into a quasi-living environment (“walls breathed. Distances folded.”) powerfully charges the final image and enacts the theme. A slight additional tactile or bodily grounding under peak strangeness could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The benthic city, the three thousand meters of water, and the bioluminescent darkness are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through a navigator’s mind. Setting is thematically integrated: “anchored” cities, forgotten stars, and literal depth mirror the psychological and cultural descent the story interrogates. The recurring chain link works as a micro-setting object that charges the final understanding of connection and anchoring. The environment doesn’t quite constrain immediate tactics in the scene, but it heavily charges the stakes of going “up.”

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mist-clad atrium, ferns leaning toward secrets, and twilight atmosphere are vivid and thematically apt, giving the piece a clear, specific locus. Setting is filtered through Mara’s work—devices, hospital records, the old carnival photo—rather than reading like a neutral backdrop. While the atrium and mist don’t strongly constrain tactical options, the twilight window and the device-as-tool function as a micro-setting that charges the final image when the mist lifts and the hearing aid is archived. Detail is economical and rarely drifts into decorative list-making.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the facility between tides, barnacled walls, rusted walkways, freezing pools, and pressure changes all create a textured, coherent world. Environment clearly constrains options (narrowing levels, time window, water seeping in) and charges the final image of submersion versus her emergence with the codex. Details feel filtered through Maya’s professional and personal lenses, not like a tourist catalog. The facility’s breathing, phase-transition motif effectively mirrors and supports the story’s liminal themes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The opal observatory under snow is vivid and purposeful: the opal floor literally enables the ink patterns, and the radio telescope’s “hum” and the universe’s “breathing” echo the heart/stasis motif. Environmental details (snow, dome, radio static) are selective and thematically tuned rather than touristic. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain choices in a survival sense, it decisively charges the ritual and the final image of shared breathing (outside universe/inside Marcus). The observatory feels integral rather than interchangeable.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower of bone, canyon of endless echoes, and textural library are striking and specific, and they’re all filtered through Maerith’s linguistic and acoustic obsessions. Setting isn’t decorative: echoes, textures, and bone pillars directly enable her method and shape the metaphoric logic of preserving language in surfaces. The environment charges the final image (copper veins in fading light, bone under her hand, the canyon of echoes) with thematic weight. A touch more direct constraint on her options by the physical setting (e.g., the canyon’s dangers, isolation logistics) would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underground garden is vivid and specific—moist limestone, gravitationally perverse vines, shifting oak/birch, and the copper-wrapped phone—creating a palpable, uncanny atmosphere. Setting is consistently filtered through Elena’s professional and psychological lens (inner ear ache, noticing plant oddities). The environment charges the final image of snow falling upward and the sense of being “between spaces,” though it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond mood and access to the phone. A slightly stronger use of the garden’s physical strangeness to limit or shape action would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly specific: sky-bridges over a “mechanical city,” an orchard of tarnished-silver fruit behind rusted fencing, and living stone wardens whose grinding voices fit the world. Environmental elements directly shape action—the fence, statues, and rooted trees define constraints that the uprooting must overcome. The locust shells and tarnished fruit recur as charged objects, inflecting the final image of mobile trees seeding new ground. World rules feel internally consistent and are conveyed through concrete interaction rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt arcade, border fountain, and shuttering shops create a vivid, lived-in liminal space that supports tone and theme. Details like “blue-tinted glass” and the defunct fountain are specific and integrated through Kael’s movement, not tacked on. The environment underlines risk (border hush, closing shutters) but doesn’t significantly constrain tactical choice beyond atmosphere. The thunderstorm-in-a-bottle object richly charges the final image, functioning as a micro-setting for memory and promise.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the rusted circus train as “broken teeth,” the willow-ringed clearing, the crimson car, and the interior light and dust all feel lived-in and particular. Environmental elements (mist, wind bells, cattails, overgrown tracks) are tightly integrated with mood and action, not mere backdrop, and they recur in the ending to charge the final image. The micro-setting of the train car and the carousel tools grounds each physical move. The only slight limit is that the environment rarely constrains her tactics beyond discovery; it primarily inflects tone rather than forcing hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory-turned-scientific-poetry library is vividly specific and filtered through Meridian’s obsessions, with details like Maxwell villanelles and quantum sestinas doing heavy atmospheric lifting. The setting’s curvature and stacks directly echo and embody the conceptual stakes, and the final image of the library “breathing” with curving shelves feels charged. The scarf functions as a micro-setting object that anchors both her body and the model. The only thing keeping this from the 9-band is that the environment guides meaning more than it constrains concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering archipelago, cliff, ferry hours, and fog are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Marina’s sensibility. Setting meaningfully shapes behavior (odd hours, dawn cliff walks, maritime library) and charges the final images of islands “sharing a secret” and the paint-wells as “tiny oceans.” The environment and recurring objects (camera, palette, light) strongly inflect theme without feeling like mere allegory. A touch more non-visual sensory texture (sound of water, cold, smell of fog) in peak beats could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the nexus that exists only when desperately sought, the wordless key sign, and the hybrid astrolabe/music box all feel organically tied to the story’s logic. Environmental details evolve with the action—the room breathing and tilting under the device’s influence mirrors Mara’s destabilized certainties. The stars and starlight recur to charge both the ritual (first star, Venus) and the closing image of “small resurrections,” so the world isn’t just backdrop. The rules of this magical-realist space are consistent and legible without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the shipwreck ring, sunken orchard, glowing mushroom rings, and fractured moonlight are all striking and filtered through Mara’s folklorist lens. Crucially, environment isn’t just décor: the greenhouse geometry and water refraction literally create the “broken constellations,” and the thin-place quality of this spot makes the ritual possible. Weather/tide and physical conditions (wading in cold water) are present but could constrain her options slightly more concretely to hit the very top band. Even so, the final image of her in the ruins with ghostly self and shattered stars feels genuinely charged by the place.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The forgotten library, warped windows, swing, shards, and tea service are economical yet vivid, all filtered through Miren’s practical, ritualized attention. The environment is not just backdrop: the archive of glass shards and the overlooked playground actively charge the stakes of exile/return and the final image. The swing’s creak and eventual stillness in dusk reweight the emotional temperature at closure. Atmosphere is rich without slowing the scene, though the world’s broader rules remain purposefully implied rather than fully systematized.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“verdant parapet beside the waterfall,” “radiant hush,” and glimpses of impossible orchards all feel integrated with Esme’s perceptions. The waterfall’s sound and mist aren’t just decoration; they frame the liminal quality of the place and literally reveal the other gardens, charging the core mechanic. The shears, seed, and multi-world soil operate as a micro-setting that bridges craft realism and fantasy. Environment could constrain choice a bit more directly (e.g., physical risk, access), but as a lyric piece the atmospheric work is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary, fractured starlight, and the fisherman’s net create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels tactile and consequential. Setting details are tied to action (the net on the stone floor, the silver wire through ancient knots) rather than decorative, and the mask/starlight motif charges the opening and final image. The environment functions as a kind of tool and altar, constraining the story to this exact ritual space and making Mara’s solitude and burden concrete. This integration of object, light, and place effectively underwrites the mood and thematic weight of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fresco vault and the henge are vividly, economically rendered and tightly braided with the thematic focus on absence and incompleteness. Details like the rain-scoured saints and spiral grass do double duty as atmosphere and conceptual infrastructure. The opening/closing return to the vault charges the final image and ties environment to meaning. Setting could push into 9+ if it constrained concrete choices more directly rather than primarily shaping interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater wreck and sunken library are vividly realized in specific, tactile images (barnacled spine, “geometric avalanches” of shelves, brass cylinders scattered like cigarettes). Setting is filtered through Marina’s professional and personal gaze, which keeps detail purposeful. The snow globe functions as an object-as-setting that crucially charges the final image and metaphor. Environmental constraint (confined submersible, deep water) is present but not fully exploited for pressure, which keeps this just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Sky Monastery, misty courtyard, and storm are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the mechanisms (prayer-wheels, bolt plates, oxidizing metal leaves). Setting details feel purposeful and filtered through her sensibility as a tinkering musician rather than touristic exposition. The environment participates in the action—the storm’s lightning reveals the ghost, the machinery carries the code, the height above the world underlines isolation and reach. It stops just shy of 9-band because the setting constrains mood and method more than it forces difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound spire, clanking elevator, and airship relics are vivid and integrated with the emotional tone rather than feeling like backdrop; the vertical movement and frost-etched window support the core metaphor of hidden/filtered perception. The goggles and diary function as micro-settings/tools that meaningfully constrain discovery and charge the ending. Weather and altitude rules are consistent and thematically relevant (pressure sickness, frozen tower above the world). The environment doesn’t quite force tactical choices beyond framing the ascent/descent, which holds it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sky gondola, high altitude, and instruments are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a meteorologist’s eye. Details like “seventeen thousand feet,” “anger-red thunderheads,” and “dusty starlight” give a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the emotional stakes. The brass telescope operates as a charged micro-setting object, tying environment to grief and memory. The setting shapes mood and isolation more than concrete options, but it’s specific and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tree library is vividly imagined—oak hollowed into spiraling shelves, sap-weeping alcoves—and filtered through her artist’s perception so it never reads as a neutral tour. The demolition machinery and the living wood environment actively shape the tone and urgency, and the coin as recurring object clearly charges the final image in her pocket. Setting and object-as-setting both constrain options (must act before sunrise, must decipher knowledge from metal rather than walls) and thematically mirror the failed attempt to “hold heaven.” This integration of environment and theme is near publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and integrated: the brass hull, observation deck, starling murmuration, and golden “luminous dead air” are all seen through a cartographer’s priorities. The environment is not decorative; the stranded air pocket and the physical deck (with nail holes and chalk grid) directly constrain and enable choices. Tools and objects—the compass, phrasebook, bolt—operate as extensions of setting and profession. The atmosphere is distinctive enough that the story would lose much of its identity if transplanted elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen library above the clouds, ice-encased shelves, and silver mirror corridor are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the piece. Setting is not just backdrop: the library provides the prophecies, the hall of mirrors enables the key realization, and the icy, luminous environment shapes the tone of numinous isolation. The recurring objects (gears, mirrors, starlight) charge the final image and concretize the abstract “rhythm of repair.” A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual could deepen embodiment, but what’s here is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet, low gravity droplets, floating rock arches, and the nebula of respite are vividly rendered and recur in charged ways, especially the arches and nebula framing the collective moments. Setting and object details (butterfly gardens, bells, domes) feel lived in and integrated with action. However, the environment mostly supports tone and symbolism rather than imposing concrete constraints or tactical limits on choices. As a result, it’s beautifully atmospheric and thematically apt, but just shy of using place as an active pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hidden lighthouse, spiral stairs, lantern room, and pane of hush are vividly realized and integrated with the action rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment constrains the story into a single, ritual ascent and charges the final image of the lighthouse standing empty while the nested structures hold the lullaby. The micro-setting details (wounded gold light, fractals opening like flowers to rain, light from no source) deepen mood without stalling momentum. One could argue the specific location could be swapped for another liminal site, which is the only thing keeping this just shy of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: screaming fruit, reconfiguring paths, and brass mechanical birds all actively shape options and danger. The cliffside and night frost give a sense of physical and temporal constraint rather than functioning as pure backdrop. Details are filtered through Maren’s familiarity and resentment, which keeps the world from feeling like a tourist catalog. The environment clearly constrains her tactics in the rescue and charges the final image of her re-entering the maze.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ravine, braided tributaries, foam, and afternoon light are vividly rendered and tightly bound to Maya’s perception and profession. Setting is not postcard-like; the water’s behavior and the precarious rocks both mirror and catalyze her thinking, and the chrysalis as an object-setting hybrid charges the final image as a “promise.” The environment’s history as the site of Daniel’s death gives the place narrative pressure beyond mere scenery. This is a strong example of setting as both atmosphere and conceptual engine.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard library and cloud-sea setting are vivid, original, and tightly integrated with the premise: crystal trees holding books, carved glass floors, and bottled moonlight all interlock. Environmental specifics directly support the method (moonlight pooling in grooves, carvings in glass as archival wounds) and feed the story’s metaphors about absence and memory. The final image of the library floating above a swirling cloud-sea of released weight recharges the entire setting as conceptual landscape, not just backdrop. The only thing keeping this just under the very top band is that the setting shapes meaning and method more than live, constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the rain-slick desert fortress and the impossibly preserved coral ice pavilion are striking, memorable images. Environmental details are filtered meaningfully through Maren’s perspective (e.g., “crystallized time,” emotional sediment in tidal pools) and reinforce the premise. The space shapes action—stairs, pools, coral branches—and charges the final image when the pavilion melts and collapses after her work. This environment clearly charges the theme and closure, though it doesn’t quite force tactical improvisation beyond the set ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astronomical clock tower, gears, brass meridians, and prairie elevators are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action rather than pasted on. The cuckoo weight literally powers the communication system and is reprised in the closing image, so the environment materially constrains and shapes events. “Borrowed starlight” and the Saskatchewan sky charge the thematic arc about cosmic connection without feeling like abstract wallpaper. Spatial relationships (tower broadcasting to seven silos) remain clear throughout, grounding the metaphor of isolation and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit canyon-as-skull and mineral-shielded burial site are striking and thematically integrated, and the mirror as an object-setting hybrid is very effective. Details are selective and filtered through her technical and reflective lens, giving the environment a lived, interiorized feel rather than a postcard gloss. The setting supports tone and theme more than it constrains physical choices; the canyon doesn’t really force or alter tactics beyond a conceptual justification for burial. Even so, the atmosphere is strong and consistent, just shy of fully driving the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The settings—archive vault, mist-lands, serpentine grotto, and the inversion phenomena—are vivid, textured, and strongly filtered through Celene’s perceptual bias. The environment meaningfully constrains action: the grotto yields its secret only during inversion, and gravity’s reversal changes navigation tactics (pulling herself “down—or was it up?”). World rules around inversion and threshold effects are consistent and dramatized rather than dumped. The final image of seeds in living stone deep in an inverted, symbol-marked chamber feels spatially and atmospherically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The siskin alder grove, the abandoned sculpture, the telegraph lines, and the hedgehog create a richly coherent, lived-in micro-world. Setting is not postcard: trees literally become instruments, roots transmit vibration, and the grove’s physical layout (workshop center, living alders surrounding) is integral to her method. The environment charges the final image—the hedgehog under the roots dreaming of unknown sound—making the world itself the ultimate resonating body. It’s beautifully specific and functional, though the grove constrains mood more than tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly and economically evoked—iron and ozone on the tongue, compass needles spinning, geometric beings in charged air—and the chess set and basalt stone are tactile anchors. Details are well filtered through Katrin’s sensibility, with geometry and positional language echoing her chess mind. The environment matters conceptually (a liminal magnetic zone whose collapse threatens the city) but exerts limited concrete pressure on her tactics beyond demanding nonverbal communication. Still, atmosphere and world rules are consistent and strongly support tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The workshop under starlight, radios from different wars, telescope parts, and the theremin made from grandmother’s pipes create a vivid, coherent environment filtered through Marcella’s obsessions. Setting details are purposeful, tying history, war, and observation into the emotional and thematic frame. The fireworks and starlight at the end nicely charge the final image, contrasting external spectacle with interior revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The treetop village, rope bridges, and swaying platforms are vivid and thematically aligned with “serenity within motion,” not just decorative. Environmental details (platform edge, wind to carry scent, vertical layering of neighbors) inform Lirien’s tactics and choices. The olfactory world is sharply realized and integrated into setting rather than tacked on. The atmosphere consistently supports the contemplative, slightly uncanny tone through to the final image of swaying stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—floating rock arches, irrigation water as navigation, the inversion of gravity affecting fruit and canals—and these are not mere wallpaper; they directly constrain tactics and possibility. The Arch Maze and the echo chamber are strong, memorable micro-settings that feel discovered through action. World rules around the Turning and water behavior remain internally consistent and elegantly taught via what Kael does. The environment also charges the final image (fruit falling like rain after the thunderous silence), giving the world a thematic as well as practical role.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    The container labyrinth is vivid, tactile, and integral: “metal canyons,” “columns of light,” and the vortex geometry all feel lived-in rather than decorative. The setting isn’t just backdrop; its architecture literally creates the crisis and constrains how wind behaves, which in turn drives the plot. Weather, rust, verticality, and emptiness all reinforce mood and theme. The final image of the containers “humming” with contained force uses setting to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, bells, and aurora are vividly realized and tightly woven into action; Kael uses and moves through the environment in ways that directly shape the ritual. The synesthetic color-language fuses setting with perception, so space, light, and sound all feel character-filtered rather than touristic. The setting also constrains the method—this precise cavern, these bells, and the aurora are required to execute the hush. The final image of him resting among silent bells in sculpted quiet is strongly charged by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Thunder-echo range is sharply realized and integral: acoustics, silence pockets, and rock formations all directly shape tactics and magic mechanics. Details are selective and filtered through her professional eye (testing with stones, mapping thin places), avoiding tourist-catalog excess. The canyon’s hush and sound-swallowing properties constrain how the flute works and charge the final touch of stone. Environment-as-constraint and object-as-setting (canyon + flute) both carry weight in the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    The topaz-glowing workshop, slate table, cold metal type, and vanishing constellations are vivid and tightly selected, with the environment continually feeding the emotional and conceptual stakes. The halo fragment and the press are not just described but used as tools that constrain choice and shape the climax. The dimming topaz walls as another star disappears charge the final image and embed the ticking clock in the setting itself. World rules—holy/technological ambiguity, disappearing stars—are consistent and absorbed through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered, with light, stone, and weather integrated into Kessa’s perception and mood. Details like the farmer mending a stone wall and the herbalist at the ridge’s end make the world feel lived-in without over-explaining. The environment mostly colors emotion and theme rather than concretely constraining choices, so it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the ridge as a repeated path and the aurora as a wonder-source meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and cold light are vivid and strongly filtered through Mara’s state, producing a striking, cohesive atmosphere. Setting functions as more than décor: the arbor as “battery” and the frost patterns as a reading method both charge the magic system and the final image of her being “embraced” by the mist. Sensory specificity is high and purposeful, particularly in the frost geometries echoing “underlying order.” The environment doesn’t tightly constrain options in a physical sense, but it decisively charges the story’s concept and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten orchard within a bamboo forest, the gnarled apple trees, the loom, and the amber bead are vivid and integrated, not postcard details. The isolation of the setting justifies the “impossible distance” and the need for a magical weave, while the orchard’s final soft glow charges the closing image. Environmental specifics recur and evolve (the oldest apple tree giving the box; the orchard “accepting” her), tying directly into theme and closure. Sensory detail is mostly visual but purposeful and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, mine shafts, and resonance crystals are vividly realized and always filtered through Kael’s practical, craftsman’s attention. Environment and objects actively constrain tactics (the honeycombed shafts and acoustic properties dictate his method) and charge the final image (the first living bud against the same azure sky that framed the ruin). World rules stay consistent and are taught through his work rather than exposition dumps. Setting is inseparable from both premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and its variant incarnations (garden, underwater, snow-blasted, pristine) are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Kaia’s sensory-mapper perception. The bay functions as a micro-setting whose unique property (crux of universes) is essential to the premise and enables the encounter with the mother. The recurring bay and engines humming at the end nicely charge the final image. Setting could constrain tactical choices a bit more directly, but for this length it feels deeply integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lantern room and lighthouse are vivid and functionally integrated: the Fresnel lens, sea-weathered glass, scratched messages, and stacked stones all shape what Vera notices and what she can do. The setting is not just mood; it constrains choice (her ritual actions are bound to this room, these stones, this glass) and directly charges the final image of the cairn with the blue sea glass flame. Environmental details like the pale gold dawn and the sense of “air embracing her” tie atmosphere tightly to thematic resolution. The world feels specific and lived-in without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald lighthouse, storm, glass lamp room, and submerged archives are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The environment directly shapes action: the height, glass walls, lens, and especially the wick are inseparable from how Mara does her job and how ships survive. The green light and jade walls recur to charge the final image of dawn breaking “green across the waves,” so setting materially underpins closure. This is one of the story’s standout strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the floating rock tea house, chain-anchored, cloudberry tea, valley mist—filtered through the dye master’s professional sensitivity to light. Environmental details (sun trails, window orientation, the wing on the sill) don’t just decorate but charge the final image and echo the thematic concern with angle and perception. The world’s gentle surrealism is consistent and legible, though the tea house doesn’t strongly constrain physical options so much as tonal and thematic ones. The morpho wing as micro-setting object meaningfully anchors the story’s opening, reflection, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The labyrinth, tower, storm, and ancient beam are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Kael’s practical yet reverent gaze. Environmental elements (stormlight, moonlight, carved rings, the thousand-year oak) are not decorative; they directly enable or constrain the magic of the sextant and the revelation of tree-memories. The setting steadily accrues thematic charge, culminating in the central beam as a literal and symbolic keystone. It stops just short of a 9-band only because environmental constraint is more enabling than conflict-generating.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: mirror world, alchemical orchard, skeletal trees, mica window, and woven dawns all interlock. Environmental features constrain tactics—the mica window is the only conduit, the dead greenhouse is the initial crucible, and endless night defines the problem that dawn must answer. The final image of sunrise over the orchard and impossible fruits directly reconfigures earlier bleak images. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, and the world rules feel internally consistent within a lyric-fantastical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The laundromat and hidden library are vivid, economical, and thematically charged, with details like “between cycles” and shelves arranged in paradoxical pairings doing real work. The environment constrains choice (the secret dryer, the stair, the fixed midnight window) and mirrors Eleanor’s inner paradox. The recurring invitation and the physical act of smoothing it bookend the story with a concrete object rooted in place. A touch more sensory variety or tactility in the library could push this even higher, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The palace grounds, brambles, and tea house are vivid, selective, and thematically aligned with creeping normality and reclamation; details like “moss crept higher” and “stonework looked somehow younger” do real work. The environment is not just backdrop: Mira’s gardening choices, the hidden tea house, and the autumn wind/leaves all charge the final image and reinforce the memory/erasure axis. Sensory detail is strong without feeling touristic or over-described. World rules about erasure/restoration come through in setting interactions (walls, vines, bread) rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Frozen Library above the clouds, the quartz Resonance Chamber, the frigid air—all are vividly rendered and integral to choice: the dying levitation and literal drop constrain what’s possible. The “quartz hush” and ice-veined corridors are not postcard dressing; they shape tone and behavior and heavily charge the final image of the fall. World rules (levitation via resonance/vows) are internally coherent and learned through Celeste’s work rather than exposition dumps. Environment and specific tools directly frame the stakes and outcome, qualifying for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pirate market under Gallow’s Pier is vivid—barnacle-crusted ladder, rotting supports, amber oil lamps, salt-thick darkness—and integrated with motion as Della moves through it. Details feel filtered through her familiarity rather than touristic listing, and the watch fob works as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image. The environment mainly serves atmosphere and social context rather than constraining tactics, which keeps it short of top-tier. Still, tone and place are memorably fused.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the lavender bluff, intensified aurora, voting forests, and individualized weather-fields create a coherent, striking world. Details are POV-filtered through Kaia’s scientific skepticism and sensory focus (tastes of metals, atmospheric anomalies) rather than feeling like a tour. The tin ring and aurora recur as charged objects that explicitly reweight the final image when she offers the ring away under the “terrestrially cosmic” sky. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it powerfully charges the thematic and emotional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave and its “auroral” light are vividly drawn and thematically linked to hidden beauty and waste; the museum above adds a meaningful vertical axis (burial vs. resurrection). Details like the headlamp, loose rock panel, and crystals catching the beam are concrete and evocative. However, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or options—it’s more a rich backdrop and metaphor than an active pressure on the choice. The final crystal-lit image does help charge the closing emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is richly evoked and tightly integrated with mood and theme, from mushroom farms and vertical gardens to the rust-colored sky pressing against the glass. The environment isn’t mere backdrop: it motivates why they live indoors, why hope feels suffocated, and it charges the final image of inner blooming against an unchanging hostile world. The Archive’s physicality (zinc plates, postal depot, etched plaque) is concrete and memorable, grounding the more abstract idea of “where lost conversations go.” The setting could constrain choices even more directly, but it already meaningfully shapes tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Whispering Bluff above an ocean of cloud, the mist, wind, and bronze bells are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Mara’s craft. Environmental forces (wind, altitude, melting ice) literally drive the sculpture’s behavior and thus the “truth-telling” music, charging the final image. Details like the clouds carrying sound and the bluff’s name deepen atmosphere without feeling like a catalog. The setting is inseparable from tone and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass dome, desert rose beds, and shifting sun are vividly drawn and tightly linked to stakes: the roses’ oil content enables the controlled burn, and the dome contains smoke and fire. Setting details are filtered through the caretaker-android’s functional yet haunted perspective, avoiding tourist cataloging. Environmental change (roses to ash, smoke clearing) tracks causally and charges the final image of replanting. The dome-as-microcosm vs. shifting outside world strengthens thematic contrast without feeling overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the converted factory, worn mailboxes, and especially the dawn courtyard with bougainvillea and fountain feel specific and lived-in. Environment isn’t mere backdrop; it embodies and enables Maya’s method (listening in a communal liminal space) and shapes how the resolution occurs. The courtyard’s tone and rituals directly support theme and closure, charging the final image of Iris rejoining the morning gathering. Details are selective and filtered through Maya’s priorities, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken laboratory and deep-sea environment are richly realized—kelp like cathedral drapery, bioluminescent algae as both light source and text, rust colonized by life. These details are filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a lyrical code breaker, so the setting feels psychologically integrated rather than touristic. The environment constrains tactics via tides, water pressure, and the humming, lock-filled walls that literally respond to her dance, charging the final opening of the doors. A slightly tighter link between the ocean’s physical dangers and the escape’s practical risk could push this toward truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings—the dock with the dead whale, the pocket-drift inland, and especially the salt crystal chamber—are vivid, specific, and thematically charged. The chamber and its mineral-thick air are not mere backdrop; they’re integral to stabilizing the pockets and to the final image of crystallizing memory. Details like water droplets forming “spinning constellations” and the coffee grounds’ fractals are sensorially rich without feeling ornamental. Environment and recurring objects meaningfully constrain method and power the story’s last image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The brook, nocturnal forest, and sensory touches (“cricket songs and rustling leaves”) are concrete and atmospheric, integrated with her trance and identity as a solitary guardian. The brook serving as her “anchor” is a nice micro-setting use, tying physical environment to magical method. Worldbuilding around prophecy, attention, and mental cartography feels coherent and selectively detailed rather than expository. The setting, however, rarely constrains her options; it enriches tone more than it shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the “building this old” with whispering walls to the book-cluttered apartment and the rooftop garden under meteors. Architectural and linguistic details filter naturally through the narrator’s sensibility, reinforcing theme rather than feeling like a tour. The bronze griffin seal functions as a micro-setting object that anchors time depth and charges the final image. The meteor shower is more atmospheric than constraining, but it does help frame the moment as cosmically scaled rather than purely domestic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet garden, indigo petals, phosphorescent mist, and crystalline Archive tower create a vivid, coherent environment that is inseparable from the premise. Setting is not postcard—memory-flowers, the tower, and the shell all function as world mechanisms and charge the final image of the garden “learning to sing again.” The twilight/morning-light transition is used texturally to mirror the conceptual shift from stasis to transformation. The environment convincingly acts as a micro-ecosystem for the story’s rules and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and crystal ceiling are vivid, integrated throughout, and consistently filtered through Lien’s attention and craft. Setting is not postcard decoration: the sanctuary’s endurance and the stalactites’ slow reshaping explicitly reframe her stance on permanence and treason, and the thorn literally embeds in the marble in the final image. Environmental details evolve (aurora colors, shifting light, dripping time) and mirror the thematic arc without feeling forced. The world’s light fantastical elements (heritage rose, northern cold) feel internally consistent and materially charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine nexus, stone corridors, and starlight create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the marriage of sound and stone is thematically on point. The seashell and the rock walls as conduits for layered voices are strong, integrated setting uses. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or choices; it mostly serves as lyrical backdrop and metaphoric support. The final image of starlight over the nexus helps charge the ending, but more tactile use of space under pressure would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glacier shrine, candles, and reflective ice are vividly rendered and tonally precise, with the aurora and “borrowed starlight” motif giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The snow globe sits convincingly in this environment and charges both setting and theme. While the setting doesn’t significantly constrain physical options, it clearly defines the ritual space where her work is possible and intensifies the mood of cold preservation and fragile warmth. The final image of aurora and extinguished candles elegantly ties environment to the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is lush and purposeful: slick stone, harbor sounds, fireflies, and rain puddles all feed Chen’s thinking and actions rather than sitting as backdrop. The parapet after rain is functionally necessary—the wet stone and puddles allow the whisk demonstration and mirrored “moon paths”—and the environmental texture consistently reflects her interior lens on hidden effort. The harbor below and coded whistles tie the abstract theme to a lived working world. A slightly tighter link between physical constraints and threatened failure could push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The contrast between rust-colored dust storms and the impossibly green orchard is vivid and instantly orients us in a poisoned, post-liquidation world. Environmental rules (radiation, stillpoint, dust flowing around the orchard) are consistent and directly tied to the core speculative conceit. The setting constrains choices at the end—destroying the diamond means losing the last livable space—so it’s more than backdrop. A touch more sensory texture or lived-in detail inside the cottage could elevate the atmosphere further, but what’s here is efficient and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory above the clouds, perpetual storm, and cobalt glass portico are vividly rendered and filter naturally through Vera’s perspective. Weather and altitude are not just backdrop; they inflect her isolation, status, and the quasi-religious aura that draws pilgrims and soldiers. The setting’s dual role as “pulpit and prison” nicely mirrors the thematic tension around power and captivity. Still, the environment rarely constrains specific tactical choices in-scene, limiting it slightly below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly realized and tightly integrated: the “feral loft beneath the dunes,” the shelves of jars, the beach town economy, and the early light all filter through Maren’s sensibility. Environmental detail supports tone and theme rather than reading like a tourist catalog; the jars and loft are both workspace and emotional landscape. The final image of the loft waiting, jars catching sun, recharges the opening description with added weight. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactics, it consistently shapes mood and identity in a way that feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina and Arctic sunset are richly rendered and inseparable from the premise: ice as memory and medium, the marina as vulnerable infrastructure, the sunset as a liminal hour when the “absolution” happens. Sound-specific details (teeth aching, frequencies, chorus of crystalline voices) filter the environment through Maren’s acoustic-engineer mind. The setting meaningfully constrains stakes—the same ice that holds grief could carry the shattering wave—and the final image of a humming memorial field and frozen Kael is charged. A slight bias toward visual/lyric flourish over tactile constraint in the climax keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tactics and theme, not just scenery. The environment directly constrains options (needing the freeze, the rain-activated viaduct, the waypoints with magnetic signatures). Recurring images of ice, basalt, and reflection charge the final view of the sanctuary as a “mirror” prison and the group’s glacial revolution. Sensory detail skews visual but is purposeful and filtered through Kael’s professional eye.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The maintenance tunnel is vividly rendered—the dripping water, acoustics, silt, panels, and pipes create a tangible, oppressive environment that mirrors her internal stakes. The setting isn’t just decorative: water lines, panel scratches, boot prints, and a shifted camera all function as evidence, tying environment directly to plot. The lantern works as a micro-setting object that charges the final image with historical and emotional weight. A slightly stronger sense of physical hazard or constraint from the flooded infrastructure could have heightened its functional pressure even further.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shop is vivid and sensorially rich—“vibrant hush,” dust motes, oil and old wood, the tiny ballerina—all filtered through Marcus’s reverent, guilt-tinged perception. Weather and light (storm clouds outside, the lamp’s circle of warm light) echo the internal stakes and charge the ending image of stepping into the gathering storm. The clockwork heart and music box function as micro-setting objects that fuse environment with theme (restoration, brokenness). While the space doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it strongly shapes the emotional and thematic register of every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive—the acid sea, brass hull, purposeless gears, and golden fog all contribute to a strong, coherent atmosphere that clearly shapes tone. Details are filtered through Fennec’s professional eye and thematic concerns (evolution of the sea, floating junkyard of a workshop), avoiding tourist-catalog description. That said, the environment rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; the acid sea and machinery could be swapped for another isolated lab without changing tactics. This keeps the setting from fully charging the final image despite its richness.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The social network archive and the “echo of forgotten songs” provide a strong, distinctive atmospheric frame, and the idea of memorials in abandoned digital corners is vivid and tonally apt. The patch functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final choice. Still, much of the archive is handled abstractly (logs, caches, servers) rather than through tactile, scene-level interaction that constrains her options. A bit more lived-in, sensory contact with the tools/environment under pressure would lift this toward the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes, with salt-wind apples and groaning ice, is specific, atmospheric, and thematically interwoven with ideas of fracture and reconstitution. The setting actively charges choices and images—the boys beneath the apple branch, the constantly breaking ice echoing clan tensions—even if it does not physically constrain tactics moment to moment. The world’s oddity (apple trees thriving in cold, vintage mirrors in a lighthouse) feels intentional and coherent within the lightly speculative frame. A slightly tighter link between environmental peril and immediate stakes could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Arctic setting is vivid and sensorially grounded—the “drift-ice marina” music, calving bergs, prefab shelter, and thin walls all feel lived-in and selective. Environment and recurring objects (marina, ice, parasol) charge the final image, where Vera listens to the marina’s “song of dissolution and persistence” as a crystallization of the stakes. The geography and physical logic of boat, floe, and camp are always clear, and weather and ice meaningfully frame what’s possible. This earns a high score; it might press into the very top tier if the physical environment constrained a critical on-page choice more directly, not just thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, and autumn wind are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marco’s sensibility, with the grafting details doubling as occupational texture and metaphor. The pavilion’s “amber glow” and elevated vantage give a distinct micro-setting that suits the intimate, suspended-feeling conversation. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain choice beyond the missed bus and isolation; it’s more mood than obstacle. Nonetheless, the recurring light/amber imagery effectively charges the final image of them sitting together as the season deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert, dunes, kinetic parapet, and murmuring pavilion are vivid and highly specific, filtered through Maya’s professional perception. The setting is not decorative: the parapet’s pressure language and the pavilion’s hushed responsiveness literally shape how the ritual is enacted. The final image of a “clearing…beneath the singing dunes” is charged by everything learned about the environment’s sentience and memory. This integration of world rules with action and theme is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are sharply drawn and recur meaningfully, with nature’s reclamation mirroring emotional repair. Details like vines climbing, broken windows, and the scent at dusk charge the final image and reinforce tone without feeling touristic. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, but it credibly shapes what is possible emotionally—a safe, liminal space for gathering and planning. The occupational lens (archivist) also colors how objects and landscape are noticed.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library at dawn, chandelier, shadows, and the rose-gold light are vivid and purposeful, consistently reinforcing the themes of supposed finality versus ongoing growth. The dictionary on the lectern and the word “complete” under the refracted rainbows elegantly charge the final image. Setting is strongly filtered through Maren’s scholarly perspective rather than feeling like a neutral backdrop. It shapes meaning more than tactical options, but it does so with precision and consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog sculpture garden is vivid, tactile, and persistently present, with weathered steel, corroded arches, and living fog that shapes how they move and perceive. The environment directly constrains choices (limited visibility, need for markers) and charges the final image of the chalk line on the corroded arch in mist. Detail is economical yet specific; the sculptures’ decayed, un-catalogued status mirrors memory’s erosion without feeling like a blunt symbol. The only thing holding this just shy of the 9-band is that other senses beyond sight and abstract “hum” could have been used slightly more to deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar observatory above a sea of clouds is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility—tools, tremors, the Moon’s face, and the clouds as visible time. Setting details like the shaking foundation and dome view support tone and theme and recur at the end with the leaf falling through clouds. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices beyond providing the telescope/transit frame, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Mount Serenity hospice above the clouds is vividly sketched and tonally apt, and the clouds recur as a quiet counterpoint to human stakes. Details like “lavender and ozone” and the cotton-sea outside Richard’s window feel selective and atmospheric rather than touristic. The most charged “setting” functionally is the broken vinyl as an object that anchors memory and the final image. The mountain environment itself rarely constrains choices, so it’s powerful mood rather than fully integrated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal observatory floating above the cloudline, Bent Constellation, and post–spoon-bending cosmos are vivid, specific, and integrated with the premise. Setting is filtered through Mira’s scholarly/astronomical bias, and details like the dome opening to the pre-dawn sky and the isle drifting “toward inevitable noon” directly charge the temporal and thematic stakes. The environment genuinely constrains the choice window (the approach of noon) rather than serving as mere backdrop. World rules feel consistent and are conveyed economically.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden behind the hedge maze is richly drawn and tonally precise—“crystalline flowers…petals rippling with bioluminescent patterns that mapped unfamiliar stars” is a standout image. Setting clearly marks the crossing into liminal space and supports the theme of old and new magics meeting, but it doesn’t strongly constrain choice beyond being the one place where this work can happen. Details are filtered through Maren’s sensibility enough to avoid the tourist-catalog feel and carry through to the final image of the garden blooming “nostalgic innovation.” A bit more tactile interaction with environment during the ritual could further integrate setting and action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, cliffs, and light behavior are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with both action (her polishing, arranging, and embedding glass) and theme (softened light versus fire). The environment directly shapes what’s possible—the openings for sun/moonlight, the mist’s filtering, and the stone walls as a canvas for her “constellation.” Specific details like the flat stone table and Eastern wall for morning light ground the lyricism. Setting clearly charges the final image without feeling like postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The moss-eaten data center is vividly and economically realized—server racks, birds in cooling ducts, icicles bleeding into “irregular constellations” all feel specific and thematically charged. Environment consistently mirrors and deepens the emotional and conceptual stakes (surveillance maps vs. honest organic patterns, tomb of technology vs. living sanctuary). While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it does structurally define what kind of encounter is possible here (a refuge rather than a confrontation). The recurring environmental motifs feed directly into the story’s tone and meaning without becoming overbearing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “feral nexus” of three rivers and the enveloping mist are vivid, specific, and constantly present; they shape perception and echo the story’s emotional and structural swirl. The environment constrains action (slippery rocks, dangerous current, low visibility) and motivates the swimmer’s training choice as well as the novelist’s vigil. The seashell and notebook act as micro-setting objects that carry charged history and directly inflect the final action of writing. The last image—writing in encroaching darkness as the nexus dims—reweights the setting into a charged, almost ritual space.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The verdant arbor, dew, harvest moon, and living vines are vividly drawn and tightly integrated into action rather than static description. The setting’s rules (vines as instruments, timing with moon and sun) feel coherent and learned through Maera’s behavior. Environmental details—birds’ silence, green twilight, the moon fading as she sings—mirror the story’s spiritual stakes without feeling overdetermined. The setting does constrain choices somewhat (she must use these vines, at this place and time), though that constraint could be pushed harder.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly realized: the withered subarctic orchard in a crater, frozen aurora, and suspended birds establish both mood and world rules quickly and precisely. Environmental details aren’t mere backdrop—they explain why she can work now and charge objects like the discarded orchard debris and the storybook plate. The cold, arrested world mirrors her suspended grief without slipping into overt symbolism. The residual glimmer of starlight in the refuse at the end effectively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered and functionally integral: its dome, gold-veined marble, and acoustics are inseparable from both plot and concept. Seasonal detail and light angles (dawn, noon, dusk, midnight) are not mere decoration but part of the investigative method. The environment constrains and enables her discoveries, and the final memory of “sound preserved in marble and memory” is charged by all the prior sensory work. This feels like a place only this story could occupy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze grotto under starlight, “shingled hush,” and the cracked lamp chimney create a vividly particular environment that feels lived-in and strange without exposition. Details like oxidized metal, snowmelt carving paths, and “where bronze met bone” do double duty as worldbuilding and emotional mirror. The lamp and grotto architecture constrain what’s possible (careful orientation, light-dependent revelation, descent to a “deepest point”) and charge the final image of faintly glowing weights. It stops just shy of 9-band because the environment shapes perception and symbolism more than concrete tactical dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The loft with its rain-beaded skylight, the kettle, the ash wood, and the tools create a vivid, lived-in micro-setting that mirrors her interior state without feeling like blunt symbolism. Weather and light evolve (“pearl to slate”) in tandem with the work, subtly time-stamping the emotional progression. The tent world and lions appear as remembered setting that meaningfully contextualize her philosophy of impermanence. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it does charge the final image and serve as an effective “ring” for this quiet performance of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The kinetic lagoon above the clouds, floating stones, and thermal currents are vivid and integrated into the emotional logic (motion versus stuckness, erosion, suspended time). Details are filtered strongly through Kera’s mind, which keeps the worldbuilding from feeling like a tour. The recurring images of the carousel, lagoon, and cliff erosion cohere into a convincing physical-metaphorical space that charges the final reflection on “the lagoon still turns.” The environment doesn’t quite constrain concrete tactics, but it clearly charges the thematic stakes and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly realized—the broken skylights, dead departures board, and defunct ducts all feel specific and lived-in, filtered through Maya’s engineer’s eye. Setting meaningfully constrains choices (water infiltration, solar panels, heat buildup all become the exact resources/constraints that define her tactics). The sextant and the terminal-as-navigation-point recur to charge the final image and theme. It’s highly effective, just shy of extraordinary only because the surrounding world beyond the terminal is kept abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are standout strengths: the crystal forecourt, petrichor, hidden sunrise, and soundless sanctuary are vivid, specific, and thematically aligned. Details are filtered through Maren’s sensibility—time, silence, and sound dominate what she notices. The environment actively shapes the beat: the rain-wet crystals “whisper,” the drying stones and fading petrichor mark the temporal limit of her playing, and the sanctuary’s silence heightens the risk and relief of making sound. The final image of her leaving, with the city clock striking six and the forecourt as a place she can return to, shows the setting charging closure rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The barge canal, rotting dock, and industrial dawn are vivid and tightly integrated with mood and theme, not mere backdrop. Environmental specifics (twilight reflections, radio silence, decaying barges, the waking city) mirror Marcus’s transition from illusion to harsh clarity. The sundial and maps function as micro-setting objects that constrain and direct his choices. Setting consistently supports tone and concept without over-description or disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor, golden dock, fog, snow, and “oceanic hush” create a rich, coherent atmosphere that’s filtered through Maren’s sensibility. Details like the snow accumulating on her shoulders as she works and the fog shrinking her world to “a small sphere of gray light and golden wood” feel both specific and thematically apt. The environment supports the contemplative, preservational mood and charges the final image, but it doesn’t materially constrain her choices or tactics. That lack of functional constraint keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The garden is vivid and integral: “shadowed,” autumnal, leaves like “forgotten correspondence,” and specifically echoed in Thomas’s carpet pattern (“an autumn garden where nothing ever died, only transformed”). Setting details are filtered through Marina’s and Thomas’s sensibilities (camphor, crimson leaf as thread), echoing the weaving and transformation motifs. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it does heavily charge the emotional and thematic stakes and the final image. Specific sensory notes beyond the visual (smell of decay and camphor) further enrich atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, clockwork servants, and hydroponic gardens are vivid and integrally filtered through the prince’s priorities. The environmental constraint—no open skies, a mechanical cavern—directly charges the impossibility of true flight and makes the bird’s song and bioluminescent body devastatingly poignant. World rules (manufactured shadows, steam-driven fountains) remain consistent and unobtrusively informative. Setting more strongly charges stakes and the final image than it shapes tactical micro-choices, which is the only thing keeping this just shy of the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian lagoon, dunes, volcanic sand, and grafted beach plants create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels both tactile and mythic. Setting is tightly integrated with theme: sand “remembers the fire,” the lagoon is the ritual site, and the plants’ grafts mirror scar tissue and emotional healing. The final return to “here at the obsidian lagoon” charges the closure image effectively. However, the environment shapes symbolism more than concrete constraints on choice, which holds it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and thematically integrated: the dry, graffitied fountains and stalled geese create a coherent, melancholy cosmology. The “city of forgotten fountains” is not backdrop but mechanism and symbol, literally structuring Mara’s path and the solution, and the fountains’ reawakening charges the final image. World rules around memory, time, and the geese’s pause are clear enough and consistently invoked. A hint more tactile, non-visual sensory grounding in the key scene could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nebula garden, petals, and bioluminescent blooms are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through the Keeper’s long familiarity, giving the setting genuine atmosphere rather than postcard abstraction. The environment charges the final image of seeds drifting “like petals toward distant stars,” tying world and theme together. However, the garden rarely constrains or forces specific tactical choices; it functions more as charged backdrop than as an active obstacle or resource. Still, it’s a major strength of the piece and contributes significantly to tone and resonance.

    The cemetery and ancient greenhouse are vividly evoked and tightly integrated with Elena’s vocation and the story’s mood. The butterflies, glass, vines, tools, and ribbon all recur and evolve, charging the space as a liminal classroom between life and death. The greenhouse meaningfully shapes what can happen—Thomas’s appearances, the monarchs’ passage, the final empty stillness. The final image of her leaving the greenhouse with tools and ribbon, as the place falls back into silence, is strongly environment-charged.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian ridge, encroaching sea, and clock tower are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s ritualistic gaze. The tower and pendulum are not mere backdrop; they physically and conceptually constrain what’s possible, especially in the “pause that shouldn’t exist.” Environmental detail (retreating tide, tower’s height, tide pools at the foundation) elegantly mirrors the thematic creep of grief and the need for measured resistance. Setting and object-as-setting are tightly woven into the final beats, charging the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, and nocturnal atmosphere are vividly and purposefully rendered, with details like the painted silo “drinking in starlight” and the “velveteen gloom” doing real atmospheric work. Setting is filtered through Mira’s professional familiarity, giving the place a lived-in specificity. Crucially, the silo is not just backdrop but also the physical locus of the secret (the floorboard and box) and the charged final image (“cobalt silence”). It stops short of 9-band because environment constrains action lightly rather than exerting strong, choice-defining pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and interior chamber are vividly realized and immediately grounded in action (climbing, breath clouding, unpacking tools). Setting is not mere backdrop: the spire’s volcanic origin drives the Thermal Tapestry idea and the frozen lake above hidden warmth charges the final image. The kingfisher quill and obsidian-infused ink function as micro-setting objects that concretize her craft and recur at the end. Environment and object meaningfully constrain and inform the conceptual choices, especially the geothermal solution.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the ember alcove, mist, chimney, and watch-towers are not just atmospheric but functionally cloak her illegal work. World rules (story famine, banned music, patrols) are inferred through concrete spatial and occupational detail rather than exposition dumps. Recurring elements—embers, mist, glowing dust, the hidden floor panel—culminate in a final image where environment and object (“the dust would speak first”) clearly charge the theme. Minor room remains only in how directly the physical environment constrains a final choice; it shapes the situation more than the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery is not just backdrop; its rules (no permanent art, exhaust vents, back room) dictate her tactics and make her deception possible. Recurring objects—the rocking chair, easel, porcelain mask, urn-turned-art—are spatially clear and charged, and the gallery’s purpose as a site of “controlled disappearance” is intertwined with every choice. The setting directly charges the final image of Mira preserving rebuilt masks in a place ostensibly dedicated to loss. World detail is economical yet evocative, with no white-room stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken city and storm-drain “philosopher’s cell” are vivid, specific, and continually reframed through Marcellus’s professional gaze. Environmental constraints (water level, patrol boats, pipe network, sedimentary layers) directly shape his tactics for excavation and concealment, and the physical layering of ruins mirrors and charges the final image of layered narratives. The chronometer cogs and waterproof cylinder function as micro-settings/tools that decisively charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet library and autumnal light are vivid, specific, and recur to charge both process (“the library held them in its velvet embrace”) and closure (“velvet autumn air,” last leaves falling). The environment mirrors the internal work—soft, shawl-like safety juxtaposed with cold war outside—and the zither as a tool is embedded in that space. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it functions as a crucial container: a liminal, almost sacred room where different factions can risk vulnerability. This is atmospheric, economical, and thematically integrated at a level close to publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted greenhouse, broken glass, and triple-moon light are vivid and thematically aligned with decay vs. regrowth. Details like branches reclaiming the rusted frame and the soil that “remembered abundance” integrate atmosphere with the premise of memory-cultivating fruit. The setting mostly frames and charges the action rather than constraining tactics, but it does meaningfully color Mara’s choices and the final image. Overall, the environment feels specific, lived-in, and symbolically resonant without becoming a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the lightning collection tower, amber and honey-colored light, and silent agricultural zones are concretely evoked and filtered through Mira’s eye for geometric beauty. World rules—lightning capture, drone hives, EMP damage—are introduced through situation rather than clunky exposition, and the recurring “honey/nectar” palette supports tone and theme. The tower and its stairs function as more than backdrop: they grant her physical access to the engineer and to the literal source of the EMP, so place shapes possibility. The final image of modified drones at “nectar-colored dusk” recharges earlier environmental details nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the quiet bay, hammered-silver water, lilac-and-salt air, and the Ashford house’s interior all feel tactiley inhabited. Details like “pale rectangles in the paint” on the sill and the migration of cups and plates are specific and integrated into action. Environment and object-as-setting (the house, the orris shard) clearly charge the final understanding, even if they don’t strongly constrain physical options. This is near-elite atmosphere, held back only by the fact that the world doesn’t significantly limit or redirect tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drowned garden and underwater city are vividly and economically realized—kelp as former rose trellises, coral in marble cracks, anemones occupying benches. These details are well-filtered through Marina’s long perspective and the woman’s discovery, creating a coherent, melancholic atmosphere. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (the statues turning toward their new guardian amid the pulsing garden). However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more emotional backdrop than a tactical pressure on actions.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The infinite staircase is vivid and functionally integrated: landings, temperature shifts, and dimensional curvature all feel specific and rule-bound rather than generic weirdness. The dice and walls function as micro-setting elements—tools and surfaces she uses to test and inscribe reality. The environment clearly constrains her choices (only up/down, no exits in sight) and charges the final image of endless motion. A touch more tactile, bodily interaction with the space under duress (exhaustion, vertigo, physical wear) could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-muted city, and moonlit workspace are vividly drawn and always filtered through Mira’s sensibility as an insomniac artist and ex-linguist. Setting does real work: the filthy glass and smog transform the moonlight into a particular, golden, almost-liquid agent that literally “pools” and triggers the threshold state. The greenhouse as borrowed sanctuary and the withering plants echo her precarious existence without feeling schematic. The brush as a tooled object and the moon-tipped motif also act as micro-setting that directly charges the final image and her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto city, Veil Falls, bioluminescent fungi, and museum-bakery hybrid are vividly imagined and consistently filtered through Celeste’s perspective as both guide and refugee. Environmental constraints—no sunlight, constant thunder of water, cave-grown grain—are not just decorative; they shape how culture is preserved and charge the final image. The opera glass lens and waterfall in particular deepen the thematic interplay between obscured light and curated hope. A slight further integration of physical constraint into on-page choices could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, rocky shore, tide, and hunger stone are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and meaning. The low tide literally enables access to the stone, and the lighthouse tools (clocks, beacon wire) materially shape Silas’s tactics in modifying the yoyo. Environmental elements recur and reweight at the end—the hunger stone blazing underwater and the counter-clockwise clock resonating with the seed charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“slow exhale of low tide,” “rain hammered the tower’s windows”) without slipping into tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse, warped mirrors, and green luminance are vivid and tightly integrated with the emotional arc, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. Setting details are filtered through Vera’s anxiety and fascination, giving the environment a psychic as well as physical presence. The mirrors and funhouse geometry actively shape her options (forced confrontation with reflection, a sanctuary for “those who'd learned to love their own dissolution”). While strong, the carnival itself is still somewhat archetypal; adding one or two more idiosyncratic, pressure-relevant details could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating orchard and driftwood circle are vividly realized and deeply integrated into action—the trees, wood, and ropes are not just backdrop but the literal instrument she must play to survive. World rules (roots drinking from sea, resonances sketching patterns on water) stay consistent and are learned through her goal-directed experimentation. Environment meaningfully constrains options: in open water, her only possible defense is to transform the orchard’s physical structure into a resonant system. The final image of the orchard turning its slow circle, “alive and singing still,” is charged by all this prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly interwoven with action: the turtles’ shells, the Brass Sea glare, the caverns of humid darkness, and the sediment of shells all constrain what Mira can do and how she learns the truth. Environmental details (maintenance shafts, welded gate, underside markings) aren’t postcard flourishes; they are the delivery system for the revelations. The recurring objects (shells, whistles, watchers, turtles) charge the final image, where the city’s movement literally stops in the same harsh, sea-glare atmosphere. World rules feel consistent and legible without bogging down the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused railway station, ivy, pigeons, and the rosebush create a vivid, textured atmosphere that supports the theme of buried and resurfacing truths. Details are well chosen and filtered through Helena’s historical sensibility, and the rosebush/ivy recur to charge the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices—this could almost occur in any abandoned archive-like space—so setting is more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the specificity and the ending’s mirror glance to the station solidly integrate place with tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly realized—columns “like drunken dancers,” light as “hushed blaze,” water claiming the terrace—creating a strong atmospheric anchor. Setting is integrated with action (wading, examining cracks, sealing clay) rather than remaining postcard description. The recurrent inkwell and the water-changed architecture both charge the final image of him leaving part of himself “archived in stone.” While the environment doesn’t impose sharp tactical constraints, it deeply supports mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library is vividly realized—reinforced glass, pressure-groan of the sea, water-damaged cabinets—and the blackout meaningfully alters what is possible (unlocked door, darkness, silence). Setting is well-integrated into action rather than touristic description, and the final image of the ocean pressing against glass charges the themes of preservation and pressure. The environmental constraint is more atmospheric than tactically constraining beyond the blackout, but it’s nonetheless central to tone and plausibility. A touch more use of physical risk from the sea or infrastructure could have raised tension and integration further.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating island tea garden, glass basilica, steam, planters, and sky tiers are richly realized and filtered through Mira’s grief, giving the setting strong atmospheric and thematic weight. The “descends while ascending” phenomenon and the basilica’s refracted light meaningfully mirror and charge the paradox of grieving while continuing to live, especially when reprised at the end. The garden of cranes is both literal environment and emotional architecture in the closing image. The only slight limiter is that the environment shapes meaning more than it constrains specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory, ruined village, and desert below are sharply realized and consistently filter through Amal’s priorities (instruments, altitude, life support, dust storms). The geode as a recurring object functions as micro-setting and tool, literally mounted in the array and physically pressed to her forehead in the final image, charging the closure. World rules around perturbations and unused futures are sketched efficiently and stay consistent, giving the speculative frame credibility without bogging it down. Atmosphere—austere, high-altitude isolation over a scarred world—perfectly matches the story’s conceptual and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory, hillside, fractured dome, and “brilliant dimness” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s woven through action rather than paused for description. The physical space matters: the broken dome provides the aperture for the drone, and the observatory-as-node conceptually charges the network of star-trail observatories mentioned later. Technical and environmental details (LEDs on ancient instruments, drone launch, dusk sky) feel plausible and filtered through Mara’s professional eye. Setting strongly supports tone and theme, though it lightly constrains tactics rather than forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt terrace, ocean wind, and forgotten shore with driftwood carvings create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that suits the story’s reflective, liminal mood. The carved watch hand functions as a charged micro-setting object linked tightly to the final image. The environment mostly supports tone rather than constraining choices, so its role is more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the specificity of shore/terrace/watch coheres into a lived, memorable place.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    The parapet, mist, valley lights, and moon are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s attention, creating a strong, hushed atmosphere. The storm-worn neutrality of the fortress thematically mirrors the “neutral territory” between apology and forgiveness. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics, it does meaningfully shape mood and the sense of precarious balance. The antique drawer pull functions as a micro-setting object that charges the central moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal setting is vivid and tightly filtered through Marina’s perceptions—fog as “regret,” the humming utility poles, the creaking dock all mirroring her interior state without feeling like generic scenery. The micro-setting elements (kayak launch, breakwater, tricky current) meaningfully frame her choice to commit to the crossing. Recurring objects-as-setting—the compass and utility poles—charge the final image of leaving the shore. Environment and tools constrain and inflect her options enough to meet the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful, especially the bioluminescent lake as both physical marvel and thematic engine of symbiosis/empathy. Details like “rain that matched her mood—jaded, relentless, oddly beautiful” and the limestone descent are filtered through Maya’s sensibility rather than reading like neutral postcards. The lake meaningfully charges the final image and reweights the entire story without bogging it in description. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but it does frame and deepen the central choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard and permanent moon are vivid, coherent, and tightly integrated with the magic—the trees’ responses and the moonlit blossoms literally participate in the transformation. The spices, blossoms, and silver-white bloom recur to charge the final image (spices in the soil, bridge between worlds). Description is lush but mostly purposeful, rarely drifting into decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The midnight glade above clouds is vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the story’s metaphysical concerns; details like “clouds dense as marble” and “silver-barked trees whose branches disappeared into distances that defied geometry” feel specific and purposeful. The setting doesn’t just decorate—it frames the ritual as only-possible-here and charges the cost of the journey. Recurring objects (saucer, cards, tablecloth) function as a micro-setting that shapes the climax. Environmental constraint is more symbolic than tactical, which is the only thing holding this below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Meridian and the recreation bay are vivid in a few strokes—the “patchwork quilt of salvaged titanium and prayer,” walls of photographs, bioluminescent strips—creating a strong atmosphere without overdescription. Setting is filtered through Ren’s priorities (grief, relics of humanity) rather than generic SF cataloguing. The ship itself doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond being the container for the photo-wall, so it reads more as charged backdrop than active constraint. The micro-setting of photos-as-membrane does do meaningful work in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: black volcanic sand, the active volcano, and the celestial alignment all mirror and charge the transformation theme. Textures (sand vs silk and marble) are used incisively to contrast her past life with the present rawness. The environment doesn't strongly constrain her options in a practical sense, but it heavily shapes meaning and atmosphere, especially through the impending eruption. Overall, the place feels lived-in rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: glowing crystalline walls, the half-finished sundial, and the blackout itself all feel tactile and integrated with Mira’s actions. The sundial in particular functions as both environment and tool, constraining how messages move and charging the final image when she traces its angles for confirmations. The luminous fort’s visual conceit mainly supports atmosphere rather than choice, but the overall specificity and integration are strong and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and original: frictionless physics, tidal bluff with “memory of friction,” eel geometries, and aurora all feel integrated rather than decorative. Environmental rules constrain choice—her undulating movement, the danger of objects sliding away, and the bluff as one of the few stable places matter to her tactics. The aurora and rocks recur and charge the final image, with the aurora’s shift from “borrowed” to “earned” reframing the world’s status. There’s a slight bias toward visual description over other senses, but urgency and tone still come through strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds, with copper dome, darkroom, and cloud sea, is vivid and thematically tuned to revelation and surveillance. Weather and height function as more than scenery: the storm’s apex defines “when masks slip,” and the observatory’s isolation enables both safety and complicity in witnessing. Objects like the darkroom timer, negatives, and bus timetable are integrated into action rather than static description. The setting very nearly constrains concrete choices, but in practice serves more as charged stage and metaphor than a hard tactical limiter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass atrium, fractured light, marble, and brook create a vivid, coherent environment filtered through Theodora’s sensibility, and they support the “dignified chaos” tone. The half-painted sundial is particularly strong, functioning as both world-building and a concrete tool for coded communication that charges the ending image. Sensory details are purposeful rather than touristic, and spatial choreography in the duel is clear. The environment does not heavily constrain tactical choices moment-to-moment, which keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted library, vines, moon, and card catalogs converted to planters are vivid, purposeful details that shape both action and theme. Environment and objects constrain and enable choices: the abandoned library’s physical decay creates room for the garden, and its card catalogs become literal seedbeds. The final image—seeds in rust, old letters as mulch, visitors trading books for plants—charges the setting as an active agent in the story’s meaning. This is high-level, economical worldbuilding tightly fused to the characters’ project.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grand Central’s lower concourse and the tidal arbor are vivid without feeling touristic, and the recurring objects (anniversary clock, compasses, moonstone piano) are tightly integrated. The environment meaningfully shapes both possibility and closure: the liminal arbor can only exist until night, the breathing islands sync with his music, and the clock’s state literally marks change. The use of embedded compasses in vintage ads and then as floating instruments is particularly strong as a POV-filtered world detail. A bit more tactile or bodily interaction with the station space under pressure could push this toward the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The island ridge, irises, and oncoming monsoon are vivid and functional, not postcard: the ridge’s age, the stone marker, and early bloom frame this as a ritual site under temporal pressure. The dream-space setting is especially strong, with “flowers blazed with impossible colors” and culturally specific ceremonies that concretize the abstraction of “collective memory.” World rules (shared dreaming, the tree’s chemistry) are consistent and integrated into action rather than dumped. Still, the physical environment constrains choice only lightly; more tactile engagement with weather/terrain at the climax could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The islet, mist, wet stones, and post-rain air create a strong, consistent atmosphere that mirrors Marisol’s internal weather without feeling purely decorative. The compass and the specific patch of cerulean sky function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; it mostly provides mood and plausibility for the washed-up objects. Sensory detail is selective and poetic rather than overstuffed.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned carnival setting is distinct and utilized well, particularly the spatial relationship between the window views and the hidden vault. The contrast between the dusty, rotting prizes and the living seeds creates a strong atmospheric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exceptional, blending the industrial decay of "rusted ribs" with the surreal vitality of the "preserved crimson" apples in a way that actively charges the story's mood. The greenhouse functions as a crucible, compressing the pressure of the ocean and the aurora into the work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the interplay of golden hour and moonlight is rendered with vivid, specific imagery that anchors the magic system. The station feels tangible and atmospheric, directly serving the plot's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong, specific detailing grounds the scene; the juxtaposition of the "humming refrigeration units" with the "molten silica" creates a vivid, textural atmosphere. The environment effectively anchors the character's isolation, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than an active pressure system.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details like "skeletal orange fingers" and "rust-scented air" that ground the scene. The environment feels distinct and thematically resonant, though it functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "ambered hush" serving as an effective sensory anchor that constrains the mood. The physical details of the ridge fort and the visual of the fading star create a strong sense of place, though the environment functions more as a backdrop for reflection than a source of active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the frozen courtyard and the "twilight that never changed" provide the necessary constraints for the epiphany. The ice violin is a brilliant micro-setting element that charges the final image. Sensory details like "sheet music written in a language of pure cold" vividly support the "mundane mysticism" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly ornamental, sensory details ("fractured rainbows," "crystal whispering"). The atmosphere successfully supports the tone, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The juxtaposition of bureaucratic "luck measurements" with the organic reality of the garden creates a distinct, memorable atmosphere. Sensory details like the copper veins in the marble and the botanical dyes ground the fantasy elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details of the "crystalline moths" and the "magnetic nexus" are vivid and ground the speculative elements effectively. The visual of light bending and the "triple sunsets" creates a strong sense of place. However, the station interior feels generic, serving merely as a container for the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The flooded opera house is atmospheric, effectively establishing a mood of ruin and reverence. However, the description leans on standard tropes ("murky water," "flickering lanterns") rather than specific, surprising sensory details that constrain the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The weather station provides a stark, isolating backdrop that amplifies the theme of precision versus chaos. The dawn light through the translucent paper is a strong visual anchor, though the environment functions more as a container than an active antagonist in this specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "weeping walls" and the "beaded valve wheel" creating a distinct, pressurized environment. The setting actively constrains the mood and supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; details like "books that sprouted mushrooms" and the "roots burrowed through ceiling stones" effectively ground the abstract theme in decay. The environment actively supports the "decomposition as wisdom" concept, though some descriptions lean slightly into standard ruin tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the eclipse provides atmospheric utility, the setting descriptions often lapse into purple prose ("hush of dreaming roots," "earth itself seemed to be remembering") rather than concrete, grounding detail. The physical space of the terrace does not constrain the characters' choices or interactions in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific, integrating the "curved metal wall," "rust patterns," and the "tilt" into a cohesive atmosphere. The environment effectively grounds the abstract concepts, though the sensory details are sometimes filtered through a slightly detached lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmosphere is palpable, with the lighthouse serving as a potent, recurring anchor that effectively charges the final image. Sensory details like the "scarred wood," "weathered hands," and the "microdot" ground the abstract nature of the conversation in a convincing physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "dimensional anchor" described as three realities pressing together is a fantastic, grounding image. The sensory details of the loop pedal's "sound of no sound" and the breathing walls create a vivid, specific atmosphere that supports the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the action; the "glass spire" and "mirrored horizon" are not just backdrop but the active mechanism enabling the protagonist's work. Sensory details (cardamom, pale colors, silence) effectively ground the ethereal concept, making the environment felt.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inverted viaduct with upward-dripping rain creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that effectively mirrors the protagonist's disorientation. The physical logic of the "drop and ripple" window is handled consistently and charges the final image of falling upward.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details are strong, particularly the tactile descriptions of vibration and the "mirrored hush" of the cavern. The sensory work successfully grounds the reader in Mira's deaf experience, though the lack of a specific temporal anchor limits the setting's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is established with sensory precision, particularly the "amber-lit streets" and the "darkening cascades" of ivy. The courtyard serves as an effective sanctuary that contrasts with the external political pressure, grounding the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse shards, salt rime, and ceiling-joist tomatoes are specific, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s scientific eye. Environment constrains her movement (crunching glass, sagging frames) and finally stains her skin—micro-setting that charges the last image. No impossible geography; spatial choreography clean. Details evolve causally: flood → silt → sprouting seeds; pattern taught by 25% mark.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canyon wall warmth, star shadows, and frost lattices are filtered through glass-maker’s heat-trained perception; setting constrains her reading method and supplies the final image. Micro-setting (ledger strip as “kiln-scorched map”) charges closure. No spatial drift; bodies and distances track. Slight over-cranked lyricism in “drifting resonance” phrase, but it serves tone, so −0.2 only.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conservatory is not backdrop but instrument: winterglass panels that refuse to fog even under breath become the metaphor for Marina’s irreversible deafness. The tuning-fork case is handled twice—first as relic, finally as talisman—its silver tarnish echoing the frost that never melts. Spatial choreography is flawless: sensors are clipped, tablet angled, breath withheld, all tracked without drift. Final image of spectrum bands refracted onto perpetual-winter roses fuses setting with emotional cost, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Kelp-wrapping, barnacle seals, phosphorescent light, and folded architecture are vivid, selective, and filtered through Meridian’s professional eye. The library’s non-Euclidean geometry is shown by how she hesitates at the four-place reading room, integrating setting into action. Environment directly enables the climax: impossible spaces become tombs. Micro-setting (the lens fragments) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.1)
    Terra-cotta arbor and tarnished bell are tactile, weather-reactive, and spatially tracked; they constrain where gifts must be left and where revelation must occur. Moon-lit ridge and “breath forming clouds” supply sensory economy without cataloging. At 778 words the world is necessarily sketch-wide, yet the micro-setting (arbor as lantern-stage) meaningfully shapes the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct’s blooming wisteria constrains the healing ritual—petals drop into the camera’s inverted image, charging the final golden pollen.

The metal-jar seeds become the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—five measured paces, northeast corner, wall panel yield. Selective sensory economy: no visual overdose, sound of boots builds tempo. Setting constrains choice—only this booth layout yields the vault location.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse-as-pressure-chamber: salt-dark, aurora leaks through wrecks, geothermal vents decide what can fruit. The ashen forge is handled twice—once fed, once cooled—its-gray-quiet smoke a constraint against detection by surface world. Apple scent, barnacle scars, and the iron spiral rail return in tactile loops that mirror memory crystallizing. Micro-setting rule satisfied: forge+apple+aurora together force the final alloying choice.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Emerald Station’s jade tiles, western bench, and skylights are sketched sparingly yet atmospherically; the color clash of emerald + amber + silver is memorable. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mira moves from bench to curtain to final arrangement. The setting never physically constrains her choices, however; it’s backdrop, not crucible, so the 9-gate stays shut.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment (abandoned control room, dripping eaves, annealer hum) is lived-in and choice-guiding: refrigeration units that no longer refrigerate both enable glasswork and taunt with lost purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Storm-battered fort, flaking gold leaf, and dying star act as micro-setting objects that literally constrain choice—wind blocks exits, booklet-pages delimit knowledge, last star times the hush. Tactile specificity: “centuries of weather had worn the mortar away” grounds scale without catalog bloat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s merchant-eye: value is ascribed to gold leaf first, temperature second. The 9-gate is missed because environment never physically endangers her (no broken stair, collapsing beam), so setting shapes tone more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)

Sensory layering—silk-on-metal wing sound, cold-light hologram that feels warm—keeps perception embodied. Spatial choreography is clean: bay → deck → bay, no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchestra pit’s knee-high water, submerged music stand, and lantern jitter are filtered through a violinist’s eye—tools become terrain. Sensory economy is good: cold water on skin, flutter of decayed paper, sudden sideways flame bend. Micro-setting works—the waxed-wrapped journal hidden between floorboards—constraining the final kneeling plunge. Only nit: no olfactory or auditory relic of flood (mold, distant drip) to widen the palette.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting: handled, smudged, back-lit, it constrains the final choice and charges the image. Mountain air sharpness and aurora fade provide sensory specificity filtered through Mira’s professional meteorologist gaze. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean—window, desk, doorway—never violating presence. Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is textured and selective: condensation “thick as wool,” rust “consumed everything,” the beaded wheel’s “welded beads—some machinist’s craft project.” Sensory hierarchy follows Mara’s fatigue and reporter eye. The tunnel constrains movement—single file, no side exits—so the discovery feels inevitable. The valve wheel re-enters the final image (“clinked against her back with each step”), charging the exit with tangible evidence, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Catacomb library is not postcard backdrop; mushroom-eaten shelves, root-split ceiling, and ink-fed flowers actively constrain what can be archived and when sky will intrude. Micro-setting (swan, stone, desk) is handled in tactile loops that charge the final shelf placement. Sensory economy is impeccable—every detail either decomposes or seeds future growth.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)

Environment and micro-object together constrain the historian’s posture of listening, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lighthouse beam and pub scarred wood are handled, re-handled, and finally reweighted as the charged image of open secrets. Spatial choreography clean: bar → window → black water → beam sweep. Weather and tide stay off-stage but the beam’s rhythm supplies temporal heartbeat. Sensory selectivity filters through Margaret’s photographer’s eye (“photography pun”) anchoring POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The basement “where distances refused to stay fixed” grounds every move; the humming anchor, breathing walls, and loop pedal’s metallic click act as micro-setting that constrains tactics. Sensory economy is tight—three senses interleaved in first 120 words—and the final image of white paint refracted by unstable light recharges the spatial rule. One minor slip: palette introduced late (after 40%) but earns partial waiver by reweighting the possession rule at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Glass spire + frozen lake function as micro-setting: the mirrored horizon literally bends perception, forcing Maya’s suspension between past/future and enabling her method. Nautilus shell is handled in three distinct beats, its spiral grooving her skin and charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (cardamom, creaking step, silver-to-gold light) is filtered through her memory-archaeologist bias. Environment constrains the only viable working hours and charges the closure when symmetry shatters.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glowing viaduct after rain is not mere backdrop—it constrains every move: appear only then, defy gravity only there, lose the power once the ripple forms. Rain dripping upward, boots unmoored, tablet phosphorescence—all are tactile, selective, and filtered through Maya’s trained attention. The micro-setting (underside of a bridge that exists “only between the drop and the ripple”) functions as both stage and countdown clock, forcing her final stance crystallization. Spatial choreography stays clean: inverted walk, sideways traverse, fall upward—each position tracks logically.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern’s acoustic architecture—stone that drinks echo, fabrics that absorb breath—functions as both setting and instrument; it literally constrains how sound/texture can be perceived.

The drum-maker’s half-built frames and the phonograph’s cracked casing evolve from clutter to tools, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory triage matches POV: meteorologist notices moisture-laden breeze, chemical scent replaced by wetland reek. Courtyard’s iron gate, fountain, ivy function as both sanctuary and trap—she’s safe yet visible from balconies, constraining her next move. Micro-setting of the brass tube becomes the story’s pivot. Missing one beat: no tactile description of the tube’s temperature or weight, a lost opportunity to ground the inciting gift.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Greenhouse acts as crucible: sterile racks force Dalton to confront absence; UV light re-tools his authentication skill into emotional assay. Crystal vial micro-setting constrains the final choice—its emptiness is the only vessel that still “remembers” her. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: lantern broker notices refraction angles before smell. No static cataloging; every detail (restoration lamps, sealed pod) advances stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terra-cotta wall that “moved like liquid… under starlight” is not backdrop; its shifting patterns physically guide Elena’s excavation and Marcus’s recognition, charging the final image.

Sensory triage is POV-driven—poet’s eye for visual metaphor, physicist’s for temporal texture—keeping detail selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken greenhouse with ankle-deep water and wind-bent shipwrecks is lived-in: she wades, lifts the bowl, uses acoustic surfaces. Glass, rust, salt, and apple flesh constrain movement and amplify sound, charging the final bowl-left-as-question image. Sensory economy is strong—no cataloguing, only details that affect the sonic task. Meets 9+ gate: the greenhouse architecture directly shapes her tactics and the closing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amber grotto is not scenery; its bioluminescent resin is cultivated to soften consent and mask the clinical act, literally lighting the half-truth. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting—handled, stained, filed—constraining every emotional transaction. Spatial choreography is clean: petal moves from Maren’s fingers → Thomas’s temple → her wrist → filing box, tracking the moral contamination. Setting charges the final image: the glowing walls reflect the counterfeit amber current now inside Thomas, environment mirroring internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The terrace is sketched with selective sensory cues—“soft lights illuminating spines while leaving the stars brilliant”—that mirror Marlena’s widening attention. The locket photo serves as micro-setting/object and is handled twice, constraining her gaze and later charging the final image. Maritime details (dockworkers’ faces, freight rates) are filtered through her professional eye, keeping exposition lean. Environment does not actively constrain physical choices, so the 9+ gate is missed, but specificity is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    Crystalline trees, glass fruit, and obsidian arbor are never mere postcard backdrop: the sculptor harvests fibers for her piece, the arbor’s black spiral hosts the vow and the reveal, and the crater-glow hours dictate nocturnal work sessions. Spatial choreography stays clean—paths among trees, arbor base as stage—so environment actively supplies materials and social stage rather than static shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal system is not backdrop; its liquid tilt and gravity slack directly enable the gondola approach and temporal bubble mechanics. Micro-setting (the Throat’s leaning towers, iron cages swinging without wind) constrains the final uncaging choreography and charges the echoed oar-stroke image. Sensory selection stays painterly-scientific—visual precision, acoustic anomalies—filtered through Mira’s vocation. One hairline slip: “water froze mid-ripple” is seen from outside the bubble, a micro POV flicker that keeps this just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard is not backdrop; its glowing fruit and drip-rate literally nourish the experiment that yields the answer. The chipped mosaic—half-eroded woman’s face—constrains Marius’s kneeling posture and later catches his tears, charging the final image. Stalactite water functions as both clock and reagent, its centuries-per-drop pace forcing Marius’s patience into bodily time. Spatial choreography is pristine: velvet bundle → dig → water → dissolve, every motion tracked against roots and stones.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prismatic escondite and fragment act as micro-setting, directly shaping Vesper’s dimensional sight and the climax’s staircase; auroras and salt-from-elsewhere are vivid, selective, POV-filtered. Spatial anchors hold, though “three dimensions sideways” compresses scale. Final image re-weights the sanctuary as threshold, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: drainage tray, formaldehyde air, and logbook constrain every action; the ink pot’s indigo stain on Mira’s fingers fuses paternal guilt with present labor. Sensory hierarchy is mortician-precise: smell, drainage glint, dawn light through high windows. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mira moves between bodies, equipment, and Pavel’s corner chair. Setting never slips into white-room; the antique pot’s reprise in the final paragraph recharges the space with inherited sin.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the bonsai labyrinth’s scale-shift supplies the thematic engine—compression spawns new time-rules. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notes fragrance refracting “through her concentration,” a scientist’s synesthesia. Spatial choreography holds as she exits workshop, enters corridors, tucks paper under stone. The miniature forest constrains her final choice; remove it and the conceptual repricing collapses—gate met for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Container labyrinths, barnacled pilings, and sodium-cyanide texture are filtered through the POV’s obsessive professional gaze; the setting literally constrains her tactics—she can only move at low tide, must climb rusted walls to eavesdrop, and stores evidence inside a metal box. The final image of poison refusing to dissolve in salt water recharges every earlier sensory cue. Micro-setting (the label itself) doubles as tool and talisman, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The collapsed copper dome, wind-tuned cello, and cliff-top acoustics constrain action and supply the literal instrument of revelation. Rust-and-blood ink is tactile and specific.

The setting charges the final image: open sky funnels forgotten voices into the broken dome where Marina sits transfixed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The raft city is sketched through motion—ropes fray, booths rot, tourists stumble—so environment actively threatens choices. Graffiti surfaces (Ferris wheel underside, hall of mirrors) function as micro-settings that constrain how messages can be hidden and read. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and touch, appropriate to a painter protagonist. Final image of murals glowing at sunset recharges the setting without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit summit and crater walls are filtered through Maya’s professional eye—shocked rock, melted glass, regolith prints—so topography guides every step. The hourglass grain functions as micro-setting/object that constrains the final ritual; its absence from Earth sand charges the “one grain among billions” moment. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent, heart-plant, ascent, rim-sit track cleanly. No tourist-catalog; each detail (300-degree swing, magnesium ribbons) earns its keep by enabling the chemical sunrise.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rail-depot-mist harbor is rendered through tactile, sonic, and thermal detail; every descriptor is filtered by Mara's non-visual attention. The basin of water becomes a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables her diagnostic choices, qualifying for 9+ gate, yet the environment never tightens or endangers—it merely hosts. Spatial choreography stays clean; fog, tracks, and ship horn track logically across paragraphs. The atmosphere is immersive but static; it supports mood more than stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Frost-rimed windowsill, rust-red ice-corrosion, and condensation deltas are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the atlas metaphors; the polyglot phrasebook and oil-lamp heat function as micro-settings that literally decode the mystery. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible reaches or drifting rooms—and weather (dropping temps, mist exhalation) directly shapes tomorrow’s stakes. The lake-as-temporal-drain is vividly particular, constraining her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Environment is filtered through the tuner’s sonic bias—cobblestones as percussion, wind in doorways as search-party—so detail is selective, not tourist. The archway and chapel bells constrain her method: she must walk the laid stones and strike local resonant surfaces. Micro-setting (ebony fork, keystone) functions as tool-setting that charges the final image when she pockets it and leaves. Weather is absent, but the “wild hush” evolves into “possibility” without symbolic overstatement, sustaining atmosphere.

    Deep-sea idiom is precise—preservation field, manipulator arms, energy probe—without faux-manual dump. The temple’s coral-encrusted pillars and collapsing rubble constrain the rescue window and physically charge the final image. Spatial choreography tracks submersible lights, field nodes, and ascending debris cleanly. Micro-setting cap waived: the vial operates as portable “environment” that reconfigures meaning at closure. Misses 9.0 because no sensory detail beyond the visual is leveraged under life-or-death pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lattice functions as micro-setting: it constrains his vantage, frames the only light he receives, and finally supports his forehead in the closing beat. Copper light returns with shifting weight—first staining floor, later blessing words, lastly bathing his moment of trust—charging the final image. “Jagged reef” and “dying stone” are tactile anchors that guide the knowledge that bodies will emerge; geography never drifts. Sensory economy favors visual and tactile, narrowing to breath and wood at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse is never a postcard: glass panes “shrouded in endless night” press inward, mercury-wept plums stain the soil, and the carved bead’s pocket-warmth constrains Elara’s micro-gestures. Sensory hierarchy skews to tactile and luminous—exactly what an alchemist-gardener would notice under black sky. Spatial choreography stays coherent across ghost-cameos; the bride’s translucent pointing directs Elara’s shears to a “diseased branch,” merging setting with tactic. The final image—bead at greenhouse heart—crystallizes the orchard itself as sacred engine, satisfying the 9+ gate.

    The orchard-catacomb hybrid is tactile—roots “like wooden lightning,” soil smelling of “bone-rich earth.” Spatial choreography is clean from surface to tomb and back. The sundial base functions as micro-setting that ultimately bears the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. A fractional lapse: pear vs. apple roots blur without differential sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The golden arcade is not backdrop; its stained-glass satellites and dormant projectors supply both resource (secrecy at dawn) and metaphoric pressure (obsolete infrastructure). The clipboard functions as micro-setting—its graphite-invisible surface literally constrains the transfer of identities. Sensory selection is urgent: dawn light, boot smear, thumb-folded paper—each detail is handled, not catalogued. The final image of “marks that would last just long enough” recharges the arcade’s transient ownership, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The eternal candle is handled in every beat: light passes through fabric to reveal hidden constellations, governs work hours, and finally silhouettes Mira’s decisive shadow—its flame literally projects her now-visible danger. Observatory walls fade from cobalt to gray, enacting the same stealth-to-exposure arc. Autumn leaves outside echo the falling-away of secrecy. Micro-setting qualifies and constrains: only by that candle can the reverse-pattern be seen, so the final image is inseparable from the tool.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mangrove roots, brackish silver water, and hanging window are selective, sensory, and filter through Isla’s urgency; the gargoyle shard is handled twice and its eight-century storm memory directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible positions—as the path of spirits’ song guides her out. Environment functions as micro-setting that alters tactics: the spirits literally provide the exit route once the apology is voiced. Meets the 9+ gate requirement that a recurring object constrain choice and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting (plaster cast) functions as map, archive, and bargaining table; its surface literally constrains where new text can be added, determining the joint action. Mist-clad atrium supplies sensory hierarchy—visual blur, cool skin, taste of morphine—mirroring anesthetic dissociation and forcing slow, deliberate motion that delays verbal work until rapport is earned. Coral fragment re-enters three times, each appearance narrowing options from private talisman to shared covenant to collaborative pen-holder, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean: bench, fountain, glass ceiling, small bodies—no impossible reaches.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orchard district is economically anchored—stone-bark trees, spilled-milk fog, silver-gray palette—and every descriptor answers to Mira’s light-painter eye. Micro-setting (her projectors, the cratered wall) literally constrains the climax: beam angle dictates what can and cannot be illuminated, charging the final fade-out. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating props or impossible footstep echoes. The phrase “photograph developing in reverse” is the only mixed-metaphor wobble, but it is brief and pattern-taught early, so harm is cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sound-garden is textured through touch-sound synesthesia: palm on crumbling plaster, fountains whispering back at shifted pitch—details constrain perception and choice. The nickel-as-micro-setting evolves from embedded relic to grinning doppelgänger, charging final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across body, wall, coin, reflected voice. No environmental detail is static; each echo redirects Marta’s attention and ultimately her stance. Setting is inseparable from the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Condensation-fogged greenhouse glass is returned to twice, functioning as both surveillance barrier and echo of mental “fog,” charging the final image. Gourd-rattle seeds, palm fronds’ filtered light, and beetle-wing scent give tactile micro-setting that constrains action (no electronics). Selective sensory hierarchy: humidity smell > visual blur > seed sound. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies. One minor time-skip (“over the following weeks”) is handled in a single sentence, preserving momentum. World rule—no cameras in greenhouse—stays consistent and is exploited for plot.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The shell operates as a micro-setting that constrains every move: starlight down the spiral dictates visibility, the deepest chamber’s soil enables the planting, and the wind’s off-key song becomes the harmonic tool they join. Sensory triage is POV-driven—pearlescent interior, reef-shadow joy—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: tilt, spiral descent, bulb placement track cleanly. The environment’s scale and ruinous beauty mirror the poet’s internal ache without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The opal library above the clouds is not mere postcard beauty; its altitude and translucent walls literally permit the dawn light to fracture and re-tune the orchids, constraining how Miren can sound them. The cracked bamboo tube becomes a micro-setting that forces her invention of the glass chime; the shattered orchid shard is handled on-page and its re-purposing alters the final harmonic. Sensory detail is selective—rose/amber fractures, copper sunset—always filtered through Miren’s curator eye rather than tourist catalog. Environment, tool, and recurring object meet the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and charging the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archive’s sealed containers of “final whispers” and the single lamp’s amber on glass create a micro-setting that literally houses the stakes; the ink well’s shifting reflections constrain pacing (Maren buys seconds before speaking) and charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    The amphitheater’s breathing stone is not backdrop; thermal expansion is the ticking clock that paces Elena’s labor and signals equilibrium achieved. Spatial choreography is precise—steps into orchestra, descent into channel, sixty-six feet of chain. Volcanic setting constrains her toolkit and provides the ash she mixes to decrypt the message, qualifying for the 9+ tool-use gate even if not quite a 9.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    The attic skylight shaft, cross-beam, and wire pigeon architecture are not backdrop but tools Elena balances on and reads by; the Mars meteorite chip pressed in the ruined hymnal is a micro-setting that charges the final image when she holds the identical-sized recorder. Selective sensory triage—cooing pigeons, slanted light, dust swirl—mirrors her narrowed attention under guilt. Spatial choreography holds as she steps off the beam and Yuki climbs in; no floating objects. Setting constrains choice: only this attic lets her hear the choir echo through cracked rafters, making the 9-band possible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and micro-constraint: its “slow-breathing glass” panels physically separate, forcing Maya to walk forward because no wall will hold her back. The salvaged oak planks anchor her father’s tactile history; the grain’s knot becomes the map she reads, literally guiding her to the logbook revelation. Light and wood evolve from backdrop to active agents—light dissolves the return path, wood withholds parental presence. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her kneel, trace, stand, and exit without drift or impossible geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Environment functions as micro-setting: observation dome glass and water column constrain what can be seen, force nocturnal schedule, and supply the bloom reveal. Barnacle density, kelp-coffee, salt-dark mystery—vivid selective detail filtered through professional curiosity. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible geography. Final image of choreography bloom charges closure; qualifies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Geode-cave is never static backdrop; crystal walls pulse approval, seeds sprout in mineral dark, and crater glass warms—each tactile shift cues internal change. Spatial choreography clean: swallow perches, seed drops into palm, vine wraps wrist, all tracked in continuous motion. Light/reflectivity motif mirrors epistemic theme without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the vine-bracelet) constrains final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tidal arcade is more than backdrop—advancing tide supplies live 12-minute clock, forcing each micro-miracle; wet stone dictates dropped-ball trajectory and bioluminescent plankton reveal. Bishop’s ivory weight, starlight reflection, and salt-worn grooves are tactile, POV-filtered. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across pillars and pools; no impossible positions. Setting charges final image: same corridor that gave her stage will erase it, re-weighting her anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Garden’s perpetual dusk, silver fruit, and starlit hedges are filtered through Kael’s tide-trained senses; the environment literally supplies the moonstone dust that enables her archive. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from exile entrance to final rooted stance. Micro-setting of her own forearm becomes the contested territory—every letter glows then settles, charging the final image. One more sensory contrast (smell of burnt photograph ash?) would have nudged 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism atrium functions as micro-setting: its glass floor hatch and angled panels enable the stone-drop experiment that drives every beat. Sensory hierarchy is glazier-specific—he notices condensation on lead came, not generic “beauty.” Pearl Bay dawn is filtered through fog, tide-level darkness, and emergent light that the panels reorder into teachable patterns. Spatial choreography is perfect: we track satchel → stone → hatch → water → wall projections without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Moonlight on fracture lines, the Douglas fir as terminus, and the cracked box as micro-setting all constrain Marcus’s decision path and charge the final image. Sensory triage is firefighter-precise: visual fracture, kinesthetic ridge slope, thermal memory of scorched skin. Only the valley lights flicker toward postcard, but they serve as counter-image to the ember motif, so allowance granted.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s three mouths, tide-polished limestone, and refracted light function as both environment and instrument, constraining where Maya can place objects and how light fractures selves. The gauge’s brass heft and needle twitch serve as micro-setting that directly shapes her next placement. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she notices pressure, shimmer, Fibonacci angles—never touristic. Final image of “all her selves walked toward the light” recharges the arches as portal, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ivy-veiled passage and fireplace micro-setting constrain movement and supply the diary catalyst; sensory hierarchy (sound mapping, charred paper texture) is filtered through Mara's cartographer gaze, charging the final acoustic image. Spatial choreography remains clean; “ivy parted” elegantly externalizes the building’s consent. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prism parapet splits twilight into ribbons that literally steer mirror angles; wet flagstones and bell hush anchor the temporal window. Micro-setting (tarnished-rim mirror) becomes the sole vessel for the decisive vision, charging closure. Sensory economy is high—“birds sometimes landed on her shoulders” shows stillness without saying it. No environment details sit inert; all refract into Aina’s ritual tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terrace is anchored early and re-used as tool: the altar, urns, and moon-lit silver constrain the choreography of enemies who must kneel together.  Valley geography is sketched only as needed—“before the first battles burned them away” links setting to stakes.  The missing valleywood trees haunt the scene as negative space that the seeds must refill, giving the place a palimpsest history.  Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual moonlight and tactile soil), but selection fits the ritual focus; a second sensory channel mid-ceremony would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Salt flat, egg, and thunder are not postcard backdrops: the crunching salt under knees literally constrains Marcus’s posture; the cracked riverbed pattern is the GPS he follows; the incoming rain will erase the coordinates. Micro-setting (egg cradle, resin shell) charges the final broadcast. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating objects.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Silver courtyard, snow, and dawn light are not backdrops—they are tools: the snow’s blankness offers a writable surface for her map, the emerging crystalline geometry literally guides her footfalls, and the pearl dawn color becomes the story’s final charged image. Micro-setting (her body as dancer’s stance) constrains every gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices temperature through breath, geometry through peripheral shimmer, never catalogues for atmosphere. No props teleport; prism sanctuary grows logically from traced patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dome’s “curved embrace” and the “meteor hush” are micro-settings that charge the final image; the campfire stick’s carved symbols constrain who can hold the narrative floor, so the object functions as portable setting that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective—silence, half-darkness, wet ink—mirroring Marcus’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography stays clean across the stick’s hand-off and the audience’s murmurs. The environment never stalls momentum; every detail tilts toward the staging of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto itself constrains choice: its moss-soft floor accepts dowels, its elevation isolates Sera from intervention, and the aerial garden supplies the only available building material—fallen moth wings. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven; she notices proboscis pressure, wing paper-whisper, amber sunset reflection on orange wings. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; weather is static but thematically apt. The setting charges the final image by supplying the only possible palette for the last migration’s witness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound sanctum is not backdrop but tool: the sub-zero air flash-cools bronze, the aurora beams through card holes to project phonemes onto ice, and the rope’s tension records pitch the way a caliper records width. Micro-setting objects—wax tablet, bronze wire, punched flake—constrain every micro-choice: wire diameter must match braid thickness, wax must stay warm enough to take imprint yet cool fast enough to survive until casting. Spatial choreography is pristine: we track left hand unweaving, right hand punching, knees braced against frozen altar so the rope’s slack never tangles—environment literally shapes posture and tactic, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vine-draped bunker, rain through ceiling holes, moss-thick murals—each detail is filtered through the seer’s bias and braided into action (she lies down where roots finger through). The bunker micro-setting literally enables the dream ingress and reappears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no weather clichés. Economy is good; one paragraph could be cut without loss, capping at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The re-imagined palace is evoked through tactile salvage—reclaimed stone, lattice dust, cooling floor—never in catalogue. Environment and tool (candle stub, notebooks, tile) directly constrain action: she saves the candle, draws on precious paper, pockets the tile. Spatial choreography is exact; no object drifts or changes state off-stage. Final image—telescope climb at dawn—caps the setting’s dual role as sanctuary and observatory.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sanctuary’s breathing walls function as both atmosphere and micro-setting: their translucent flicker narrows Marcus’s options—he cannot flee a place that is half-solid—and the final waver coincides with his surrender, charging the image. Soundless rule is maintained until the weep, making the eventual sob a cost rather than décor. Pin and box are tactile—“cylinder pin broken, mechanism frozen mid-song”—and handled across three beats, satisfying micro-object setting.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fog-droplet-as-tiny-sun reprises at climax, directly enabling the mirror-capture tactic; environment charges closure. Micro-setting (sextant, silver-backed glass) constrains every beat. Spatial choreography clean—mirrors placed in circle, dream tracked by arc. Idiom stable, no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    The impossible orchard physically constrains every move: footholds determine dialogue pacing, rain-collection bottles dictate Lisel’s medicinal agenda, and dappled cathedral light becomes the workspace for eye-mending. Spatial choreography is flawless—branches as bridges, beams as perches—creating a living set that forces intimacy at height. The scent of pears and incense is filtered through Mara’s professional eye for refractive angles, fusing occupation with atmosphere. The final image of ripening apples above the shared toolkit recharges the setting as a cathedral of second chances rather than abandoned ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse glass, crystallizing breath, and cameo blank act as micro-settings that constrain choice—she can only “think” in the bathroom, the cameo only fits one tree-gap. Sensory selection mirrors disquiet: luminous fruit, carved bark, pale shell. Asteroid orchard rules remain consistent, learned through action. Final image of grandfather-eyes in mirror re-uses bathroom micro-setting to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bookstore-mountain is not backdrop but instrument: shelves flicker between existence and memory, prepositions root in “soil layers of time,” constraining how Mira can speak to free the students. Sensory triangulation—obsidian study, humming spines, coffee still steaming across days—grounds the impossible physics. Cartography of Hours shelf literally flickers, charging the final image of unheard symphony. Micro-setting (botanical diary pages) functions as tool-as-setting, handled twice to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Micro-setting triumph: the emerald card’s exact green becomes the garden’s key, fusing object and environment into one constraint. Fog is not backdrop but pressure—breathing “wool,” canceling distance, forcing circular walks. Carousel horses mid-gallop provide a frozen-motion image that charges the final living flowers. Spatial choreography stays clean; the ship’s deck never dissolves into white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clock-tower mechanism room is more than postcard: grinding gears narrow her attention, pendulum shaft geometry literally hosts the door, and the impossible curved shelves constrain movement. Micro-setting objects—walnut door, wax seal, ceremonial rope—are handled tactilely and become the crucible for choice. Final image of warm tea beside alien notebook entries fuses body, tool, and environment. Missing a 9+ only because the rope’s physical properties (heat, light) are stated not sensed.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the story’s spine: harmonic caves → energy storm → ice gallery → bloom. Every detail is filtered through the mapkeeper’s professional eye (“oscillation preserved in sandstone”), making the world a tool she reads. The echo chamber stone and ice cracks function as micro-settings that constrain tactics; the stone warms, ice branches glow—objects evolve, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight; sound, temperature, and mineral memory braid into theme without static description.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pavilion is more than postcard: its glass walls vibrate at a frequency that literally narrows Mera’s auditory perception, and the star-aligned crack in the prism functions as a celestial lock that must be physically matched—setting as puzzle. Micro-setting triumphs: the silk cushion, diamond-dust star charts, and the moment her shadow’s heart marks the dig-site are all handled, not observed. Thistle seeds clinging to vibrating glass fuse atmosphere with theme (hope needs a crack). Only the wasteland beyond remains generically “ashy,” but the story never needs to go there; the pavilion’s interior is the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Observatory-above-cloudline is not backdrop but pressure engine: storm-light makes shadows measurable, fog-phase dictates urgency, crystal pillars hum donated memories. Micro-setting of “summer-quill pages that disappear in autumn” functions as ticking clock and vanishing archive. Every sensory pick (wet crystal hum, lightning’s muscle-like ripple) is filtered through Maris’s recorder bias. The final image of softening fog directly mirrors her internal liquefying certainty—setting charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is selective and tactile: copper filings in the satchel, moonflowers that “crawl,” kerosene rag knots handled in two beats. Environment constrains tactics—starless sky forces Mara to manufacture light, the tower height dictates launch angle. “Blooming fortress” is reused as closure echo (“fortress bloomed”), charging the final image. Dock 0.2 because dusk-purple walls and glazed guards edge toward postcard, but overall the fortress functions as crucible, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Grotto, starlight, and thumbnail cicada constrain choices: the cramped pool limits retreat, the jade’s “interior weather” reframes transition. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mei catalogs by touch and star-glow, not tourist visuals. Environmental mirroring (crab shell ↔ niece departure) is embedded in action, not symbol tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The xenial trellis is both setting and tool: it literally suspends her above the inverted earth and furnishes the only place the gilded flower can bloom. Sensory economy favors touch and motion over visual catalog; spatial choreography never wavers. Micro-setting (porcelain doll) doubles as environment, constraining every silence-transfer beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terrace as floating auditory sanctuary is specific, improbable yet physical; wind across prisms supplies tactile immediacy. The storm glass acts as micro-setting that constrains Mara’s choices—she watches, decides silence is best. Train-whistle echo anchors time and valley depth. Final image of crystals “fluidly logical as breath” recharges the place with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    The throne chamber’s compressed-starlight materiality, the scanner glove’s readout, and the paint strata each constrain tactics: only the glove can parse the waterfall, only the mural reveals the stair, only the ruby re-awakens the throne. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but is justified by a data-ghost world. Spatial choreography is pristine: Vess never floats, the flake’s temperature is tracked by touch, the staircase names are read by fingertip. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image—no 9-barrier breach.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: brass ring on a solitary charred gateframe acts as both shrine and tool; ash under starlight is sensorily selective (cold metal, glowing screen-obscene) and steers the final gesture. Spatial track stays clean across the single threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mushroom cavern is handled as both ecology and emotional barometer; humidity sensors, pulsing glow, and salt-crusted bolt give tactile triangulation. Micro-setting (the fault-line slit) literally constrains her final placement—she has to stand there to bolt herself to the multiverse. Grandfather’s naval anecdote seeds the salt-bolt with remembered pressure, paying off when she weaponises that memory. Sensory choice stays filtered through Maya’s grower-eye, never tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The curved walls and brass horn are not backdrop; they are the lockpick. Every sensory pick—dust motes thickening, golden shadows pooling—directs Mara’s finger to the depression beside the dial, making environment the active agent. The micro-setting of the gramophone bolted to one spot literalizes the family’s fixed guilt. One more tactile beat (heat of the brass, vibration in her palm) would have nudged 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse-as-micro-setting constrains every move: the liquid-starlight bark, hourglass fruit, and permeable walls shape what can be unsnapped. Sensory economy is tight, and the final transformed orchard recharges every prior sensory seed.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The file room functions as micro-setting: dust thickness becomes a legible map, brass button a portable spotlight, lamplight a timepiece. Sensory hierarchy obeys Sarah’s archival gaze—visual dust geography, tactile paper brittleness, auditory silence of basement—each selecting detail that later constrains her choice to keep working after closing. Spatial choreography is flawless: folders are stacked, rolled documents slipped, button travels from crack to palm to desk-edge. The tiny attic of artifacts (button, lamp, dust) stands in for Civil-War-era Philadelphia without tourist landmarks, and recharges the final image when the button catches the lamplight—setting literally illuminates the reconfigured meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The auric lagoon is more than postcard: its doubled starlight literally hides the submerged exit route, and the rain-grooved stone supplies the tactical map that unlocks the archive. Sensory selection stays filtered through Mira’s urgency—golden plankton, salt smell, cold stone under knee—anchoring time and body. The hidden server room is sketched with functional minimalism; enough to believe, not enough to slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto’s wet stone, prism facets, and dissolving dewdrops constrain tactics—Elena must play “through” the geometry, not around it—charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight: morning light is always filtered through cracks, never generic. Spatial choreography is clean; the saxophone never teleports, and body placement relative to prism is tracked. Micro-setting (the instrument’s keys under mist-damp fingers) functions as the tactile ground that makes abstract “vested hush” physically legible.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    The arbor’s body becomes a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: seeds must be finger-sorted in zero-g, monuments are built from rejected genetic material, and the moonstone can only “write” on this living wood. Vivid sensory triangulation—ash-colored bark, mossy taste of spring, opalescent glint no larger than a grain of salt—keeps perception urgent and POV-bound. Spatial choreography is immaculate: seeds fall upward, twigs bend into archways, and moss veins track the moonstone’s exact path across the table. The final blooming palette reconfigures the entire visual rule-set, passing the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selective sensory economy—"clouded glass panels," "ochre, copper, rust" leaf strata, "cold air rush"—anchors every move without museum tour. The greenhouse’s warped door, dry fountain, and subterranean waterfall each constrain bodily access: she must crawl, pry, descend, get soaked. The compass rose itself becomes micro-setting, its mis-needle charging the final pedestal image. No spatial drift; bodies and props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The foundry is not backdrop but instrument: rain-cooled anvils dictate her slipper tread, forge heat governs coin temperature, dripping rafters meter her guilt. Micro-setting—the zodiac coin—constrains every tactical move; its spiral angles are measured before gold dust is laid. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound: alchemist notices metallic tang over rain scent. Final image recharges setting: gentle rain on iron roof leaves “essential scars untouched,” welding environment to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Echo Gorge functions as both acoustic trap and emotional crucible; its stone walls literally shape the tactic of “pursue by sound” and determine the vertical, twilight geography. Micro-setting objects—warped harp, crocodile tooth—constrain handling and become extensions of Mara’s body under pressure. Sensory economy is tight: cold exhalation, ink-like shadows, water-over-stones laughter, each filtered through Mara’s attuned ear. Final image of sound ascending the golden rim re-charges the setting with earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ultraviolet forest is not backdrop; its bioluminescence dims where her tears fall, turning setting into a reactive mirror that absorbs pain. The pewter strap functions as micro-setting against her skin, constraining every tilt of her head. Spatial choreography is flawless: she stumbles, braces, carves, all tracked without drift. Environment literally metabolizes her suffering, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended alchemist market is sketched with brisk, sense-driven strokes; the lighthouse lens fragment functions as micro-setting that literally reframes what can be seen, satisfying the 9+ gate. A few phrases (“elusively tangible,” “crystallized feeling”) edge toward the generic, but the selective detail keeps the world breathable without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ticket office reeks of rust/popcorn, elevator shaft glints with oily detail; body-as-setting shows dust patterns under nails. The mainspring-as-micro-setting literally jams then frees the pulley, constraining Marcus’s tactics. Spatial choreography holds: ladder, tiles, box, phone-cam all tracked. Final image of “weightless burden” recharges ceiling motif; environment enforces choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glass orchard, cloud-sea, and crystalline fruit are rendered with kinetic specificity—books fly “not in chaos but in revelation,” glass trees “bend under the weight of fruits that contained not answers but better questions.” These images directly constrain the climax: the physical deformation of the library is the visible price of Margritte’s intervention. Frost patterns work micro-setting duty, tying dawn ephemerality to the stake of transient truth. Environment is not backdrop; it is the crucible that charges the final reconfiguration.

    The baroque asteroid is lived-in: gilt corridors flake under fingertips, frescoes exhale centuries of vacuum-dried pigment, velvet drapes hold dust that catches prismatic light. Micro-setting—the shard itself—functions as portal and proof, constraining methodology and final revelation. Spatial choreography stays crisp as Matthias “walks these halls alone,” then “stands before his own reflection.” Weather is literal time-storm, never decorative; it forces the mirror-covering ritual and seeds the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Violin-curved chamber, brass shells, dawn-amber glow—every sensory choice constrains acoustic possibility and thus the repair tactic. Micro-setting (philosopher’s chip as needle) literally pierces the invisible threads, so object-as-setting qualifies for 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is pristine: spiral down / bench / ascent up track cleanly. Only minus: exterior street never anchored, but that absence serves the sealed-resonance conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Storm-tossed archway as micro-setting constrains her sheltering and later orienteering; driftwood becomes both material and mnemonic device. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Iris notices structural load before she notices smell. The coastal road “gray smear” is a selective visual fragment that matches her artist’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean—no teleporting between van, arch, beach—earning the 9+ quick test, but the repeated “turbine-hum” costs 0.4 for minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Amber pavilion glass functions as micro-setting: its shifting spectral angles literally constrain where and when her mural can be seen, charging the final image. Autumn light is not tourist décor but tactical—only slant-light reveals the cathedral’s secret garden. Spatial choreography clean: stairs climb, platform perch, finger trace all track. Weather and season evolve causally from February frost to October honey-light, mirroring her internal quieting. 9+ gate missed only because environment does not foreclose a live option at the climax; it illuminates, not blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    The obsidian lagoon is returned to in both 1952 and present, its glassy surface literally constraining parley logistics and symbolically recharging the final debris-message. Micro-setting (Elijah’s driftwood alphabet) functions as tool and stage; without it the encoded communique and Maya’s later imitation would fail. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—heat, black sand, shell edges—filtered through archive-trained attention to durable fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Paper-lantern cove is evoked through selective, POV-filtered detail—tattered awnings, salt-worn air, ovens beginning to hum—rather than postcard inventory. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting that actively constrains her tactic (no seam → must use memory instead of tools). Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and light at the decisive beat, charging the final image. Only the “seven languages” line feels briefly touristic, but it is quickly re-filtered through her alchemical purpose, so the cap at 8.8 is not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop orchard is tactilely alive—“branches skeletal against the violet sky,” bark “warm from the day’s sun”—and the skyscraper’s 1889 transplantation history anchors every beat. Micro-setting triumph: the wax shaving’s warmth against bark fuses object & place into a single constraining interface. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible moves. The final image of her hands smelling of “ancient bark and older promises” recharges the setting as living archive.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ice-pillar fountain and shattered glass dome are not postcard scenery; they pressure choice—ice must melt by will, not heat, and the dome’s缺席 starlight refracts the vortex. The acorn cap micro-setting literally seeds the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → pry → place → footprints toward door. One slip: “tables laden with jars” flashback is cinematic, not tactile, but brief enough to avoid cap.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The airborne cathedral is sketched with swift, sensory strokes—perpetual cloud, open arches, stone transmitting tremors—each detail later weaponized by the rope. Micro-setting (rope → bell mount → tower bones) literally channels the storm and dictates the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no anchor drift past 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The copper-domed station, spiral stairs, and hand-blown lantern bubbles are tactile, selective, and filtered through Kael’s caretaker gaze; the imperfect glass finally constrains his choice to stay, charging the closure image. Weather and spatial choreography remain stable. One minor missed beat: the era’s “overlooked” technology level is atmospheric but never limits action or stakes on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sweetwater Apiary remains tactile—crystallized honey, melted wax seals, the last good wood—each object constrains Silas’s next move. Stained-glass box micro-setting governs the climax: only its bee-panel sequence yields the list. Scorched wasteland outside the cracked windows keeps time visible—ghosts arrive because the world cracked open. Sensory hierarchy obeys beekeeper priorities: scent of propolis, smoker resin, pane color temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.7)
    Green-glass silo filters light into usable wavelengths—setting actively re-tools perception, not postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography clean: ladder ascent, floor crouch, descent at dusk. Prairie cold and rusted ladder echo internal erosion of old chronology. Micro-setting (urn shard) charges final image; its warmth against ribs is tactile proof of reclaimed rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt lagoon, rain-slick stone, broken feather—each returns as tactile objects that constrain choice (Maya pockets feather, sits on wet stone, invites him to share the site). Micro-setting (feather shaft split) literally charges the final image by paralleling the snapped kite string. Selective sensory economy—visual shimmer, wind tug, salt hush—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography clean; kite’s flight path tracked to horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Living stone pillars that grew from the earth like ancient teeth” and the pale-green mist shift anchor the world in tactile, evolving specificity. Temple fractures, copper wire, and root choreography all constrain later tactics; the orchard–pillar symbiosis literally props up the climax image. Micro-setting (diary, copper loops) charges the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tower and garden are sketched with selective sensorial economy—dripping eaves, bronze quiet, moss-ghosted saints—each detail filtering Kira’s scientific gaze. Micro-setting (the dried fountain convergence point) literally constrains her final bodily stance and becomes the slate for the chemical formula; this satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate: staircase descent, footprint tracking, kneel at center are tracked without drift. One minor lapse: “reddish dust” is introduced only when needed for the formula; earlier foreshadow of its color would sharpen specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Jetty, tide level, and barnacle hollows actively determine where seeds can root; the blooming planks constrain every scatter and charge the last image of beauty “learning to swim.” Sensory selection mirrors Erasmus’s listening bias, keeping detail purposeful and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Twisted metal bones” and “fallen dish antenna shelter” give post-war texture without catalog bloat; the leaf-cube functions as micro-setting that literally refracts the map. Wind whistling through corrugated gaps keeps bodies present. Spatial choreography is clean: caravan → shelf → lamplight → three-day trek → antenna shelter, no impossible moves. The environment does not alter tactics in the final beat, so misses 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass bubble deck, charcoal-stained sketchbook, and warming compass rose applique are tactile micro-settings that literally constrain motion and supply the only anchor; spatial choreography stays consistent. Sensory economy favors warmth/touch over visual checklist, matching isolation. The supernova glint off the rose in the last paragraph recharges the object and environment simultaneously, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ice-spire is not postcard; it actively slices wind into “secrets she couldn’t quite hear,” making the climb a sensory gauntlet that shapes her pace. Brass sundial lid becomes micro-setting: its warming face re-anchors orientation at the summit. Texture is selective—no visual catalog of ice, only the one “frozen finger” image that later points at the healed sky. Spatial choreography is clean: she climbs, kneels, descends with no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gallery’s acoustic physics and pawn-less chessboard are not backdrop but instruments: curvature dictates the archiving method, missing squares literalize the erased populace. Nomadic penumbra of firelight is filtered through Mara’s crisis-trained eye, narrowing to “specific angle of fingers waving goodbye.” Spatial choreography is flawless—footfall patterns, resonance nodes, chalk arcs tracked without drift. Environment directly constrains the final choice to keep walking the memories, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mountain-bookstore is not postcard backdrop but navigational crucible: seventeen turns, poetry corridors, and greenhouse level supply the only path to the stone and later the only soil for seeding the book-textures. Ventilation shaft delivers the feather as causal aperture, not coincidence. Micro-setting of stone grooves plus feather barbs constrains the breakthrough beat. Final reprise of “spring rain” outside recharges the terraced-valley memory, locking setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    The frozen village is rendered with selective, sensory economy: ivy mid-growth, dust motes suspended, thunder caught in lull. These micro-details constrain Elena’s movement and charge the final thaw; the chapel’s slanted light becomes the stage for the tapestry decoding. Spatial choreography remains clean; the setting’s temporal rule is taught early and paid off at closure. The tapestry itself functions as micro-setting/tool, its platinum threads warming under her palm to release time.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bone towers are not backdrop; their acoustic properties become the engine of escalation, forcing Mira’s tactics to evolve. The pale spire’s fog “breathes,” a micro-setting that charges the final image when she walks into it. Spatial choreography is clean: abandoned brush, smooth ivory walls, mist timing track consistently. Only a hairline slip—“towers of bone rose like broken fingers” mildly clichés—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Limestone crack, pulsing anemones, and the tide’s either/or on the conch create a micro-setting that actively tightens her choice; the reflected light-shaft literally mirrors her shift from observer to participant. Sensory selection stays painterly yet body-bound: cold water seeps through denim, mineral golds tint her retinas—details she can’t capture at arm’s length anymore.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse, salt-scrubbed soil, and night-blooming jasmine are specific, POV-filtered, and return in the final image. The beacon lit at dawn is a micro-setting tool that charges closure: Mara ignites it even after sunrise, externalizing her new visibility. Spatial choreography is clean—dock, stairs, cottage track without drift. Environment constrains choice: only dawn wind can carry the scent; removing the lighthouse color or garden would weaken the emotional alchemy.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Starlit cliff station, censer foot’s green-black catch of light, and groaning hydraulics create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Mara’s solitude and methods. Sensory selection mirrors emotional paring-down; the censer’s weight and temperature anchor the zero-meridian beat. One clause—“now submerged”—delivers valley history without exposition dump. Environment is inseparable from the navigation logic.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hanging orchard is not backdrop but tool: the swaying bridge forces her confident footing, the ravine’s updraft carries truffle scent, the storm-battered trunks require her body to twist and reach. Micro-setting qualifies—the glass eye’s gold flecks swim in lamplight, constraining her decision to trust it. Weather is causal: horizontal rain drives her indoors to the textbooks, then back out to test the occlusion. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices root-grip, oil-wrapped cloth, the faint fungal musk that city-dwellers never learned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal dock/mist twilight is sketched with selective sensory strokes that mirror the blurring of sea/sky and memory/self. The boutonnière functions as micro-setting—its crystalline stem literally storing data—constraining Margit’s choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is secure; weather and tide act causally. Economy prioritized over breadth, appropriate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shop’s “old paper and regret,” the creek’s audible climb, and the limestone’s mineral constellation are filtered through Marcus’s surveyor-trained attention; every tactile or auditory detail is also emotional. The blooming cavern literalizes the subconscious garden he never dared enter. Spatial choreography is flawless: alley → foundation crack → descending passage → cavern threshold. Environment directly shapes the final choice—only here can the door exist—passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is protagonist: the ridge “blade of stone,” the cobalt grotto that “wept light,” the ember grotto whose heat she trades for higher cold. Each geological layer constrains stamina and steers the next foothold. Final image of fireflies ascending to “bleeding starlight” recharges the entire visual pattern. Micro-setting (her scraped hands, gown heavy with cloud-wet) doubles as body-anchor, cleanly meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ember nexus functions as micro-setting: drifting sparks mirror memory-suns, constrain visibility, and charge the final image (“ember-glow of twilight’s end”). Spatial choreography clean—distance tracked in handshake/step-close. Tool-body-object triad met: columella curl re-centers in palm at closure, reprising logarithmic spiral as literal handle on their new joint purpose. Weather/twilight arc supplies visual countdown that paces the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Birch bark functions as micro-setting: its organic curl and sap scent constrain her method—she writes on it because paper feels dishonest. Cabin, altitude, and weathered grave supply tactile, POV-filtered detail that mirrors internal brittleness. Final image of wind “November—or March?” externalizes temporal slippage. Object-state coherence: scroll edges stay brittle, lamp flickers, no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shop’s occluded sight-lines literally enact the theme: Elena must “read between” hanging gears to see repurposed midwife tools; this micro-setting constrains her discovery and later charges the final image. Fog outside and drip-sound inside create a tangible sensory hierarchy filtered by her absent smell, sharpening attention to visual/tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The midwife-screw is handled twice, its texture and history woven through action rather than catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating tea-platform is not backdrop; its knife-edge width forces Kael to kneel motionless, magnifying tremor and breath control. The crow quill’s trimmed barbs, inkstone chill, and canyon updraft are returned in the final sway, physically charging the “captured stars” image. Micro-setting (scarred arm) literally constrains the rune design—without those ridges the spiral could not exist. All sensory notes serve the stakes; no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Archive paper dust and orchard roots function as micro-setting: paper ghosts → perfume bottle → sheet-music score form a tactile chain that constrains Mira’s gesture of restitution. Sensory funnel stays biased—sound (“invisible symphonies”), scent (ghost perfume), touch (dust motes)—mirroring Mira’s synesthetic guilt without tourist cataloging. Spatial choreography holds across the single continuous scene; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The temple-library is evoked through hush, stone-carved shelves, and translucent walls—three concrete anchors that double as metaphors for permeable reality. Sensory economy is strict: footstep philosophy, yellowed pages, crystalline definitions; no visual overflow. The setting actively constrains choice by degree-of-illusion shelving, so environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting gate satisfied: the junction where corridors meet functions as charged object, steering the final surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass cylinders, bronze valves, and horizon line are filtered through Maren’s professional gaze; tools double as metaphors for perceptual limits. Spiral carved in stone and suspended pendulum supply the final charged image. Micro-setting (key against sternum) constrains her decision to act. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop: its permeable stone literally enables the breach, its glow guides Mira’s laser, and its medicinal purpose motivates her final leniency. Spatial choreography is flawless—laser dot, air currents, squeeze-through gap—each detail paid off in the climax. The mushrooms’ blue constellation light reappears in Marcus’s eyes at closure, recharging the opening image with new ethical weight. Environment thus constrains tactics and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rain, skylight glass, and unmowed clover function as micro-setting that constrains attention: the downpour traps her inside long enough to decrypt the notebooks; the clover’s “tiny prisms” refract the emotional cost in the last paragraph. Candle lantern is handled twice—lit, then packed—its mica pane clouding and clearing parallel her shifting certainty. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: academic mind notices watercolor blur of green, then seizes on quantifiable raindrops. Environment is not backdrop; it licenses the reflective space required for the syllabus beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-bulb tunnel and glass disc function as micro-setting: the disc’s prismatic shadows literally guide Iris’s finger, constraining every musical intervention. Sensory economy is high—wet finger on glass, copper wires breathing—without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: shelf, receiver, pad track across beats. The harmonica disc reappears in the final sentence, charging the Charged Poise with inherited memory.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jetty, tide-pooled wood grain, and salt-sweet air are filtered through Mira’s archivist gaze; the roses constrain timing (“impossible for such a late hour”) and mirror her late blooming. The thermos of freshly boiled walnut ink functions as micro-setting/tool that enables the decisive inscription. Spatial choreography is clean: descent, kneel, ascent track without drift. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image (“roses released their fragrance into the darkness”) and constrains the ritual beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station is not backdrop but toolbox—ivy hides her, rusted cart becomes desk, moon rock is the portable altar; spatial choreography is flawless. Micro-setting object (moon rock) constrains the final choice by embodying the ledger she must decide to keep or drop. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s filter: she notes satellite latency, not birdcalls. One decimal off 9.0 only because weather/rail physics stay ornamental rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but instrument: frequencies shatter glass, bark whistles, moss absorbs footfall. Micro-setting = Mara’s skin; the platinum ring constrains every directional choice until it quits. Final clearing’s absolute silence is the charged environment that forces the stillpoint stance. Sensory economy is strict—no tourist catalog, only vibrations she can feel.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: its warped light literally bends the pen’s trail across the screen, constraining how edits can be drawn. The cramped observation pod is sketched through selective sensory load—ache-inducing light, sulfur scent memory, flickering console—rather than inventory description. Meridian’s acidic soil is never seen, yet its consequences pressure the pod via polite settler messages, keeping geography functionally off-stage but causally active. The split-nib pen’s physical oddity anchors spatial choreography each time it touches the console, charging the final star-caught glint.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor’s moonlit surface is not backdrop but metronome: wave-intervals dictate the choreography’s tempo, and the dock’s wooden vibration supplies bass Marina cannot hear but can feel through bare feet. The camera’s frost and weight recur as micro-setting, constraining her to manual adjustments that retrain finger dexterity. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Celeste’s signing silhouette never blocks the moon-path, allowing the final image of overlapping shadows to read as stacked staffs of silent music. Light is treated as tactile: pearls scatter, shadows sustain, reflections cue timing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Basalt archive breathes through tactile specificity: dry air, volcanic dust under fingernails, headlamp flare on slashed hide. The tapestry fragment is handled repeatedly, becoming micro-setting that charges the final image; removing it would gut the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sound-wave garden and auric lagoon are built through touch and vibration, not postcard visuals; their physics ("sound sculpted reality itself") constrain what Maya can do—only drumming lets her meet the dead. Micro-setting of her body (aching fingers) becomes the final anchor. Starlight and dawn are used sparingly to shade temporal edges. No environmental detail is wasted; each ripple or color is paired with an action that advances memory-bleed.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    The container labyrinth is not backdrop but tactical Rubik’s cube: 3-D folds on the tablet physically block/enable every move; final nexus “won’t exist by dawn” charges closure. Micro-settings—maintenance harness, storm-humming metal, zodiac coin—constrain access and timing. Sensory economy favors metallic hum and violet light over visual checklist; spatial choreography tracks cleanly through shifting corridors. Environment directly shapes strategy; without the daily re-configuration, Mira’s垄断 of navigation and the key-time insight collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt dock after rain is not postcard backdrop; its wet planks refract both twilight and guilt, forcing the mirror’s necessity. Micro-setting excellence: the dental mirror’s circular glass becomes a moveable star, constraining every tilt and flash; the shutter grid across water functions as a living keyboard. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rope coils, pilings, and window angles track without drift. Only micro-slip: “shuttered buildings that lined the canal” repeats twice in close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cobalt library glass, magnetic grotto stones, and mist against panics are tactile, bias-filtered through Marina’s professional caretaker gaze. The grotto’s compass-warping lodestone constrains lantern placement and later charges the final image of flickering rules. Spatial choreography across twelve shops is kept coherent by the procession of after-chess visits. Environment is not just mood—it enables the rebellion’s mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sublittoral fringe is lived-in infrastructure: barnacled rock memory, kelp calves, tide clocks that decide when the island can be reached. Micro-setting (the whalebone tool, the ankle-deep pools) constrains every footstep and finally carries the scrimshaw away. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions as Marina wades, circles, releases. The cedar-twisted island recharges the final image by vanishing, reweighting the stakes: freedom is not a place but a subtraction.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Farmhouse/turbine geometry anchors every beat; wind casts literal shadow and auditory pressure that masks forbidden grief. Driftwood block operates as micro-setting—its diminishing mass externalizes the internal lightening. Spatial choreography stays clean; blades’ sweep is sensed even when off-stage. Final wall-absence image reuses the same vertical plane, reconfigured. No generic placeholders; every detail is filtered through Maya’s grief-narrowed attention.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cobalt atrium, quartz pillars, and frozen lake are etched in tactile, purpose-driven strokes; the colonnade’s warmth against winter cold is used to mark Lyren’s bodily risk and the moment of answered resonance. Micro-setting (her journal pages) charges the final image. No spatial drift; weather actively groans in response to speech.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ash-flecked cobblestones, twisted glass, and the reed’s tactile ridges are filtered through Mira’s haptic bias; colorblind POV justifies sensory selectivity. The courtyard constrains choreography: plants arranged along perimeter, reed placed center, Fen’s exit from kiln—space stays coherent. Weather (fading light) times the final exchange. Glassblower craft details are minimal but accurate and choice-relevant. The micro-setting of the reed-as-object charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Acoustic-reconstruction table, carbide lens, and dawn-lit monitors function as micro-setting that constrains action: only this lab could refract corrupted data into pilgrimage routes. The lens’s golden shadows dance across walls, charging the final image when Karim sees “landscapes that existed only in memory” yet feel real. Spatial choreography stays clean: stranger enters, places lens, claims controls; Karim stays seated until she stands to collaborate. Sensory selection narrows to sight and sound—no smell or temperature—mirroring the auditory premise.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory’s copper dome, ash-smeared workbench, and star-slit aperture are returned to as micro-setting that literally guides choice (starlight needed for curing, dome opening for perspective). Tool-detail on jeweler’s torch, diamond bur, resin viscosity constrains timing and risks. The final image marries environment and body: pendant held to starlight, Pleiades refracted through ash—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The loft is lived-in physics: ink stink, thread tension, skylight water acting as shifting lens—each detail constrains attention and later re-appears in the ending image. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track bodies around the bench, wall, ladder without drift. The rain’s amber refraction is not mood garnish but the final instrument that “refracts” the city into data, charging the closure. Missing only the tactile grit of the grandmother’s actual journal paper—an intimacy that would push it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bronze prism pagoda is not backdrop; its facets refract unnamed colors that “hurt to witness,” constraining Maressa’s ability to look away and thus her decision to proceed. The archive’s living-stone shelves and unpredictable hum function as micro-setting that alters her cognitive tactics; the final twilight dimming recharges the opening image, now weighted with refusal.</answer>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—pursue vs. refuse forbidden knowledge—tightens when the last atom reveals the civilization’s self-storage suicide; the price is Maressa’s irreversible loss of innocence. One meaningful turn: activation of the final atom crystallizes the ethical cost, forcing renunciation. Under causal lens, escalation is clean: each memory fragment raises the cost of continued pursuit until silence becomes the only tactic left.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The river stone functions as micro-setting: its heft opposes the anti-gravity library and literally presses against the transparent wall in the final image, constraining her stance. Perpetual golden hour and unwilting blossoms externalize stasis; the cloud-high perch denies erosion yet also denies growth. Sensory economy favors touch (stone) and sight (condensation) over tourist cataloguing. Environment mirrors thesis while remaining physically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fogged terrarium glass, humidity drip, and starlit valley create a coherent micro-climate that literally cages her choices. Prism’s shedding skin and color-shift serve as body-setting extensions that charge the final image. While the workshop never becomes a tactical obstacle, the misted glass physically traps her gaze and forces the decision beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tower room is economically sketched through sensory hooks (frosted hourglass, pressed ivy, coffee rings) that double as mood mirrors. The body-as-micro-setting works: the fresh abdominal scar constrains posture and attention. No external environment alters tactics, so the 9-gate is missed, but the selective detail is atmosphere-rich without momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The projection booth is rendered through hot-metal scent and sprocket-hole ache; every object (film strip, rewinder, aperture plate) is handled and gains emotional charge. Micro-setting triumph: the celluloid itself becomes geography—gaps between frames serve as chambers where love incubates, directly enabling the final act. Spatial choreography stays clean as Marina crawls, spreads, threads. Lacks a 9-push only because weather/outside city remains default-thunder wallpaper rather than feeding back into her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    Aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting: its granite pulse and meteor keyholes constrain every tactical move. Brass astrolabe is handled thrice, altering stance each time—tool-as-setting that charges closure. Sensory economy favors cold, light, sound of unspoken words; no filler weather clichés. Spatial choreography flawless: Lyra → archway center → mouth opens → light pours through her.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing dune, chess-clock, and phosphorescent flowers constrain every tactic—she sings to the equations because the flowers draw nutrients from probability fields, and the clock’s frozen midnight is the literal threshold she must breach. Sensory economy is perfect: ash-dark sky, luminescent sand, and quantum-inked container walls are filtered through her physics-tuned attention. Micro-setting (the clock in her pocket) charges the final image when it warms and ticks. No scaffolding or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mechanical rainforest is rendered through tactile micro-details—copper whistles, iron groans, gear-coin pulsing—yet the spatial choreography is one-man wandering, so environment constrains attention rather than tactical choice. The gear-as-micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; only the slight over-painting of “endlessly in all directions” keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The veiled ridgeway remains postcard-fog until the final paragraph, where “each stone distinct” finally charges the image; until then, setting is atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint. The brass punch serves as micro-setting and recurrent object, handled in every beat, so meets the 9+ gate even if landscape does not.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cobalt stone, perpetual snow, and four piano-leg dents are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through Marta’s labor. The bolt micro-object constrains her pocketed guilt and finally charges the closing placement. Spatial choreography on the spiral staircase is immaculate; each ash-mark is discovered through physical kneeling and tracing. Environment mirrors interior thaw: as feeling returns to hands, the fortress’s acoustic freeze begins to break under her hum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dying library is not backdrop but tool: gossamer scrolls, backward-flowing spring, and translucent walls progressively constrain Kael’s options until only one sending remains. Sensory triangulation—ink’s “purple-black iridescence,” columns “threading with luminous cracks”—is filtered through her custodial gaze, never touristic. The final image of void “where lost things go to dream” recharges earlier spatial cues, meeting the 9-band gate; micro-shortfall is the absence of a tactile object that survives to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Station stilts, sunrise angle, and the ripped atlas function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice: she can only tape the page where glass catches dawn light, making the gesture irreversible. Sensory hierarchy is scientist-practical—temperature readouts, current overlays—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: railing → desk → window → headset exchange. Environment supplies the final image (station swaying but moored) that literalises “drifting moored” and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Spaceport ruin is vivid, selective, and filtered through Kira’s barefoot soles; micro-setting (warm concrete, oil stains) constrains her pacing and mirrors internal fatigue. The stone circle’s hum is tactile, not catalogued, and charges the final image. Environment directly enables the closing epiphany, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Volcanic glass, steam-displaced visibility, and root-network spatial logic constrain every choice; the cave’s dreamlike refraction literalizes the theme of uncertain becoming. The kite’s bark-paper tail and amber sphere are handled, not catalogued, and their evolving physical states alter tactics (light angle for reading, warmth for unsealing). Final image—the embryo drifting in steam—charges the atmosphere with conceptual cost. Meets 9+ gate: micro-setting (cave glass) directly shapes the unsealing act.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass conservatory wall, potting bench soil under nails, and salt-wind-scented rosemary function as micro-setting that constrains her propagation choices. The automated beacon’s mechanical sweep contrasts vegetal persistence, recharging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys her gardener gaze—texture of crumpled photo soft as cloth, lavender stems “delicate,” soil moisture checked by finger. Spatial choreography is clean: potting bench → glass wall → cliff edge and back, no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tightening lighthouse walls and rotating beam function as both body-scale constraint and metaphysical mirror; they physically force the card-work and charge the final image. Salt-smell books and gossamer threads are selective, not touristic. Micro-setting (the broken box lid) literally shapes the final gesture of refusal to reseal it.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Wind-carved sandstone cliffs and prismatic drone wings are filtered through Kael’s predator-biased eye, anchoring who-where-when within 50 words. The alcove’s pale rock becomes a micro-setting that constrains the ink reveal and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys her eclipse-scorched skin and light-sensitive pink eyes. Environment guides choice: only the wind-sculpted crevice offers the sheltered surface where ink can pool and vanish.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Snow fell perpetually through the broken dome overhead” immediately bodies the library in a single, memorable image. Cold is not backdrop—it disables retrieval tech, mandates gloves, shapes Kael’s hush-breath urgency. Shelves of crystallized data cores act as both vault and latent weapon, charging the final transmission. Spatial choreography stays clean: hand-to-vault-to-terminal path is trackable; only the “echoing” descriptor is slightly over-milked across four mentions.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dome itself acts as constraint—climate, visibility, social fragility—forcing the father to lower his weapon; roses breathe and lean, charging the final image. Ballast canvas scraps evolve from debris to ethic medium, their freighted histories literally planted, a micro-object that alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices petal curl, dust weight, holster creak, never tourist-catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sound-wave garden is rendered through selective, urgent sense filters—“crystalline terraces vibrating at frequencies that made sound visible”—and the rail spike functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory economy is tight: sound is vision, silence is drowning, iron sings. Spatial choreography holds: the skiff, the pinned frequency, the bottle of light all track cleanly. Only the garden’s deeper “frequency layers” remain a touch abstract, but the spike literalizes them on-page, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Observatory dome functions as micro-setting: acoustic echo mirrors inner chaos, aperture light frames the nib inspection, spiral stairs mark the moral descent. Cloud-sea vista supplies tonal lift at end. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. “Rosewood pen nib” acts as portable setting extension, its vintage grain bridging eras. Weather/cloud shift is symbolic but timed with decision beat, earning its place.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Laboratory of lost sounds” is more than postcard: shelves of obsolete decks, meteor hush at 2 a.m., ink nebulae—each detail filtered through Mira’s synesthetic vocation. The mahogany desk drawer hides future/past letters that literally change her workspace posture. The amber isn’t scenery; its port-fit forces the climax. Micro-settings (firmware slot, tattoo needle) constrain final choice, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting triumph: the grotto’s parabolic acoustics turn ambient drip into a second score, forcing Isla’s breathing to slow and match the mother’s. The damp stone literally colours the sand, making every ridge darker—environment altering artefact. Mist is not backdrop but timing device: it thickens only after the tile fragment is laid, signalling phase shift. Final image of “slow, strange rebirth” is charged by the acoustic hush that now feels breathable.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Shattered sky and plaza mosaic are not backdrop but tactical instruments: the cracked glass sound-track underscores the knife-edge tension, while the tessera’s physical fracture is the literal trigger for retrocognition. Micro-setting (single stepping-stone) constrains the entire conflict. Sensory economy obeys Vessa’s prosthetic sensors—temperature differential, tremor calibration—so every detail is POV-filtered. Final image reuses both environment and object to crystallize the new moral configuration.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment (silver-fruit orchard) constrains tactics: time-folding branches let Celeste literally pick and graft futures onto the boy’s path. Spatial choreography is clean—antique shop → hidden door → hedge maze → orchard—each threshold tightens access and stakes. Selective sensory layering (apple/rot on same branch) mirrors her ambivalence. Tool-as-setting (tarot coin) alters her acoustic reach; orchard responds with windless sway, proving micro-setting qualifies.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Studio is concise micro-setting: LED array, damp palm, paper-thin geode—objects handled, not catalogued. Rainbows scatter once, then return reweighted in the “delicate as willowglass” line, charging closure. Body-as-setting works: fever palm, solar-plexus warmth anchor stakes. Spatial track survives the shock collision. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses invited only once.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bioluminescent algae, tide-breathing walls, and the flooded air-pocket shelf are rendered with tactile economy; the cave itself acts as a sensing membrane. The elm fossil micro-setting doubles as tool and talisman, handled in multiple beats and charged in the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mira catalogs taste-air and thermal longing-waves, not cartographic distances. Environment constrains her only route—float/record/speak—so the cave network is agency-shaping, not postcard scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zephyr Bluff’s wind-sculpted snow functions as co-protagonist: its patterns enable the code, its melt deadline drives the scene. Mist and spring tilt supply both atmosphere and ticking clock. The engraved pillbox recurs as tacticle anchor, handled twice with reweighted meaning. Environment directly constrains choice—without the snow she can’t read Marcus, without the melt she wouldn’t act today.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Fog, river, ticking gutters, and lantern light are filtered through the coachman’s river-tuned attention; sensory hierarchy (sound before sight) mirrors his ambient craft. The yarn needle functions as micro-setting: handled twice, it guides the woman’s re-orientation and literally “mends” her reading of the will. Spatial choreography is clean—coach, ferry planks, satchel, and reins all track without drift. Weather shift (fog lifting) is causal, not symbolic backdrop, enabling the crossing. Environment does not merely echo mood; it gates the decision, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern glass functions as micro-setting; its prismed colors charge the final image and constrain her daily ritual. Wasteland vs. oasis opposition is economically sketched yet sensory (warm stones, thrumming air). Spatial choreography stays clean across the three-week span. Environment shapes her stance; the oasis leans toward her kindness—an irreversible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fire-escape micro-garden, the brass tool worn “smooth from decades,” the moon-slick harbor, and the splintery boathouse planks are all filtered through Mira’s locksmith gaze—every surface is something to be read, picked, or cultivated. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: five-story descent, alley, dock, boats, lighthouse, return. Weather (full moon, wind-shadowed water) directly shapes the tactic of reflective light-beaming. Sensory economy favors touch and sight, mirroring a lockmaster’s tactile precision. The lighthouse interior evolves from “dark” to “blazed” under the children’s converging beams—an environmental state-change that mirrors the thematic unlock.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is protagonist: atomically reflective floor guides navigation, brass sundial constrains path-finding, tidal clouds force vertical escape. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Kael’s urgency—photon reflections and vapor density matter more than catalog visuals. Setting directly shapes tactics and is inseparable from the closing cartography act.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lotus temple + lily pond function as micro-setting: the wet stone path underfoot guides her slow relinquishment, and the golden pond surface mirrors the final release. Sensory hierarchy is biased to reflective surfaces and water-light, matching the thematic “prismatic.” Spatial choreography is tight—satchel → spiral → pond arc. The spiral’s reed-and-twig construction is specific enough to resist swap; it constrains the literal tying action that resolves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The basement studio’s “dust and ozone” is filtered through an astronomer’s eye—charts red-inked with signal correlations—so setting guides her improvised antenna alignment. Jupiter’s position is not just color but a functional constraint that amplifies her hack, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: headphones pressed, floor thrumming, charts trembling. No weather clichés; the only environment is circuitry and celestial geometry, exactly what the conflict needs.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nexus is tactile, not postcard: “walls breathing inward,” stone cold & thrumming, starlight pouring like silver rain. Micro-setting rule met: the compass and flagstones function as handled environment that literally reshape under her palm. Spatial choreography is crystal—five corridors, shrinking entrance, impossible depth—all tracked without drift. The final image of starlight following her out recharges the opening motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quarry’s chisel-scarred walls, mist, and Vera’s boot purchase on ancient marks constrain movement and echo the killer’s precise violence. Micro-setting object—the ribbon—evolves from evidence to emotional lens, charging the final portrait. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s artist eye: texture of stone, color of thread, angle of neck. Final image is inseparable from setting’s negative space.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Station, storm, and nail are rendered with tactile specificity; the copper’s patina under the scope is the micro-setting that literally carries the world-saving math. Rain from the “wrong direction” keeps climate stakes sensory. Spatial choreography is clean; only the cliff’s exact relation to the landing zone remains generic, preventing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mountain pullout and fluttering mesh are viscerally anchored; scaffolding distance and slope under boots track cleanly. The mesh-as-setting actively constrains the discovery beat—names only visible at full wind-taut tension—so environment shapes tactics. Sensory economy favors wind/light/touch over visual catalog. Micro-setting (fiddle case, glass flake) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Train car acts as micro-setting that constrains: the loose window grants illicit entry; the creaking walls amplify his trapped breathing; the fox’s amber eyes mirror Luka’s self-surveillance. One more tactile detail of the mildewed velvet against his skin would have nudged 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Observatory is lived-in: dome motors, red night-lights, eyepiece breath-fog. Winter mountain cold noses into skin and metal, guiding the decision to stay inside and talk. Telescope and telegram function as micro-settings that constrain choice—no single observer can hold the data. Final image of converging starlight fuses place and theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Swirling orchard-vortex is simultaneously setting, antagonist, and memory palace; leafless apple-trees as “skeletal hands” constrains her path and charges final image. Micro-setting rule satisfied: lily-pads-in-winter create impossible footing that forces her ritual gait. Sensory hierarchy follows Kael’s druidic bias—she reads water memory, smells rot, feels bark pulse. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across five tightening circuits.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt glade is more than postcard: its light literally guides the maze-build and reflects their scar-glow, charging the final image. Wheelchair, clipping, and scar serve as micro-settings that constrain motion and tactile choice. Spatial choreography stays clean as Chen kneels, others emerge, and the crystalline maze grows from their hands. Dusk timing tightens the visual stakes without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is not mere backdrop; its phosphorescent fruit and root-threads literally constrain Mira’s next tactic—she maps the exchange on living trunks. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Mira’s fingers on carved symbols narrow attention to tools she can repurpose in the final beat. Spatial choreography is surgical: lantern angle, root-skull density, and the oldest tree as rendezvous point stay trackable. Environment thus charges the final image with conceptual cost: stepping into a soil of bones to unmake a destiny is irreplaceably specific.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The trailer’s limestone dust, magnifying lamp, and quarry hollow constrain Marcus’s options and echo his emptied career; the cloth’s weave and smell act as micro-setting that charges the final wall-tacking. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through ex-roadie expertise, never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean; the quarry’s abandoned scale mirrors his interior without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Magnetic arbor’s electromagnetic hum and cloud-floor are concrete, bias-filtered through Asha’s scholar-eye. The seed-as-micro-setting is tactile—clay dust mixed into soil—and directly enables germination. One slip: “platform hummed with a frequency” is generic; exact sensory signature (pitch, bone feel) missing. Still, environment constrains the final miracle, satisfying 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal atrium is not backdrop but hydraulic engine: shelf migration and copper basin literally narrow Maren’s options, forcing the smelt. Micro-setting objects—creel, titan-gear—constrain every reach and fold; their salt-dark weave and cog pitch return in the final heartbeat sync, charging the closure image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Crystal topology and shell acoustics constrain the ritual; the caves’ latent glow literally charges the final image.

    The ivy-choked platform, still-functional pump, and tape-glinting accordion are vividly selective and mirrored in Maya’s internal decay/recovery; spatial choreography is clean and the station constrains her choice to stay and play. Environment charges the final image—ivy and bellows both patched yet still breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fog, amber-lit stacks, and mist-shifting shelves are sketched with economical sensory triads that reinforce temporal disorientation. The library’s vertical abyss and violet door are not postcard glamour—they gate access and force Elena’s climb, so setting directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting (watch, veil, journal) is handled on-page, each altering risk calculus. One minor spatial fudge: shelves “stretch impossibly upward” yet a spiral staircase appears without re-anchoring ground distance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Velvet observatory, bruised twilight, and ice violin are not backdrop but tools that constrain choice (the violin’s fragility demands replication, the velvet gloom hides subversion). Micro-setting triumph: the coffee cup becomes a forecasting engine whose porcelain continents guide the climax. Spatial choreography remains flawless across desk–case–window triangle.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora light, and emerald chip form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains every beat: altitude dictates breathless hush, aurora supplies the only illumination for pigment choice, the chip is the literal tool of translation. Spatial choreography is immaculate (table descent through floor aperture). Sensory economy—smell of dyed wool recalled, touch of calluses—mirrors weaver’s life without tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Grotto’s mist-stone walls, pearl-bark trees, and Pool of Reflection are not postcard scenery—they channel souls and physically position Mei (ascend to think). Hairpin micro-setting re-appears at closure. Sensory economy favors hush and vineyard-like growth metaphors, aligning with tone. Could gain 0.2 if one tactile detail of condensed mist on skin constrained her next gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse, wind chimes, and concave mirror constitute a tight micro-setting that actively reframes faces and choices. Dawn light and salt air are filtered through Mara’s professional gaze; brass tubes become an “instrument” she reads, a tool that constrains interpretation. Spatial choreography is clean; no object teleport. Final glow on chimes recharges the motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The magnetic grotto’s starlight “pooled in impossible colors, violet bleeding to copper” is sensory, selective, and immediately tied to the meditation goal; the same light refracts in the pond rings at closure, charging the final image. Body-as-setting (Keiran’s reversing age) functions as a lived prop that constrains his teaching urgency. Spatial choreography is clean—stones drop, ripples expand, bodies remain kneeling/sitting on a drifting platform. The mineral aurora is irreplaceable: its color-shift cues the perceptual lesson and reappears in the last line’s shimmer, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Bone towers, dust layers, and perpetual echo are not backdrop but tactical instruments—she uses their resonance to perform the rescue. The arrowhead’s flint and the birds’ wings are micro-settings that constrain method; remove either and the appraisal fails. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: sound first, touch implied, vision last. Final image—“dust settling fresh upon her shoulders”—crystallizes setting and stance simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Environment (the icebound spire) directly constrains the final action—only the keystone’s exact wedge can seal the apex fracture, making setting a tactical actor, not backdrop. Micro-setting of the folly stone in her hands recurs as charged object, its vine motif mirrored in tower carvings. Sensory hierarchy follows POV: mist accepts weight, ice refracts “brilliant dimness,” stone hums. No static catalogue; every detail is filtered through Teryn’s bias toward beauty-over-efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Harbor, wreck, and lantern sky are economically layered; each sensory pick (cold water stealing breath, rust-cathedral) serves Marcus’s narrowing attention. The waterproof cases labeled “Thunder/Indigo” let setting supply plot assets, not postcard color. The key tag and vacuum-sealed journal function as micro-setting that gate the climax. Only nit: no tactile detail of brass in the dive itself, keeping it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber-lit deck, corroded coins, and static bursts are sensuously specific and feed directly into Kael’s choices (receiver tuning, coin-casting). Micro-setting—the console’s metallic clatter—constrains the next frequency pick. A hairline over-reliance on visual amber; one tactile or olfactory hit in the final third would nudge 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Observatory as micro-setting constrains every beat: the oxidized dome fractures light necessary for crystal naming, the angled telescope dictates where she stands to catch the ray. Atlas page itself becomes portable setting, perimeter shrinking to knife-tip on kraken. Dusk’s scattered light is not backdrop but required tool—no other locus could supply the prismatic refraction. Final image of crystallized words in pocket is inseparable from this architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment (viaduct stone, dew, dried riverbed) is returned to in every beat and finally constrains the cosmically balanced drip-rate that restarts the cycle. Body-as-setting (palms cradling corroded bell) and tool-as-setting (bell interior hosting quasi-liquid clapper) charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy collapses to sound and touch under crisis—perfect alignment with accumulative design. Spatial choreography is immaculate: Maren center-span, water below, upward weeping; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The midnight ridgeway, mudbank, and mirrored hush constrain movement and set secrecy; the sapphire label’s reprise in the final paragraph recharges the object-as-setting. Sensory hierarchy is biased by warden expertise—water levels, levee stress—anchoring reader in Marafocused attention. Spatial choreography is crisp: ridge descent → mudbank → storefront → ridge return. Environment quietly mirrors internal shift from silence to restored chime.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting that constrains the final action—its geometric perfection triggers the irreversible flame experiment—while the kaleidoscopic waterfall and copper-apple orchard supply vivid, POV-filtered sensory detail without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Arbor-as-micro-setting: every hand-on-bark read constrains what Vera can claim; moisture angle of leaf-veins literally decides futures. Spatial choreography is spotless—steps left, duck, intersection point—tracked without drift. Starlit silver leaves mirror her internal flicker between doubt and certainty. Final sway above clouds images the precarious trust she must keep aloft.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating dojo, reality-rewriting plains, and brain-in-jar operate as both backdrop and pressure source: the tethered cables and stuttering forests literalize unstable identity. Micro-setting—the jar itself—becomes the pivot object that constrains Kenji’s final choice. Sensory selection stays biased to his narrowed affect: visual chill of amber fluid, auditory hum of cables. One minor slip: “Montana/what used to be called” is generic; still, the world rules remain consistent and the final image recharges the jar’s obsolete label.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mill-by-creek, moonlit garden, storm-washed air: selective sensory detail anchors each beat. The brook’s “eternal song” and midnight bloom create nocturnal atmosphere that directly feeds the escape-room mystique. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel’s acoustic physics are not exposition but discovered through ritual action—leaf against stone, nozzle angle changing pitch. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marcus’s caretaker gaze: blower roar first, then smell of leaf dust, then vibration in wrist bones. The ventilation grates function as both literal ducts and emotional trapdoors, letting sound “curl around hearts” upstairs—setting actively mediates outcome. Micro-setting of the pull-cord handle in his palm becomes the story’s heartbeat metronome.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen roses, frost-call-numbered books, and pendant silver create tight sensory hierarchy filtered by POV priorities. Micro-setting (pendant) constrains the decisive choice; garden mist literally guides her crawl path. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from thorn-bush to shelf-line. Cold as persistent environmental antagonist shapes action—she moves on all fours to conserve heat. Final image of melting-ice call numbers re-anchors transformed library, charging ending.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ember nexus is not backdrop but micro-setting that supplies the literal heat and molten metal required for vivification; its fivefold star shape constrains where Maren must kneel and where the staff fuses. Twilight tightens the clock—world “held its breath”—creating a liminal permission window for sacrilege. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Maren notices sulfur stench, quicksilver tremble, dove-blood temperature because each indexes prior failures. The broken crozier evolves from symbol of hierarchy to neuron-like tendrils, its transformed grain an environmental extension of her own veins.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory economy—copper housing, groan of cables, moonlight filtering through broken windows—grounds the tower as both cradle and antenna. The gorge’s invisible depth mirrors the unseeable cosmic depth she tunes into, charging the final image. No spatial contradictions; weather (lunar perigee) is causal, not garnish. Micro-setting (hollywood fragment) constrains the tuning action and returns reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Optical-illusion gallery is sensuously traced: sinew glints, stairs loop, Penrose shadow sharpens into the boy; environment actively rewrites itself around her touch, constraining every subsequent threading motion and charging the final fold where walls breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Benthic city pressure (three-kilometer water column, absolute dark) shapes every thought and action; the dome acrylic, bioluminescent wildlife, and corroded chain link act as micro-setting objects that literally constrain choice—chain reprise charges the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: darkness first, then engineered amber light, tactile iron weight; no tourism catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean across single-scene window. Setting alone does not reach 9+ because it never threatens bodily failure on-page, but it reconfigures the final image of “stars reflected on water” versus crushing darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mist-clad atrium is more than scenery: its glass walls “pressing…like something trying to get out” mirror the dead boy’s urgency and Mara’s containment of voices. The decades-old hearing aid acts as micro-setting—every temperature shift grounds us inside her tactile process. Space stays coherent across the single scene; potted ferns “lean toward secrets,” an image that quietly prefaces the later reveal of voices leaning on her. Setting thus constrains and charges the final quiet image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Facility-as-carcass metaphor is sustained, tactile, and filters through Maya’s spelunker gaze: “barnacled walls and rusted walkways like the ribs of some ancient creature.” Gold-flecked codex functions as micro-setting that constrains the final beat—its conductivity literally illuminates the exit. Spatial choreography clean: four descending levels, narrowing corridors, single junction room. Tide re-entry supplies live environmental pressure that forces departure; setting charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Opal floor, dome glazed with moonlight, sub-zero air biting palms, radio hum—selective sensory triangulation guides ritual choice; the shard’s jagged edge and ink’s viscosity constrain gesture, while winter cold limits duration of exposure. Micro-setting (shard and ink) literally charges the final image when the shard drinks the mandala. Observatory scale is sketched, not over-toured; cold and silence externalize the internal defragment process, tightening atmosphere to theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon’s acoustic mirror-rule and the bone tower’s porous surface are not backdrop but tools: ridges receive the diamond’s micro-incisions, echo chamber guarantees perpetual playback. Micro-setting = diamond + bone interface that literally rewrites the world. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and hearing, matching Maerith’s goal. Weather/light are used sparingly (“fading light” in final line) to time the last encoding. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. One whisker off 9 because the canyon’s “endless” scale drifts toward grandeur without grounding a single physical constraint (echo decay time, etc.).

    The underground garden is not backdrop; its impossible gravitic vines literally steer Elena’s sensory disorientation and decide where she plants the confession pot. The copper-wrapped phone and bioluminescent moss are tools that constrain the only means of contact. Micro-setting (arrowhead among roots) is gripped in a choice beat and reappears in closure pocket. One minor slip: “snow falling upward” final image is conceptually charged but not pre-seeded in spatial layout, barely missing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sky-bridge height, gear-grind city, silver-apple dusk, and stone sentinels are sketched with swift sensory economy. The violin body and locust shell act as micro-settings that literally touch the final action. Spatial choreography stays clean—commuters freeze, fence rattles, roots become legs—each move tracks. One minor slip: “earth cascading from its wooden joints” momentarily pictures sawdust instead of soil, but the image still constrains the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt arcade’s blue glass and shuttered shops are filtered through Kael’s caution—sensory hierarchy biased toward sound (brittle hush) and tactical movement. Micro-setting works: the defunct fountain as territorial line constrains the hand-off. Environment recurs in the final image, now recharged as “blessing.” No spatial drift; weather is bottled, literal, and causal. Lacks a 9-level environmental twist that actively blocks an exit, hence 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting mastery: the crimson car, brass poles, and wind bells are not backdrop but tools that constrain her repair sequence and refract the final gleam. Blackberry thorns, mist, and willow shade are sensory selected to mirror her sealed throat and later opening. The halo fragment’s material properties (gilt, half-circle, light-catcher) charge the closure image decisively; remove it and the resonance collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The converted-observatory library is rendered through Meridian’s professional eye—“villanelles of Maxwell’s equations,” “quantum sestinas”—and finally constrains her final gesture: the scarf settles into the predicted valleys. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (scarf) charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Archipelago functions as micro-setting: ferry schedule dictates life, cliff vantage enables photography, triangular islands mirror triangle of palette wells. Fog “pressing like a living thing,” honey-thick sun through scratched yellow pan—tactile, selective, POV-filtered. Palette itself becomes final “place” where secret is found, satisfying the 9+ gate that an object charges the closing image. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The locksmith bench’s “astrolabe crossed with a music box” is a micro-setting object that literally constrains the final choice—only this device can transmute the hair into sound. Starlight is not backdrop; it threads the ribbon and thereby charges the final image with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara steps back into the same “shadowed nexus” but the angle of exit is altered by the tilted floor she navigated mid-scene. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Mara notices smoke-iron shifts in the sign, not tourist details, because keys equal survival for her.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shattered greenhouse panes, moon-fractured glass, and salt-apple air are lived-in and pressure choices—she positions herself at the pentacle they form. The sunken orchard’s biology (roots gripping underwater) and the accidental “cathedral” of shipwrecks constrain movement and echo the memory-cathedral she enters. Micro-setting (star chart, fungal halos) is handled, not catalogued. Final image of broken constellations recharges the setting with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The forgotten library is evoked through tactility—dusty boards, chipped pot, warped windows—rather than catalogue. The playground swing functions as micro-setting: its creak supplies the hush-meter that times the scene and its final stillness mirrors Kael’s new poise. Spatial choreography is flawless; both women move in precise backward vectors that track across beats. Swing as time-device constrains the pacing of mentorship beats and charges the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    The worn-smooth shears, wet stone parapet, and waterfall’s “radiant hush” act as micro-setting that literally steadies the crossing; without their tactile anchoring the braid would collapse. Final image of seed tucked “where reality grew particularly thin” crystallizes the spatial logic—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prism sanctuary fractures starlight into “nervous colors,” an immediate sensory filter that later recharges the final image of her mask reflecting the same light. The salt-stiff net’s knot-by-knot resistance constrains her trembling hands and paces the beat-level action. Spatial choreography stays clean: vault → center → cliff above. Environment does not merely backdrop; its optical fragmentation mirrors the splintering of drowned voices and Mara’s own broken sightline through the mask’s missing eye.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rain-scoured vault, the spiral grass, the torn map edge, and the exposed prehistoric stones are not backdrop but instruments: they constrain Elena’s interpretation and supply the final recommendation. Sensory triage is POV-filtered—she notices moisture-ghosted saints and axial-shift shadows because they mirror cartographic absence. Micro-setting (the trilithon’s footprint) literally shapes the reopening plan. Final image recharges the vault frescoes: ruined saints now frame the site’s new, deliberate wound.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Submersible cockpit, collapsed library shelves, and the slowly tilting floor form a micro-setting that literally constrains reach and sample collection. Brass cylinders scattered “like dropped cigarettes” and the waterproof radio housing give tactile specificity that guides Marina’s mechanical-arm choices. Spatial choreography is flawless: lights catch spine → shelves collapsed → captain’s quarters behind → snow globe anchored. Glycerin snow suspended mid-fall re-appears in the final image, charging closure by re-pricing the same object.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sky Monastery, copper bolt plates, prayer-wheels, pigment jars—each object is tactile and recruited into action. Micro-setting rule met: the bolt plate constrains every encoding stroke and returns in the final snap of “completing the circuit.” Weather (mist, lightning, thunder) narrows perception and times the beats. No geographic drift; spatial choreography is airtight.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frost-etched brass cage, amber ribbons in ice, and captain’s abandoned quarters are economically selected and return to constrain choice: only this frozen spire’s refractive walls make the diary legible, so the setting actively enables the climax. Details are filtered through Maren’s servant-eye—she notes worn leather, soup delivery, polishing the binnacle—anchoring class and intimacy without tourist excess. Spatial choreography is clean: elevator rises past countable floors, goggles pocketed then donned, diary pages turned while cage rattles. Environment recharges the final image: clouds seen “outside the spire” replay Thessaly’s sky-vigil, sealing setting’s role in meaning.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—will Maren discover a living trace of Thessaly’s lost self?—tightens each floor; entries move from nostalgic joy to pressure-sickness admission, raising emotional cost. Maren’s agency is attentional rather than combative: she chooses to keep reading, to keep seeing, thereby foreclosing the option to remember Thessaly as merely vacant. The goggles’ reveal is not coincidence but the earned payoff of her curiosity; escalation is textural, a density increase of love and loss rather than plot twists. A visible price is paid on-page: Maren exits tasked with “seeking out every moment,” a lifelong curatorial burden now inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Brass telescope functions as micro-setting: its patina, weight, and Victor’s fingerprints constrain every tilt of the lens and charge the final touch. Gondola’s altitude, cold glass, and dusty starlight are filtered through Mara’s meteorologist gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is tight—body, notebook, telescope, western window—each beat references a tactile anchor. Environment directly guides the last image (“clouds gathered…homecoming”), satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tree-library’s weeping sap shelves and encroaching demolition gear constrain every beat; she must act before sunrise. The coin-as-micro-setting charges the closure when its warmth against her ribs becomes the last tactile link to the monk’s infinite attempt. Selective sensory hierarchy—touch over sight—mirrors her face-blind perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is clean: she lifts, photographs, tucks the coin while wrecking-ball idles outside. Environment is not backdrop but ticking container that will shortly fail to hold heaven, forcing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Brass hull, amber sky, chalk on planking, lazy compass needle—details are filtered through Maren’s cartographer eye and tied to action. Antique airship is more postcard than functional, but the hopscotch board behaves like a physical tool that constrains the final tactic, satisfying micro-setting gate. Starling murmuration mirrors the unlocking swirl, adding resonance without overt symbolism. Tactile specificity anchors the floating locale without checklist description.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Frozen library above clouds” is not postcard; the ice-encased shelves and amber dawn constrain movement (slippery floor, frost-numb fingers) and shape the hush needed to hear gear-ticks. Micro-setting object—the brass gear assortment—becomes the tactile ground she walks on once spread on the table; its evolving chill mirrors her warming understanding. Spatial choreography clean: entry → table → shelves → hidden chamber → descent, all tracked. Final image of synchronized heartbeat and gears is charged by environment’s cold acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Low-gravity droplets, floating rock arches, and butterfly bells are tactile, selective, and mirror the communal drift/tether tension. The copper bell and chalked words act as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics—pollination failure, message permanence—charging the final image. Sensory economy favors nebula light and orchard weight; no exposition dumps. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the square, domes, and orchards.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse is rendered as a body-instrument: spiral stairs = vertebrae, lantern room = skull, pane of hush = eardrum; setting is micro-scaled to the tool she wields. The hidden/bleeding land and wounded-gold horizon are filtered through bereaved attention—she sees surfaces that can be tuned, not vistas to admire. Spatial choreography is immaculate: climb, cradle, threshold, pane, dust—every object tracked without drift. The final image of an empty lighthouse that is simultaneously full of lullaby satisfies the 9+ test: environment charges the resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orchard-as-body dominates via tactile verbs (“clung,” “screamed,” “clicked”), sensory hierarchy follows Maren’s priorities. Micro-setting (nut, hovering footfalls) directly enables escape route, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across the walk sequence. Mechanical birds, frost clock, and labyrinth geometry each pressure tactics; cliffside locale could be any high ledge, a minor generic note preventing top band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The braided ravine is not postcard backdrop; its foam patterns supply the literal mechanics for her polymer insight, constraining the final choice. Micro-setting success: the chrysalis functions as portable setting-object that charges the exit image. Sensory hierarchy obeys a chemist’s bias—visual patterns, molecular allegories, cold-water data. Achieves 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass orchard is not backdrop; its crystalline trees refract light that literally guides Mira’s stylus. Micro-setting objects—bottled moonlight, incised floor—constrain every move; she cannot map without their optical cooperation. Spatial choreography is flawless: moonlight “pools like mercury, seeking the lowest points,” leading her eye to each cut. Final image of floating library/cloud-sea re-weights the premise: memory’s absence keeps the whole structure aloft.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Desert-after-rain and subterranean frost create an impossible yet internally consistent physics that charges the final image. The “coral icebound pavilion” is handled three times—described, tasted, dissolved—making it both setting and plot engine. Micro-setting succeeds: the cloth wrapping, the stair breach, the tidal pools constrain every tactile move. Sensory selection stays biased to Maren’s chef palate, avoiding tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clock-tower mechanics are tactile and specific: brass meridians, cuckoo weight, pulley, cupola starlight. Object handling constrains the broadcast timing and returns in the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography keeps seven off-page silos legible through distinct audio cues. Prairie night is evoked with economic sensory triangulation—cold, starlight, humming across distance—never slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon-as-skull and moon-shadowed mineral shield function as both atmosphere and tactical constraint—hiding the site from detection. The broken mirror’s fracture lines evolve from damage to optical modification, charging the final interface beat. Sensory selection is urgent: silver light, cracked reflections, synaptic static. Setting is not backdrop; its geometry literally enables the new protocol. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto’s serpentine anatomy is rendered through Celene’s tactile navigation; walls, mist, and floating grit constrain every pull and squeeze. The manuscript page itself acts as micro-setting, its angle-of-light threshold literally steering her body. Final image of stone-become-soil crystallizes the inversion rule and charges closure. No environment details are wasted; each reappears as tactic or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The alder grove is filtered through Mara’s professional attention to vibration; every bark stroke and root sway is purposeful, never postcard. The porcelain insulator’s crystalline feel and the stress-crack map function as micro-settings that constrain her precise wire tensions. One minor over-explanation—“vibration lived everywhere, patient and invisible”—is the only line that slackens the otherwise tight sensory weave.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic nexus is rendered through iron-tasting air, spinning compasses, and geometric song—details that actively block conventional navigation and force Katrin’s chess translation. Micro-settings (basalt stone, weighted pieces) function as portable terrain that constrains every tactical move. Final image re-uses “constellation come to earth,” re-weighting the earlier star-field motif. Spatial choreography stays coherent across bodiless forces moving pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Workshop’s copper coils, salvaged war radios, and star-vented roof constrain every tactical move—equipment limits which frequencies she can try. Micro-setting of the brass clasp charges the final image: its molecules warm under fingertip perception, becoming the embodiment of Elena’s intention. Sensory hierarchy is biased to sound and touch, matching Marcella’s profession; fireworks’ red-gold light is filtered only at the end, mirroring revelation without overt symbolism. No spatial drift; every object’s placement is tracked cleanly across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    The treetop village is never generic postcard: swaying platforms, rope bridges, and cedar scent constrain every move; wind direction decides where the stench drifts and where Lirien plants the pot. Body-as-setting is vivid—her stomach lurches, hands tremble, breathing shallows—anchoring spatial tension. The pressed petal inside the journal serves as micro-object that recharges the final image. One minor spatial fuzz: “platforms away” is imprecise distance, but it never confuses choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating arches, rising irrigation, and water-sphere chamber are sensory, plot-functional, and unique. The inverted orchard is not mere backdrop—it funnels flight path and reveals the buried arrow. Micro-setting (broken arrow tip) becomes the literal key to the past. Only the skeletal tree at First Orchard drifts toward generic; still, environment constrains every maneuver, qualifying for 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Container geometry is tactile—“rust-orange walls,” “metal canyons”—and constrains movement and perception; wind pressure is made legible through stacked papers, ballast stones, sensor digits.

Environment directly shapes the investigative method, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bell hierarchy (thimble to cathedral) and aurora-fed ice vault constrain every move Kael makes; tools (amber sheet, his palms) become micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory triangulation—metal cold, aurora colors, violet-gold echo—guides his anti-conducting. Environment, body, tool all re-appear in the closing hush, re-weighted as the price he must live inside.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thunder-echo range is not backdrop but active constraint: silence pools that “dissipate” sound dictate the threshold’s location and the flute’s test. Canyon wall under her palm, weighted case, and amphitheater of silence charge the final image. Driftwood markers integrate body, tool, and terrain; no white-room syndrome. Spatial choreography clean—left-hand passage, three-walled heart—all tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Topaz walls, cold metal type, and the thumbnail halo fragment constrain every tactical move; the fragment’s glow literally guides ink placement and final press pull. The vanishing sky functions as environmental countdown—each wink-out dims the room and tightens available light for work. Micro-body setting: the operator’s fingers become calipers, pressure gauges, then tremblingly uncertain once he owns them. The workshop’s amber light is charged in the final image, reflecting both ink glow and cosmic loss.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Aurora, ridgeway stones, and the pendant’s copper patina are filtered through courier bias—what’s stable, what sings. The lights shift from pretty backdrop to child-dragon lens, charging the final image. Micro-setting rule met: pendant-as-tool constrains the farmer-scene choice and recurs at closure. Selective sensory economy keeps momentum; no static catalogue. Weather (aurora intensity) tracks causally with emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz arbor functions as both cathedral and battery, constraining Mara’s final decision by offering itself as archive; frost on windshield acts as micro-setting that literally encodes her prior drive, forcing re-seeing. Mist, translucence, and refracted cold rainbows are filtered through grief-narrowed perception—visual dominates, but the hush and pulsing heat of prism balance senses. Spatial choreography is clean: from foot of arbor to driver’s side window to final upraised prism, no impossible positions. Environment evolves: frost patterns form overnight from yesterday’s tears, proving rule that emotions precipitate—world logic stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is never backdrop: the bamboo forest presses light into “filtered sun,” the orchard’s oldest tree literally yields the puzzle box, the loom’s warp constrains every tactical move. The amber bead itself becomes micro-setting—its century of sunlight is spent—so setting charges the final image as required for 9-band entry. Only the daughter’s village remains off-stage, but that omission is purposeful, keeping the lens tight to the spinner’s pocket of time.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating rock arches and crystallized trees are sketched with economy yet return charged: arches that “had forgotten how to dream” reconfigure under the final vibration, embodying the re-price. The mine-shaft grid is handled tactilely—iron stakes, hammer taps, silk tension—so environment and tool jointly enable the climax. Azure palette threads sky, crystal note, and petal, giving the final image synesthetic coherence. Micro-setting rule met: the resonance crystal in Kael’s lap literally channels the planet’s heartbeat into the closure beat.

Spatial choreography stays coherent—feet find moss, lungs feel pressure—so the environment actively shapes tactics. The bay’s pristine version in the pocket universe recharges earlier decay imagery, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lantern room as micro-setting constrains every move: spiral stairs force single-file solitude, glass panels become the archive of keeper-ghosts, the extinguished lamp creates the literal dark that lets graffiti speak. Sea-glass finally crowns the cairn, turning environment into votive. Sensory detail is selective—brass warmth, breath on glass—filtered through Vera’s habit of quiet attention.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald tower, copper rain-bowls, and starlight trapped in glass are rendered with tactile specificity; the lighthouse itself constrains every move—spiral stairs dictate pace, lens angle dictates safety. Micro-setting qualifies: the glass wick is handled in multiple beats, its internal galaxy visible at closure. Weather evolves causally—wind hammers while Mara adjusts mirrors—mirroring her internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean; ships’ synchronized turn is seen through glass, distance plausible. One minor stretch: “centuries of maritime memories embedded in glass” is poetic but not grounded in tactile evidence; it doesn’t break credibility but keeps the top band just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating rock on chains, dawn mist, and sun-trail geometry are sketched with economy yet return to constrain her daily ritual; tea-house interior is tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Storm-wracked moonlight, growth-ringed stone, and the broken sextant’s mirrored arc function as micro-setting that directly enables the climax: moon-angles must hit the oak keystone. Spatial choreography is immaculate—seventeen corridors, spiral staircase, east turret, central chamber—bodies and objects never float. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kael’s maintenance gaze: sound of pin, weight of kit, silver pooling in glass. Environment constraints choice (only eastern turret angle works) and charges final image. No filler; every detail either limits motion or supplies the healing light.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse’s skeletal trees, floating glass shards, and mica sheets are not backdrop: the dawn-threads must wrap the trees to re-ignite them, and the window is the literal aperture through which meaning passes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices light, texture, resonance, because she is light and glass. Spatial choreography stays coherent as fragments orbit, exit, and return. The setting constrains the final tactic and charges the last image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fluorescent hum, impossible shelves within a dryer drum, and the creased card’s evolving texture create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Eleanor’s movement and final acceptance. Warm amber vs. cold laundromat lighting mirrors her shift from isolation to dual citizenship. Spatial choreography stays clean across the spiral descent and group entrance. One could wish for a single sensory detail from the library books themselves to push past 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Overgrown palace is filtered through Mira’s gardener-eye—she notes moss height, vine caliper, seed viability—so setting actively constrains tactics. Micro-setting objects (blue cloth, ceramic cups) are handled repeatedly and return in the charged final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as she crosses from bramble wall to low table to east-wing prospect. Sensory balance favors touch and scent—caraway crust, chrysanthemum steam—avoiding visual catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Frozen library, quartz chamber, amber clouds function as both spectacle and constraint—the slide must be re-coded before gravity wins. Micro-setting (Resonance Chamber) directly shapes her method and limits time; the lantern slide handled in tactile beats charges the ending image. Sensory selection stays POV-driven (archivist notices shelving hum, ink freezing). Spatial choreography clean; no anchor drift; world-rules (levitation via frequency) internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pirate-market micro-setting—barnacle-crusted ladder, throne of lobster traps—constrains choreography and social hierarchy; Kern’s literal elevation on traps mirrors his moral fall. Oil-lamp amber pockets against salt-thick darkness supply visual hierarchy that guides Della’s stealthy approach. Watch fob functions as micro-setting/object hybrid, its tarnished silver catching fragments of lamplight to signal heritage and ticking morality. Final climb “toward the dying stars” repurposes the vertical pier architecture as moral ascent after letting Kern flee.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lavender bluff, pollen-voting forests, and aurora are rendered in swift, selective strokes that mirror Kaia’s synesthetic bias. The tin ring functions as micro-setting: its warmth and tremor constrain her attention and guide her to the bluff’s edge. Weather-carriers’ personal atmospheres provide tactile spatial choreography—mist column, heat shimmer, head-high drizzle—each affecting her tongue and stance. Final image of ring dissolving into fog re-weights the setting itself as the new compass.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Crystal cave fractures headlamp into “spectral shards” that mirror her emotional refraction; this micro-setting directly charges the final ascent.

Space is coherent: panel behind rock, distance tracked as she spins, climb back up literalized.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse city is sketched with sensory economy—filtered amber, rust-colored weight, recycled-air hum—yet these details double as pressure gauges: the thicker the sky feels, the more deception is normalized. The Archive itself is rendered as tactile workspace: thousands of zinc plates, blank stylus, the hush of preserved intent; the body-as-setting (Mira’s gold-veined leaves) constrains every social interaction. Spatial choreography stays coherent through tunnels and conservatories, no floating rooms. Micro-setting bonus: the body/tool (leaves/plate) charges the final image when Mira’s leaves catch light “like stained glass,” re-infusing the toxic world with luminous candor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bluff above the clouds is evoked through wind-catchers, swaying bronze, and droplets that refract dawn into rainbows—details that actively constrain how Mara can place the ice and how sound travels. The kinetic sculpture itself functions as micro-setting; its counterweights and motion arcs determine where each bell can swing, directly shaping the melting-drop symphony. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a tuner notices bronze alloy, wind direction, and overtone beats, never tourist filler. One minor nit: “endless sea of white” is the only cliché; luckily it is early and quickly particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dome’s refracted amber, the roses’ “strangely organic” cells that breathe while the android suffocates, and the spiral of combustible stalks all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Environment is not backdrop; it is tool and antagonist— oils decide burn pattern, ventilation decides smoke path. Spatial choreography is pristine: rows seven & eight, charging shelf, spiral’s heart, apex ventilation tracked without drift. Micro-setting (the android’s own chassis overheating to spark) functions as setting-extension that enables the escape.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Courtyard is sketched via sensory triage—bougainvillea color, fountain burble, tai-chi scrape—each filtered through Maya’s listening lens. Spatial choreography holds; no white-room. Brass key and locket micro-setting constrain choice. Factory-building details stay generic, and mailbox interior is skipped; environment never forcibly narrows final tactics, capping below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kelp-draped cathedral, bioluminescent algae, corroded spiral staircase—every anchor is sensory, specific, and filtered through Mira’s coder-musician eye. The sunken lab constrains sound, movement, and breath, directly shaping how she must choreograph escape; the final image of seawater rushing past rusted walls re-weights the setting from tomb to portal. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly. Even without exterior geography, the micro-setting of staircase, bench, and dice suffices for 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt-crystal chamber functions as micro-setting: its brine pools enable the pockets to stabilize, directly determining Maren’s success. Sensory selection is disciplined—one whiff of “gleaming silence,” the tack of salt on skin—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from dock, to lab lift, to net-handling of floating distortions. The environment never decorates; it supplies the literal medium that lets deleted memories precipitate into crystals, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Brook, paper dust, and forest breath are filtered through summoner’s ritual attention; micro-setting (stone, satchel, ink smear) constrains the mapping act. Night-cycle progression is tracked without spatial drift. However, environment never endangers or materially limits her; it’s a backdrop, not a crucible, capping 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is filtered through an architect’s eye—cornices as “declarations,” papers like “miniature skylines”—so every book pile and limestone arch guides the narrator’s desire and later choice. The rooftop garden under meteors functions as micro-setting that literally showers the decisive beat with cosmic dust, reweighting the stakes from academic curiosity to existential commitment. Spatial choreography is clean: door, cluttered apartment, rooftop ascent track without drift. The bronze seal recurs as handled object, its shifting wings charging the final image; this satisfies the 9+ gate that a tool constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet garden’s phosphorescent mist and indigo petals are sensuously selective, tethered to Mara’s ankle-clinging motion. The crystalline Archive hum is learned through action, not dump. Micro-setting rule met: the seashell-tool literally constrains the final tactic—its resonance rewrites the archive’s function—and the flower color (Anya’s eyes) charges the closing image. Spatial choreography stays clean as Chen steps from shadow; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marble sanctuary, aurora ceiling, and dripping stalactites act as micro-setting that constrains ritual timing and pigment chemistry. Rose thorn and ink bowl function as portable setting-objects whose tactile handling alters tactics. Sensory hierarchy stays visual–tactile, filtered through calligrapher’s trained eye. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. Final thorn-in-marble recharges the whole space.

    The serpentine nexus is evoked through motion (“wound through the passages”) rather than static catalog. Starlight filtering through cracks becomes the final charged image that mirrors Kael’s layered voice. The seashell fragment acts as micro-setting, guiding her ear to wall-fissures and thus altering tactics. One detail short: we never feel stone temperature or air shift, so environment stops just short of forcing a physical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glacier shrine is more than postcard: ice walls “that had never seen the sun” constrain oxygen, candle heat, and bodily endurance; the warped glass’s “amber” glycerin mirrors fossilized data, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—17 candles track 17 dreams, each wick a beacon in a coherent three-dimensional vault. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: diesel-tinged bathwater, frozen eyelashes, the globe’s strange warmth—details a diver-tuned sensorium would seize. Environment directly guides the choice to dive again, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Slick parapet stone, moonlit puddles, and hemp fibers provide tactile anchors; the bamboo whisk doubles as micro-setting that constrains Chen’s gesture and final image. Firefly season is sensed, not catalogued, and weather’s residual wetness lets moonlight “scintillate” while guiding Chen’s pattern-reading. Spatial choreography holds as Chen shifts from net to whisk to puddle—no floating props. Environment is inseparable from her method, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-as-micro-setting is the story’s engine: apples thriving in irradiated soil, dust skirting the fence, the buried diamond beneath the roots—each detail later constrains the choice to preserve or expose. Gate met: the final image of apple trees guarding their secret charges the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stormlit observatory, cobalt glass, lightning taste, and copper-ozone air are selectively re-used to pressure her confinement and charge the final image. Micro-setting succeeds: the portico itself functions as tool/prison that constrains every broadcast and final silence. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves between peaks, camps, transmitter. Weather is not backdrop; storm spikes force her to shelter under the glass while transmitting, integrating setting into beat-by-beat action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    The loft’s sand-scratched walls and gull overhead tracks supply immediate spatial grip; the music box’s sand-clogged gears act as micro-setting that constrains repair tactics. Dawn light is filtered through action—wind-chapped coat, sun-painting jars—never as postcard. The beach’s empty wistfulness mirrors the internal stakes without overt symbolism. Environment directly enables the climax: open-air mixing of jars could only happen here, under dune acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: ice floes’ distance, acoustic conductivity, and sunset color pivot directly constrain tactics—she must stay within arm’s reach to feel stutter, must finish before light fails. The key’s brass warmth against frozen chest, the whistle through Kael’s adapting bones—these micro-setting details charge the final harmonic image. Proper-noun economy perfect: no gratuitous Arctic jargon, only “crypt keeper,” “Faroe cliffs” as necessary anchors. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across pier descent, ice press, and climb back to lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Basalt columns, frozen lake surface, and moon-track reflections are not backdrop but navigational tools that constrain when and where they can move. The magnetic viaduct’s hum is felt in the body (“familiar pull”) and literally masks their exit. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the lake’s mirror becomes the closing image that reweights captivity into self-possession. Spatial choreography is pristine—no impossible positions across ten-mile night trek.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel’s dripping acoustics and overhead rumble are filtered through Sara’s investigator bias—she notices metal scratches before water stains. Brass lantern, silt-preserved boot prints, and repositioned camera are micro-setting objects that constrain tactics (where she can stand, what she can prove). Spatial choreography is clean: left-hand lantern swing, crouch, panel hinge angle all track. Final daylight re-entry recharges the underground details with exposed-air risk, earning the 9-gate “object charges closure” test.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Shop is rendered through oil scent, suspended dust, and micro-tool detail; the lamp’s circle later mirrors the final focused choice. Objects (ballerina fragment, magnifier) double as emotional barometers. Spatial tracking clean; no white-room. Environment does not literally constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Brass hissing under acid, pulleys that connect nothing, cogwheels spinning without purpose—each detail is filtered through Fennec’s engineer-eye and mirrors the theme of purposeless desire. The kaleidoscope tube itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains every action; without it, no transliteration, no prophecy. Sensory economy favors touch and metallic sound over visual postcard excess. Final image of acid waves slapping the hull re-weights the workshop as a bell-jar for human hunger—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Archive is sketched through sensory micro-details—“abandoned playlists,” “server cluster that officially didn’t exist”—that double as plot vectors. The cubicle patch serves as embodied micro-setting and final talisman. Spatial clarity is maintained; no environmental detail is wasted.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Salt-wind apple trees, tarnished mirror-creatures, and groaning ice are vivid, selective, and filtered through Kael’s shadow-biased perception. Micro-setting objects—fragment, mirrors—constrain tactics: she can’t “see” without the shard, can’t reveal without mounting the mirrors. Spatial choreography is clean: circular room, west window, boys visible outside. The lighthouse orchard is more than postcard: its impossible fruit thriving in cold becomes the metaphor engine for peace that shouldn’t grow yet does. One minor slip—“vintage store mirrors” is told, not shown through tactile detail—but the mirrors’ later agency compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active constraint: cracking bergs dictate rescue routes, shrinking floes force the pick-up, wind temperature decides parasol use. Body-as-setting works too—gloved hand, salt-spray face—filtering every detail through Vera’s exhausted感官 hierarchy. Spatial choreography is flawless from dock to prow to shelter. The parasol’s cracked tip is the micro-object that charges the final image; without it, the closing beat loses its physical metaphor for fragile persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber paper walls filter lantern light into honeyed suspension, mirroring the stalled decision. Autumn wind rattling the panels externalizes Elena’s internal waver and literally cools the intimacy, forcing them to speak closer. The burned letter fragment is handled twice—first examined, then dropped—its charred edge a micro-setting that charges the final image. Vineyard below acts as off-stage future resource and social battleground, constraining the match.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desert-pavilion-stone network is sensuously particular: silk walls translating wind into “hushed conversations,” stones breathing underfoot, dunes singing low frequencies. Selection obeys Maya’s trained attention—she never catalogues, she reads. The kinetic parapet evolves from backdrop to collaborative partner, constraining her footfalls and ultimately ingesting her, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp: prophet sits, Maya circles, stones rise—no geographical drift.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lavender field, rusted factory, dove-gray case recur and constrain placement and mood; factory ruin literally frames the photo arcs. Sensory triad—purple bloom, rust scrape, lavender scent—mirrors the grief-to-garden arc without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: fence gap, kneeling, overhead photo plan. Setting charges final communal decision; environment = micro-tool.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library at dawn is filtered through scholar-bias: selective attention to shelves, lectern, chandelier corpse. Micro-setting object—the crystal—constrains every tactical move (tuning-fork activation, rainbow cast across “complete”). Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound and refracted light under pressure; no filler. One proper-noun economy slip—“Council of Final Knowledge” named once, never reused—blocks 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fog, corroded steel, and salt-bleached driftwood are filtered through Marcus’s synesthetic quest; every texture is touched or repositioned, never catalogued. The garden’s spatial logic remains coherent across the driftwood path; distances and sightlines track. Final image: chalk on rust under fog—environment, tool, and body converge to charge the closing moment. No credibility strain; sculpture decay and acoustic properties read true.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Above the clouds” lunar observatory and groaning mountain bones are sketched in three crisp strokes yet constrain every action—equipment must be earthquake-proof, staff trapped on a peak. Micro-setting succeeds: the spinning brass hand, jeweler’s loupe, and seismic dampener camera-part are tactile tools that charge the final fix. Weather (churning cloud-ocean) evolves with each tremor, mirroring internal pressure without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible object positions during the rebuild.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mountain hospice above clouds is more postcard than pressure, yet the vinyl shard functions as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography clean; lavender-ozone scent mentioned once but not exploited. Strong auditory filter (Ella, piano) compensates for visual generality. Fits Track A default.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating brass observatory, crystal walls, and Bent Constellation are sketched with economy; micro-setting (the invisible keyhole mapped by magnetic tremble) directly enables the decisive turn. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s scholar priorities: rune sequences, charts, microscopic carving. Weather is absent but irrelevant; spatial choreography is clean—key, floor tile, cases, dawn line. The “more solid” face in glass charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Garden, bones, and tooth function as micro-settings that directly constrain tactics: crystalline flowers map alien stars, bones must be arranged symmetrically for gate function, the tooth anchors the exit. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneeling beside Thomas, hand placements, final step into light—all tracked without drift. Selective sensory economy favors the doctor’s touch and sight, reflecting both clinical habit and wonder. Hedge maze and secret garden are named, but the garden’s interior is the active crucible; its twilight-at-noon rule is obeyed consistently. Environment, tool, and recurring object all charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto’s serpentine anatomy and mist-breath constrain every movement—she polishes where sunlight can strike, places shards only in reachable fissures. Sea-glass itself functions as micro-setting: its fracture planes dictate grip, weight, risk of cut. Tool, body, and environment merge when “the grotto itself seemed to breathe with her,” charging the final image. Sensory economy is POV-filtered: salt-taste of mist, cliff-roar reduced to hush, color admitted only through glass.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Center is anchored by line 4; moss, rusted doors, and thawing icicles are filtered through Mira’s ex-data-subject eye, turning server racks into soil. The amber pendant operates as micro-setting: its insect-in-amber image constrains the final exchange and recharges the “data-fossil” theme. Sensory hierarchy is tight—sound of dripping water, feel of moss under palm—never drifting into catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → bench → pendant hand-off → exit, all tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “feral nexus” is not backdrop; its six-direction current physically impedes the swimmer and later becomes the metaphor for multidirectional grief, directly charging the final image. Mist is used to blur vision but sharpen auditory detail—gasping stranger—so environment dictates perceptual hierarchy. Spatial choreography is flawless: upstream → rocks → notebook on lap. The seashell functions as micro-setting; its spiral constrains the closing gesture, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arbor is not backdrop but instrument: tendrils warm, pulse, glow; dew, moonlight, and birdsong are filtered through Maera’s tinkerer senses. Spatial choreography is clean—her knees, palms, bag, and the vine’s spiral all track. The vine itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act of singing. One missed chance: the “scrap-metal butterflies” are mentioned once but never re-enter to charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crater orchard is rendered through tactile refuse—rusted lids, shattered mason jars—each item later charged by starlight and pulse. Spatial choreography is clean: kneeling center → radial placement → upward constellation. Cold halts time, making the environment an active constraint; the same cold is re-inscribed as cosmic distance in the final image. One slip: “subarctic crater” is dropped once and never used to pressure tactics, keeping it just under the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marble cavern is never postcard: gold veins redirect both light and sound, constraining her nightly lamp angles and thus her discovery path. Micro-setting (the timer’s velvet cloth, frost on leaves) keeps texture tactile. Final image of sealed bronze doors re-uses the ingress prop, now re-weighted as silence-preserver.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bronze grotto, cracked lamp chimney, and calcified burdens are tactile, specific, and return to charge the final image; the grotto’s metallic ribs literally steer her posture and lantern placement. Starlight and snowmelt are economically reused to mark time and refract lamplight. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: metallic taste, oxidized smell, shingled hush layers all serve the fractal motif. Setting constrains the only method—orientation of burner—so environment is integral to beat-by-beat action.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ash blank, angled skylight, and kettle form a micro-setting triad that actively limits posture, light, and time; each prop’s state (rain-beaded, boiling, carved) is tracked across beats and charges the final image; no extraneous breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Kinetic lagoon, floating stones, and mist-threaded voices are filtered through Kera’s scavenger bias; silver water mocking stillness mirrors her paralysis. The camera wheel’s plastic teeth supply micro-setting that advances film-frame-by-frame metaphor. Spatial choreography is clean: 20-foot ghost distance, pocketing wheel, approached hand. Environment narrows choice—only above-cloud detritus offers raw material for reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Spaceport carcass is tactile—trampled grass, ghost calliope, broken skylights that “let in precisely the right amount of rain.” The northwest water-stain map and dead batteries constrain her retrofit choices; the sextant’s brass arc charges the final atrium image. Minor imprecision: “ghost-blueprints” is metaphorical surplus that doesn’t guide choice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Crystal forecourt operates as micro-setting that constrains the choice—its echoing hush and rain-wet facets literally absorb and return her first note, making the act of playing irreversible; petrichor and moist stone are filtered through her sensory hierarchy, not tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Canal water, diesel shimmer, crumbling charts—each detail is filtered through Marcus’s disillusionment. The broken sundial acts as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: it is literally impotent for “telling time,” forcing him to adopt documentation over divination. Spatial choreography is clean: deck → pilot house → hold → dock, no impossible moves. Tone of “serene upheaval” is sustained by amber reflection against industrial ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Golden dock, whitening snow, lapping harbor function as micro-setting that constrains attention and filters sound to “oceanic hush.” Fulgurite and tarred rope act as handled objects that charge the final image. Sensory economy is tight: visual whites, haptic knots, acoustic hush repeat and evolve without checklist syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bronze leaves, camphor, crimson silk—selective tri-sense detail mirrors internal decay/transformation. The thread functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Garden’s autumn shadows externalize lonesome splendor without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: satchel, bench, leaf spiral tracked throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The suspended palace–stalactite complex is not backdrop but active constraint: swaying groans dictate quiet work, crystal wall offers the outside darkness as mirror, copper incubators must be stolen from medical bays. Sensorial hierarchy matches crisis—smell of moth-eaten velvet, metallic bone glint, clockwork clicks fading under the first “music.” Micro-setting (laboratory, incubation chamber) directly shapes tactics: every temperature dial, nutrient line, and lamp angle alters survival odds. Final image—song refracted through crystal—makes environment participate in the thematic repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting: its mirror-surface literally reflects Maya’s face and metaphorically reflects her need to “mirror” mercy back into the world. Black volcanic grains under fingernails, the scent of dune grass, the chill of mirror-still water—all are filtered through firefighter sensory hierarchy (texture first, then temperature, then sound). Spatial choreography is flawless: we track knees, stone, pouch, necklace in a tight half-circle without floating props. The lagoon’s darkness constrains the final image: it is the literal pocket from which Marcus takes his transformative sand.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fountains evolve from dry stone to singing infrastructure, constraining the final release; the stained-glass box’s “outside normal time” property directly shapes Mara’s tactile struggle. Constellation map functions as micro-setting that dictates shard placement. Sensory selection skews visual, but compressed word-count justifies narrow bandwidth. Spatial choreography clean across single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Nebula garden as micro-setting: phosphorescent blooms larger than planets constrain seed-harvest choices and provide the only toolkit (light without fire). The brass gear’s worn teeth function as a second “setting” that literally clicks limits on what is possible. Sensory hierarchy skewed to luminous visuals and distant bells, mirroring the keeper’s attenuated time-sense. Final image of drifting petals uses the setting to reweight the stake: beauty that perpetually fails.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse glass, rust, and monarch wings are filtered through Elena’s mason-eye for texture and fracture; the cracked panes mirror her cracked certainty without overt symbolic nudging. Spatial choreography stays clean as ribbon, bench, and tools move from prop to prop under Thomas’s shimmer. The final image—Elena exiting into “gathering dark” while clutching the mapped ribbon—lets setting bite back, implying the cemetery will now physically enact the connectivity she has internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ridge’s glassy spine, the tide’s yearly gnaw, and the brass pendulum bob function as one micro-setting that constrains every move: climb too late and salt water shorts the gears, wind too early and the pause never comes. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a winder’s occupational eye—she notes chain-link counts, iron-rail cold, and bioluminescent glow because they affect timing. Weather is not backdrop but deadline: the lowest tide exposes the ridge and the ritual window. Final image recharges the same obsidian glints as the opener, now refracted through inscribed brass, proving setting evolution rather than static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment and object constrain choice: the silo’s curved ceiling funnels starlight onto the workbench, forcing Mira to read by it; floorboards respond under finger pressure, cueing the hidden box. The cobalt metallic surface drinking starlight becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image when Mira carries the letters out into that same starlight—an irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Obsidian spire and frozen lake constrain invention options—thermal tapestry future literally grows from the spire’s volcanic DNA. Kingfisher quill recurs as micro-setting/tool whose flexibility mirrors the need for adaptive precision. Selective sensory focus (frigid breath, ink mixed with spire dust) keeps detail purposeful. Final image—sun touching obsidian peak—recharges opening “blackened tooth” with latent warmth, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ember alcove, mist, and chimney pocket act as micro-setting: warmth allows nightly work, mist cloaks the illegal dial, dust becomes mnemonic medium. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s copyist attention: coal scent, scratch of pen, amber dial. Spatial choreography clean—radio beneath floor, desk above, boots outside. Final image—glowing dust—recharges setting as memory substrate, passing 9+ gate by a hair; earlier detail could have constrained a mid-scene choice more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Gallery is evoked through tactile art verbs—charcoal dust, porcelain shards, exhaust vents—rather than visual catalog. Rocking chair serves as micro-setting: its decrescendo tracks mortal pressure and dictates Mira’s speed. “Soot-stained palms” body-tool link constrains her touch-based craft. No weather clichés; spatial choreography clean as she moves from easel to chair to back-room kiln. Setting could charge final image more if ash-flow were spatially tied to chair, but still earns high specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is specificity engine: brass teeth catch green-filtered light, coral on subway tiles, hospital records in silt. Chronometer cog acts as micro-setting that charges final image. Spatial choreography clean through submerged arches to highest pipe. Environment constrains every tactic—diving, hiding, archiving—so 9+ quick test met.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    The velvet library’s filtered amber, oak table, and frost-laced windows are selectively sketched and return to charge the final choral moment; the zither itself functions as micro-setting, its carved petals guiding the “subtracting” exercise, so environment subtly constrains method and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rusted greenhouse is tactile—glass shards, corroded frames, warm shears—mirrors the internal state and literally supports the stakes (“access to soil memories”). Three-moon light functions as both ticking clock and atmospheric filter. Micro-setting (shears, seed, soil) constrains every beat; no 9-band only because the moon alignment itself is described generically rather than through sensory specificity that could charge the final image further.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lightning tower as micro-setting constrains every beat: copper warmth, spiral stairs, amber shadows that cue time of day. The lacquer box’s bee-flower motif reweights from mystery to toolkit at closure. Sensory economy favors tactile heat, honey light, silk nest—never catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: gate-counter exchange, vertical climb, rooftop capacitor bay all track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Hammered-silver bay, breathing windows, and paint-ghost rectangle on the sill all constrain choice or charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maya’s perfume-trained nose and latent lighting transition. Micro-setting (the sill ghost) directly enables the climactic recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Garden’s drowned marble, coral-threaded limbs, and leaning colonnades are tactile and specific; every visual sharpens the stakes of preserved beauty versus salt-water decay. Spatial choreography stays clean as Marina guides the woman to the garden’s heart; distances and stone gestures track without drift. The ampoule’s bioluminescent purple and the silver fish school act as micro-setting extensions that constrain the final reveal. Environment literally shapes the ending: only underwater silence allows telepathy and guardianship to crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The staircase as a recursive function is evoked through tactile repetition: cold stone, temperature deltas, harmonic echoes—never a catalog. The chipped die is a micro-setting that constrains every probability calculation; its imperfection is felt in palm and equation alike.

Final image of “endlessly above and below” recharges every prior sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse is sketched with spare, sensory economy: smog-filtered moonlight turns “amber,” tomatoes wither, distance to landlord is implied. The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting—its Tangut carving constrains her next stroke and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto is lived-in, not catalogued: damp glass pressing recipes, fungi-light fingering manuscript ink, thunder vibrating in ribs. The waterfall’s roar is both lullaby and alarm, guiding what can be heard or risked. Opera-glass lens and bread ovens are micro-settings that constrain choices—lens demands alignment maintenance, ovens force communal timing. Final image of rising dough in perpetual twilight recharges every prior detail with edible continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse workshop, wet rocks, and hunger stone constrain movement and supply tools (bronze axle, beacon wire). Micro-setting of the yoyo’s bronze axle serves as the pivotal arena. Final image of the stone blazing beneath rising tide is recharged by earlier description. Environment shapes tactics and charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Opera-clasp-as-micro-setting constrains every beat: its green glow supplies the only light for the mirror confrontations and pulses brighter at the climax, directly charging the final image. Funhouse geometry is kept tactically specific: warped glass multiples, Vera leans closer, reflections shift to smoke. Weather and broader carnival remain off-stage, appropriate economy for 750-word count. Spatial choreography is clean—advisor steps between two mirrors, Vera pins clasp to collar without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating orchard is not backdrop but instrument: driftwood, ropes, and root-systems constrain every tactical strike. Micro-setting (xylophone mallet, apple skin tasted) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—Kael moves counterclockwise, waves lift the structure, no impossible positions. Weather and tide evolve causally with her sonic intervention, reweighting stakes in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Brass Sea glare, reptile musk, and phosphorescent shell-gas are tactile and selective; the turtle undersides as living parchment is a brilliant micro-setting that directly shapes discovery. Spatial choreography stays clean across the descent. The horizon watchers function as both geography and antagonist, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ivy-strangled Victorian station, broken glass, pigeons, rose petal—selective, sensory, filtered through Helena’s archival eye. Micro-setting (loose brick, gilt page edge) directly enables the inciting discovery. Spatial choreography holds: we track her boots, hands, scarf, car mirror. The station’s decay mirrors the theme of buried truth, but the environment never actively constrains tactics or charges the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The flooded pavilion is not backdrop but prosthetic extension of grief—each crack he fingers is also a lost anniversary. Water depth dictates where he can kneel to insert the note; the brass inkwell’s warmth against seawater-chilled fingers constrains the final gesture. Spatial choreography is flawless: drawbridge, knee-deep terrace, central column track without drift. Micro-setting (inkwell) charges the final image; without its retained heat the cost would be abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Reinforced-glass city, circular archive, bronze stamp, and head-lamp beam all constrain tactics and physically charge the ending: the camera and stamp must be smuggled past glass walls. Sensory economy favours sound (creak, pressure-groan) appropriate to outage urgency; visual detail is filtered through Marcus’s indexer habit of labelling. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stacks → ajar door → cabinet tiers; no impossible prop jumps. Micro-setting (stamp in palm) becomes the emotional nexus, satisfying 9+ quick test. Minor cap: environment does not further evolve after lights return; hence holds just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Floating island tea garden, glass basilica, and steam-kettle micro-climate are not postcard backdrop—they constrain action: the basilica’s optical “descends while ascending” mirrors Mira’s paradox and charges the final image when its refracted light ignites the cranes. Tool-as-setting (gem-polishing pavilion) offers tangible workspace that shapes dream-recording mechanics; proximity of chamomile and silver-needle plants keeps scent in sensory rotation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as visitors traverse tiers and cranes sway on threads.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    The floating observatory is sketched with tactile specificity (cooling breakers, humming gyros) and matters instrumentally—altitude drops as power diverts, linking setting to stakes. Micro-setting rule met: the geode’s lattice functions as the story’s terrain. Desert below is atmospheric but static; no spatial choreography issues. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis-narrowed perception. Slight over-reliance on visual; other senses invoked only once each.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory dome, drone telemetry, and dusk light are filtered through Mara’s technician eye; each constrains altitude and scanner placement. Chip-as-micro-setting returns in 3-D projection, directly enabling the final uplink. Textural specificity (“LED arrays casting sharp shadows across weathered astronomical instruments”) embeds ancient/modern tension without catalogue drift.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Cobalt terrace at dusk” and driftwood watch hand function as micro-setting: the wind and carved hand pressure the final admission. Color and salt-crust detail are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the closing image, charging the closure. Spatial choreography stays clean across the three-night search.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Storm-worn parapet is not backdrop; the slick stone forces Mara to brace her body against the wall, the moonlit mist dictates the clandestine rhythm. Micro-setting rule met: the brass drawer pull functions as portable “home” wreckage, constraining the choice to confess partial histories.
