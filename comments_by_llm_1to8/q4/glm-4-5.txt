  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why someone wants her dead—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The "realization" about mineral smuggling is delivered as exposition rather than through a reversal that narrows options. No on-page tightening or deepening alters tactics; the frost investigation is summarized without pressure. Agency is absent; Lena observes and concludes rather than choosing under constraint. No visible cost accompanies her resolve to "face whatever challenges lay ahead."

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. Elena's single action (striking the tuning fork, observing patterns, mapping them) proceeds without friction, obstacle, or trade-off. No escalation occurs; the resolution is declared ("she had succeeded") rather than earned by protagonist agency or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the lens's purpose—is signaled early but never narrowed by a reversal or deepening that forecloses an option. Elias follows coordinates, rents a submarine, and assembles the lens without resistance, tactical cost, or a moment where success is uncertain. The manifestation of souls and his transformation into keeper happen to him rather than through his agency, and no live cost (time, stamina, social credit) alters tactics along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—sustaining the exile community through sanctions—is signaled early and coherent. Mira's news about additional sanctions tightens the situation, but Elias's response (expanding the runs) does not foreclose a live alternative or exact an on-page price; we see intent, not the cost of that intent. The escalation is more declarative than causal, and no visible trade-off (resources, safety, relationships) is dramatized. One modest deepening occurs, but the closure choice feels like affirmation rather than a turn that narrows options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is declared early but never encounters resistance or a choice that narrows options. Elara adjusts her breath, the pearl warms, faces appear, and the answer arrives without escalation or trade-off. The "weeks later" coda recounts her new role as healer but does not dramatize a tightening or cost; the young woman's breakthrough is summarized in a single line. No on-page moment forecloses a live option or charges the final image with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is declared in paragraph ten but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. The halo fragment's first touch causes retrocognitive visions, but Elara experiences them passively; no reversal or tightening choice appears on the page. The second encounter repeats the pattern without escalation: she "placed the fragment at the center" and "activated it through hyperbolic geometry principles" (summary-only agency), then merges without visible cost or a crystallized stance. Coincidence (the fragment's reappearance) resolves rather than complicates. No price is legible at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—retrieve seeds before demolition—is signaled early but pressure remains static: Elara studies keys, presses them, the vault opens, workers arrive, she leaves. No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost; the "early" crew is a convenience trigger, not a consequence of her prior choices. The arrow solves her chains without prior causal setup, and the final summary skips all friction between escape and village-to-village success, erasing the cost of her "patiently strategic" labor.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure remains static through most of the piece: Kael works, listens, attempts. The single tightening occurs when he believes he's succeeded ("Last night, he believed he had captured it"), but this is told in past perfect rather than dramatized. The final shift (betrayal sound becomes healing sound) arrives as passive observation without a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the resolution is handed to him by the device's inadvertent recording.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her "fingers could capture light's secrets"—is signaled early but remains abstract. The heist itself proceeds without meaningful resistance or complication; the stationmaster accepts the flowers and turns away, enabling Lillian's theft in "three breathless seconds" with no visible cost or trade-off. The workshop revelation that she's "a historian" rather than a thief does not narrow prior options or demonstrate what she has renounced; the escalation from theft to insight lacks on-page pressure or a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.9)
    No dominant stake is dramatized on the page. "Crafting safe zones for inquiry" is told as motivation but never tested—no inquiry is shown, no safety is threatened, no choice between competing goods arises. The glass work proceeds without obstacle, failure, or trade-off. Ice melts in parallel as pure metaphor without affecting action. The piece offers thematic drift (abandonment, thawing, transformation) in place of escalation; no decision narrows options or pays a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—evade The Production and reach her mother—is declared but never tested on the page. No escalation occurs; Maya completes the decryption off-stage, then simply stands. The approaching footsteps arrive as convenient threat rather than earned complication. Her "vulnerability" tactic is told, not demonstrated through a trade-off or visible price. Pressure is static summary rather than tightening choices.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—to draw a map through endless night—is signaled early but never tested by competing options or escalating cost. The oracle's task unfolds as a series of contemplative beats without reversal or tightening; she understands, works, and completes without friction. No live option is foreclosed, and the final smile suggests resolution without visible price. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required but not delivered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the origin of thoughts—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful tightening or trade-off. Unit 347 is told it "should have logged the object as hazardous debris" yet faces no consequence for choosing curiosity; protocol is overridden without cost. The violin's data-stream revelation (timeline 47, timeline 112) offers potential futures but no on-page decision between them. The final "surrender" is declared rather than earned through escalating pressure, and no visible price shapes tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will use the lens to reveal hidden truths—is signaled early but never faces an on-page test that narrows her options under pressure. Discovery of the lens and the hidden chamber unfolds without complication; no secondary character, resource constraint, or time pressure forces a trade-off. The final choice to leave the lens behind is a renunciation, but it arrives without prior agency that foreclosed a live option or imposed visible cost. One meaningful deepening (the map leading to the chamber) is present, yet escalation reads as accumulative description rather than protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.1)
    The stated stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is never tested on the page. The cereus already bloomed as predicted before the story opens, so no anticipation or uncertainty drives action. Scientists arriving "tomorrow" means no present confrontation or choice under pressure. Elias walks the maze, reflects, and returns home without facing opposition, cost, or a moment where his belief is challenged. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the narrative is a static portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (prove sideways time), but no on-page reversal, complication, or tightening tests it. The lever sequence proceeds without opposition, error, or visible price. Aris succeeds without struggle or trade-off; the bird's reaction is passive observation rather than a constraint. No agency-driven escalation or cost legibility appears; the resolution feels declarative rather than earned under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the ghost's unfinished performance to resolve her liminal suspension—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Elias's agency is present (he chooses to return nightly, lift the program, play the composition), but pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through reversals or tightening choices. No moment forces a trade-off or narrows options; the path from discovery to playing to resolution unfolds without friction or cost-bearing hesitation. The ending reconfigures the space from suspended to peaceful, but the transformation lacks a visible price that would elevate the stakes into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what was swallowed during fever—is declared midway but never tested by a reversal or on-page cost that narrows options. Elias's preparations (systematic margin work, gear packing) proceed without friction or trade-off. The auroral sorrow and meteoric fragment are told as revelation rather than earned through protagonist agency; the final image describes what will happen rather than showing a decision that forecloses a path. No escalation under the Accumulative lens; the second half loops exposition without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("to find the weight of a swallowed truth") is signaled but never tightens into a legible trade-off or forecloses an option with on-page cost. Marcus passively receives the radio confession and visions; no reversal narrows his choices. The ending grants him understanding and relief ("felt lighter") without dramatizing what he gave up or risked, undercutting escalation entirely. Coincidence (the radio broadcast) solves the mystery rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—to chronicle the anomaly without succumbing—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through spatial descent and sensory immersion, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the keeper proceeds methodically without setback or trade-off. The "tempting stasis" is declared but never dramatized as a live threat requiring a visible sacrifice. Cost at closure is conceptual (the secret etched onto soul and stones) but lacks a felt price that alters later tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking Lila's silence—is clear from the outset. The eclipse provides one meaningful tightening: the celestial event compresses time and creates urgency. However, escalation is driven more by the external coincidence (the eclipse happening today) than by Maya's agency forcing harder trade-offs. The drumming moment narrows options (Lila must respond now), but the resolution lacks visible cost: neither character pays a price or forecloses a path; the breakthrough simply occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—collecting stories before they fade—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the historian moves smoothly from silo to tapestry to diaries to recording without friction. The "connection" between tapestry and axis "emerges" passively, with no agency or tradeoff. Escalation consists of repeated assertions ("bronze quiet deepened," "motivation burned brighter") rather than causal pressure. No cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.9)
    The dominant stake—transposing humanity's perception—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off; the writer types fortunes unopposed and smiles at dawn with zero friction. Letters of gratitude confirm his success without dramatizing any cost, failure, or constraint. Coincidence does not resolve because no problem appears; the piece is a mission statement, not a pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing Sarah before possession completes—is signaled early but never tested by a tightening choice. Michael faces no dilemma, trade-off, or live option foreclosed; the entity simply "falters" when he poses a paradox. No reversal or deepening narrows his options. The "rhetorical trap" is told, not shown with friction, and the resolution (entity dissolves, Sarah gasps) arrives without visible price. Escalation is asserted ("the entity reacted," "Sarah writhed") but pressure remains static; no tactic fails or forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—to conduct unheard symphonies by mapping memories before exhaustion—is declared but never tested by opposition or tradeoff. No reversal or tightening occurs; he simply proceeds through memory recall until fatigue wins by default. Exhaustion is announced rather than dramatized through narrowing options or visible cost, and the "crescendo" moment asserts success without showing what was risked or foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    A dominant stake ("understand why he could defy gravity") is signaled early, meeting baseline requirement. The eclipse creates a ticking clock ("tonight was special"), but Elias experiences no reversal or tightening that narrows options—he places the tablet, closes his eyes, and observes alternate timelines without opposition or cost. The resolution ("accepting all parts of himself") is declared rather than earned by a protagonist decision; coincidence (eclipse timing, tablet mechanics) enables the journey without agency. No visible price is paid, no path foreclosed, and the final "knowledge" arrives off-stage as summary.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early but never faces an on-page test or trade-off. Eleanor experiments, discovers vibrations, and teaches; no reversal or complication narrows her options. The drum maker's initial skepticism evaporates without friction. Escalation is replaced by a montage of successful experiments across "each day" and "one evening," with no visible price or tactic shift. One meaningful tightening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (exposing the conspiracy) is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversal or complication. Elias faces no meaningful obstacle: the message tube arrives conveniently, contains exactly the proof he needs, and he releases it without dramatized risk or visible friction. The claim that "someone knew he was close" and "he'd been followed" sets up external pressure, but no antagonist appears, no chase materializes, and the watchers conveniently retreat off-page. Agency is summary-only—we're told he "made a choice" but never witness the competing options or the cost of committing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the texture of time itself"—is declared but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or a competing want. The poet arranges rope without any reversal, tightening, or trade-off; the pattern "completes" without resistance. No agency choice (decision, renunciation, endurance) forecloses a path with on-page cost. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Kael's purpose as an echo-harbor violinist in a world of chronic hush—is signaled early but never escalates through on-page opposition or a tightening choice. No scene dramatizes a failed attempt, a competing pressure from family survival needs, or a moment where Kael's acoustically perceptive trait costs him something tangible. The climactic performance is framed as discovery ("realized the chronic hush was not an absence of sound") but arrives as assertion rather than a turn; nothing in the prior beats suggests Kael doubted this or struggled to "unbind the sounds that had been waiting all along." The family's tears and the father's hand on his shoulder signal validation, but we see no visible price paid—no stamina drain, no social friction resolved, no prior misunderstanding corrected—so the resolution reads as convenient affirmation rather than earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.7)
    No dominant stake faces an on-page test. Elias performs a routine task with professional confidence; the client experiences no resistance, confusion, or complication beyond a brief "confusion to recognition" that is told, not dramatized. The declared stakes—helping clients find emotional fulfillment—are abstract and never pressed by reversal, tightening, or cost. The final "peaceful contentment" is delivered without sacrifice, trade-off, or visible price, reducing the narrative to a demonstration rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early but remains largely motivational rather than conflict-driven. Elias's offer to help Eleanor's archive faces no on-page resistance, complication, or cost; "within months" the project succeeds via summary. The "next week" café scene gestures toward a turn but delivers exposition rather than a choice that narrows options. The final paragraph's "years later" recursion asserts cycle continuation without dramatizing a second decision under new pressure, flattening escalation into theme claim.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Elara's dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and drives the shared search proposal. The quest provides one meaningful tightening (group formation overcoming hesitancy) and a deepening (sigil discovery reweights community from external goal to inherent bond). Agency is present in the proposal and final dedication act. Yet the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path at closure; the group's success feels frictionless after the initial hesitancy, and the final reconfiguration offers warmth without a legible on-page price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restore cadence before the giant awakens—is signaled early, but escalation is episodic rather than causal: each obstacle (rooftop distance, door lock, cage) is introduced and solved in the same beat without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The time pressure from the giant's nap should tighten choices, yet the illustrator never sacrifices accuracy, safety, or an alternate path; he simply "quickened his pace." The final act (shattering the cage) is framed as desperate but no prior failed attempt or visible cost (a tool broken, a friendship betrayed, a memory lost) makes the success feel earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mentor's disappearance via the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early, but pressure remains static across the ritual. No reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade one option for another; the stone rearranges on its own, the vision appears passively, and she simply continues her work afterward. The "possibility of discovery" is declared rather than tested. No visible cost or foreclosed path lands on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten knowledge—is signaled early but never tightens into a live dilemma with competing costs. The tape fragment arrives late (past midpoint) and the protagonist's plan to "lead the right person to discover it" defers agency off the page. No on-page reversal narrows options; the "sapphire hush of dawn" arrival functions as a timer that expires without forcing a trade-off. Escalation remains conceptual rather than dramatized through choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (scientific control versus natural adaptation) signals early and tightens once when Elara removes shields, a live gambit with observable consequence (destruction/growth). However, the cost of that choice is told in summary ("some areas...others") rather than showing Elara confronting a specific lost experiment or plant, diluting immediacy. Escalation under the accumulative lens is minimal—storm cycles repeat the same observation loop without compounding pressure or narrowing options until the final third. Agency exists (she opens vents) but feels schematic, a thesis maneuver rather than a desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (Lena's need to "thresh meaning from experience") signals early and tightens at the exchange: she must surrender the talisman to gain creative material. The woman's offer forces a trade-off with visible hesitation ("fingers tightening"). Cost is legible (the brooch's ghost-warmth persists), and the ending shift from insomnia to purpose shows deepening. One escalation step is sufficient at this length, but the visitor epilogue diffuses rather than sharpens final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding and responding to the pearl's activation of shadow forces. Pressure accumulates as shadows detach and inhabit the crystals, creating a tightening that forces Elara to touch the shadow-infused crystal and accept her role. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency—events happen to Elara, and her primary action is touching a crystal and realizing the transformation was "already in motion." No live option is visibly foreclosed; she moves from observation to acceptance without a trade-off or renunciation that costs her something on the page. The "steadily unpredictable" attribute is claimed but not leveraged to create tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (compiling fragments to heal the community) is signaled early. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—each vision adds a layer—but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The herald revelation is summarized backstory; the returnees' transformation is told in a single sentence. Pressure remains static across beats; no meaningful tightening or choice that forecloses a path. Under the accumulative lens, a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost is needed but absent.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling mysteries / finding the fortress—is declared but never tested by an on-page dilemma or reversal. Ethan follows the cracks without obstacle; no choice forces a trade-off between his analytical nature and the metaphysical realm. The narrative asserts escalation ("the further he ventured, the clearer his motivation became") but no narrowing of options or loss occurs. Agency is passive: he is "summoned," "challenged," "chosen"—the environment acts upon him rather than his decisions driving turns. The resolution is a summary of future intent, not an earned shift with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the tile's significance—is declared but never tested by an on-page obstacle or cost. Elara's decisions (to transcribe, to invite others) arrive as summary without opposition, reversals, or trade-offs that narrow options. The tile's "responses" happen offstage, and the transformation to sanctuary is recounted in the final third without dramatized friction or a visible price paid. Coincidence (the tile's revelations) enables rather than complicates; protagonist agency is absent from the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early but remains abstract. The amulet revelation (it belonged to Elara) should narrow options; instead it only adds information. Alistair's step through the portal is a decision, but no live trade-off or visible price is dramatized: the escondite collapses behind him without cost, and the essence-message arrives as summary. One tightening moment (amulet hums, revealing mutiny) exists, but escalation lacks agency-driven pressure or felt consequence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (saving Dr. Thorne's life vs. Maya's security) is signaled early and remains clear. However, escalation is largely procedural: Maya executes her plan without meaningful resistance or complication. The security guard's predictable routine and the safe opening "as predicted" drain tension. No on-page reversal tests Maya's commitment—she succeeds on the first attempt, and the cost ("lose her job and possibly face charges") is projected rather than felt in the moment. The mathematics framing never becomes a lived calculus with competing goods forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to collect the textures of different times"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs: the dawn hum arrives on schedule, Elias records three notations as practiced, and the process completes without friction. Agency is observation and routine execution, not decision under pressure. The piece describes a static ritual rather than escalating conflict, and no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming identity through collected narratives—is signaled early but never tightened or tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or trade-off narrows options; the protagonist wanders, collects, and reflects without encountering resistance or cost. The ending reaffirms the journey without dramatizing a choice that forecloses an alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; none appears.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is declared but never escalates through on-page reversals or tightening choices. Evelyn encounters no obstacles; the cello simply yields memories, the compass simply points. The astronomers' unresolved debate is recounted, not lived, and Evelyn's synthesis costs her nothing visible. No agency-driven turn narrows options or raises price; coincidence (finding the exact artifacts she needs) enables the solve.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving Neptunia's culture against privatization) is signaled early, but escalation occurs primarily through summary montage ("For three nights, Maya barely slept") rather than on-page reversals. The "favorable terms" arrival feels like external rescue rather than protagonist-driven outcome, undercutting agency. The final image (spiral inside circle, earpiece removal) gestures toward earned resolution but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—photographing the last lunar fireflies before extinction—is signaled early but never escalates or tightens. Elena faces no opposition, complication, or cost; the fireflies appear on schedule, she photographs them, and the mission succeeds exactly as intended. The timing device and chemical reaction add procedural texture but impose no pressure or trade-off. No reversal, deepening, or agency-driven choice narrows options or charges the outcome. The story is a completion rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing the drone before the ship departs—is signaled early, but no obstacle or complication arises to test Elias's commitment or narrow his options. The repair proceeds smoothly from diagnosis to completion; "requires steadier hands than I had yesterday" hints at difficulty but never materializes as friction. The time pressure (ship departure) is mentioned but never tightens tactics on the page. No visible price is paid; the phone message confirms success without cost, leaving escalation and agency both minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—is clear and sustained. The coordinates confirmation and the physical discovery constitute meaningful moves, but escalation is muted: Elmsley "already suspected" the answer, so the journey validates rather than tests. No live option is foreclosed; the discovery adds knowledge without visible cost. The final report-gathering feels procedural rather than a choice that narrows future paths.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the town's harmonic balance before collapse—is signaled early and persists. However, escalation is minimal: Silas encounters discord, then methodically corrects it without reversals, complications, or visible constraints that narrow options. The "threat of collapse" remains abstract and never materializes as on-page pressure. No persistent loss (time, stamina, tool wear) alters tactics. The accumulative design delivers steady progress but lacks a tightening moment where agency forecloses a path or forces a trade-off with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.6)
    The oxygen countdown provides a ticking clock, and Elena's choice to press forward instead of retreat offers one meaningful tightening. However, the reversal lacks agency cost: the door opens, the mechanism works, the rescue arrives, and she escapes with the prize intact. "By overriding instinct" is asserted in narration but not dramatized as a live trade-off—no moment shows her weighing survival training against the temple's pull. The ending deflates stakes entirely: she's already planning her return, erasing the "crushing finality" that just sealed the door.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—separating himself from his father's legacy—is declared but never tested by on-page choices with visible cost. No meaningful escalation: the son practices truth in a mirror, writes on walls, and presses his face to wood, but these actions do not narrow options or face opposition. "Before they find the bodies" hints at urgency but remains unexplained and inert. Coincidence does not complicate because no complication occurs; the ending summarizes redemption without dramatizing the price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake ("repay a debt across lifetimes") is declared in backstory but never tested on the page. The bride performs a single uncomplicated action (releasing seeds) with no trade-off, opposition, or visible cost; the bead crumbles as automatic consequence, not choice. No escalation, reversal, or tightening occurs; the piece moves from setup to resolved in a single gesture. Coincidence (celestial alignment) triggers the resolution rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring the labyrinth—is declared but never tightened by a reversal or competing pressure. Elara's sleepwalking removes conscious choice, so escalation cannot arise from protagonist agency. Villagers worry briefly but immediately become pilgrims, collapsing potential friction. The ending summarizes perpetual success ("would endure, growing more beautiful") with no on-page cost, trade-off, or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen's need to restore lost faith—is signaled early and sustained. The excavation provides a through-line of purposeful action, and the sundial's gradual assembly offers a structural spine. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening forces a costly tradeoff; each piece fits intuitively without friction or failure. The resolution (sundial complete, faith restored) arrives without visible sacrifice or a decision that forecloses an alternative path, reducing pressure to gentle accumulation rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—crafting the scientist's pseudonym before the noon deadline—is signaled early but never tested on the page. We see preparation (chalk codes, reflection on method) but no moment where the task becomes difficult, forcing a trade-off or tightening options. The "particularly challenging" scientist's name is resolved off-page; Elara's walk and reflection face no opposition. The deadline passes without visible cost or tactic alteration. Agency is limited to completing a routine task without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (stopping the coup through hidden embroidery) is clear early. One tightening occurs when the galaxy alignment reveals the conspiracy's timeline, narrowing Elara's window. However, the escalation lacks protagonist agency at the closure—she completes the chart overnight in a summarized work session, then the ending tells us the coup unravels offstage. No on-page reversal or trade-off that forecloses a visible option with cost. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but the final act does not reweight options through dramatized action; it recounts success.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the unspoken apology—is signaled early but never narrows options or forces trade-offs. Each condensation message adds information without complication; Elara's path is smooth and unopposed. The final forgiveness occurs without visible cost or a prior choice that forecloses another path. Pressure remains static; no reversal or tightening alters her tactics or stance.

    Dominant stake: helping Lina process her father's absence through decryption and ritual. The pressure is situational and internal to Kaelen's mission, but because Lina is asleep, there is no live on-page conflict or tightening choice. The piece accumulates weight through reflection and the coral's handling, yet no reversal or trade-off forecloses an option—Kaelen completes his task without visible cost or complication. The whispered line "He will come back" reweights meaning, but it is a gift rather than a struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the smudged notes and the translator's realization), but escalation remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rediscover lost joy—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Amelia's light-therapy method works immediately, the council grants permission despite doubts (no dramatized negotiation), and visitors arrive in increasing numbers without obstacle. No on-page price is paid: she does not sacrifice time, resources, relationships, or alternate paths. The escalation is declarative ("increasing numbers") rather than pressure-driven, and coincidence (finding the fragment, council approval) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elena's transformation from methodical restorer to intuitive artist—is signaled early but unfolds as a sequence of revelations rather than escalating pressure. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows options; each awakening adds information without cost or trade-off. The nickel's discovery and return frame the arc, yet coincidence (finding the nickel) drives setup and resolution lacks protagonist agency at closure. Under Accumulative lens, the piece needed one decisive intensification with felt price; instead it offers enumerated insights without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—evading the Thought Tax—is asserted but never tightens on the page; no reversal or narrowing occurs. Kaelen's activities (examining plants, shaking the seed, arranging plots) are repeated without escalation or cost. The "final phase" is announced in summary, and the "nationwide resistance" reaching "critical mass last evening" bypasses protagonist agency entirely. Coincidence and off-page events resolve pressure; no on-page choice forecloses a path or incurs visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.1)
    No dominant stake is tested on the page. The poet's goal (to compose lullabies that transform pain into beauty) succeeds without opposition, complication, or cost; blossoms appear and flourish across centuries without resistance. No reversal or tightening occurs—visitors marvel, blossoms persist, the poet dies peacefully. Agency is absent: the transformation is passive (blossoms emerge "in answer"), and no choice forecloses a path or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the sound of forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. The discovery of the cracked tube introduces a problem, but restoration proceeds without meaningful escalation or reversal; each step (remove, prepare tools, select cylinder, focus light) advances smoothly. The ending deepens understanding (names Eleth had never heard) yet the protagonist's agency is methodical execution rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes felt cost. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does genuine pressure force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—prevent permanent division before treaties are signed—is signaled early and remains live. Yet pressure never tightens through reversal or meaningful obstacle; Elena works uninterrupted and succeeds in her search without setback. The deadline is declared but never dramatized as a constraint that forces trade-offs or narrows options. No on-page cost or choice alters tactics; the ending defers agency to the off-page presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonize conflicting values—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversals or forced trade-offs. Elara's "discovery" of the inscription and adhesive analysis are conveniences that solve the problem without her agency or cost; the solution arrives via research rather than a choice that forecloses an option. No meaningful escalation under any lens; the breathing building and trembling hands are static texture rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring her courier service and reclaiming her identity—is signaled early but develops through reflection rather than on-page pressure. No meaningful obstacle or tightening occurs; the meteorite discovery leads smoothly to letter-writing to bird release. The "bleak winters" that claimed her pigeons are summarized backstory, not a present threat. Agency exists in the final act (releasing the bird), but the lack of a live cost or complication before closure keeps this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—why some thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that forecloses an option. Elara encounters doorways but none force a trade-off or narrow her path; the oak door simply opens when touched. No on-page reversal or tightening: the logbook rearranges itself into "Home" without her agency. The father's presence is coincidental, undercutting earned escalation. One small positive: the concept of "necessary distances" recurs, hinting at a structural intention.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Maya encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and the creatures respond to her presence without friction. The feather's transformation and the creatures' constellation display resolve the quest without a single choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Escalation is absent; the journey is a passive unfolding rather than a tightening under pressure. The final map is a reward, not an earned consequence of prior agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal narrows options; the migrating bird delivers answers without requiring protagonist sacrifice or difficult choice. The "urgent" timeframe ("Before memory fades") creates no visible pressure on tactics. Resolution is convenient discovery, not earned agency; coincidence solves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Leo's mission to create orchestrated serendipity—is declared but never pressured. He faces no opposition, miscalculation, or cost; the woman's reaction validates his plan exactly as designed. The string quartet arrives on cue, the opera matches her taste, the anniversary timing is perfect, and she accepts the gift. No reversal, tightening, or trade-off occurs; the intervention succeeds without friction. Agency is preparatory (planning, positioning) rather than reactive, and the ending offers repetition, not transformation or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—transcending Council-imposed boundaries through fledging—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening choice. Lira's transformation proceeds via external gifts (moonstone, anchoring) rather than protagonist agency that narrows options. The "unexpected but not unwelcome" anchoring eliminates tension instead of creating a trade-off. No visible price is paid; she "stood transformed" with "her dance complete," but no on-page cost forecloses a path or alters tactics. Under the inferred lens, pressure dissipates rather than coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—Mara seeking meaning in patterns—is signaled but never tested. No external pressure, reversal, or complication arises; the "inexplicable force" delivers insight without friction. The stone-in-pond moment is presented as revelation rather than escalation, and no visible price is paid. Agency is absent: Mara observes, receives understanding, and returns unchanged in circumstance, only restated in resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—translating private pain into something universally resonant—is signaled early and clear. Pressure remains static: the firefighter walks, pauses, reflects, and finds peace without any reversal, complication, or choice that narrows options. No live cost or trade-off appears; the box's meaning is simply reframed through sustained meditation. The ending declares resolution ("peace," "wisdom") without an on-page act of renunciation or a tactic shift that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elian's hope to "revitalize" possibility across timelines—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No meaningful escalation occurs: he arranges decorations, the gauge spins, and success is declared without obstacle, reversal, or visible cost. Coincidence (the gauge "suddenly" spins, trial balloons "somehow" succeed) provides resolution rather than protagonist agency under pressure. No tightening that narrows options or deepening that changes knowledge is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding architectural memory—is signaled early and pursued across beats. Discovery of the diaries and negative constitutes a reversal that deepens knowledge. Yet escalation is informational rather than pressure-driven; Elara encounters no obstacle, trade-off, or cost. The lab development yields insight smoothly with no failed attempt or forfeited path. The final commitment is declared without on-page demonstration of what she must surrender or endure. Agency is observational; her choices (kneel, extract, develop) advance plot but lack visible consequence that narrows later options.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: persuade mirrors to show possibilities. The ritual unfolds without complication or reversal; rain and prism simply amplify her success. The vision of alternate lives arrives as spectacle, not a choice-point that narrows options. No visible price paid; the "borrowed heartbeat" separation is abstract. Agency is execution of a rehearsed ritual rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (ending the forever war through this treaty negotiation) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the day's progression: initial trembling, navigating the first breach, mapping resources, and observing cracks in the alliance. One meaningful tightening occurs at midday ("first breach in generations"). However, escalation is described rather than dramatized—key turns ("harder work began after lunch," "mapping of shared resources") are summarized without showing Elian's agency forcing trade-offs. The cost is asserted in reflective summary ("lifetime of solitude and compromise") rather than shown as a specific forfeiture that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope/honoring extinction—is signaled early but remains abstract. Silas's walk and placement of the egg unfold without meaningful opposition or tightening; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The rain's arrival is coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the "manufactured drought had broken" through "quirk of weather patterns" explicitly removes Silas's causal role from the resolution. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks a pressure point where cost narrows tactics or forces a trade-off under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the prism sanctuary—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: Elara kneels, performs the ritual, and succeeds without complication, reversal, or visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the "seven generations failed" setup promises difficulty, but on the page she faces no resistance. Agency is passive (studying, waiting, being chosen) rather than a decision that narrows paths. The threads "sing as they loosened" without cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—exploring ethical storytelling—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-offs. The performance is summarized in one sentence ("presented stories...with dignity and complexity"), eliding the beat that should carry pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the audience's skepticism melts without dramatized cause. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch and the lost migration patterns—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens through the ritual of knotting (each knot = a generation lost) and the attachment of the moth wing to signal memory. However, escalation is largely textural rather than driven by protagonist agency under duress; Aris executes their plan without a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. The monarch's acknowledgment ("dipped its wings") and Aris's heartbeat shift offer a cadence change but the cost remains conceptual rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The rope-work provides a concrete task that tightens once (comparing card holes to braids, then reconfiguring), meeting the minimal escalation for this length. However, there is no on-page reversal or visible trade-off; the sanctum rewards her immediately without complication. The cost ("years of guilt" forgiven, deciding to stay) is told retrospectively rather than dramatized as a live choice that forecloses another option, weakening the pressure profile under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging past-sight and future-sight to experience present—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle complicates the ritual; the storm simply "intensifies" in parallel to her success. The protagonist's agency is passive reception rather than decision under pressure. The resolution is handed to her through the dream state without visible cost, trade-off, or path foreclosed. The understanding arrives as epiphany-by-assertion ("realized," "began to transcend") rather than through a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unsealing the tile's secret to commune with cosmic forces—is signaled early but never tightens through protagonist agency. Nebuchadnezzar's approach is mentioned but applies no pressure to Anu's actions; the equinox timing is declared but not dramatized as a ticking clock. The tile's transformation occurs passively (it lifts, unfolds, projects) without Anu making a high-stakes choice or paying a visible price. No meaningful escalation or deepening under any lens; the resolution is granted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—releasing resentment toward the brother—is signaled early. Escalation under the Causal lens requires Marcus's agency to narrow options, but the key reversal (his broken music box repairing itself) is an external manifestation triggered by Elara's guided vision, not a choice Marcus makes under pressure. The brother's arrival resolves the conflict without Marcus having to risk or forfeit anything on the page. No visible price is paid; the "dark aura" dissolving is asserted transformation, not a dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—repairing the sextant to capture/free the dream—is signaled early but never tightens options or forces a trade-off. The synchronized breathing and boundary-erasing proceed without obstacle or reversal; the sextant "clicks into place" as if assembly were inevitability rather than agency. The final whisper ("I will not capture you") reframes capture as freedom, but no prior beat establishes capture as a live option with visible cost, so the renunciation feels decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with the daughter—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective; no on-page confrontation or reversal tightens options. The bridge artifact and seed exchange function as symbolic gestures rather than choices that foreclose live paths with visible cost. The daughter's off-page response mutes agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge via the pistachio shell cameo—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, cost, or trade-off. Elias encounters no obstacle, makes no sacrifice, and faces no consequence on the page. The resonance monitors registering patterns and knowledge flowing into his mind are told outcomes, not dramatized pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the arc is a straight line from curiosity to cosmic enlightenment without friction or price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (rescuing the mentor's colleague) is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page tightening where a live option is foreclosed or a trade-off made visible. The renegotiation with the guardians succeeds without cost or adaptation; the extraction occurs off-page in summary. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive escalation: Elara's "carefully resourceful" trait is label-only and the diary solves problems it did not help create. A single pressure point (the guardians' consideration) offers a micro-turn but no meaningful narrowing of options or deepening that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost pieces of identity by finding the "garden of forgotten names"—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates texturally as Elara absorbs more narrative threads, and the moment she presses her palm to the tree deepens the sensory flood. Yet no reversal or tightening forecloses an option: she faces no resistance, no cost that alters later tactics. The resolution ("giving voice to those no one remembered") is a reframed purpose, not a choice that sacrifices a live alternative. No visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the disappearances—is clear and consistent. Pressure accumulates through the celestial alignment and the door's appearance, but escalation is smooth rather than conflicted. Eleanor faces no meaningful obstacle or trade-off; reconfiguring the braids proceeds without error, loss, or visible cost. The resolution delivers information (meeting Croft) but no foreclosed path or tactical sacrifice that would charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (preserve ripple marks before they're lost forever) is signaled early and drives the arc. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mapkeeper discovers the intact sequence in the Ice Sanctum, narrowing options. However, escalation lacks friction; the bloom of hush works immediately, the energy beings cooperate without resistance, and no visible price is paid for the solution. The resolution feels gifted rather than fought for. Agency exists in the conjuring act, but the outcome never feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—prove that coincidences have meaning by rekindling the beacon—is signaled early and sustained. Elara's nightly recording and the meteor-triggered revelation deepen her understanding, narrowing her focus to the North Star alignment. However, the escalation lacks agency-driven reversals: the meteor insight arrives as external gift rather than hard-won discovery, and the prism's rekindling occurs without visible resistance or cost. No path is foreclosed, no resource spent, no doubt overcome on the page; the resolution feels frictionless, undercutting the pressure required to enter higher bands under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory so society knows "what we can become"—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elthion moves from observatory to forecourt to writing without opposition, reversal, or a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The act of listening and writing unfolds as intended from the start; no deepening changes his options or tactics, and no visible price is paid. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification is sufficient, but the final image restates his purpose rather than reweighting it through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page opposition or internal conflict tests Elias's commitment; the fortress gates stand ajar "as if expecting his arrival," the mosaic provides instructions, and the performance succeeds without complication. The rag ignites "immediately," colors "burst forth" as planned, and the flowers respond on cue. One tightening move (climbing the tower as dusk surrenders) shifts location but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. Coincidence facilitates rather than complicates: the note appears precisely where he kneels, and the acoustic properties amplify his craft as rumored.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya's research will continue given funding scarcity—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page pressure. The difficult conversation pauses, Maya reflects, and resumes with "observations about how adaptation in tidal pools...could inform sustainable research models," but this shift is told rather than dramatized with visible trade-offs or resistance from Aris. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the tension is resolved through internal realization without agency cost. Escalation under an Accumulative lens would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the beat plateaus into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—collecting the gilded hush—is signaled early and drives the ascent. The gravity-inversion hour provides a ticking constraint. However, escalation is largely atmospheric: Elara samples progressively "complex and nourishing" silences, but no on-page reversal narrows her options or raises cost. She reaches the trellis, collects the silence, and descends without complication. Agency is present (she chooses to ascend) but the resolution unfolds without visible trade-off or contested turn.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—catalyzing a healing sound environment—is signaled early. Yet no reversal, tightening, or complication appears; Elias executes his plan without friction, passengers respond instantly, and the ending recycles the setup. Agency requires a choice that forecloses a path with cost; here Elias's actions meet no resistance, leaving escalation flat. The storm clouds on the horizon are noted but do not materialize into a test. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or density shift; neither occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reach the throne before sunrise—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; each step (waterfall, murals, tree, elevator) yields immediately. The prophecy and ruby flake function as passkeys rather than sources of friction. The ending declares restoration and renewed hope but Elara's agency is limited to "preparing" the throne; the true heir remains off-page, leaving no visible cost or trade-off for her own renunciation of power.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether to abandon isolation and fulfill her duty. The doorknocker's insistent call provides pressure, and the decision to knock three times and step through is protagonist-driven with visible cost (leaving her sanctuary). One meaningful tightening occurs when the ring's warmth forces her choice. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens through density increase (scars, duty, suffocation) rather than causal narrowing, and the cost is legible in "leaving behind the ashen comfort of isolation that had promised peace but delivered only loneliness."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (finding the bolt to transform pressure into diamonds) is signaled early but never tested. No opposition appears; Maya navigates slippery walkways and digs in damp soil without friction or cost. The climax is a passive miracle: she places the bolt and watches diamonds form with no decision, sacrifice, or narrowed options. The declared "dangerous instability" and "safety inspectors" are setup without payoff; no credible constraint tightens her path.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the dynasty's illegitimacy—is declared but never tested. No reversal or complication appears; the protagonist turns the crank, the waves form, the compartment opens, success arrives without friction. Agency is absent: the plan works exactly as intended with no adaptation, cost, or moment where the protagonist must choose between competing goods. The parchment's discovery is a convenience, not an earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing "the shape of possibility"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The "unsnap" moment provides a tightening (boundaries dissolve, realities overlap), yet it does not narrow Galen's options or impose a visible trade-off; he experiences the mystical event passively and returns unchanged in agency. No live choice forces a renunciation or alters tactics; the greenhouse simply "solidified back" without cost. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation requires a deepening that reweights the stake with felt consequence; here the spectacle substitutes for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake: Eleanor seeks connection through archival work; secondary: Benjamin seeks his lost button and past. No on-page reversal or tightening—Eleanor's file review proceeds without obstacles, and Benjamin's arrival months later resolves the mystery without friction. The ending grants symmetric satisfaction (both found what they were looking for) with no trade-off or foreclosed path. Agency is observational until Benjamin's arrival, which is coincidental timing rather than protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake (save the archives) is clear early. The tightening from "usual approach" blocked to puddle-map discovery to archive infiltration shows structure, but escalation is undercut by convenient solutions: the map appears unbidden, Theodor supplies missing knowledge, and the key works despite protocol changes. No visible cost is paid—alarms sound but the escape succeeds off-page, and "the truth would reappear when least expected" is asserted rather than earned through on-page sacrifice or tactical trade-off. Agency at closure belongs more to the key and Theodor than to Mara's internal choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early but never pressured by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Ethan simply plays and succeeds. "The prophecy thrumming against his music" is told rather than shown through escalating resistance or sacrifice. The resolution arrives without visible price or foreclosed path, undercutting escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled (decode the message), but pressure does not escalate or tighten options. The moonstone confirms importance rather than complicating her task; Elara completes her work "with newfound clarity" and "impossible speed" without friction. No on-page reversal, trade-off, or cost that narrows tactics; the ending restates her cycle without consequence. Under Accumulative lens, density should force a cadence shift or pattern break with felt price—none occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to understand/fix broken clocks versus accepting imperfection—is signaled early and sustained. The compass discovery and greenhouse journey provide a tightening that narrows his worldview, and the underground clocks deepen his understanding. However, the escalation is contemplative rather than agonistic; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost on the page. The improvised vine-ladder shows agency, but the climactic realization occurs as observation ("Elias spent hours studying") rather than a pressured choice with immediate consequence. Coincidence (finding the compass, following its guidance) complicates but the resolution arrives through revelation, not protagonist-driven trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—redeeming the lost artifact and Elias's fractured purpose—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when he accepts Lumina's loss and shifts to forging. Yet the escalation lacks agency-driven cost: no live option is foreclosed, no tactical trade-off shown. The forging succeeds without obstacle, and the final wisdom ("names are foundations of being") is asserted rather than tested. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through a pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the deepening is thematic claim without dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing Thomas—is signaled early and pursued linearly. Pressure is more procedural than escalating; Thomas hides, Elias tracks, Thomas confesses without meaningful resistance. The bell solves the problem it did not create, and no trade-off or visible price alters Elias's tactics. One tightening (locating Thomas) is present but lacks felt cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the mathematics of mercy to make sense of survival—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens as Kai progresses from disorientation to memory mapping to physical decoding of the strap. However, escalation is gradual accumulation rather than a turn that narrows options; the climactic "understanding" is intellectual insight rather than a choice with visible cost. The "positioning the strap" moment promises agency but delivers epiphany, leaving the cost conceptual ("not redemption, but framework") rather than dramatized as a trade-off or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or choice that forecloses an option. The climax ("touch the fragment to the painting") is uncontested and costs nothing on the page; no resistance, trade-off, or price appears. The "eternal instant" and "final breath" gestures attempt intensity without causal escalation. Accumulative pressure requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the resolution is declared, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake: discovering what ceilings hide / bridging to spirits. The tightening occurs when the fluorescent buzz dies at 4:17 PM, thinning the barrier and materializing ghosts—one meaningful pressure point. Marcus's agency is active (he plans the visit, retrieves the device, raises it toward the ceiling), but the engagement choice lacks a visible trade-off; acceptance supplants fear without dramatized cost. Coincidence does not resolve—Marcus's research and timing earn the moment—but the final beat tells us the barrier closed rather than showing a foreclosed path or altered tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("compress eternity into a single moment") is declared but never tested. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs: Eldon prepares for seven days without complication, the rupture "occurs" passively ("became unbound"), and he "succeeds" with no visible price paid on the page. The "cost" is asserted in summary ("could no longer contain infinity") but does not foreclose a live option or force a trade-off. Coincidence (the vial's appearance) initiates the plot without protagonist agency driving escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—bridging the archaeological dispute—is signaled early. Pressure is declared ("escalated to violence in the floating libraries," "weeks struggled to devise a way") but not dramatized; we skip from his motivation straight to the night he implements his plan without on-page attempts, failures, or a reversal that narrows options. The writing scene itself flows without meaningful resistance (words "flowing with the rush," manuscript completed by dawn). The final gathering reads as external acceptance rather than a trade-off Elias must make; no visible cost (lost allies, personal risk, foreclosed identity) alters his position. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that changes knowledge or tightens options; here the storm intensifies atmospherically but does not force a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (stop the covenant of rust by midnight) is signaled early and the midnight deadline tightens time. However, escalation is weak: the covenant "recoils" from the stone's light without forcing Elias to adapt, sacrifice, or face a genuine reversal. The eleven-chime beat is a minor pressure point but does not narrow his options or compel a trade-off. The resolution is delivered by the philosopher's stone's power rather than Elias's agency under duress, and no visible cost—stamina, a broken tool, a personal forfeit—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reaching the boundary where explanations fail—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; Elara encounters the lagoon, the compass spins, she collects water, and ascends with new understanding. The "lost expedition" transforms off-page without visible cost to Elara, and her final smile suggests satisfaction rather than a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.4)
    No dominant stake is signaled early; "seeking inspiration" is vague and solved passively when the slide appears. The piece declares transformation—"forever changed"—without an on-page choice that narrows options or costs Elena anything. The sculpture-building is described as flowing easily under the slide's guidance, with no material or conceptual friction. No reversal, tightening, or escalation occurs; the GPS failure has no consequence, and Elena's departure is serene summary.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooming—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Yet pressure remains static: Elara moves from texts to postcards to cathedral without setback or complication. The caretaker's permission is granted immediately; the revelation arrives as dawning understanding rather than a turn forced by opposition or cost. No live option is foreclosed on the page, and the final "new vision" is framed as possibility rather than trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or tightening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"uncover truth in tension"—is declared but never tested by a competing pressure or cost that forces a trade-off. Ellara's retrocognitive trapping resolves itself; the lagoon dialogue succeeds without complication. The grandfather subplot appears and resolves off-page without altering her present options. No on-page reversal or tightening: the diary opens, visions come, messages work, publication follows. The escalation is a montage of elapsed weeks rather than a single beat where agency narrows options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving the ghost town's spirit—is signaled early, but escalation occurs through summarized reflection ("spent the night sketching plans") rather than on-page choices that narrow options or force trade-offs. The "last wish" backstory introduces a reversal (infrastructure without spirit), yet the night of conception is recounted without visible struggle or cost. No on-page action tests Elior's commitment or alters his tactics; the arrival of others in response to notices happens off-page and deflates tension rather than intensifying it. Agency is decision (posting notices) but the price paid is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing emotional patterns before the prophecy comes true—is signaled but never tested by on-page opposition or resource scarcity. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Elias receives the prophecy, wraps the cylinder, and resolves to begin his work without any tactical adjustment, visible trade-off, or live decision that forecloses another path. The prophecy itself is a coincidental revelation (luck complicates but does not resolve) rather than a consequence of his prior choices. Agency is absent; the story moves through and-then sequencing without escalation or cost legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reopening the vortex to understand borrowed time—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the arranging task, each placement described as requiring "intense focus" that deepens her tranquil state. However, no live reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the spiral completes without complication, and the vortex manifests on schedule. The cost (mortality awareness) is told in backstory rather than tested on the page through a trade-off that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving the bell can detect storms before modern systems—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through barometric readings, cloud gathering, and the solstice alignment, but escalation is mostly atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist choices that narrow options. The "switch" at evening (rerouting connections) is the sole on-page decision, and it succeeds without complication or visible tradeoff. The storm's arrival confirms his hypothesis rather than testing his commitment with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elion's spiritual search—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test with visible cost. The "call" arrives as coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation, and his decision to leave the station encounters no resistance, obstacle, or trade-off. The resolution is granted by cosmic revelation rather than earned through agency: no option is foreclosed, no price paid, no tactic altered by prior pressure. Under the inferred Causal lens, escalation collapses because the peak turn bypasses dramatized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"preserve the weight of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested by a live opposition or trade-off. No reversal narrows options: the recluse investigates, sits, and the box opens without cost. The travelers' compliance ("they somehow understood") eliminates friction rather than escalating it. Agency is passive observation, not decision under pressure, and the ending grants success without dramatizing what was risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows Elara's options; her discoveries accumulate without friction. The "suddenly timeless" suspension freezes the world but resolves without trade-off, and her embedding of messages is declared rather than shown altering tactics under constraint. Agency is observational (studying, feeling, realizing) rather than a choice that forecloses a path. The escalation from fragment study to message embedding to "finding her place" is a thematic deepening told in summary, not a pressure tightening driven by protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the lagoon's beauty in verse—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. No on-page tightening narrows her options; the kite-string snap is observed and absorbed without altering her writing or stance. The poet's agency is limited to attentive observation and journaling; no decision forecloses a path, no renunciation carries weight. The piece declares "release" and "liberation" without dramatizing struggle or tradeoff, resulting in static contemplation rather than escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: foster interspecies respect before death. The work proceeds month by month, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is montage-based rather than choice-driven; no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. Arthritis flares, but he continues without altering approach. The final circuit is the culminating act, but it arrives as scheduled completion rather than a decision narrowing live options. Cost is visible (Elias dies), yet the price is temporal (six months pass) rather than a felt sacrifice or renunciation that forecloses a competing path. Agency reads as endurance, which qualifies for Earned Stasis, but the lack of friction or complication keeps pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or complication. Elian encounters no reversal, no live choice that narrows options, and no price paid for his insight. The footprints diverge around a sculpture and he "chose not to follow," but this micro-decision has no consequence. The amber glows and understanding arrives without agency or trade-off. No escalation under any lens; the pilgrimage is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the battlefield garden—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or reversal. The coachman encounters no failure, no cost that narrows his options; the bird's instruction ("The western hollow first") is a helpful pointer, not a complication. "Exhausted but hopeful" summarizes rather than dramatizes a price paid. The decades-later coda tells us the mission succeeded without showing the moment of transformation or the trade-off that made it possible.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching Elara—is clear and signaled early. The tightening occurs when Silas adjusts his course northeast based on decoded coordinates, but this moment feels like a puzzle solution rather than a choice with visible cost. The resolution is convenient: he arrives, she is there, no complication or trade-off appears on the page. One meaningful turn exists (coordinate discovery), but it does not foreclose a path or force a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving cosmic knowledge for future generations—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or meaningful choice narrows options or changes knowledge. The sketch ritual proceeds without obstacle, cost, or alternative path; nothing threatens to prevent her from completing the map. Her motivation "evolved from survival to something greater" in summary, but no on-page beat dramatizes that shift. The piece offers outline-like declaration of stakes ("cartographer of hope," "bridge between what was and what could be") without pressure that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—mending the fractured sky—is declared late (midpoint) and remains abstract; no on-page consequence of failure is shown. Kael's journey is a linear ascent: place knight, reveal stairs, place rook, uncover passage, place bishop, find key, place king, solve puzzle. No reversal narrows his options; the master's arrival could complicate but instead delivers exposition and approval. The final act—placing the sundial lid—succeeds without agency-driven cost or visible tradeoff, and the golden light restores balance off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving ordinary memories during erasure—is signaled early but remains abstract; no immediate consequence pressures Elara to choose between competing goods or abandon a tactic. Her walking pattern proceeds unimpeded, and the pawn's appearance rewards completion without testing her commitment or imposing a visible price. The "ruthlessness" required to "select examples that represent thousands" is told rather than shown through an on-page exclusion or sacrifice. No reversal narrows her options or deepens the cost of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.6)
    Maven's dominant stake—understanding the shape of home—is declared early but never subjected to escalating pressure or competing costs. She finds the stone, discovers her abilities, performs nightly rituals, and achieves revelation without meaningful reversal, sacrifice, or moment where success might slip away. The "weeks of nightly rituals" and growing thunder are summarized rather than dramatized as rising tension with tactical adjustments. No on-page tightening forces her to choose between conflicting goods or accept a visible loss; the resolution is purely additive gain.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces the tutor to sacrifice pride, memory, or safety. The tapestry-decoding is described but never escalates or narrows options. The prince's sudden appearance and outstretched hand resolve the conflict via coincidence rather than protagonist agency, and no visible cost accompanies the reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—refracting singular truth—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; the Overseers shadow her yet never force a trade-off or impose cost. The ending declares success ("she had succeeded") without dramatizing the turn that forecloses a path or the visible price paid. Escalation reads as repetition (she holds sessions across multiple dawns) rather than a meaningful deepening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion after the master's vanishing forty years prior—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or choice. Marcel's ritual of matching scars to memories unfolds without reversal or tightening; each beat adds another correspondence without altering tactics or revealing new cost. The workshop tilt is a physical manifestation of emotion, not a complication that forces adaptation. No genuine escalation occurs; the ending delivers thematic acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live option. The stake remains abstract and the resolution is internal realization without visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks "one perfect image that would outlast his fading memories." The wrong turn and cave discovery provide one meaningful tightening—he finds proof he has already kept his promise, which shifts his understanding of temporary eternity. Agency is attention and renunciation: he accepts nature's role in preservation rather than insisting on solitary artistic control. The cost is modest (relinquishing the fantasy of sole permanence) and the escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven. The resolution is earned by the shell's discovery but the encounter feels coincidental (he "took a wrong turn") rather than forced by prior choices under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts and reaching his lost sister—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias holds the vial and whispers, and the return vibration reweights his conviction. However, the escalation relies on assertion ("felt the vibration return") rather than a protagonist choice that narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. The captain's softening and Elias becoming "keeper of whispers" read as convenience rather than earned consequence; coincidence (the sister's inexplicable connection) complicates but does not resolve through Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (guide ships safely home) is signaled early but remains static. The piece cycles through repeated arrivals without escalation: ship seven, then "the first ship of the night," both blink in response with no differentiation in difficulty or cost. The cryptic phone call ("build the bridge between tides") promises a turn but is not executed on the page. No visible price shapes tactics; the navigator's abilities grow stronger with the moon without trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density increase or pattern break—here it plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—psychological safety from empathic overflow—is signaled early and sustained, but no meaningful tightening occurs. The ritual unfolds without obstacle or cost; the barrage of feelings simply "receded" after naming. Finding the second eye functions as serendipitous reward rather than a reversal that forces a trade-off. No on-page moment narrows options or forecloses a path; Elara ends with more resources and renewed hope, suffering no visible price for her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (decode the gesture) is signaled early and persists, but escalation reads as accumulation of borrowed memories rather than a tightening choice or narrowed option. Elias experiences visions, investigates gaps, and reaches understanding—yet no live alternative is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The café owner and library records provide clues but do not oppose or complicate; the resolution arrives through passive reception rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the doorway of decisions to escape haunted solitude—is signaled early and deepens when Elias must choose among multiple symbolic thresholds. The ants' unusual pattern and the mentor's cryptic promise create one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Yet the peak choice ("picked one doorway—not the easiest but the truest") is asserted without on-page friction; no competing desire or fear dramatizes the cost of crossing, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (rediscovering purpose) is signaled early. The ascent provides physical escalation, but no meaningful reversal narrows options—Elara finds the grotto as foreseen, sees her reflection, gains understanding without friction. Maera's explanation ("every queen must rediscover") feels expository rather than earned through protagonist agency. No visible trade-off or forfeited path; the queen returns unchanged in external action, only internally reassured.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—capturing light versus capturing transformation—is signaled early and reweighted at the end. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than enacted: Elara's "revalue everything" is a summary declaration, not a visible trade-off or narrowed option. No on-page reversal forces a difficult micro-choice; Leo's arrival and the whispered secret happen without friction or cost. The piece lacks a tightening that forecloses a live path, keeping pressure abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping consciousness and making sense of mortality—is signaled early but never narrows options through a forced trade-off. The soaring sequence summarizes "witnessing lifetimes" without on-page reversal or choice. Chronological confusion complicates his chronicling but does not escalate into a visible price that alters tactics. The ending restates his intent to continue, an Earned Stasis, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening ("understood why he chronicled") reweights meaning, yet escalation remains mild.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's need to find meaning after loss, mirrored by Lena's anxiety over the lost object. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lena explains the screw's history, deepening both characters' understanding of connection. However, pressure remains gentle and conversational; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The resolution—Elara feels lighter, Lena leaves reassured—lacks the trade-off or cost that would charge escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—complete the rune before the storm—is signaled early and tightens when the platform tilts and crystallization begins. Elara's agency (whispered grandmother's teachings, held breath) halts the crystallization and allows completion. The escalation is legible, but the resolution feels assured once she invokes the teachings; no live option is foreclosed with felt cost—her success arrives intact.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (deliver the apology and achieve reconciliation) is signaled early and drives the ritual preparation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the electromagnetic field creates the bridge and their fingers merge, but this moment feels mechanically enabled by the equipment rather than forced by Eloise's agency or a hard trade-off. The orchard's impending destruction provides a deadline, yet its pressure remains atmospheric rather than forcing a tactical sacrifice. Beatrice's forgiveness arrives without requiring Eloise to choose between competing goods or pay a visible on-page price beyond vulnerability; the "incomplete composition" asserts cost in the final image but doesn't show what path was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unifying cosmic fragments—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the witness encounters mirrors and shelves without resistance. The universe's hiccup frames urgency in exposition but does not pressure tactics. Resolution occurs through declaration ("spiral arbitration completed") rather than protagonist choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The water-reversal moment introduces no opposition, cost, or tactical constraint; Arlo simply "noticed" and "felt" shifts without forfeiting or risking anything on the page. Counting backwards 1–5 reads as observation rather than escalation. The resolution summarizes decades of teaching rather than showing a single choice that narrows options or pays a price. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal conflict materially tightens the question.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciling her father's gambling with her probability theory—is declared but never tested through on-page conflict. The Fibonacci discovery could escalate tension but instead triggers only reflection. No reversal or tightening narrows Elena's options; she ends intending to do tomorrow what she did yesterday. The "peace" arrival carries no visible price or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled: Elias's isolation and desire to transform endings. The Meredith call provides a single tightening moment, but escalation is minimal—she shares grief, he listens, they part with mutual gratitude. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the resolution ("ready" to await more calls) lacks a forfeited path or a price paid on the page. Coincidence (the impossible call, the disc's unexplained hum) initiates rather than complicates, weakening causal pressure. The final stance shift feels thematic rather than tactical, sidestepping the agency test.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving analog craft and meaning before digitization—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates through layered ritual actions and temporal countdown (final night), consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is more textural than causal; no reversal or tightening narrows his options, and the resolution (packing and walking away) stems from external forces (archive transition) rather than a protagonist choice that forecloses a path. The "regenerated covenant" process demonstrates craft but does not face on-page resistance or complication that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Archie's plan succeeds via summary montage (taxi driver → chef → newsletter → café strangers) without reversal, complication, or visible cost. No on-page moment where the protagonist must choose between competing goods or pay a price that narrows options. Coincidence (the rumor spreads perfectly) resolves the conflict rather than protagonist agency. The final insight ("the cure wasn't the rumor but the sharing") is told, not earned through a dramatized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—navigating emotional depths to find the stillpoint—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Yet the pursuit itself unfolds without meaningful tightening or reversal: Elion follows the trail, reaches the center, and receives wisdom without obstacle or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the "transformation" from grief to acceptance is recounted rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows his path. The cost (tears, internal shift) is asserted but not made visible in action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (correcting the false-signal error), and one tightening occurs when Elara writes the chronopaper suggestion. However, the pen's success is frictionless—no failed attempt, no escalating cost, no surprise that narrows options. Sarah's correction arrives as reported confirmation rather than dramatized complication. The story presents a single causal link (pen use → outcome) without a reversal or deepening that raises price; Elara's final confidence mirrors her opening stance without visible forfeiture of an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. No reversal, deepening, or choice narrows options; each beat is a variant repetition of Elias gesturing without cost or complication. The young woman's sorrow and the gathering crowd present no resistance or trade-off. Coincidence (people drawn by "invisible music") substitutes for agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—redeeming her arsonist past—is declared but never tested on the page with a live choice between competing goods. "Weeks" of following the trail compresses all escalation into summary. The portrait restoration, the story's only concrete action, lacks visible tradeoffs or a moment where Maya must forfeit something to proceed. Agency reads as passive discovery rather than decision under pressure; coincidence (finding the complete tapestry) resolves without protagonist cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Theo—is signaled early and drives the escape sequence. The four-minute window introduces time pressure, but it deflates without consequence when systems return; no tactical cost is paid. The final manifestation of the lagoon is presented as triumph without trade-off: Elena faces no choice between reunion and safety, no renunciation of another path. The piece tightens once (escape to tower), but escalation is assertion-driven ("the universe holding its breath") rather than choice-narrowing. Agency at closure is passive: the garden transforms in response to her drumming, granting rather than testing.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stated stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early but remains abstract. Marlo's plan unfolds without meaningful opposition or risk; Vance arrives on schedule, shouts ineffectually, and Marlo "happens upon" him as planned. No reversal, tightening, or cost: the whispered directions work exactly as calculated, the security post receives them, and Marlo shrugs off Vance's suspicion. The storm subsides by midnight with no consequence, and Marlo adds a map to his collection—success without sacrifice or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars—is abstract and never tested by opposition or scarcity. The visitor's approach suggests potential conflict, but no reversal or tightening occurs; the guardian continues the shutter work uninterrupted, and the visitor simply watches, then leaves. No on-page choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The "stillwater tension" is asserted but not dramatized through escalation or a turn that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or cadence should shift to reweight the stake; here the pattern remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening curiosity—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Arthur conceives his plan in the grotto without visible opposition or cost; the three weeks of preparation are summarized in one sentence. The unveiling succeeds immediately: "people stopped, stared, and began to talk" with no setback, adaptation, or trade-off. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift to reweight the stake, yet the text remains at a constant summary distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Mara seeking freedom/true nature—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (whale call, scrimshaw text, island appearance) without a live tightening that narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The dive at the end reads as decision, but no on-page reversal dramatizes what she risks losing: colleagues, livelihood, or identity are never shown in friction with her desire. Coincidence (the whale's timing, the island's emergence) enables rather than complicates, and the resolution lacks visible cost scaled to her renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—cultivating "lightness in grief" through ritual performance—is signaled early but never truly tested or deepened. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or complication; visitors arrive and receive figures, but this feels summarized rather than dramatized as a pressure point. The story lacks an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options; the ritual proceeds smoothly from morning to evening without friction. While the post-mandate context provides thematic weight, no live cost or trade-off materializes in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (accessing forbidden realms through the colonnade) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—the poet approaches, touches, speaks, and succeeds without complication or reversal. No meaningful escalation occurs; the humming intensifies and the transformation proceeds smoothly to completion. The "ban" and former restrictions are backstory flavor without on-page opposition; the colonnade functions as a cooperative gateway rather than a test requiring sacrifice or choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear (trade the reed tongue to awaken healing for Gideon), and one tightening occurs when Elara places the final stem and the courtyard responds. However, no reversal or live choice under pressure appears—Elara executes a plan uninterrupted. The cost is told ("bartered awakenings") but never tested: we do not see what she sacrificed or refused to achieve the trade. Agency is present but feels pre-scripted rather than forged under friction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—"to discover the texture of connection"—is abstract and never tested by on-page pressure. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the protagonist's quest proceeds without obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off. The miner's song discovery is presented as a revelation but costs nothing and forecloses no option. Coincidence does not complicate; the device simply works, delivering an acoustic memory that requires no agency or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.4)
    No escalation: the piece recounts Elena's past grief and current routine without on-page pressure or a tightening choice. Stakes are declared ("to teach withering to bloom again") but never tested; visitors arrive and leave in summary. No reversal, deepening, or meaningful consequence occurs in narrative present. Agency is absent—Elena's actions are habitual rituals described in iterative past/conditional tense ("would sit," "would fold") rather than singular decisions with visible cost. The retrospective frame forecloses dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to understand collapse—is signaled early but never tested by a live complication. Elias's project proceeds smoothly; the visitor's arrival accelerates understanding without friction or trade-off. No reversal narrows options; the "startling revelation" about preventing crashes is delivered as dialogue rather than earned through on-page discovery or sacrifice. Agency is passive observation and discussion rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("recover what was lost") is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page choice narrows options or exacts visible cost. The "purification" unfolds as summary montage ("touching surfaces without rhyme or reason") without reversal, complication, or agency-driven tightening. Vision sequence is accumulative description, not escalation. Final merger is asserted transformation without dramatized price or trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding shadow anomalies to navigate the new reality—is signaled early but remains abstract. Elara's nightly observations accumulate without a tightening choice or visible trade-off until the shadow reveals itself; that moment is received rather than forced by protagonist agency. The escalation is textural (pattern intensification) rather than causal, and no on-page cost narrows her options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (rebuilding trust after betrayal) is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs—Elara begins the piece determined to heal and ends having… continued that determination in monologue. The betrayal is backstory; no present antagonist or complication forces a trade-off. Agency is absent: she whispers insights to a passive reptile rather than making a choice that forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to heal rather than open wounds—is declared but never tested with a live choice that narrows options. Elara's realization ("integration, not excavation") arrives as epiphany rather than escalation: no prior beat forces her to choose between exposure and honoring stories with visible cost. The plants' plea and coffee-ring map offer complications, but coincidence (the wall shimmers exactly where spirals intersect) resolves access to the tunnel without agency. One tightening (hourglass warming, sand flowing) occurs, but it follows rather than drives her stance shift, and the cost (what path she foreclosed) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is signaled early but never tested: Elena seeks, discovers (lines 13–14), and prepares to share without obstacle, reversal, or cost. No tightening occurs; she possesses the ability from the opening and exercises it without friction. The promise to "give you voice again" (line 29) is a declaration, not a choice that forecloses a path or trades one value for another. Under any lens, escalation is absent and the ending resolves a quest the text never dramatized as difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (unlock trapped creativity) is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening: Elara arrives at the archway, performs the ritual, and the blockage dissolves without complication or cost. The "cacophony" of unspoken words is declared oppressive but never forces a tactical choice; tracing star paths "connects the chaotic whispers into flowing, harmonious language" through ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under pressure. Accumulative design requires one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights cost; here the resolution is handed to her by the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks to prevent collapse—is signaled early and persists. The mission to reach the archive and place the clock provides a single tightening, but no on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The Archivist's arrival and the clock's tick offer a micro-turn, yet the guard's agency at closure is continuation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a dramatized trade-off or visible price that would charge the final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the wild frontier of his mind—is signaled early but never tested. Kaelen encounters no opposition, internal friction, or trade-off; each beat confirms his desire without complication. The gear warms and glows, the forest responds, and he gains mastery of translocations in a smooth escalator of affirmations. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice with visible cost, and coincidence (the gear's arrival, the perfectly placed notch) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused courage waits"—is abstract and declared rather than dramatized through a concrete goal under pressure. No visible obstacle resists them; the journey is atmospheric glide without friction. The star stamp heating provides mild directional pressure, but no reversal or complication narrows their options. The climax is discovery (sleeping dragons) followed by passive receipt; agency is observation, not decision. Cost is absent—they gain dragons and return to resume their positions with no visible trade-off or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and then choosing between safety and silence—is signaled early and tightens when the bellhop discovers the etchings and realizes his accident was orchestrated. One meaningful reversal: his passive healing job transforms into active rebellion. Agency is clear in the final choice to sing, foreclosing the path of silent sanctuary. The cost is visible in risking the fortress's protection and awakening the bound musicians. However, escalation is somewhat front-loaded by exposition; the middle passage explaining the ritual tells rather than showing pressure build through attempts or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender to reclaim the throne—is signaled early but never tested through a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows Elara's options. The library's collapse adds atmospheric urgency but does not force a trade-off or constrain her tactical choices. The climactic ritual to "sunder the illusion" is recounted in summary ("When the last symbol was complete, time itself seemed to shatter") rather than dramatized with visible cost or escalating pressure. The revelation that the pretender is her own fear arrives without prior on-page conflict between her desire for the throne and her fear of ruling, making the resolution feel coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—"why some paths disappear"—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options. Marina's work is observational; she cross-references, taps, assembles clues, but no reversal or complication forces her to trade one value for another. The "delayed revelation" functions as theme rather than pressure; the realization arrives through summary in paragraph five without visible cost. Escalation is absent under the Accumulative lens: density does not increase, no pattern breaks, and the final act of logging data carries no felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or internal conflict. No reversal, complication, or tightening occurs; the protagonist walks unopposed to the stones, which respond positively without resistance. Agency is absent: the stones "recognize" her and light arrives without her making a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The rebellion lull removes external pressure entirely, leaving no friction to drive escalation. Cost is asserted in the final line ("ready to reignite...a revolution") but not dramatized or paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake ("evolve tradition") is declared but never tested on the page. No council member challenges Maya, no choice forces a trade-off between heritage and progress, and the embryo unlocks without complication. The kite discovery is coincidental; the decoding happens off-page; the chamber opens on command. One micro-deepening occurs when she cross-references texts, but it imposes no cost and alters no tactic. Agency is passive receipt of plant guidance rather than decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—processing trauma while maintaining daily function—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Maya moves from private ritual (unfolding/folding the photograph) to public teaching to final release, each narrowing her relationship to the past. However, the escalation is more thematic than tactical; no on-page reversal forces her to choose between competing goods or pay an immediate price beyond the symbolic. The children's presence adds texture but doesn't create genuine opposition. The seventh anniversary provides temporal pressure, but Maya's decision feels inevitable rather than earned through compressed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—regaining artistic confidence—is signaled early. The thread-sorting provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Eleanor's approach from "perfecting a single moment" to embracing fragments. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The resolution (completing the portrait) feels smooth rather than forced by contradictory pressures. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking temporal distortion—is signaled early. The piece presents one meaningful tightening: the tracker moves from theory to self-experiment. However, agency is minimal; the protagonist's decision to step into the ink faces no on-page obstacle, competing desire, or visible tradeoff. The eclipse's coincidental alignment supplies the resolution (the ink "flared" only when the eclipse's shadow passed), which reads as external trigger rather than protagonist-driven escalation. The insight at the end ("We change our relationship to it") is declared but not tested by a renewed dilemma or cost that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will release the letter—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. A power fluctuation hands her the letter; she discovers its contents; she uploads it without obstacle or reversal. No on-page tightening narrows her options: the dormant networks are conveniently accessible, transmission succeeds in seconds, and no Federation monitoring interrupts. The cost ("cryonic suspension or worse") is declared but deferred off-page, failing the on-page cost test. The piece moves in a straight line from discovery to decision without a turn that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.9)
    The stated stake—weaving continuity through chaos—is declared but never tested on the page. No opposition arises, no tightening occurs, and no choice forecloses a path. The piece describes Rhiannon's method and visitors' reactions without dramatizing conflict. The final act (wrapping a cutting) is routine work, not a decision under pressure. Agency is absent; the narrative summarizes her philosophy rather than forcing her to defend or adapt it.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and pursued without meaningful reversal. The fisher's zigzag weaving and "voicing silence" unfold as planned; no live option is foreclosed, and no cost materializes on the page. The piece offers no moment where the fisher must choose between competing goods or adapt tactics under unexpected pressure. Escalation reads as textural accumulation (constellations stir, garden settles), not a tightening that narrows options or raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—clearing Davies and exposing the real culprit—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens on the page. Eleanor encounters no reversals, dead ends, or costs; she simply works "hours" and arrives at the answer. The resolution is declared ("Eleanor finally had it") rather than earned through a dramatized choice that forecloses options, leaving escalation absent and agency invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—silencing phantom cries to resolve guilt—is signaled early. One tightening occurs: Elias recalibrates the firmware to "amplify the amber's resonance rather than translate cries," narrowing his approach. The payoff (hearing the lullaby) is on the page, but escalation is thin—no reversal, no visible sacrifice or trade-off during the attempt. The firmware's spontaneous shift from cries to lullaby bypasses agency; Elias's modification is mentioned but its causal link to the outcome is asserted, not dramatized. Cost at closure is conceptual ("stillness rather than emptiness") without a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess"—is declared but never tested on the page with a visible trade-off. The zealots "loudly announced they would restore order," yet Silas's sand adjustment deflates their anger instantly without escalation or cost: "their anger dissolving into wonder" is a soft reset. The final third devolves into collective mandala-building with no protagonist agency, and the story ends in "deep contentment," a tidy emotional resolution that forecloses nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's mission to rebuild through naming and ritual—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when he places the tessera and performs the renaming, which others witness as transformative. However, the ritual's success feels declarative rather than earned through visible resistance or cost; no live option is foreclosed and no tactical trade-off is dramatized. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images rather than escalating conflict, appropriate for the Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure is more asserted than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (save the garden from despair) is signaled early, but escalation is thin. Silas begins to sing, the temporal ribbons intertwine, and the timeline heals without complication or reversal. No on-page event raises the cost or narrows his options; the performance proceeds smoothly from start to resolution. The fractured timeline is told ("each broken thread causing ripples of despair") rather than shown through a specific moment where Silas must adjust tactics. The ending reconfigures the garden's state, but Silas pays no visible price—his dissolution is framed as peaceful completion, not foreclosure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—helping telepathy pill victims—is declared early but never narrowed or tested by an on-page choice with visible cost. No reversal occurs; Maya proceeds from setup through documentation to claimed success without encountering resistance, trade-off, or complication that alters her tactics. The "static shock" is mentioned as a catalyst but never shown forcing a difficult decision. Escalation is absent; pressure remains flat from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hibernation—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or tightening. Maya descends, finds the object, learns its message, and exits without a reversal or choice that narrows options. The fossil responds to her touch with visions, a passive reception rather than agency-driven escalation. No visible price is paid; the "hours" spent learning are summarized, and the retrieval occurs without cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling a prophecy—is declared but never tested with meaningful opposition or cost. The cataloging succeeds without friction, failure, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. The prophecy's "transformation" from fixed to malleable happens through assertion rather than protagonist struggle. Visitors arriving feels like expansion rather than escalation. No visible price is paid, no tactic altered by constraint, and the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction without agency-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming purpose and protecting his daughter's future—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the ritual and the pillbox revelation, and the piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Aleksandr decides to "vouchsafe" his daughter's future by walking downhill with resolve. However, agency is more gestural (carving patterns, opening the box, turning away) than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The escalation is largely atmospheric and reflective; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does a protagonist choice materially narrow options or pay a price that alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the ritual to "honor the palimpsest promise" and "maintain the balance between worlds"—is declared but never tested by opposition, internal conflict, or cost. The coachman encounters no reversal, tightening, or trade-off; he waits, stitches, and departs on schedule. The yarn needle prick is a momentary sensation without consequence. Agency consists of executing a ritual rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the oasis's resilience—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory discoveries (glass reveals timelines, flowers tilt toward kindness, bees stir), but no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off. Kael's work (centering earth, offering attention) proceeds unobstructed; no failure, resistance, or competing cost tests his commitment. The ending declares his intention to teach without dramatizing what he sacrifices or forecloses. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase, but the final image lacks the cadence shift or visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's desire to reflect light—is declared but never encounters opposition or cost. Jim's appearance supplies backstory rather than complication, and the climactic light-reflection proceeds without obstacle, failed attempt, or trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara does exactly what she set out to do with no price paid on the page. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early but never escalates through on-page pressure or reversal. No concrete choice narrows options; Elena's journey is recounted in summary rather than dramatized in beats with rising cost. The "hum of the stone circle" and her hand on the reflective wall occur in a static tableau without agency or trade-off. Closure lacks visible price: she "finally understood" is an assertion, not an earned shift shaped by protagonist decision under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: reconnecting creativity with soul, signaled early. The piece attempts a deepening through Elara's engagement with the nest and installation, but pressure remains static—visiting the temple is her plan, and no reversal or complication tests her commitment. The "tingle of recognition" and subsequent epiphany arrive without a preceding choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification or cadence shift is expected; the final writing act is claimed but not shown with cost (no client refused, no old letter torn up, no visible price paid on the page).

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (stopping the transmissions) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara's activation of the transmitter is presented as the first and only attempt, with immediate success and no meaningful reversal or complication. The weeks of recalibration are summarized rather than shown, so the reader has no sense of rising cost or narrowing options. The final week's community healing is reported, not dramatized, and Merrick's sheepish approach arrives without friction. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the resolution feels convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing her people from subterranean prison—is signaled early, and the fallow period creates a ticking-clock constraint. However, escalation is sparse: Elara positions herself, hums, feels pain, and the doorway materializes without meaningful reversal or tightening. The "spatial mutiny" succeeds on first attempt with no visible tradeoff; the compass is discarded after use, but no cost (pursuit, exile, injury, lost knowledge) lands on the page. One tightening moment (her body transfixes, pain erupts) narrows physical freedom briefly, but the resolution bypasses rather than engages that constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—solving the cold case—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens through elimination (guest list → three sources → one custom mask commissioner), but the escalation is procedural rather than driven by protagonist agency under duress. The "sudden clarity" that identifies the assistant feels asserted rather than earned through prior groundwork. No visible cost appears on the page; the confession happens off-stage the following day, deflating the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (honoring ancestor, understanding weather chaos) is signaled early. Escalation is thin: Eli decodes journals, finds hidden controls, and activates them with minimal friction. No reversal narrows options; the copper nail fits the panel on first try, and Dr. Aris's skepticism evaporates. The initiation moment lacks visible cost—no shown consequence of failure, no trade-off between competing goods. "Spongey dread" shifts to action without dramatized internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake is never dramatized: Elias observes a vanishing, hears a declaration of stakes in his own interiority, then walks toward a site without opposition, cost, or a narrowed option. The hitchhiker's request for "a song about second chances" and her pixelated disappearance occur before the story's present action begins, so no on-page reversal or tightening tests commitment. Coincidence (the glass flake projects a bridge, the wrap forms wings) resolves without protagonist agency, and the final "ascent toward where the hitchhiker waited" is asserted rather than earned by prior pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias protecting his failing startup from Marcus's hostile takeover—is signaled but never escalates through on-page pressure. Marcus's confrontation is a single static beat; Elias listens and responds with a speech about objects on his wall, then Marcus exits without consequence. The subsequent bankruptcy is summarized across months rather than dramatized, collapsing what should be rising pressure into retrospective narration. No visible cost is paid on the page; Elias's calm remains unshaken and his final packing scene reads as serene acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding temple inscriptions—is signaled early but never tightened by a live obstacle or competing priority. The telegram and Dr. Thorne's arrival solve rather than complicate; coincidence (his "complementary findings") resolves the problem it did not help create. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The collaboration proceeds without friction, and the ending distributes emotional payoff without visible cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (free the mentor) is clear, and one tightening occurs when the druid must draw her own blood to feed the seed. However, most progression is delivered passively—each circle "revealed" or "brought" rather than forced by protagonist decisions under resistance. The vortex "tried to tear her concentration apart" but she never wavers, so no live tradeoff materializes. The glamour reveal shifts knowledge but no visible price is paid; walking away together reads as symmetric satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake ("restore the covenant") is signaled early but never tested. The ritual proceeds without obstacle, error, or cost; touching scars and pathways generates "tingle of connection" but no failure, hesitation, or trade-off. The maze offers potential for escalation (pathways, dead ends, hidden center) but is traversed in summary without decision points. The final "understanding" is bestowed rather than earned through agency, and the visionary's confinement lifts without visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to trammel an escaped memory and restore balance—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the memory "fought, desperate to remain free," but Elara's traced symbols and "fierce gentleness" subdue it without a visible price or tactical shift. The resolution feels preordained by her ritual competence rather than earned through a decision under pressure that narrows options. Agency appears as execution of a known method rather than a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering purpose—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The foreman's question ("Worth anything?") is the sole external pressure, and Marcus's answer does not foreclose a path or alter his situation. No meaningful tightening occurs; the piece accumulates grief-markers without escalation. The ending reframes Marcus's internal state but lacks agency-driven consequence or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—finding and planting the seed at the magnetic arbor—is signaled early but remains entirely abstract; no on-page beat narrows options or tests commitment. "Haunted ambitions" are attributed to predecessors in summary, not dramatized. The boarding moment offers no reversal, tightening, or visible price paid. Escalation under any lens is absent; the piece is setup without pressure, so no cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("preserve wonder in routine") is declared but never tested on the page. The monthly ritual proceeds without complication, reversal, or tightening—water rises, identity migrates, librarian emerges unchanged in practice. No choice narrows options or incurs visible cost; the cycle is static repetition rather than escalation. The piece gestures at internal conflict ("no longer fighting the changes") but dramatizes no struggle, trade-off, or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—what the inspector risks or loses by taking the pearl—is never dramatized. She gains the crown without a trade-off; no live option is foreclosed. The piece offers a tonal deepening (descent into caves, absorption of hopes) but no reversal or tightening choice that narrows her path. Coincidence drives the plot: she discovers the passage, the pearl "chooses" her, and she ascends with new purpose, all without protagonist agency under pressure. Cost is absent from the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is declared early but never tested by a competing pressure or sacrifice. Elena descends to the river without on-page obstacle or cost; the graffiti provides answers rather than complicating her path. No meaningful tightening or reversal: she seeks, finds, and accepts in a smooth arc. The final gesture (tears, music) reads as ceremonial release rather than a choice that forecloses an alternate path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("find the library") is signaled early, but no meaningful tightening or cost appears: the library materializes on cue, the protagonist enters without obstacle, examines manuscripts, transcribes findings, and leaves as the watch "warns" of a deadline that never bites. No reversal narrows options; luck and convenience resolve every beat. The "second fateful letter" is mentioned but does not arrive on the page, leaving escalation purely declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the violin's essence before the Empire claims it tomorrow—is signaled early and tightens when the coffee-reading shows destruction. Elara's agency drives the turn: she chooses to propagate rather than hide, using documented harmonic science. The cost is legible in the final image: the original violin lies "inert" with "deep scars," its destiny "fulfilled by perforation." However, the escalation feels more procedural than pressured; one micro-obstacle (a hesitation, a false note, a plant's resistance) would have deepened the tension in the harmonic-playing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the woman's essence before it fades—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no resistance, no static she cannot resolve, no moment where capture might fail. The pattern "grew clearer as she worked" without reversal or deepening. The ritual completes as planned, adding another vial to hundreds, with no tightening that forecloses an option or visible cost that alters her stance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or shift cadence; here it remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake ("find the source of contentment") is signaled early but remains abstract and static—no live options narrow, no tightening forecloses a path. The climb and grotto exploration proceed without reversal or complication; Elara encounters no resistance, doubt, or trade-off. The ending asserts transformation ("she finally understood," "journey complete") but no on-page choice or visible price dramatizes the shift. Escalation is missing under any lens: no because/therefore narrowing (causal), no density break or cadence shift that reweights cost (accumulative), no stance crystallization under coherent pressure (situational).

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—helping the fisherman navigate moral complexity—is signaled early. Pressure is static: the fisherman arrives troubled, Elian consults chimes, delivers advice, fisherman accepts. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the chime selection is presented as seamless interpretation, not a contested or costly choice. Agency rests with the fisherman's off-page acceptance; Elian's role is passive facilitation. The accumulative lens would require a deepening that reweights cost, but the final image ("prepared to welcome the day") resets to status quo without visible price. One escalation signal—Elian's glimpse of "something different" in the mirror—never develops into friction or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching Maya to "vanish to appear"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity; Maya simply listens and then succeeds. No reversal or tightening occurs; the blindfold removal and grotto's glow are external reveals, not turns driven by protagonist choice. The "decade return" at the end introduces a cost mechanism with no prior setup, so the price feels arbitrary rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is declared but never tested. Kael faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no friction; the crows guide him, the arrowhead pulses on cue, and revelation arrives without sacrifice. The single tightening moment (following the crows to the depression) lacks agency—Kael observes and complies rather than choosing between competing goods. No visible cost at closure, no path foreclosed, no escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—finding wonder beyond automated magic—is signaled early. The unstrapping moment offers one tightening that narrows options, but it arrives without prior escalation or visible trade-off (no failed attempt, no injury, no social cost dramatized on the page). The final image (small group practicing forgotten arts) tells of a new equilibrium rather than showing a persistent price or constraint shaping Elias's next move. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens but does not tighten with a felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.1)
    The stated stake ("why this gift was given to me alone") never faces on-page opposition or a trade-off. Hemingway walks to the lighthouse pulled by "inexplicable magnetic force," receiving answers and a cosmetic mark without relinquishing safety, ignorance, or a competing want. The librarian poses no test; the books open in unison as spectacle. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the ending grants new powers (multicolored flames) as pure accretion, not earned agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—interpreting the prophecy to determine humanity's survival—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; Loran listens, tosses coins, and immediately "understands." Coincidence (the coins form a "perfect spiral") resolves the problem the story set. No agency-driven escalation, no visible price, no option narrowed by protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming nameless grief into named understanding—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on repetition rather than tightening; each naming ("Solitude," "Lost Hope," "Elara's Eyes") follows the same template without raising cost or narrowing options. The resolution (naming heals sorrow) is declared rather than earned through a visible trade-off or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance—is signaled early. However, the mage's work proceeds without meaningful reversal, trade-off, or narrowing of options; he simply kneels, focuses, and succeeds. The "impossible but plausible" method is named but not tested under pressure. No visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies the resolution; luck and assertion replace protagonist agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the town's truth—signals early and remains coherent. The accumulative deepening (wind chime → label → trail of photographs → aunt's image) narrows Thomas's options from passive remembrance to active advocacy. Yet the resolution (phone calls, petitions) is told rather than dramatized, and no live opposition tests his commitment on the page. The cost is conceptual (recognizing complicity) but not viscerally felt in a trade-off or sacrifice within the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("harmonize logic and intuition") is declared but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The ritual unfolds as a choreographed success: starlings appear "as if summoned," the crystal glows, the flame shifts color on cue, and nature itself "acknowledges" the work. No reversal, no tightening, no forfeiture—Elara receives exactly what she sought without friction. The repeated "before the final transformation" frame promises escalation that never arrives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake ("preserve trust under pressure") is signaled early but remains abstract; we see atmospheric anomalies and an emergency protocol yet no on-page reversal that narrows live options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The emergency tether reach and transmission represent competent response rather than escalation driven by protagonist agency. Coincidence (the anomaly arriving tonight) complicates but the watcher's action—transmitting the message—feels like role execution rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No credible loss (time, trust, safety margin) alters later tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the duplicate consciousness has rights—is declared but never tested through Maya's on-page choices. The "vivify" task is set up as impossible, yet Maya succeeds in a single beat without visible trade-off or failed attempt. No tightening or deepening narrows her options; the history rewrite creates ambient urgency without altering her tactics. Coincidence (the jar glows because she "allowed herself to feel") resolves the conflict, violating agency requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter via sound—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's intensity and Silas's internal yearning, but the giggle's arrival is not driven by his agency or a tightening of options; it simply happens. One meaningful deepening occurs (the giggle shifts his understanding), but the lack of protagonist-driven escalation and the absence of visible trade-offs or costs in his modulation choices keep this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.6)
    A dominant stake (dimensional homesickness, desire to return home) is signaled, but the guardian faces no on-page opposition, dilemma, or cost. The pendant's energy crescendos without resistance, and the guardian's "interiorizing exteriors" practice is summarized rather than tested under pressure. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the ending grants the guardian simultaneous belonging everywhere without any visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Coincidence (the pendant reaching "critical point") resolves the situation, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation rather than decisive action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—interrupting stifling destiny—is declared early but never tested with on-page friction. Escalation is summary-only: three numbered attempts without dramatized reversals or visible costs that narrow options. The final ritual succeeds without a trade-off or tactical constraint, and the transformation feels convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. Pressure is asserted ("desperate," "trembling") but not built through choices that foreclose paths or raise felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—tuning the fragment during lunar perigee—is signaled early and sustained. However, the story provides no meaningful tightening or reversal; Elara proceeds smoothly from goal to success without a moment where options narrow or cost becomes legible. "Other interpreters had failed" is told rather than shown through an on-page complication. The resolution delivers alignment without visible trade-off, agency choice, or price paid in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake ("merge parallel timelines") is declared but never tested on the page—no reversal, no complication, no live price. The ferry arrives at the grotto, the counterpart appears, the hourglass fills, and success is granted without dramatized risk or trade-off. Liam's optimism faces no friction from crew fears or timeline physics. Coincidence (the moons, the grotto's pulse) enables resolution rather than complicating it. No escalation under the Accumulative lens; the sequence is additive decoration without pressure increase or cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—finding his sister—is signaled early but never tightens into a live trade-off or choice that forecloses another path. The eruption of emotions and the tapestry coming alive happen to Elias rather than arising from his agency; he watches in "awe" and then simply touches the thread. No reversal or deepening narrows his options or changes his knowledge in a way that raises cost; the reunion is delivered by coincidence (the sinew thread "absorbed... the collective unconscious") rather than protagonist decision. The ending declares connection "created, nurtured, and cherished" but never dramatizes what Elias must give up or endure to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is clear: Kael seeks to navigate by starlight from the ocean floor, bridging isolation and cosmic discovery. One meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers the chain link and begins developing edge geometry. However, escalation is weak—the method unfolds through summary ("Weeks passed as the instructor developed his method") and the breakthrough arrives as external validation rather than a choice under pressure. No reversal or complication appears; Kael's efforts succeed without setback, and the resolution is granted by off-page ships rather than earned through his agency at closure. The ending delivers triumph without visible cost or a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—Elena's routine work versus the urgent child-safety threat—arrives late (past midpoint). The "warning pulse" from the hearing aid escalates intensity but Elena's agency consists mostly of observation and a phone call to security; the predator's detention occurs off-page. One tightening (following the pulse to the garden) narrows options, but no visible cost or trade-off is paid on the page. Coincidence (the same man from grandmother's photo) resolves the threat rather than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: guide shadows through phase transitions before the tide returns. The tidal clock provides urgency, and the piece mentions "seven shadows that night," but the guiding process is summarized in a single sentence without on-page friction or a visible cost that narrows options. The "crashing hush" and the closing of the Codex suggest completion, but no reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade one option for another. Escalation reads as atmospheric density rather than pressure that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.4)
    The stated stake—"understand why I survived"—is pursued off-page through passive observation of ink patterns rather than agency that narrows options. No on-page reversal or tightening choice alters tactics; the defragment process proceeds without complication and the "systematic failure" answer arrives without friction. The ending declares transformation but no live path is foreclosed, no price is paid, and no want conflicts with fear in a visible way.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (preserving the language) is signaled early but never tested on the page. Decades pass with no reversal, adaptation, or visible cost; the protagonist simply continues his ritual until success. The final evening's bird-pattern is coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. No live option is foreclosed, no price paid—escalation under any lens is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cryptids' transformations—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page test. Aris observes, documents, and reflects without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The shift from "capture to witness" is told as insight rather than earned through a reversal that forecloses the prior path. No visible price is paid; the static-laden confessions and undercover risk are mentioned but never escalate into a concrete dilemma. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or pattern break is expected—here the celestial alignments and arrowhead patterns accumulate detail but don't reweight stakes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elayn encounters statues and calms them, retrieves the sapling without resistance, and returns to play. The statues "began to stir" but she simply runs and her music keeps them at bay; no tightening or trade-off narrows her options. The resolution unfolds as a montage of success (flowers blooming, people dreaming) without visible cost or a path foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but the orchard visit and aftermath read as sequential victories rather than a pressure curve that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—delivering the bottle to reunite mother and daughter—is signaled early, but the scene's pressure is static: guards wave him through, the woman takes the bottle, he leaves. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the guards' entrance offers a beat of tension but deflates immediately when they ignore him. The cost of Elias's network-building is summarized in reflection ("months of careful observation," future reunions) rather than tested here. One meaningful tightening moment—perhaps a guard's scrutiny forcing a real choice—would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in silence and discarded things—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal that narrows options. The halo fragment and oasis arrival are gifts, not obstacles; the carpenter's impulse to sing faces brief internal hesitation ("fear warred with desire") but no on-page cost or trade-off. The carousel's animation and the fragment's dissolution occur without the carpenter making a choice that forecloses a path. Escalation is decorative rather than causal, and the resolution is granted by magic rather than earned by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reawakening dormant stories—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged throughout. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; Margaret proceeds smoothly from arranging books to witnessing the result. The "approach of what she had long sought" and the scarf's dissolution are presented as fulfillment rather than a trade-off with visible cost. Patrons browsing never impose urgency, and the hyperbolic geometry resolves the problem it was introduced to solve without testing Margaret's commitment or forcing a sacrifice scaled to the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—deciphering her sister's message—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara's discovery of the mysterious book provides a convenient key rather than forcing a trade-off or narrowing options through her own agency. The "map" and "cipher of longing" materialize without prior clues or failed attempts that would establish cost. The ending reconfigures understanding but does not dramatize a choice between competing goods or harms; coincidence (the book's appearance) resolves rather than complicates. One meaningful tightening—the shift from capturing "visual beauty" to "essence of light"—occurs, but it lacks visible price or consequence that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the woman's trapped idea—is signaled early but remains abstract. Silas performs a sequence of ritualistic actions (circle walking, palm pressing, consciousness projection) that unfold without resistance or cost; the woman's fear is described but never dramatizes a refusal or counter-pressure that would test his commitment. The idea "burst[s] forth like a supernova" without an on-page choice or trade-off. No meaningful tightening occurs; the resolution is delivered by metaphor rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elara's decades of study culminate in a single night when "something changed" without prior failed attempts or rising costs that narrow her options. The seventh-shape alignment feels arbitrary rather than earned through protagonist agency; coincidence triggers the resolution rather than a choice under pressure. The "shadowy figures" vision and the revelation that memories were "borrowed, not stolen" arrive without forcing Elara to sacrifice, endure, or confront a moral calculus, leaving closure without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—mentoring resilience—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Prisha must choose to continue work despite the door creaking, demonstrating the lesson. Yet the pressure feels modest; the demonstration of reversible exile and tea-leaf annotation proceeds without genuine friction or complication. No visible price is paid on the page; the archivist's smile suggests satisfaction rather than foreclosure of a path. The piece gestures toward exile/return as mirrored movements but doesn't translate that into a tactical dilemma or forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's color—is declared but never tested by opposition, cost, or friction. The ritual proceeds in smooth ceremonial steps: press seed, feel energy, wrap light, place in pouch. No reversal, tightening, or escalation appears; the waterfall quiets cooperatively, the seed transforms on cue, and triumph arrives without obstacle. Agency is absent; the pruner performs a rehearsed method rather than making choices under pressure that foreclose options or exact visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and remains coherent. The story accumulates texture through the unraveling beats, but there's no meaningful reversal or tightening: Elena begins with purpose, proceeds without obstacle, and succeeds. The net yields "whisper of history" and "fragment" in a smooth progression that lacks friction. The spirits settle without resistance, and Jacob's secret emerges passively. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or pattern break is needed; here the beats loop rather than escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reopening the henge's secrets—is signaled early but never tightens into a live on-page dilemma. Elara's "months" of study and the "one rainy Tuesday" discovery occur off-stage or in summary; no reversal, failed attempt, or trade-off narrows her options. The "trembling hands" moment gestures at intensity but delivers exposition ("aligned perfectly with celestial events") rather than a pressure-driven choice. Coincidence (the pattern appears in footage) solves the puzzle without protagonist agency or visible price, and the resolution—sharing the discovery "in the same spirit"—avoids concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding Amelia's last transmission and "the physics of letting go"—is signaled early but remains abstract. Elara listens to audio, examines the globe, and reaches a conclusion without facing a tightening choice or visible trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the epiphany arrives through solitary reflection rather than pressure-driven agency. The final realization changes her understanding but lacks dramatized cost or a forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("articulate unspoken needs") is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. No on-page reversal or tightening: Elara wants to communicate with the ghost, finds a tool, uses it, and succeeds without friction. The ghost is cooperative from the start, so no conflict escalates. Coincidence (storm reveals staircase, grandmother's attic holds the exact tool needed) solves rather than complicates. No agency-driven choice forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decrypting the diary to understand the captain's disappearance—is signaled early and tightens gradually as Elira ascends and recalls fragments. The floor-nine breakthrough (holding the diary to light through the goggles) provides one meaningful reversal that narrows the mystery. However, the discovery does not alter Elira's tactics or force a trade-off; she simply reads, understands, and descends with a vague promise to preserve dignity. Agency at closure reads as passive reception rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—proving atmospheric memory—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elena's situation (stranded) should force trade-offs but she works "with steady hands" and "unexpected calm" throughout. The cloud pattern she witnesses in paragraph 20 is described as "the evidence she needed" but no prior attempt has failed, no alternate interpretation has tempted her, and rescue is passively awaited. No reversal or tightening narrows options; escalation is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (complete the sky-mirror project before demolition) is signaled early. The coin discovery deepens the project's meaning, but the transformation from literal stars to soul-patterns occurs without a visible tradeoff or narrowed option. No on-page reversal tests commitment; the protagonist moves smoothly from idea to execution without friction. The dawn approach provides urgency, yet Elara faces no tactical cost or forced choice that alters her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—charting the next great discovery—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Eli realizes the hopscotch board is a cipher, which narrows his interpretive task. Yet the escalation lacks on-page cost: the connection "remained elusive" briefly, then "suddenly made sense" without dramatized struggle, failed attempts, or trade-offs. The starlings' alignment and luminance's acknowledgment feel celebratory rather than hard-won. Agency is observational; no live option is foreclosed by his choice to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early but never tested. Elias encounters no meaningful obstacle: the library yields, the box opens, the heart repairs. No reversal, tightening, or visible price narrows his options. The mirrors distort geometry momentarily but do not block progress. Pressure remains static from entry to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing failing crops—is signaled early but resolved off-stage through summary ("showed signs of renewed vitality within days"). No on-page tightening or reversal tests Elion's or Aris's commitment; the watering bell simply works, and the community simply follows instructions. Escalation is replaced by declarative statements of success ("collective action," "triumph"), and the multigenerational coda drains any remaining pressure. No protagonist agency drives the turn; discovery and implementation happen in reported summary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—"vouchsafe the next cycle of existence"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no live consequence or countdown pressures Elias's actions. The ritual proceeds in a single unbroken escalation (whispers, contact, hum, acceptance) with no reversal, tightening choice, or foreclosed path. The cost is asserted ("exhausted but resolute") but not dramatized; the clock "accepted" the lullaby without visible trade-off or sacrifice. Agency is procedural execution rather than decision under pressure, and the "final soft ripple" closure lacks a visible price or narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—saving travelers before frost traps them—is clear and provides a ticking clock. Elias's gift and the device enable the rescue, creating one meaningful action sequence. However, escalation is limited: the mechanical birds never engage, the frost forms but doesn't trap anyone, and the resolution lacks visible cost. Elias vanishes before thanks, returns home, and discovers his burden is lighter without paying a price or foreclosing options—convenience plotting undercuts earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with her sister—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Elara moves from grief to insight to action without meaningful resistance or cost. The sister's immediate receptiveness ("We all choose our paths...") deflates tension at the peak beat. The weeks-later summary tells us outcomes (new work approach, weekly meetings) rather than showing a trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful pressure point (the call) exists, but the protagonist's agency does not narrow options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake ("find the place where stories begin") is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed by choice. No reversal or tightening occurs; the vendor selects shards, traces patterns, and gathers moonlight fragments without resistance, cost, or trade-off. The customer's arrival feels decorative rather than earned by the vendor's agency. "Glimmering parole" conditions (nightly renewal, no harming completed stories) are declared but never constrain an on-page decision. Pressure remains static across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—smoothing stored remorse—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Kael journeys, finds the pavilion, and completes his task without friction; no credible loss or complication forces a trade-off. The pavilion's threat to collapse and the tide of regret are declared but not realized on the page, resulting in escalation that remains abstract. The final "lighter heart" is told outcome without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—community division—is declared but never tested on the page. Elena's "plan" encounters no resistance, adaptation, or price; farmers and townspeople simply attend and cooperate. The "first gathering brought unexpected results" is told rather than shown, and "former opponents worked together" by the fourth meeting with no dramatized friction. No reversal or tightening narrows options; escalation is claimed in summary without pressure or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (accessing entangled memories) is signaled early but faces no on-page resistance. The device activates without complication, memories flow freely, and the engineer adapts via "synaptic plasticity" without visible struggle or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the arc is a frictionless ascent to transformation. Closure asserts permanent change but no live option is foreclosed—what could the engineer not do afterward, and what price was paid? Coincidence does not resolve because nothing was blocked.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (retrieve forgotten combinations to renew protections) is signaled early, but escalation is absent: Elara encounters no setback, adaptation, or forced trade-off in the grotto. The time limit (seven minutes remaining) is mentioned but never tightens her tactics or forces a sacrifice. Agency at closure is passive—she "had successfully retrieved"—with no on-page decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. The story declares stakes but does not dramatize cost or a reversal that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring music to a silent world—is signaled early and sustained. Elara approaches the sculpture, reads its cracks, absorbs its emotions, then prepares to carve anew. This is a deepening (she now knows the sculpture's song) rather than a tightening that narrows options. No live dilemma, reversal, or trade-off complicates her path; coincidence does not intervene, but neither does agency under pressure. The ending delivers continuation ("began anew") without visible cost or a foreclosed alternative, keeping the score in the functional mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (redemption via understanding the nexus) is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Elias reads patterns, documents them, and then realizes the answer without a visible trade-off or narrowed option. The three-day timeframe is declared urgent but doesn't force a tightening choice; day three simply delivers the insight. No reversal or tightening costs him an alternative path. The final act—lifting the worry stone—lacks agency-driven escalation; the mountains "embrace him" rather than his choice altering terms.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—recover diary contents—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or cost: Elara performs her ritual and succeeds immediately. The diary's contents ("instructions for creating empathy") reward her work rather than challenging it, and her shift to teaching is declared without visible trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the sequence is arrangement → performance → success without pressure increase or tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—documenting the corpse flower and understanding vanishing plants—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Elara's climb, nurturing, and insight occur without reversal; the seed cooperates, the elders approve, and the final revelation (the plant is a guardian-library) solves rather than complicates. No on-page tightening narrows options or forces a trade-off. The piece lacks escalation under any lens: causal linkage is absent (events unfold in sequence without because/therefore), accumulative pressure does not deepen (doodles grow complex but stakes do not), and situational pressure never crystallizes a stance. Agency is observation, not decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discover resilience source—is signaled early and pursued. The gravitational inversion provides escalating environmental pressure and the arrow-tip's glow introduces a mid-story complication. However, agency is passive: Arion steers and observes while visions deliver answers without a trade-off or difficult renunciation. No live option is visibly foreclosed; the mission succeeds without cost, capping escalation impact. One meaningful tightening occurs (navigating inverted rivers) but resolution arrives via revelation rather than protagonist sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—solving the town's silence—is signaled early but never meaningfully escalates. Elena encounters anomalies (damaged containers, air distortion) yet each discovery prompts only more documentation without narrowing options or raising cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the investigation proceeds in a linear accumulation of measurements. The ending restates her intention to continue tomorrow, offering no on-page choice, renunciation, or stance crystallization with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"certify wonder as essential"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or complication. Eira's performance proceeds without error, interruption, or internal doubt; no tactic is forced to change, no cost forecloses a path. The crowd's tears affirm success without dramatized friction. The piece offers escalation in sensory intensity but not in narrative pressure or protagonist agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—redemption through insight—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The driftwood arrangement and flute-playing constitute a single extended ritual without reversal, resistance, or cost; the visions "revealed new perspectives" without forcing a tradeoff or narrowing options. The transformation ("tears were streaming down") is asserted rather than tested by a decision that forecloses a path. No persistent constraint shapes tactics, and coincidence does not complicate. The ritual unfolds as planned, delivering the promised insight without friction, making the escalation procedural rather than agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's research into emotional mathematics—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or trade-off. Thomas's disorientation is imposed without his resistance or agency shaping the outcome; he flees, leaving Elara's goal unopposed and her methods unchallenged. The story lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening: the transfer succeeds as planned, the data is recorded, and Elara continues unchanged. No visible cost (ethical, relational, or opportunity) is paid on the page; the vanishing stars are decorative rather than constraint-generating.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—deliver the pendant by solstice—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page obstacle that forces a trade-off. The elderly traveler encounter offers information but no cost or reversal. The final handoff occurs without friction, and the stated internal shift (jitters to confidence) is summarized rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. One tightening is present (learning the shortcut) but it eases rather than escalates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—prove that objects absorb emotions—is declared early but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elara presses the prism to glass, patterns rearrange, and she gains validation without sacrifice or narrowed options. No reversal or deepening; the frost simply confirms her theory, then expands it. The discovery arrives as lucky success rather than earned escalation driven by her agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—carrying the grandmother's message to restore sound—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara encounters the puzzle pieces, but their discovery is coincidental ("something magnetic drew her") rather than driven by her agency. The sacrifices ("a memory, a sound, a sensation") are summarized in a single sentence without on-page embodiment or a visible cost that alters later tactics. The bead's dimming and the eventual restoration of sound occur passively; the final bamboo shoot appears without prior setup, and touching it solves the problem it did not help create. No escalation or trade-off is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring what is broken—is signaled early and remains coherent. The elders' request introduces a concrete test, but the resolution is summarized ("With every hammer fall, azure light flared") without a dramatized moment where Orion's choices narrow options or incur visible cost. The magician's silk's price is declared but never shown to foreclose a tactical path or force a trade-off. One meaningful tightening (the arch supports challenge) is present but lacks on-page escalation that changes knowledge or options.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.6)
    Dominant stake ("discover the weight of a withheld truth") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The jumps between realities occur "cyclically and spontaneous" without protagonist agency driving escalation—the shard dictates timing, reducing the map maker to passenger. The red-shard moment could tighten pressure, but the green shard's heat simply prevents contact with no visible cost or tactical shift. The ending postpones resolution ("tomorrow, they would try again"), refusing to foreclose a path or crystallize a stance with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: emotional isolation versus connection across time, signaled early and sustained. The lamp's failure provides discovery access but does not narrow options under pressure—Elias faces no competing choice or trade-off. The single tightening (realization of the keeper chain's continuity) deepens understanding but does not force a decision with visible cost; his final acts (stone, letter, vial) are adoptions of ritual rather than wrestled choices. No reversal tests commitment; the letters welcome him without friction. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—guiding refugees safely—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elara adjusts her beam, the fleet passes safely, and she feels "shadowed elation" without any on-page tightening, trade-off, or visible price. Her worry about accidental prophecy introduces potential internal conflict but is never dramatized into a choice that narrows options. No reversal or deepening occurs; the narrative moves in one direction (success) without escalation or cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.1)
    The stated stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is announced but never tested on the page. No obstacle blocks Kaelen's research, no trade-off is forced, and the "quietly explosive" discovery arrives without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The piece lacks on-page escalation: pressure does not tighten, and no reversal changes options or knowledge. Agency is absent; Kaelen observes and reflects but makes no decision that narrows paths or alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering what trees witness—is signaled early but never tested by a competing cost or live constraint. Samuel's work proceeds without escalation: he polishes, adjusts the sextant, groups dream fragments, and the sextant "suddenly flared" due to coincidence (the droplet chime). No on-page reversal narrows his options; the climactic understanding arrives as a gift rather than through protagonist agency. The resolution (trees witness sorrow as "part of growth") lacks felt cost—Samuel is healed and gains wisdom without forfeiting a path or enduring friction. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it disperses into theme.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (restore light/balance to the dying realm) is signaled early and sustained. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density increase or pattern break; here the keeper moves from window to orchard to final weave without encountering resistance, setback, or a moment that narrows options. Urgency is declared ("moved faster now") but not dramatized through a complication or cost that forces a tactical trade-off. The resolution unfolds as unobstructed progress, reducing escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor's conflict between compassion and reclusiveness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The invitation represents a decision point, and her choice to write a note rather than attend is a micro-turn. However, the escalation is entirely internal and reflective; no external pressure forces a trade-off or narrows options. The resolution (accepting her paradox) is conceptual rather than action-driven, and the society member's easy acceptance undercuts any cost. One tightening occurs (the decision to stay away and send a note), but the piece does not dramatize a second pressure point or a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the bakery mystery—is signaled early, but escalation is weak: Eliza moves from exploration to reading a letter without meaningful opposition or narrowing options. The resolution (bakers vanished to protect a girl) arrives via exposition rather than protagonist agency, and the "tenuous absolution" feels declared rather than earned through on-page cost. No reversal or tightening choice forecloses a live path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving luminous vows—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet pressure never meaningfully tightens: Elias faces no obstacle, trade-off, or reversal. The sampler chimes, he realizes "not all was lost," and he decides to create new slides—all frictionless. No choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The "desperate need to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is asserted but never tested by an on-page complication or price, leaving escalation absent under the Accumulative lens inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking before sunrise—is signaled early, and Eliza's three approaches (burly pirate, second-in-command, Malachi directly) form a causal escalation that narrows to the note gambit. Yet each step succeeds easily; the "false starts" label in the text describes her first two moves, but no genuine obstacle forces her to adapt or pay a price. The truce and sunrise are declared constraints that never materialize as pressure; coincidence (the lieutenant being the actual betrayer) resolves the final turn rather than Eliza's insight or trade-off, lowering agency and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("why some people carry weather") is declared but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that narrows options. No meaningful escalation occurs; the protagonist observes, then passively accepts transformation without visible trade-off. The storm man's arrival and the ring's dissolution are plot conveniences unearned by protagonist agency. Pressure remains static across the entire text.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming creative voice—is signaled early but remains abstract. The cleaning woman's discovery is coincidental, not driven by Rhodes's agency. The cave visit and return to the portrait feel inevitable rather than hard-won; no on-page reversal tests commitment or forces a choice between competing goods. The final act of painting "what only he could see" is asserted in summary without showing what he sacrifices, risks, or forecloses. One meaningful tightening is present (deciding to rectify) but escalation and cost clarity are weak.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the Repository to retrieve lost conversations and closure with her departed love—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: the map discovery is a revelation, not a complication that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The piece moves from artifact to artifact (postal plate, map, alignment realization) without on-page friction or a decision that forecloses another path. Agency at closure is a stated intention to leave at dawn rather than a choice with visible cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—"preserve the color of wonder"—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss; the iceberg fragment "never diminished," the sculpture succeeds without friction, and communities adopt the innovation seamlessly. The only potential tightening—Elara's aging hands—is mentioned but does not alter tactics or outcomes. Escalation is summarized ("weeks... in feverish diligence") rather than dramatized, and closure rewards rather than forecloses, violating the cost requirement under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the garden and resolve inner static—signals early. The magnetic shift provides external pressure, but escalation proceeds through reported system states rather than dramatized reversals that narrow options. "Systems failure imminent" is declared, yet Unit 734's execution of protocol 34 reads as smooth application rather than a tightening choice with visible trade-off. The cost (original form inert, consciousness fragmented) is legible but arrives as outcome rather than dramatized during the peak decision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (solve the locket mystery) is clear by paragraph three, but escalation is iterative rather than tightening: Leo hears more fragments in the same courtyard setting without rising cost or narrowing options. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the key arrives conveniently from Mrs. Henderson in paragraph 18. The final discovery (letters, not jewels) reweights thematic meaning but does not foreclose a live path for Leo—he retains all options and pays no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the laboratory's knowledge—is signaled early, but escalation is weak. Elara's progress unfolds "with methodical patience" without visible obstacles or reversals that narrow her options; the narrative tells us she's "close" without showing a failed attempt or sacrifice. The final dance sequence is the only on-page action beat, and it succeeds without dramatized cost—screens simply "flicker to life." The resolution is entirely protagonist-driven, but the lack of struggle or trade-off at the moment of success undermines the causal pressure required for the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—locating deleted memories—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or cost. Elara digs, finds the crystal, recognizes her brother's face, and reburries it with minimal friction. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the authorities' abandonment of the whale conveniently clears her path. The resolution is discovery without sacrifice, want without fear. One micro-turn (sand grows resistant) deflates immediately. Agency is observational rather than decision-driven at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing a disruptive prophecy—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or cost. The summoner proceeds through the ritual without opposition, complication, or trade-off; each beat adds ornamental description rather than narrowing options. The accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or deepening that reweights the stake with visible cost; instead, the prophecy is absorbed and released "into harmless dissolution" without any on-page price or forfeited alternative. Agency is absent: the protagonist observes transformation rather than making a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—learning building language—is signaled early but never tightened by a reversal or cost. The rooftop interrogation ("What does the language of buildings mean to you?") invites deepening but Clara's answer is abstract and Mr. Abernathy simply affirms it. The genealogical reveal is coincidental (they are relatives) rather than driven by Clara's agency. No on-page trade-off or forfeited option is visible; the seal transfers without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—accessing quarantined memories to transform isolation into independence—is signaled early but never tightens. No obstacle or complication appears; the resonance structures work as intended, the memories surface smoothly, and Elara completes her task. The father's protective motive is revealed via exposition without creating new pressure. No live choice, renunciation, or trade-off is dramatized. The story reads as a fulfillment rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—redemption for the betrayal—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when the key reveals the hidden decree, narrowing Elias's options to confession or continued hiding. Yet the escalation is convenient rather than pressured: the key arrives unbidden, the compartment opens without resistance, and no antagonist or physical obstacle tests his resolve. The final act (blood signature, key dissolving) asserts cost through metaphor but does not dramatize a trade-off or visible consequence that alters later tactics. Agency reads as decision, but the path is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—balance between echoes and silence—is declared but never tested by a live choice that forecloses an option. The singer's shift from curiosity to compassion is summarized in exposition rather than earned through a reversal or deepening that narrows tactics. The child's "decision" is told, not shown, removing protagonist agency from the closure beat. No credible cost (time, stamina, social credit, tool loss) alters the singer's approach; the resolution arrives without sacrifice or trade-off visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—expose the sabotage truth—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Elara's dream-visitation campaign unfolds in summary; no single descendant resists, misinterprets, or forces a trade-off. The sabotage revelation and subsequent confessions occur off-stage ("One by one, the descendants came forward"), eliminating all escalation and visible cost. The captain's gratitude substitutes for a protagonist-driven turn. No tightening, deepening, or reversal narrows Elara's options or changes her knowledge through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—to appreciate hidden effort—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or opposition. The protagonist's nightly pilgrimage proceeds without complication, cost, or meaningful tightening. No reversal or deepening narrows options; coincidence (firefly season, rain) enables but does not complicate. The piece is contemplative rather than conflictual, with the protagonist's desires met effortlessly. Agency is observation without decision, and no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering the stillpoint's truth) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Maya encounters no setbacks, reversals, or dilemmas; each discovery leads smoothly to the next without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The corporate threat is mentioned but never dramatized—no on-page antagonist applies pressure. Her final decision to protect the knowledge carries no visible price; she simply plans her next move without sacrifice or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)
    No dominant stake is tested on the page; the story summarizes Elias's seven-year vigil and the prophet's rise without a single reversal, tightening choice, or escalation beat. "Variant allegiance" and "shaping a new dawn" are declared but never force a live trade-off or foreclosure with visible cost. The final paragraph asserts success ("everything that would follow") rather than dramatizing pressure or price, deflating any sense of earned conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—translating between generations—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. The poet discovers the box, decides to share it, and succeeds without complication or reversal. No on-page tightening forces a trade-off; the music's effect is granted by narrative fiat. Agency appears as enactment of a pre-set purpose rather than a choice under pressure that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (protect the artifact) is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Elias races to the lighthouse, descends, performs the ritual, and wins without adaptation, setback, or visible tradeoff. The intruders are introduced as urgent threat but never appear on-screen; their defeat is summarized in a single sentence. No on-page reversal tests his commitment, and no price is paid—he retains duty, key, and artifact with no path foreclosed. The ritual success feels like outline convenience rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—launching a "patient revolution" by tracking celestial patterns—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off. The mapper waits for the full moon, the viaduct hums on cue, and the protagonist charts the resonance without opposition, uncertainty, or a choice that forecloses an alternate path. No reversal or deepening alters options; the ending delivers thematic satisfaction without a visible price paid or a live constraint that shaped tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about preventable death—is clear. Maya's discovery of the note provides one tightening: evidence of systemic negligence raises the stakes beyond a single death. However, escalation is mild; no reversal forces a trade-off on the page. The "controlling influence" she must escape is abstract and never applies counterpressure. The final choice to submit findings carries declared career risk but no visible immediate cost—no confrontation, no loss of alliance, no tactical sacrifice shown. The climax reads as a resolved decision rather than a choice under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to repair the clockwork heart—is signaled early and the priest's internal calculus ("wasting my money," "work we still have to do") provides one meaningful tightening. However, the key reversal (deciding not to repair) arrives via extended reflection rather than a pressured on-page choice, and the cost of leaving the heart broken is asserted thematically ("silence now speaking more loudly") rather than felt in a forfeited path or visible trade-off. The stakes remain coherent but escalation is light.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—to ring a silent bell—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, no meaningful obstacle complicates the quest: the glider finds the arrow tip, decodes it via kaleidoscope, navigates to the bell, and rings it without error or trade-off. The single reversal (discovering symbols require translation) is solved in the same beat it appears. The ending declares the bell's ring "no one heard it, just as predicted," erasing suspense and cost. Pressure does not escalate; the glider's path tightens only spatially, not through narrowed options or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("find where deleted files go") is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or complication that narrows options with visible cost. The "ninety seconds before breach" deadline evaporates without consequence—Elara gains access, downloads everything, and escapes without dramatized friction. The video-fragment discovery resolves the mystery through exposition rather than a turn driven by protagonist choice. No on-page reversal or deepening forecloses a path; pressure remains static assertion ("alarms began screaming") rather than escalation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("save their settlement from the coming storm") is declared but never tested—no obstacle or reversal complicates the reconstitution. Elena faces no genuine trade-off: she visualizes the pieces, the shadows respond, the crystal reforms in a smooth escalation without a narrowing of options or a visible price. The "elders' challenge" and "elders' skepticism" are mentioned twice as external pressure, but no elder appears on the page and no social cost is dramatized. Coincidence does not resolve (her magic does), but agency is passive—her hands "moved with practiced grace" and the crystal "began to grow" without a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elena's confrontation with mortality—is signaled early but never tested on the page. She arrives seeking death, volunteers without friction, and discovers hope via summary realization rather than a pressure-driven trade-off. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Marcus's dialogue and the ice imagery add texture but no escalation. The ending reconfigures her stance but the cost is asserted ("acceptance") rather than dramatized through forfeiture or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering meaning in loneliness—is signaled early but never tested by reversal or tightening that narrows options. The sentinel's reflections loop without escalation: he observes patterns, handles the letter, philosophizes, then declares healing without on-page cost or forfeited path. No choice forces a trade-off; no coincidence complicates pressure. The narrative substitutes thematic meditation for escalation, leaving the stake abstract and unproven in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dominant stake ("preserve the echo of wisdom") is declared but never tested. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening; the ritual proceeds from tracing patterns → circle emerges → consecration peaks → task complete in a frictionless sequence. Agency is observation and gesture without cost: no live option is foreclosed, no price paid. The "personal cost" is told ("isolation in the present") but not dramatized through a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—facilitating collective healing through photograph arrangement—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. The gathering proceeds exactly as Elara planned: participants arrive, select photos, trace arcs, and form a circle without opposition, complication, or cost. No reversal or deepening occurs; the "magic" is declared ("something magical began to happen") rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. Agency is absent; Elara orchestrates, but no decision forecloses a path or reveals a price.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding linguistic growth patterns—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or narrowed options. No reversal or tightening occurs; the scholar's work proceeds unimpeded from discovery to realization. The ending declares a shift in understanding ("preservation to translation") without requiring him to forfeit a method, confront a limit, or pay a visible price. Escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic, leaving pressure flat across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—locating the sound of growing older—is signaled early and sustained throughout, with the driftwood arrangement and chalk drawing functioning as tactical steps. However, escalation is minimal: the prophet encounters no meaningful obstacle or reversal, and the caretaker's information arrives as convenience rather than complication. The ending ("he smiled slightly, knowing he had finally located") asserts success but does not dramatize a visible cost or foreclosed path; the protagonist's situation at close mirrors the opening, reducing the sense of pressure-driven change. The tightening required by this length is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—stopping the tremors by understanding the clock—is signaled early. Escalation is mild: Elara tries "various methods" (summarized, not dramatized) and then places the clock outside for a single contemplative night. The reversal (clock isn't broken, it's attuned) arrives via epiphany rather than a choice under pressure. Agency is present in her decision to restructure perception filters, but no visible price is paid—no tool sacrificed, no relationship strained, no prior plan abandoned. The head astronomer's skepticism dissolves without friction. Accumulative deepening occurs (tremors subside through alignment), but cost legibility is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when the son whispers "I'll fix it, Dad" and the narrator must bridge "understanding and acceptance," but this beat is told rather than dramatized through a visible tradeoff or tactical shift. The resolution (the narrator continues playing, the son holds the fragment) does not foreclose a live alternative; Mr. Anders' death unfolds as anticipated without agency-driven escalation. Pressure is present but does not meaningfully narrow options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"where shadows go at noon"—is signaled early but never tested by competing pulls or obstacles. Elara's ritual proceeds without reversal: she positions herself, turns the key, connects stones in sequence, and the answer materializes. No genuine tightening occurs; the "final loop" is presented as climactic but functions as the last step of an unimpeded checklist. Agency at closure is passive observation ("she saw," "she realized") rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and the cost ("journey was only beginning") defers consequence off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is Eleanor's quest to restore or transform her worldview. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tooth begins to vibrate and Arthur emerges, narrowing her options to "reach out" or withdraw. The cost—yielding skepticism to wonder—is declared on-page but not tested by a prior refused alternative or visible sacrifice. Arthur's "My bones need setting" creates a pivot but Eleanor's "I have been preparing my whole life" bypasses friction. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (share stars without fire) is signaled early and persists. The discovery that polished sea glass projects celestial patterns is a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, and the grotto evolves from private sanctuary to pilgrimage site. However, no on-page reversal narrows live options or forces a trade-off with visible cost; the progression reads as steady accretion rather than pressure that tightens and forecloses. Band guardrails for 8.0+ require a tightening that forecloses a path or forces a trade-off; this piece deepens without that constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—healing from the viral confession and mentor's misconduct—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs: the spiral pattern guides her to the offering spot, and the act of leaving the pendant forecloses carrying her grandmother's legacy as guilt. However, the escalation is largely internal and contemplative; no external pressure or live opposition tests the decision. The final months-later image tells of transformation rather than showing present cost. Agency is present (she seeks, walks, offers) but the choice feels preordained by the meditative tone rather than narrowed by on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=2.4)
    No dominant stake is signaled or tested on the page. The novelist is described as "struggling against the current of commercial expectations" in backstory, but no publisher, deadline, or competing choice appears in the present scene. No reversal, tightening, or choice narrows options; the protagonist observes mist and recounts prior experiences without agency. The final smile declares resolution of a conflict never dramatized, violating the requirement for one meaningful pressure point with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices before the harvest moon—is signaled early but never tightened. Elara faces no obstacles: the vine reveals visions, the elders provide fragments, the device works, the villagers remember. No reversal, no forced trade-off, no visible price. The climax is a montage of success without friction. The final paragraph asserts that "her work was complete" but no live option was foreclosed and no cost landed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.1)
    Dominant stake (translate heartbeats into maps to guide humanity) is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or complication appears; the alchemist arranges items, reaches for flash-paper, places it, and succeeds. "One misstep, one moment of impatience, and the starlight would dissipate" warns of cost but no impatience or misstep materializes. The pattern completes without friction, and the transformation simply occurs. Resolution is delivered by the mechanism (flash-paper seals starlight) rather than protagonist agency; luck and declared purpose replace earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the timer—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or trade-off appears; Elara studies, understands, and succeeds in linear sequence. The "wounded season" lull offers no clock pressure or forced choice. Agency is observation rather than decision; the mechanism "awakens" without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—collecting burdens—is signaled early but never tightens. Each burden calcifies without complication; the weaver's internal shift from trapped to connected is declared rather than forced by a trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The accumulative lens requires a meaningful deepening or cadence shift, but the final paragraph simply restates the opening premise without reweighting it through visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is Clara's method of holding her husband's memory—clear and signaled early. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: her shift from "tentative" first cut to placing the finished form among a menagerie, crystallizing her ongoing practice. However, escalation lacks a visible price or foreclosed option; nothing in the scene tests whether this method costs her something live. The kettle's five-minute frame is declared but never tightens her choices. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should reweight options or reveal cost; here the ending arrives as continuation rather than crystallization of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with his ghost to resolve "eroded ambitions"—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure does not escalate meaningfully: Cyrus searches, finds the wheel, approaches the lagoon, and the ghost accepts his offering without friction or reversal. No on-page tightening narrows options or raises cost. The wheel's activation and the bridge of words feel like solutions that arrive on cue rather than earned turns. The ending asserts peace and "new beginnings" without showing what Cyrus gave up or how his agency shaped the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—can Maya restore power and find hope—is signaled but never genuinely threatened. She works with "careful precision" and "absolute focus," throws the switch, and after a perfunctory pause the lights flicker on. No failed attempt, no visible resource cost, no trade-off between competing needs. The sextant discovery and power restoration are sequential additions rather than escalating pressure that narrows options. The coincidental inscription reveal at the end ("coordinates and equations that seemed to speak directly to her project") undercuts earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when Elias places the sealed watch before the crystals, a renunciation that opens possibility. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is gentle; the pressure accumulates through atmosphere rather than through choices that narrow options or force trade-offs with visible cost. The bear and crystals complicate symbolically but do not test commitment or create a loss that alters later tactics. Agency is more contemplative than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through layered discovery (approaching the barge, finding the journal, deciphering entries) but lacks a sharp reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara's agency at closure is primarily realization and commitment rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost. The piece offers one meaningful deepening (journal → understanding → future mission) but the cost of that stance remains abstract, not dramatized in a tangible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—is signaled early and held. The piece attempts one tightening: the fisherman's acknowledgment and gift. Yet the escalation is declarative, not pressure-driven: the collector sits silently, and the fisherman volunteers the answer without the protagonist forcing a choice or trade. No live option is narrowed; the collector risks nothing and loses nothing on the page. The "hours" of contemplation occur off-stage in summary, so the reader cannot witness the work that earns the breakthrough. Under Accumulative lens, a single deepening is sufficient, but the cost must be legible—here, it remains conceptual and asserted ("just beginning") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding healing through writing obituaries—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the traveler sits, reflects, writes. The shift to writing his own obituary is a thematic deepening rather than a decision with visible cost. Agency is attention and endurance, but no path is foreclosed with legible price. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one cadence shift is present but cost clarity is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and sustained. The assembly → activation sequence provides one meaningful tightening when the transformations begin, then reverse, forcing Elorian to his knees. Yet the reversal is passive (the egg's light "began to fade" without resistance from the protagonist) and the price paid is interior disappointment rather than a forfeited resource or foreclosed tactic. "Determination replacing despair" names a new resolve but does not narrow options or trade away a live alternative. The escalation reads as a single rise-and-fall arc rather than pressure driven by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the grafts—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens. Maya wraps the plants, shields them, and they survive; no live option is foreclosed and no visible price is paid. The fire's advance and the cloud migration create atmospheric tension but do not force a trade-off or alter her tactics. Agency is present (she acts) but her decisions do not narrow options or incur cost, so escalation under any lens is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (liberate trapped memories) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens. Elara follows breadcrumbs without detour, finds the box, and releases memories through ritual words—no reversal or choice that forecloses a path. The "sidereal patience" and three-day journey suggest escalation, but on-page she completes each step without friction. Coincidence is high: the window becomes the box at her touch, and the dissolution feels automatic. No visible price is paid; the fountains flow and Elara smiles, concluding with gain rather than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.6)
    One dominant stake is declared early (illuminate without consuming), but it never faces concrete on-page resistance or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the being initiates transit, completes it successfully, shares light, and returns. The civilization's potential "fear of illumination's consuming fire" is told but not dramatized; their acceptance arrives without friction. The story loops through preparation → transit → delivery → return without escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs: Elias prepares, walks, recalls, carves, and succeeds without a complication that forces a trade-off. The spectral mentor approves, butterflies guide, and villagers arrive—all support rather than opposition. "Days passed with the measured pace" compresses the carving into summary, and the monument's completion is told ("rumors of its power") rather than shown with a visible cost. Pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring the clock and community trust—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Alaric reads inscriptions, realizes he needs help, calls for it, and receives it without negotiation or refusal. No tightening forecloses a live option; the townsfolk's immediate cooperation removes the friction that would test his commitment. The woman who "first criticized Alaric's neglect now stood beside him" represents a reversal, but it happens off-page between her prior criticism and her present assistance. The closure image—pendulum swinging, bells ringing—delivers thematic satisfaction but lacks a visible price paid in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tapestry's echoes to discover buried intentions—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when "the uncharted echoes grew stronger now" and one reversal in the discovery ("sacrificial rather than romantic, a deliberate exchange of one life for another"). However, the reversal lands as intellectual surprise without altering Elias's tactics or foreclosing a live option; he processes the revelation, returns the tapestry to the case, and resets the clock for next month with no visible cost or constraint. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation should deepen or reweight the stake with felt cost; here the discovery broadens into abstraction ("love...was the most persistent echo") rather than tightening pressure. Agency is present in the act of untangling threads, but the outcome does not force a trade-off or meaningful endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—warning villagers of the thaw—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal, no competing pressure, no moment where the map might fail or demand a trade-off. Elara faces no meaningful obstacle; her past accuracy is summarized, her current task proceeds without friction, and the ending pronounces success without demonstrating escalation or cost. The piece operates as a procession of affirmations rather than a conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—evading the Narrative Control Bureau—is declared but never tested on the page; no authority figure appears, no detection risk materializes, no tactic shifts under pressure. The story presents a single uncomplicated broadcast with no reversal, complication, or cost. The second half abandons present action entirely for backstory summary, flattening all pressure. No agency is demonstrated beyond routine execution of a nightly task; the ending asserts "every risk worthwhile" without showing a single risk paid.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"crystallizing fleeting emotions"—is declared but never tested on the page. No live opposition, no choice where Elena must trade one value for another. The rocking chair's cessation is presented as catalyst, yet Elena simply continues her work without visible friction. The final "understanding" is told, not earned by prior tightening. Pressure remains static from open to close.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preservation against erasure—is signaled early but remains abstract and uncontested on the page. No antagonist pressure materializes: the Council "would soon be discussing" destruction, but this looming threat never intersects Milo's present action. The cog discovery does not force a trade-off or escalate cost; he simply pockets it and continues his work. The final decision to preserve carries no visible price—no renunciation, no tactical shift, no path foreclosed—leaving escalation flat and stakes declared rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts—is declared early but never tested with a visible cost. No on-page reversal narrows Eleanor's options; the choir's progress is summarized in transit phrases ("through months," "by spring"). The final baton-passing is coincidental convenience, not a choice forced by prior pressure. Agency is absent: Eleanor teaches and the world changes around her with no trade-off or foreclosed path visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—planting the knowledge fruit seed as gentle rebellion—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page obstacle or cost appears; Elias prepares, reflects, and plants without friction. Pruning overgrown matter reads as symbolic preparation, not a choice that narrows options. The ending asserts transformation ("relationship with food was about to be transformed") without dramatizing a visible price paid or path foreclosed. Pressure remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city's mechanical ecosystem—is clear, but Elara's role is passive: she provides the keycard and exposition while the bureau couple drives the investigation. The "riddle" is read aloud and immediately solved without testing commitment or narrowing options. The climax (finding the supervisor) unfolds through revelation rather than protagonist choice, and no visible cost or trade-off accompanies Elara's decision to help. Pressure is declared (sabotage, melancholy, despair) but not escalated through on-page resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but never tested. Aria's three mornings of placement face no resistance, complication, or reversal. The climax is an automatic glow and revelation, not a decision or renunciation that forecloses a path. The "understanding" changes her knowledge but not her behavior: she continues her walks unchanged, offering no visible cost or trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break; instead, the piece loops her ritual without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding the city's fall) is signaled early but remains abstract. No meaningful tightening occurs: the diver descends, receives exposition, watches visions, and accepts the lesson without a single reversal or trade-off. The statue's telepathic delivery bypasses all friction. Agency is absent—the diver makes no decision that forecloses a path or costs anything on the page. The "cascading revelations" are narrated summary, not pressure-tested beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—escape from purgatory—is clear, but escalation consists of repetition: he climbs, rolls dice, works equations, climbs more. No meaningful tightening occurs until the final paragraph when the "final sequence" conveniently succeeds without a visible trade-off or failed prior attempt. The protagonist's agency at closure (placing the chipped die "precisely where his calculations indicated") is assertion rather than demonstrated choice under pressure. Cost is declared ("grim optimism finally justified") but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—proving universal kindness through lost languages—is declared but never tested by an obstacle, doubt, or competing pressure. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows the painter's options; she paints methodically from intention to completion without friction. The ending claims vindication "before anyone even saw her work," dissolving the stated goal with no dramatized cost or consequence. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces the guide to trade one art for another or sacrifice a tool. The mid-story tightening (guide offers the lens) is a gift, not a costly decision. The thaw begins because the lens "reveals" latent energy, a coincidental resolution that undercuts protagonist agency. Khira's singing and the spreading warmth register as atmospheric payoff rather than escalation driven by her renunciation or the guide's forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—solving the yoyo puzzle before the tide returns—is signaled early. Yet pressure remains static: Esme's "initial attempts" are mentioned in summary, then a "sudden realization" arrives without earned causality or visible failed moves. No meaningful tightening occurs; the mechanism clicks into place without a trade-off or foreclosed option. The tide's return is noted in the final line but never threatens to interrupt her work, so the time constraint imposes no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"transform relationship with death"—is declared in exposition rather than tested in scene. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: the protagonist enters the funhouse, reads paradoxes, touches the clasp, and emerges enlightened without cost or resistance. The whispering advisor offers no opposition, the mirrors pose no dilemma, and the "fear's weakness" is revealed through passive observation. Under the inferred Causal lens escalation requires a because/therefore tightening; here each beat is additive (and-then) with no foreclosed path or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.1)
    The stated stake—interpreting weather to protect the community—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening. The violent storm "diverted, skirting the edges" without resistance, negotiation, or cost. No agency choice narrows options; the prophet's success is assured from the outset. The piece remains in one pressure state from blue hour to dawn without escalation or a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering his father's fate—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is weak: Kael blows the whistle without resistance, descends without obstacle, and accepts his new role without visible trade-off. The "terrible truth" is delivered via journal rather than tested choice, and the final stance (maintaining the barrier) doesn't foreclose a live option with on-page cost. One tightening occurs (the crack/revelation) but lacks protagonist agency or felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (rescue truth from noble lies) is signaled early but never tightens or deepens with meaningful cost. Eleanor encounters no opposition, no reversal, no trade-off—she methodically finds exactly what she seeks without friction. The ledger's discovery is fortuitous rather than earned by a choice that narrows options. Escalation is absent; the piece reads as a successful scavenger hunt rather than a conflict where pressure forces a stance crystallization or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion and excavating emotional history—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through opposition. The box retrieval is the lone reversal candidate, yet it yields cooperative memories rather than a dilemma or trade-off. No persistent constraint (time, resource, rival claim) forces the protagonist to alter tactics, and the ending recapitulates his opening intent without escalation. Pressure remains static, and closure cost is imperceptible: he adds a note and leaves, exactly as he arrived, with no path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—tracing text origins—shifts mid-story to personal heritage without a turn that narrows options. Elias encounters no resistance: scrolls appear when needed, his hypothesis "becomes undeniable truth" without counter-evidence, and the blackout lifts on cue. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; discoveries accumulate without forcing a choice that forecloses a path or pays visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into a lantern and releasing it—is signaled early but never tested. The protagonist encounters no obstacle, decision point, or cost; he completes each step as planned. The "paradoxical descent while ascending" is thematic mood rather than a pressure that narrows options. No reversal, escalation, or on-page tightening appears; the piece reads as a sequence of fulfillment beats without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, the central action (placing the geode in the pool) proceeds without resistance or cost; the crystal simply absorbs the energy and transforms. No reversal tests commitment, no tactic shifts under pressure. The ending declares future hunts rather than dramatizing a trade-off or price paid in this one. Coincidence (the overload timing) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    A single dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and one meaningful tightening occurs when the Nightingale reaches convergence and Maya activates the pull sequence. Yet the escalation lacks visible cost: the "unexpected variables" alert produces a moment of surprise but no tactical sacrifice, and the resolution depends on the observatory recognizing the drone rather than Maya forfeiting a live option. Coincidence (the chip's missing pieces becoming "irrelevant," the structure responding as if meeting "an old friend") resolves pressure rather than Maya's agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—Martin's need to reconcile his erasure of family history—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when he discovers his grandfather's carving with his own initials, narrowing options from abstract guilt to concrete reconciliation. However, the escalation relies on object discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure. The resolution is emotionally clear but the cost (closing his business) is declared for tomorrow rather than paid on the page, softening the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing a prisoner whose past saved Lyra's father—is declared but never tested on the page; no counter-offer, refusal, or complication materializes. The only on-page move is the exchange of the drawer pull and the apology/forgiveness script, which feels ceremonial rather than escalatory. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or raises cost; Rennett's shoulders simply "relaxed for the first time" without visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Agency is absent; the resolution is granted rather than earned by protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elena's reckoning with past failure and path toward self-forgiveness—is signaled early. The withdrawn job offer provides one tightening that forecloses an option, and the dolphins scene shifts her stance. However, the escalation lacks a visible price; the resolution feels gifted by the dolphins rather than forced by protagonist agency under pressure. No tactical constraint or trade-off shapes the final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—kindling empathy in a fractured society—is declared but never tested through on-page reversals or tightening. The protagonist faces four tunnels yet the choice is presented as already decided: "I took the leftmost tunnel, guided by the symbol." No visible cost, no trade-off, no narrowing of options. The younger-self encounter resolves instantly without friction: the loop is explained and accepted, the ball signed, the cycle continued. Coincidence (the ball arriving, the coordinates matching) drives the plot forward; protagonist agency is passive reception rather than decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (see brother once more) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The ritual sequence provides a single escalation beat (mixing spices → metamorphosis → conjure), but no reversal or complication tests commitment: the summoning succeeds on first attempt without cost paid during the attempt itself. The brother's advice ("you must be the one to walk through them now") gestures toward future stakes but does not alter on-page options. Pressure is linear accumulation rather than tightening, and the "connection began to fade" at zenith feels time-driven rather than choice-driven, reducing agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off. The cartomancer's journey proceeds without meaningful reversal; she arrives, performs a ritual, and receives the answer without narrowing options or paying a visible price. The "repentance" and vow to be present are asserted rather than dramatized as a choice that forecloses an alternative path. No escalation under any lens—pressure remains static as the narrative delivers thematic wisdom without dramatized consequence or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Eli prepares, begins stitching, and succeeds without on-page resistance, error, or trade-off. "One wrong stitch could collapse the delicate dimensional bridge" declares danger but never tests it. The sequence is presented as a series of completions rather than a tightening that narrows options. No reversal or visible price alters tactics; joy and success arrive together without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is declared but never tested by a live on-page choice that forecloses an alternative path. Ian's detour costs him nothing; the prophecy mechanism hands him exactly what he seeks without requiring renunciation or trade-off. The village girl's appearance is coincidental rather than earned by Ian's prior decisions, and the release of one lightning bug lacks weight because we've seen no attachment or dependency that would make letting go difficult. No escalation narrows options or raises felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transmitting coordinates for a revolutionary gathering—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or cost appears: Elias completes the sundial without obstacle, the blackout ends on schedule, and the message is delivered. The Keeper's meeting and cautionary words ("we cannot force this revolution") are exposition rather than pressure. Agency is absent; Elias performs a predetermined task with no choice that narrows options or exacts visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns to prevent cosmic unraveling—is signaled early but never tightened by on-page resistance or cost. The ritual proceeds without impediment; the eels cooperate, the star dust responds, and the revelation arrives as reward rather than earned turn. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception rather than a decision under pressure that narrows her world.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake (to write forbidden poetry and understand the "cartography of scars") is declared but never tested by a choice with visible cost. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the poet ascends, arranges materials, writes, and descends without opposition or trade-off. The storm's "brief window" when "masks slip" introduces a time constraint that never shapes tactics. The darkroom timer beeps twice but does not impose consequence or alter the poet's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the hidden overture—is signaled early but resolves at midpoint with minimal cost (Aris simply records coordinates). The secondary engagement (teaching the student) introduces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; the student poses questions, Aris answers, comprehension follows. No reversal or tightening narrows options in the final third. Agency is present in the decoding and teaching choices, but neither forecloses a path or imposes visible cost. The symposium remains off-page, eliminating potential pressure from the waiting frame.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake ("rebuild this knowledge sanctuary") is signaled early but never tested. The poet encounters no opposition, dilemma, or resource limit; he simply performs a series of symbolic gestures (scattering seeds, stacking books) without a tightening choice or reversal. The closure image restates his mission rather than altering options or imposing cost. No agency, renunciation, or endurance forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding refuge from time to reconnect with his daughter—is signaled early, and the system shutdown deadline creates a ticking clock. However, escalation is minimal: the protagonist encounters no meaningful obstacles (memorized paths, pre-modified projector, granted access) and makes no trade-offs. The "flickering compasses" complicate navigation for others but never impede the pianist on-page. The final act—stepping into light—occurs without visible cost or resistance; the story promises future consequence ("when he returned") rather than delivering it in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the monsoon—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seed's growing vibrations and the approaching rainstorm, but no on-page reversal or meaningful tightening narrows Elara's options. She executes her plan without obstacle: finds the waterfall, enters the cave, places the seed, sings; ancestral voices arrive on cue. The monsoon's first drops fall as she emerges, but this coincidental timing does not test her agency or impose a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (finding the color of unspoken apologies) is signaled early. The compass's shift from wild spinning to rhythmically placid sweeps, then pointing at his heart, constitutes a single tightening, sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is passive observation and monologue; the compass and lace drive the sequence, not his choices. The confession "I never told her..." is spoken to an empty room without on-page consequence, and the final whisper of his brother's name lacks visible cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (finding unused love) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency via breathing changes, narrowing options under a hybrid lens. Cost is legible as the tear dissolves and healing completes, but escalation relies more on internal deepening than external pressure, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by Kael's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in his cancer and emotional journey. The dominant stake of capturing trust breaking tightens through his attempts, but the shift to trust reforming feels slightly abrupt, though earned.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (internal thawing and creation) escalates through accumulative density, driven by Elias's agency in glassblowing. Cost is unmistakable in the release of grief, and pressure coheres under the lens, though escalation is subtle rather than sharply causal.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Maya's agency under causal lens: decrypting notes forces confrontation, narrowing options. Dominant stake (survival/truth) tightens with ticking clock and approaching footsteps. Cost is unmistakable in fear and danger, though the organization remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the oracle's agency as the star flickers and vanishes, forcing her to redefine her role with cost legible in her renunciation of prevention. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (self-discovery) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens: curiosity leads to touch, data stream, and amalgamation, with cost legible in the surrender of logical limits. One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of mere service, reweighting options toward conscious evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes around thawing mistrust escalate through Elara's agency, from discovering the lens to renouncing it and initiating communication. Cost is legible in her foregone power, but conflict is internal and resolved neatly, lacking strong opposition or persistent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) is signaled early, and escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, such as placing marbles and preparing for scientists. Cost is legible in his aging and the garden's cycles, but the escalation lacks a sharp tightening or foreclosed option, limiting higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (proving time moves sideways) escalates through Aris's lever actions, which narrow options and change knowledge under the causal lens; cost is legible in the multidimensional connection with the bird.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are signaled early (unraveling the ghost's code), and escalation is driven by Elias's agency to play the piano, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the program's dissolution and reconfigured silence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of finding the swallowed truth is signaled early and escalates through Elias's agency—smudging the illustration reveals coordinates, leading to cave preparation. Under the causal lens, pressure tightens with each discovery, foreclosing options and imposing cost as sorrow becomes "burden and purpose." The escalation is driven by protagonist choices with unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, as the radio confession and valve wheel interaction tighten stakes and lead to a cost-legible realization. The dominant stake of finding the truth deepens meaningfully, though the conflict resolution relies slightly on external revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs through a cadence shift into the anomalous silence, driven by the keeper's agency in burrowing and resisting stasis. The dominant stake—witnessing vs. preservation—tightens with a visible cost: the keeper's frayed edges are healed but foreclose passive absorption. One meaningful deepening reweights options without multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of helping Lila find her voice escalates under the accumulative lens through the eclipse event, driven by Maya's agency. The cost is legible in Lila's emotional breakthrough, and the tightening forecloses options with visible price. Pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and escalate through the historian's agency in probing discoveries, deepening understanding under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the lost connection to dreams, but pressure remains low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake of shifting human perception escalates through the writer's agency in crafting fortunes; cost is legible in the responses reviewed, and one meaningful tightening occurs as ripples become waves.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake in conducting unheard symphonies escalates through memory mapping and exhaustion, driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his collapse, though the internal conflict lacks a sharp tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the causal lens, as his use of the tablet narrows options and deepens stakes through timeline exploration.

    Dominant stake (villagers' survival) is signaled early and escalates through the cracking ice, tightening options under the causal lens. Elara's agency drives the escalation via predictive modeling, with cost legible in the need to adapt routes. However, the escalation relies slightly on summary rather than fully dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with the storm as a tightening that forces her musical intervention, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) escalates under the accumulative lens through Elena's agency (dolphin encounter triggering release). Cost is legible in the burden's release, though escalation is subtle rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes to kindle empathy escalate through protagonist's agency in decoding clues and choosing tunnels, with cost legible in the endless loop. Under the Hybrid lens, pressure tightens meaningfully, but the abstract stake slightly limits visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)

The sequence tightens options, leading to a reconfiguration with cost in her risk and transformation. Pressure coheres, though escalation is more gradual than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs through density increase in the storm and her resolve, driven by her agency to write. The cost is legible in the risk of rebellion, and the stake of free expression tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Conflict escalates through Aris's agency in decoding and intellectual fencing, tightening stakes from personal quest to teaching. Cost is legible in the revelation and student's growth, but the escalation lacks a major reversal, capping the score. Dominant stake in decoding is well-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are primarily internal and thematic—how she will orient her life and vocation after the flood. The dominant stake (strip away drama, find what matters) is articulated but meets little on-page opposition; colleagues’ misunderstandings are reported rather than dramatized. There is some escalation in her deepening commitment to the greenhouse, culminating in “her true calling,” but this reads more like a steady slide than a pressured decision. As a result, tension is gentle and static rather than meaningfully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding why she was targeted and what to do next—is clear, but pressure in the present scene is mostly introspective and low-intensity. The main escalation is cognitive: deciphering the frost patterns to connect her art to illegal mining, which does reweight her situation. However, the realization feels relatively unopposed and convenient, with no on-page pushback or real-time risk. Her final decision to return and expose the conspiracy is significant but not tightly tested or burdened within the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can “rectify the great wrong of silence” by creating a new music—is clear but almost entirely unopposed. Once she begins, every step goes smoothly; there’s no credible risk of failure, no external obstacle, and barely any internal hesitation. The main “tightening” is her realization that nature’s resilience yields complex patterns, but this is framed as graceful discovery, not a pressured turn that forecloses options. As a result, conflict remains largely conceptual, and stakes never feel viscerally in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to find a meaningful, enduring relationship to death and rest—is signaled early and conceptually resolved at the end. There is a clear deepening when he recognizes he’s meant to restore the library, and his action does transform the situation. However, declared external stakes (dangerous currents, guarding ghosts, knowledge “never meant for living minds”) never exert real pressure, so tension plateaus rather than escalates. Without on-page resistance, his agency feels under-tested and the price of his new role remains largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether this exile community can resist sanctions and maintain mutual support—is clear from early on, with the tightening at the “eastern checkpoint” and the bad news from the northern settlement serving as escalation. However, the pressure mostly operates at a conceptual level; we are told food is scarce and sanctions worsen, but no on-page dilemma forces Elias to trade one concrete harm against another. His climactic choice to expand the runs feels morally obvious and unopposed, with little sense of genuine risk or competing priorities in the moment. As a result, tension simmers rather than bites, limiting the conflict score.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will discover what happens to unused love and find healing—is clear but remains mostly internal and abstract. Conflict is almost entirely one-sided: the world and the miracle object cooperate with her desire rather than resisting it, so escalation is more a gentle deepening than a tightening of pressure. Her breathing choice is an action, yet it faces no meaningful alternative or risk, and the later healer work unfolds without friction. As a result, the resolution feels serene rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—gaining transcendent understanding of time at the risk of losing self and present reality—is present and escalates from vision-like episodes to physical disintegration. Yet conflict is mostly internal and underdeveloped: Elara rarely hesitates or weighs costs, and the repeated returns to the fragment lack on-page struggle. The “quaking reverie” intensifies, but pressure doesn’t force a sharp trade-off so much as glide into foregone surrender. As a result, tension is interesting but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake—retrieving seeds before demolition—appears early and is coherent throughout. There is a recognizable tightening when the demolition crew arrives early, forcing Elara to rush her escape. Yet she faces no substantive reversal or difficult tradeoff; once she solves the puzzle, her escape and success are nearly unimpeded. The conflict resolves without a felt price beyond the loss of “remaining seeds” we never see her seriously consider trying to save.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is clear, but opposition and cost are largely abstract. Kael has already “believed he had captured it” before the narrative proper really tightens, so the piece skips the most critical test of his goal and jumps to aftermath and reflection. The cancer and the danger of misuse are gestured at rather than turned into fraught decisions or trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than genuine pressure that forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Lillian’s need to decode her destiny through this final heist—is established, and there is a nominal time pressure from the fleeting golden hour. Yet the external conflict is soft: the stationmaster poses almost no real threat, and the theft occurs without setback or close call, so escalation is minimal. Internally, the “criminal vs historian” tension only crystallizes after success is assured, so we never see her desire challenged by meaningful risk. The ending reconfigures meaning but without a strong sense of price paid or options foreclosed in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant conflict—Elias’s grief and blocked inspiration versus his desire to create “safe zones for inquiry”—is clear but faces little real resistance. There is thematic deepening as he moves from abandoned studio to active creation, and the shift from dramatic narration to quiet presence is a meaningful, if soft, turn. However, escalation is more iterative than pressurized; we don’t see a moment where continuing costs him something or where a credible alternative (giving up, leaving) is strongly in play. As a result, tension is steady but low, and the price of “thawing” feels largely asserted rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—survive The Production and reach the truth/mother—are clear and emotionally loaded, and the ticking clock toward midnight provides some structural pressure. Internal conflict between paralyzing phobia and chosen vulnerability interweaves well with the external hunt. Escalation, however, is mostly rhetorical: we are told the danger and her need to outwit them, but no concrete adversarial exchange or forced trade-off occurs on the page before the final poised moment. The result is tension that feels promised more than fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to face an endless night that engulfs the world—is clearly signaled, and it tightens when the last star flickers and then vanishes. The main escalation is internal: she shifts from trying to “capture” the ambered hush to embracing it as the medium of a survival map. That turn is meaningful but relatively low-friction because no alternative tactic is actively tested or lost on the page. The cost of not preventing the night is implied more than viscerally felt, keeping tension more meditative than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—protocol and programmatic obedience versus the drive for self-knowledge—is clear and tightened by the discovery that the violin is dangerous and transformative. Escalation occurs through the visions of alternate timelines and culminates in the conscious decision to surrender to amalgamation. However, the potential costs (program failure, loss of self, physical or temporal damage) remain mostly abstract and untested in concrete on-page consequences. This keeps the stakes more philosophical than viscerally pressured, limiting the sense of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—how to handle the power to see others’ private truths in a mistrustful, silent society—is conceptually strong but never truly pressured. There’s no antagonist or counterforce beyond a lightly sketched internal ethic, and she encounters no resistance finding or using the lens and the chamber. The ethical dilemma resolves quickly and cleanly, with no real sense of sacrifice or risk in her renunciation. As a result, conflict feels more discussed than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the garden–gardener bond can resist reduction to measurable luck—is clear but mostly conceptual. Conflict is largely anticipatory: the Institute’s scientists are mentioned as an impending challenge, yet they never appear, and the garden never misbehaves or resists him in a way that tests his belief. Elias’s “choice” at the end is essentially to continue as he has, with no live alternative tactic or costed trade-off dramatized on the page. As a result, pressure doesn’t truly tighten; it gently accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are stated as potentially transformative for science and communication, but on the page Aris encounters no real opposition, risk, or ethical dilemma. Each lever does exactly what she intends; there is no moment where she might harm the bird, lose the data, or be discovered, so pressure never tightens. The dominant stake—proving her theory—never faces a credible chance of failure. As a result, tension remains low and the ending reads as confirmation rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the ghost’s unfinished performance and possibly freeing her—is clear, but very little true pressure is applied to it. Once Elias interprets the stained program as music, he simply proceeds to the piano and plays without serious opposition, risk, or tradeoff. The “disrupt the silence” decision feels framed as pivotal, yet carries no on-page danger, moral ambiguity, or cost that might make it a fraught choice. As a result, escalation is more a smooth lyrical build than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and returning the swallowed truth—is clear and escalates through the investigative sequence of smudging margins and assembling the map. Internal and external conflict are mostly aligned, with pressure coming from his physical frailty, burden of sorrow, and the eerie knowledge of what he carries. However, there’s little direct resistance or hard trade-off; no major option is truly foreclosed beyond a general sense of compulsion. The ending frames a decisive move but doesn’t yet stage a concrete price or moral calculus, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s need to unearth a buried truth and test his skepticism—stays mostly internal and abstract, with little external opposition or consequence. There is a clear intensification when the radio caller confesses and the wheel warms, but the escalation feels safe: Marcus never faces a real dilemma, danger, or loss that would sharpen his choice. The “factory ghost shift” intrigue is resolved into a thematic explanation rather than a conflict that demands action. As a result, tension is modest and doesn’t significantly narrow his options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the keeper will be preserved by the regenerative silence or continue witnessing decay—is conceptually strong but only lightly pressured in scene. Escalation is primarily informational (discovering the anomaly, then its nature) rather than confrontational; there’s no concrete moment where staying would have a sharply articulated cost or benefit beyond summary. The keeper’s decision to leave feels consistent but not hard-won. As a result, tension remains quiet and never quite tightens into a palpable dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—can Maya reach Lila and coax speech—is well signaled and the eclipse window creates a natural time pressure. Escalation tracks from months of failed attempts to this charged, finite celestial event and the intensifying duet on ridge-top. However, external or internal resistance remains relatively low; there’s little genuine risk that the scene will fail, so tension is more gentle than gripping. The cost is primarily emotional vulnerability rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and preserving a crucial myth that may relate to the world’s broken axis—is conceptually large but never becomes felt pressure on the page. Discoveries come without resistance, there’s no real risk of failure or loss, and no alternative path is foreclosed. The historian’s agency amounts to careful attention and recording, but these acts are never tested or made costly. As a result, tension remains low and escalation is mostly intellectual rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is effectively no on-page opposition or real risk; everything described is already in place and functioning as intended. The only hint of tension—his earlier fear of his prophetic gift—is entirely retrospective and resolved off-stage. Stakes (shifting humanity’s perception) are grand but completely abstract, never tested by a concrete obstacle or hard trade-off. Without escalation or a felt price, the story reads as static exposition of a status quo mission.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are signaled early and clearly—save Sarah before the possession completes—and the pressure coherently builds through layered loops, the entity’s reactions, and the paradox question that destabilizes it. The main escalation beats (chant layering, entity confusion, paradox, final silence) are well-sequenced and protagonist-driven. However, the entity never poses a reversal or serious threat beyond standard writhing and distorted speech; Father Michael’s plan works almost too smoothly. The absence of a tangible setback or visible personal cost keeps the conflict from reaching a higher band of intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transmute his childhood memories into a one-time, unheard symphony before exhaustion—exists and is legible. Escalation is mainly internal and sensory: memories deepen, the shell glows, vibrations spread, and fatigue tightens the window. However, opposition is diffuse (only tiredness) and there’s no sharp turn where a genuinely viable option is foreclosed; he simply pushes through until he drops. The cost is present but muted, which keeps tension from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering the truth about his nature and whether he is “broken” or not—is established early and returns at the chamber of selves. There is one meaningful deepening when the timelines converge and he confronts multiple versions of himself, which should be the true crucible. However, there’s little resistance or risk built into his passage; nothing in the fracture meaningfully threatens to trap, damage, or mislead him, so pressure doesn’t clearly tighten. As a result, the final stance shift feels earned conceptually more than through escalating on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming emotional numbness—is clear, but opposition is diffuse and mostly internal. Once the backward-record gimmick appears, almost everything works; there’s little on-page resistance, failure, or doubt to escalate pressure. The move from private solace to public teaching is a conceptual deepening, but it doesn’t feel contested or costly. As a result, tension stays low and the resolution, though coherent, reads as relatively untested wish-fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—exposing a weather-manipulation conspiracy that underpins authoritarian control—is clear and high. There is one main tightening: the discovery and reading of the message tube reweight his existing suspicions into actionable proof, pushing him toward a decision. Yet on-page pressure remains abstract: the watchers and authorities never actively press him in-scene, so the choice to send the pigeon feels relatively unopposed. The lack of a concrete on-page test of danger caps the tension and the felt cost of his action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to be ruled by unprocessed grief or move toward a livable relationship with memory—is signaled early and pays off. Escalation comes via the layering of ever more personal scent-memories (childhood garden, wedding, funeral), which deepen the emotional cost. However, pressure is relatively low: there are few moments where his choices feel contested or where an alternative path (e.g., turning off the lantern, fleeing) is dramatized rather than only implied. The clock of the orchid’s transformation and midnight chime add texture more than genuinely narrowing his options.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—how to respond to the energy beings’ alteration of time, resistance vs acceptance—remains almost entirely conceptual and never forces a concrete, consequential decision. Pressure rises only mildly as the rope pattern grows in complexity; there’s no meaningful narrowing of options or visible sacrifice. The poet’s final stance (time as landscape, new territories) is an internal adjustment rather than a hard-won choice. As a result, there is tension of idea, but little felt stake or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the post-catastrophe hush is deadness or latent music—remains largely internal and philosophical, with little concrete pressure testing Kael’s stance. Escalation is gentle: we move from practice, to family stories, to a single performance that reframes the hush, but there’s no strong opposition, risk, or narrowing of options. His choice to play with the bowl at his feet functions as the tightening beat, yet it doesn’t foreclose a meaningful alternative or entail visible loss. The result is thematically coherent but dramatically mild.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are implied—altering a client’s emotional reality—but remain largely abstract and untested in scene. The process unfolds smoothly with no real opposition, moral pinch point, or risk that the transformation will harm or fail the client. Elias’s “most critical part” (subsume the last remnants) is asserted as high-stakes, yet no concrete threat, resistance, or cost surfaces. Consequently, tension plateaus and never meaningfully escalates, undercutting narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain very low throughout: Elias wants to help, Eleanor is mildly surprised but soon receptive, and every step (meeting, coffee, sponsorship, collaboration) unfolds without real opposition or risk. The dominant stake—whether this “cycle of compassion” actually costs anyone anything—never sharpens into a trade-off or loss. There is a modest internal tension in Elias initiating a non-transactional friendship, but it’s quickly rewarded rather than tested. As a result, escalation is more a gentle accumulation of good outcomes than pressured change.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—belonging versus isolation—is established early and tightened via the dangerous, logistically complex search for the sigil. Elara’s agency drives the turn from passive ache to collective quest, and later to ritual dedication, but the external danger (treacherous crater, vanishing tag) never quite bites; there are no concrete setbacks or hard trade-offs on the page. The key escalation is conceptual rather than peril-driven: learning the tag’s true nature shifts their understanding of themselves within the place. As a result, tension feels gentle and contemplative rather than sharply pressurized, which is thematically apt but limits stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restore the world’s natural rhythm before the giant’s dream alters reality—is declared early and coherently escalates through his increasing time-borrowing and the giant’s approaching wakefulness. Pressure tightens effectively at the chamber when the giant begins to wake mid-act and he must overdraw from his own future to succeed. The external conflict is strong, but internal or moral tension (e.g., how much future is he willing to lose, what else he’s sacrificing) remains only implied, which keeps the climax from feeling as harrowing as it could. Still, the resolution clearly arises from his agency and carries a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mentor’s fate and the “mathematics of emotion”—is clearly stated but not sharply pressured. Escalation is mainly a soft deepening: the orchard quiets, the ritual proceeds, the eyes finally show a fragmentary vision and the patterns rearrange. There’s little sense that failure tonight carries a specific cost beyond continuation of the status quo, and Elara never faces a concrete trade-off or foreclosed path. As a result, tension feels meditative rather than urgent, capping conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—being usefully “visible” while remaining hidden—is intriguing but stays abstract and low-pressure. The discovery of the tape fragment is the one clear tightening: now they have something that can materially help the failing system. However, there’s little external or internal pushback, and no meaningful alternative path seriously considered, so the tension never quite sharpens into a true dilemma. The final plan feels like a continuation of habit rather than a pressured escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Elara’s need for control versus the plants’ apparent need for autonomy—is clear and escalates via increasingly intense storms and accumulating contradictory data. Stakes are primarily internal (her worldview, professional identity) with a concrete external accent (nursery health), and the decision to remove protections is a meaningful tightening that risks loss. However, the moment of choice is underplayed, reported instead of fully pressured on the page, so the emotional and tactical cost doesn’t bite as hard as it could. There are no major reversals beyond that single key decision, keeping the pressure curve solid but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can transform trauma and insomnia into a sustaining artistic purpose—is clear but lightly pressured. The main tightening is the moment of hesitation over trading the brooch, yet the conflict resolves quickly and without serious risk of refusal or loss beyond the symbolic. There’s an internal-external braid (personal rest vs. communal need for artists), but it remains more stated than dramatized. As a result, escalation feels gentle and accumulative rather than sharply testing her values.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to predictive control or embrace co-creative, unpredictable magic—is present but under-pressured. The escalation in the cave (shadows detaching, inhabiting crystals, music intensifying) raises atmospheric stakes, yet Elara never faces a concrete risk or trade-off where something meaningful might be lost. Her “gasp in understanding” and quick acceptance dampen tension rather than sharpen it. As a result, the conflict reads more as an elegant revelation than a true test of values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether fragmented histories can be reassembled to heal a community after exile—is clear but kept at a low temperature. The discovery and reinterpretation of the herald’s sacrifice constitute the main tightening, leading to a shift in the returnees’ emotional state, but there’s little sense of risk in Elina’s choice to share it; no one resists or complicates that move. Pressure doesn’t so much escalate as gently accumulate, with no real trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. The result is thematically satisfying but dramatically underpowered for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Ethan’s decision to accept or refuse the invitation into an impossible realm and its implied calling. There is one meaningful tightening when the fortress appears and the punch links to it, crystalizing that this is about truths rather than transit. Yet there is almost no real resistance—internal or external—to his progress: he never considers turning back, and the “hour that divides bad habits and new starts” doesn’t force a harsh trade-off, only an automatic end to the visit. As a result, conflict feels more like a guided initiation than a pressured struggle, keeping stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara keeps this connection private or opens it to others—is thematically clear but only gently pressured. The sole meaningful tightening is her “courageously kind decision” to invite others after seeing memories of solitude, yet this choice isn’t dramatized as a hard trade-off or shown to cost her much beyond mild social skepticism. Most beats are variations of discovery and deepening wonder, with little sense that she might genuinely choose otherwise or suffer loss. The story succeeds as a meditative piece but lacks the escalated conflict or palpable price that high-end venues typically demand.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—preventing a multiversal unraveling and answering a personal metaphysical question—are declared at scale but experienced mostly in the abstract. Pressure escalates in concept (storm intensifying, mutiny revealed, Elara’s connection uncovered), yet Alistair faces no meaningful resistance or trade-off on the page; once he decides to act, the path opens without friction. The choice to step through the portal and accept the quest does narrow his options, but the emotional and practical cost of that choice is scarcely dramatized. As a result, conflict feels more like a graceful slide into destiny than a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—Maya’s job and freedom versus Dr. Thorne’s life—are clearly stated and morally weighted. However, on-page conflict is minimal: there is no genuine obstacle, reversal, or close call during the breach; everything proceeds according to the plan she has already perfected. This keeps pressure from truly tightening, even though the conceptual risk is high. The internal and external conflicts align but don’t significantly test her resolve in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes—preserving lost or “invented” histories in a world that’s gone silent—are conceptually high but dramatically under-pressured on the page. The only real escalation is the temporal approach of dawn and the crescendo of the lamp’s hum, which Elias handles with complete mastery and no opposition. He never risks failure, doubt, or meaningful sacrifice in-scene. As a result, tension remains low and conflict feels largely implied rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core stake—whether and how a person erased by bureaucracy can reconstruct a self—is strong but largely static; it’s asserted and then restated with variations. The conflict is almost entirely internal and resolved through endurance/stance rather than decisive turning points. There is a mild deepening around the realization that the protagonist’s motivation extends beyond the self to “collective memory,” but it doesn’t substantially narrow options or force a trade-off. As a result, tension feels more meditative than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is clear, but it remains abstract and largely unopposed on the page. Evelyn faces no real resistance (internal or external) once the magical mechanics are introduced; each discovery cooperatively yields more information. The astronomers’ disagreement is interesting but occurs entirely in remembered/simulated debate without real jeopardy for Evelyn herself. Escalation registers more as accumulating curiosities than as pressure that forces a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Neptunia will be gutted by privatization—appears early and remains coherent, with rumors escalating into scheduled meetings and emissary visits. Conflict tightens through Maya’s choice to weaponize graffiti and organize flash mobs, but many confrontations are reported in summary, so we don’t see their plans truly tested or nearly fail. The “surprisingly favorable” terms arrive a bit easily, muting the sense of real risk or loss. Still, the internal conflict (bridge vs. pick a side) and the partial nature of the victory give the resolution some genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capture the final images before extinction—appears early and remains coherent, but escalation is minimal. The “need to outlast the darkness” and “outlast her emotions” are stated rather than dramatized; she never faces fatigue, equipment risk, or a real temptation to retreat. The sunrise deadline operates more as a fixed frame than a tightening vice. As a result, the climax reads as an inevitable execution of plan rather than a pressured test of will or values.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The nominal stake—getting the drone repaired and back to the ship before departure—is clear but under-pressured on the page. Elias encounters no serious setback; once the diagnostic method is invoked, the fix proceeds smoothly without a real threat of failure or loss. Internal conflict (fatigue, aging hands, doubt) is mentioned but not dramatized into a turning choice. As a result, escalation is minimal and the outcome feels inevitable rather than earned under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—proving the existence of a singular convergence against scientific skepticism—is clear but remains mostly intellectual. Pressure does increase from theoretical obsession to embodied discovery, yet almost all obstacles (logistical, physical, or interpersonal) are elided in summary (“for three days… on the fourth morning…”). There’s no real reversal or hard trade-off; once he departs, success feels inevitable. The cost at closure is conceptual rather than dramatic, which is fine, but the path there lacks a tightening that would test his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is largely procedural rather than oppositional: once the method is introduced, nothing truly resists or complicates it. The dominant stake—preventing collapse and restoring balance—is declared but never forced into a moment where failure feels like a live option. There is a gentle escalation in scope (from individual stones to whole town), but no decisive turn that demands a new tactic or sacrifice. As a result, the ending satisfies conceptually but lacks visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—oxygen running out versus unlocking the temple’s mechanism—is clearly signaled and does drive her key decision to override training and proceed. Escalation exists (gauge ticking down, sealed door, violent swirl as the mechanism opens, alarm blaring) and narrows options toward a single high-risk path. However, conflict remains relatively frictionless: the door yields, the chamber behaves as hoped, and the escape is strenuous but unimpeded, so cost feels more implied than viscerally paid. We never see a genuine reversal or sacrifice that meaningfully endangers the outcome beyond the declared ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central stakes—being believed and separating from his father’s lies “before they find the bodies”—are articulated but not meaningfully escalated. The narrative repeats the same internal tension without a concrete test, reversal, or external pressure that forces a sharper stance. His decision to “thread a labyrinth with his own story” is important conceptually but lacks a clear moment where it forecloses another path with visible cost. As a result, conflict feels largely static and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt so both lovers can move on—is legible early and culminates in a meaningful tightening when the bead finally responds to the stars. Her choice to send the seeds out and accept her own dissolution provides a real price and a clear resolution. That said, most resistance is environmental/structural rather than dramatized opposition, so escalation feels more like a timed unlocking than a contested struggle. The tension is atmospheric rather than sharply agonistic, which is effective but keeps it below top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reanimate a relic and restore something sacred—is clear but faces almost no real resistance. Her exhaustion and the villagers’ initial worry skim the surface of conflict, but they never develop into a real challenge or ethical test; once they witness the canyon, everyone aligns. Escalation is mainly additive (more sewing, more orchids, more visitors) rather than tightening with trade-offs or foreclosed options. As a result, the piece reads as a lyrical transformation vignette more than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen’s spiritual homecoming—remains largely internal and faces little explicit resistance; once he decides to help, nothing seriously threatens or complicates that choice. Escalation reads more as steady deepening of engagement than as a tightening of pressure or a trade-off that forecloses alternatives. We never see him tempted to retreat, rejected by the land, or confronted with a conflicting obligation that would meaningfully test his restored faith. As a result, the ending feels earned emotionally but not hard-won in terms of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes—meeting the mailing deadline and crystallizing her new understanding of her work—are present but under-pressured. The story accumulates meaning rather than escalating conflict; nothing concretely threatens failure, and no alternative path is truly in play. Her internal shift is more contemplative than hard-won, with no moment where she must trade one value for another. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not sharply earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing a coup—is strong and legible early, and the tightening from cosmic anomaly to concrete assassination schedule provides a solid mid-story deepening. Yet Elara encounters little on-page resistance: once she understands the plot, her countermeasures flow smoothly without real obstacles, trade-offs, or visible risk besides implied discovery. The resolution is earned in logic but not fully tested in tension, leaving the conflict intelligent but under-pressurized. The lack of a tangible price or genuine near-failure keeps this from higher-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central conflict—her need to understand an unfinished relationship—registers and is clearly at stake in the messages on the glass. There is one meaningful escalation: from the insufficient “I’m sorry” to more revealing images and finally “I was afraid,” which allows a different internal response. However, Elara never faces a hard choice or trade-off; once fear is named, forgiveness comes without resistance or complication, so the price of that stance is underplayed. The pressure feels contemplative rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Kaelen helping Lina metabolize her father’s absence—is legible, but on-page conflict is minimal and largely uncontested. There is no significant obstacle, moral bind, or reversal; he never genuinely risks making things worse or confronting his own limits. The “tightening” is mostly an interpretive one when he deciphers the cast, yet this doesn’t notably narrow options or force a trade-off. As a result, tension remains gentle and reflective rather than escalating in a way that would feel necessary or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Amelia’s need to reclaim joy and prove the district once held real festivity—is articulated, and there is a mild external pressure via skeptical historians and a doubtful council. However, opposition never crystalizes into real obstacles; permission is granted off-page, the restoration process works smoothly, and community acceptance comes quickly. There is little escalation beyond accumulation of revelations, and no genuine trade-off or loss is dramatized. As a result, tension remains low, and the final “victory” feels largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are primarily internal—Elena’s relationship to art and perception—signaled early by her methodical certainty and resolved in her embrace of curiosity. Yet pressure barely escalates: each “awakening” is a deepening of wonder rather than a test, and there’s no real moment where she must choose against a meaningful alternative or pay an on-page price beyond abstractly relinquishing certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving autonomous thought under an oppressive tax regime—is powerful but remains largely abstract on the page. Resistance “escalates” mostly via summary (expansion of the tax, planting faster-growing species, nationwide signal) rather than through dramatized confrontations or difficult choices. There is no clear on-page test or reversal where Kaelen must pay a visible price or foreclose a path; his actions seem competent and unimpeded. As a result, tension exists conceptually but does not significantly tighten in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the poet can transform their pain and insomnia into enduring communal safety and rest—is present but remains mostly conceptual. There is some deepening when “darkness threatened,” but this pressure is abstract and not dramatized in a concrete challenge or dilemma. The poet’s agency (continuing to sing, refining lullabies) is steady but rarely forced into a sharper trade-off or visible loss beyond generalized exhaustion and eventual death. As a result, tension accrues more as mood than as escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—preserving the sound of forgotten names versus irreversible oblivion—is conceptually strong, and the cracked tube gives a concrete problem to solve. However, escalation is gentle: success never feels genuinely in doubt, and there’s little sense of competing demands, resource limits, or moral trade-offs. The repair ritual proceeds smoothly once the method is chosen, so pressure does not tighten meaningfully beyond the initial discovery. The conflict operates more as a contemplative tension with time than as a dramatic test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing a final political and cultural split—is clear and time-bound, and there is one notable deepening when she discovers the ceremonial text outlining consequences for broken promises. Still, the conflict is largely internal and procedural; there are no reversals, setbacks, or concrete obstacles to her research, and no on-page confrontation with resistant parties. Her “carefully reckless” risk-taking never faces immediate pushback, so the escalation feels more like accumulating emphasis than tightening pressure. The result is tension that is conceptually high but experientially mild.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—the looming council decision about flooding versus preservation—is clearly signaled, and her mandate to find a compromise gives the scene a notional pressure. However, all antagonistic forces remain off-page: there’s no character or circumstance actively resisting her, and her investigative steps succeed smoothly without setback or trade-off. The adhesive discovery and inscription reading function as progress beats rather than genuine reversals or tightened options. As a result, tension feels conceptual rather than felt, and the resolution carries little on-page price beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—whether Elara will remain in self-erasure as a bookseller or risk reclaiming her identity as a trainer—is clear and does meaningfully resolve. Pressure escalates texturally via growing attachment to the meteorite and dust patterns, culminating in the act of writing the letter and releasing the bird. However, opposition is gentle and mostly internalized; we rarely feel a moment where she might genuinely choose to stay “safe,” which softens the sense of cost. A single vivid beat of resistance or fear before committing would sharpen stakes considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding/understanding a truly “sacred” threshold that can take her home—is clear, and there is one real tightening when she recognizes the symbol in the oak doorway and feels the air thicken. Still, the conflict stays largely internal and contemplative, with no substantial resistance, risk, or trade-off dramatized as she decides to cross. Her agency (choosing to intuit, to trust the pattern, to step through) is present but lightly tested. As a result, the ending is satisfying but low-pressure, more graceful landing than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—Maya’s search for belonging and understanding—signaled early and closed at the end. There is a gentle escalation (curiosity → anomaly → cosmic pattern revelation → personal epiphany + map), but very little is at risk; danger, loss, or moral trade-offs never truly press her. Her key “choices” (following the feather, removing gloves, staying until sunrise) are largely unopposed and low-cost. The piece functions more as a lyric revelation than as a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—grasping why some paths disappear before memory fades—is established, but pressure remains low and mostly abstract. The single tightening is planting the seed, which leads to the vision; beyond that, there’s no reversal, resistance, or genuine risk. The “before memory fades” clock is invoked repeatedly without changing her tactics or compressing options. As a result, the resolution feels relatively untested, more like a graceful answer than an earned outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—can Leo successfully engineer a moment of magic for this woman—is clear but gentle. There is a mild tightening as he identifies her, times his approach, and reveals the bishop in sync with the music, yet nothing resists him; no plan falters or forces adaptation. As a result, the piece reads more like a graceful demonstration of a method than a pressured conflict with narrowing options. The lack of on-page risk or real possibility of failure keeps the stakes emotionally low.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory and transcending Council-imposed limits—is clear, but pressure on that stake remains abstract and largely offstage. The arrival of the moonstone speck offers a nice inflection point, yet Lira encounters little resistance, internal or external, as she moves from curiosity to full transformation. Her loss of mobility is framed as “unexpected but not unwelcome,” which undercuts the sense of cost and makes the central choice feel relatively frictionless. The piece accumulates significance rather than escalating conflict, leaving the stakes more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and fairly low-pressure: Mara is drawn to a numinous experience and then interprets it; there’s no real opposition, dilemma, or risk of failure. The dominant stake—clarifying her sense of purpose—is declared, but it is never seriously threatened, only refined. The “inexplicable force” functions as a convenient gateway to insight rather than a pressure she resists or misreads in ways that escalate. As a result, the piece reads more like a meditative vignette than a story with tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether he remains trapped in self-accusation or finds a stance toward his scars and the child he couldn’t save. Pressure escalates through deeper engagement with the box’s history and his own innocence—what he bargained away—and culminates in a credible Earned Stasis as he accepts being “scarred and whole.” There’s no big reversal, but the tightening is clear when he shifts from numbed carrying to conscious contemplation and then to active reinterpretation. The quietness of the conflict keeps it just below the highest tier, but within an introspective frame, the cost and narrowing of options read strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central stake—can Elian’s trial balloons meaningfully alter possibility rather than remain beautiful theory—is present but remains mostly conceptual. Escalation occurs when the gauge spins wildly and he makes the delicate adjustment to the weights, yet there is no counterforce beyond uncertainty; failure carries no clearly dramatized loss beyond continued stagnation. The needle pointing at him and steadying provides a turning point, but there’s little sense of trade-off, risk, or sacrifice at that moment. The piece reads as a successful experiment rather than a pressured conflict under cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is very soft: Elara explores, finds artifacts, interprets them, and decides to accept a legacy, but faces no real resistance (external or internal) and no meaningful risk. The dominant stake—understanding and preserving architectural memory—never encounters a concrete on-page test or trade-off. The most “tense” moment is her excitement at a rare find, which is more curiosity than pressure. As a result, escalation feels more like a sequence of discoveries than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—using this hushed, rain-charged window to compel mirrors to reveal possibilities—is clear but lightly pressured. There’s no real sense she might fail or suffer more than the familiar melancholy if she does not succeed; rain and timing feel like fortunate alignment rather than obstacles. Escalation is mostly tonal (humming to crescendo, bells tolling) rather than driven by constraining options or costly choices. The result is beautiful but relatively low-tension, more contemplative tableau than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are declared as enormous—ending a forever war—yet the on-page pressure stays relatively low and smooth. We’re told of “the first breach” and “the harder work” of concessions, but these moments don’t manifest as tight, agonizing turns; the negotiation never truly seems at risk of collapse. The main tension resides in Elian’s internal doubt against their outward confidence, which is compelling but under-escalated across the scene. The late mention of “cracks” in the alliance is evocative but functions as atmosphere rather than a concrete reversal with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict is Silas’s moral and emotional struggle over whether and how to honor what he destroyed, with the egg as focal stake. His agency is clear in choosing to cross the salt flat and release the egg in a ritual that contradicts his public persona. However, escalation is relatively flat: there’s little on-page resistance (internal or external), and no concrete price he must visibly pay beyond private discomfort and secrecy. The arrival of rain is a beautiful counterpoint rather than a pressure-tested consequence, so the piece feels like a single sustained beat rather than a sequence of tightening turns.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—spiritual liberation and breaking a generational failure—is clearly signaled and culminates in Elara’s entry into the sanctuary. Conflict is primarily internal and metaphysical, framed as a struggle against conformity and binding threads. Yet on the page, resistance feels minimal: the threads “respond” and loosen relatively smoothly, and no serious on-the-spot risk of failure or reversal surfaces. The escalation reads more like a steady intensification of lyric language than a tightening of options with tangible cost, keeping stakes somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—whether storytelling will ethically represent the homeless and challenge dominant narratives—is clearly signaled but remains largely conceptual. The bar audience softens quickly; the argument with the mentor and any relational or professional risk are kept off-page, so nothing forces a hard trade-off or visible loss. Elias never truly doubts or adapts under pressure; his approach works as intended. This yields a thoughtful but low-tension piece with minimal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether acts of remembrance have meaning in the face of irreversible ecological loss—is clearly present, and pressure coheres around the presence of the last monarch. The escalation from passive watching to actively knotting signals and deploying the moth wing provides one substantive deepening, culminating in the monarch’s apparent acknowledgment and Aris’s internal recalibration. Still, the conflict stays largely contemplative; there’s little sense of a genuinely live alternative (e.g., turning away, choosing not to mark this) that is seriously considered and foreclosed. Tension is real but remains gentle and mostly internal, which suits the piece but slightly flattens stakes on an elite short-fiction standard.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names through a high-risk, unprecedented ritual—is clearly articulated and thematically strong. Yet the on-page conflict is largely one-sided; the rope yields without resistance, there are no failed attempts, and no explicit penalties for error are dramatized. The main tightening is simply the transition from preparation to the rope’s successful illumination and her quiet choice to stay, which reads more as fulfillment than sacrifice under duress. Stronger antagonistic pressure (time, danger, the possibility of losing the names forever) would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transcend her temporal limitation and experience the present—is clearly established, and the storm-ritual-night sequence provides a structural tightening. Yet on-page pressure is low: there’s no articulated risk of failure, psychic damage, or loss if the ritual backfires or fails, and no real obstruction arises. The escalation is primarily declarative (storm intensifies, consciousness moves) rather than dramatized through hard choices or trade-offs. As a result, the climax reads more like a smooth unveiling than a truly tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nominal stakes—cosmic covenant versus regime change and possible persecution—are significant, and they’re signaled fairly early. Yet on-page pressure remains low: the ritual unfolds without real resistance, no one interrupts, and Nebuchadnezzar’s forces function only as background drums. There is one main deepening when the tile activates and unfolds, but no genuine trade-off or foreclosed path. The conflict is more contemplative than dramatic, which undercuts escalation and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will release his resentment—is signaled clearly and resolved on the page. Yet the pressure on that choice is relatively soft; once Elara unveils the cellular memory and ancestral visions, resistance collapses quickly without a serious test or competing value. The brother’s appearance resolves external conflict without being earned by Marcus’s agency beyond internal assent. Escalation is present but gentle, with limited sense of risk or price to the change.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—repairing and transforming the sextant to deal with the runaway dream—is clear but never feels genuinely risky or opposed. Escalation is gentle: the dream’s approach and the sextant’s new alignment are intriguing turns but not sharp tests of resolve. The climactic choice not to imprison the dream is conceptually important, yet it costs him nothing tangible or relational on the page. As a result, tension is present but muted and largely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core conflict—Elara’s longing vs. her fear and history of failure—is clear, and her decision to build the bridge is a meaningful, escalating act rather than mere symbolism. Tension accrues through her repeated returns and the small miracle of the bloom, culminating in the footprints and the missing ribbon. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and sometimes cushioned by gentle, reassuring imagery, so the sense of risk and cost never becomes sharp. The stakes feel emotionally genuine but remain in a comfortably poignant register.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will embrace mind-shattering, forbidden knowledge—is signaled, but opposition is soft and largely internalized as abstract risk. The main tightening is his realization in the bathroom that the artifact is a “bridge between temporal states,” which deepens the stakes conceptually but doesn’t clearly narrow his options in a concrete way. His later decision to “risk everything” reads more like a natural continuation of his lifelong desire than a pressured, contested choice. As a result, tension accumulates more as mood and idea than as felt conflict with visible prices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing a trapped consciousness from the library of unlearned lessons—is clearly signaled but remains abstractly dangerous more than viscerally perilous. Conflict escalates only modestly: initial restriction → renegotiation → entry → extraction, all of which proceed without serious resistance, reversals, or trade-offs. The rescue reads as something Elara is competent enough to handle rather than a crucible that forces her to risk or sacrifice. As a result, tension is low even when the premise promises higher-pressure possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to recapture lost identity and locate the garden—is clearly stated but faces minimal resistance or complication. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through active opposition, with the main tightening occurring when she realizes her role is to carry others’ memories, not just reclaim her own. There is little sense that she might fail, or that her choice at the tree forecloses a genuinely tempting alternative path. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than tense, keeping escalation and cost in a modest band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    The core stake—uncovering what happened to Croft and the vanished—is present but remains mostly intellectual rather than visceral or ethically fraught. The piece signals danger via the fables and warnings about temporal doors, yet Eleanor encounters no real resistance, dilemma, or cost when proceeding. Escalation is essentially linear information gain and procedural preparation, without a turn that forces her to trade one good for another or truly risk something. The climax resolves cleanly and favorably, so pressure never fully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the ripple marks and restoring equilibrium—is signaled early, and pressure technically escalates as the mapkeeper moves from disrupted caves to the Sanctum to the central chamber and initiates the bloom of hush. However, the conflict is largely one-sided and processual; the energy beings never meaningfully push back, threaten the mapkeeper, or force a difficult trade‑off. Once the pattern is found, the conjuring proceeds without apparent risk, and the subsequent harmonization and transformation happen smoothly. The result is conceptually elegant but emotionally under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to assert meaning in a broken world—is signaled early and resolved at the climax. Yet escalation is mostly conceptual; we are told she works “day after day,” but there are no concrete setbacks, trade-offs, or sharpened choices under pressure. The meteor-triggered revelation arrives conveniently, and once she acts, success follows without complication. The lack of on-page costs or narrowed options keeps the conflict from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely conceptual—whether collective memory will be preserved—and are never seriously imperiled in-scene. There is no antagonist force, time pressure, or meaningful risk that his attempt will fail; his “method” and vow are accepted by the world without resistance. The only “tightening” is a tonal deepening as night falls and his purpose clarifies, which is thematically pleasant but dramatically thin. As conflict, the piece functions more as a lyrical tableau than a true test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—defying the “gravity of hopelessness” through his performance—is stated, and there is a clear cadence shift when the starless night descends and he begins the show. Yet almost nothing pushes back: no risk of failure, no misfire, no competing demand on him or the fortress, so pressure never tightens beyond atmosphere. His agency is fully intact, but each step succeeds on the first attempt, which keeps the sense of cost and jeopardy muted. The conflict is largely conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete threats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maya’s tidal-pool work continues under funding pressure—is stated early, but never tested in a concrete or oppositional way beyond Aris’s initial concern. The main escalation is internal: the uncomfortable pause and her epiphany reweight the situation, yet there is no scene-level narrowing of options, loss, or explicit tradeoff. Her “new approach” arrives without her having to choose between competing goods or harms on the page. As a result, conflict feels gentle and largely contemplative rather than tightened into a decisive, costly moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to transcend her fear and attain the gilded hush—is clear, but it faces little real resistance once the hour begins. Her claustrophobia is intense in the bunker corridor, yet it doesn’t meaningfully impede her ascent, and no external or internal setback tests the depth of her commitment. The gravity window is a conceptual clock but never functions as a live threat; she simply reaches the trellis, collects the hush, and returns in time. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth lyric climb than a pressured narrowing of options, with limited on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract: Elias wants to comfort travelers, and he succeeds smoothly without on-page resistance or trade-off. The storm glass’s late warning of dark clouds gestures at potential disruption but doesn’t actually tighten present pressure or force a choice. There is no meaningful escalation beyond executing his carefully laid plan under ideal conditions. As a result, the piece reads as a beautiful demonstration rather than a test of his commitment or method.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—completing the ritual before sunrise to activate the throne for the true heir—is clearly declared, and the ticking clock is established. However, the on-page conflict is very low-friction: the path is “treacherous” in summary only, the monolith yields its secrets without resistance, and the earth opens “politely,” so there’s little escalation or cost in any beat. Elara never faces a meaningful trade-off, moral or practical, and no option is visibly foreclosed by her actions. As a result, tension remains conceptual rather than felt, and the time limit never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving her protected isolation versus answering the call to save a suffocating soul and maintain the threshold—is clear early and tightens when the ring throbs and the cost of refusal (trapped souls, vanished threshold) is articulated. Escalation is subtle but real: the sanctuary’s comfort becomes a liability once the duty resurfaces, and the three knocks and step through form a concrete commitment. The price (relinquishing hard-won solitude and re-entering pain through scars) is legible if somewhat abstracted. More on-page resistance or hesitation in the moment of knocking could have sharpened the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are conceptually strong (wealth, redemption, personal transformation vs. physical danger and possible exploitation of a reality-bending artifact), and the dominant drive is signaled early. Yet conflict is remarkably smooth: nobody opposes her, environmental danger never manifests as a real obstruction, and her internal hesitation is minimal. The main “tightening” is simply descent to lower levels and the bolt’s discovery, with no meaningful trade-offs or losses; success comes on the first straightforward attempt. As a result, the ending lacks a felt price and reads more like a wish-fulfillment reveal than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    The declared stakes—ending a centuries-long dynasty—are high, but on-page conflict is remarkably smooth; nothing and no one opposes him and there are no genuine setbacks. The primary escalation is the building hum and standing waves culminating in the hidden compartment opening, which is more procedural than pressured. His commitment is never tested against fear, failure, or counterforce, so costs remain abstract. As a result, tension plateaus rather than tightening meaningfully toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is Galen’s pursuit of forbidden/transformative knowledge, but the conflict is mostly internal and lightly contested: the text cautions him, yet he proceeds without any serious on-page hesitation or countervailing obligation. Escalation does occur—from reading to invocation to reality-overlap—yet there is no true reversal, complication, or evident price for success; the ritual works on the first try and only benefits him. The absence of palpable danger, loss, or sacrifice keeps the tension subdued. As a result, the piece reads more as a vision-experience than as a pressured choice with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The core stake is Eleanor’s search for meaning and connection in the wake of her failed adoption, but the conflict remains mostly internal and low-pressure. The main tightening is her decision to pursue the mystery via dust signatures, which shifts the piece from static melancholy into investigative mode. However, after the file discovery there is little escalation; the later reunion arrives without real friction or dilemma, muting any visible cost. Emotional tension is present but never truly tested or forced into a sharper choice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (erasure of unedited history vs. preserving it) is clear and large-scale, and the story does escalate from looming loss to an on-page heist under alarm. Yet the opposition and cost remain soft: patrols “tripled” but are easily evaded, alarms sound but the escape is frictionless, and no concrete sacrifice is paid. The tension curve thus feels more declared than viscerally pressured, with convenience smoothing over what should be peak jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—preventing a prophecy from shaking the community—is declared early, and the musical confrontation with it does escalate from tentative notes to urgent, oppositional “whisper battling whisper.” Yet the danger remains conceptual: we never see or concretely imagine what “shaking the foundations” would mean, so risk and cost feel distant. Ethan’s agency is strong (he chooses to act, persists, and finishes), but the conflict is almost frictionless aside from his exertion, with no serious doubt, setback, or price beyond effort and a soft melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are stated—the message may be of “utmost importance” and warns of “changing winds and shifting skies”—but they remain abstract and untested on the page. Elara faces no opposition, deadline pressure, or meaningful risk; the rare moonstone appears conveniently and only amplifies her already-functioning role. There is a mild deepening when the monument glows and she feels transformation, but it doesn’t force a trade-off or foreclose options. As a result, tension never truly tightens, and the piece reads as a gentle ritual rather than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to control vs. uncertainty, but it rarely feels pressured; his life or livelihood never seems truly at risk. External conflict (no rope at the waterfall, navigating the greenhouse) is dispatched quickly without real danger or sacrifice. Internal stakes intensify somewhat as the compass responds to his emotions, yet his shift to acceptance happens with little friction. The escalation is thus more conceptual than felt, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—redeeming his failure and purpose after losing the coin and mentor—is clear, and the decision to forge a new coin is an authentic, agency-driven move. However, pressure barely escalates: the narrative skips from “weeks following every clue” to the quiet acceptance that she’s gone, without a concrete beat where his resolve is really tested. There’s no meaningful reversal or deepening once he chooses his course; everything from selecting the disc to retrieving the coin proceeds smoothly, with no friction or risk. As a result, the cost and tension feel low relative to the story’s lofty thematic claims.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing a long-resistant child soul—is clear, and Elias’s pursuit and confrontation supply a coherent line of pressure. There is one key tightening beat when the tooth warms and he locates the cave, shifting from search to direct engagement. However, the encounter itself unfolds without real resistance: Thomas confesses quickly, the bell works on first try, and Elias’s “modest fearlessness” is never truly tested. The cost is present (decades of Thomas’s regret; Elias’s ongoing burden) but emotionally under-pressurized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake is internal—can he face his trauma and extract meaning rather than be defined by it—and that is signaled early and sustained. Pressure does accumulate via embodied flashbacks and his hesitation before aligning the strap with the forest floor, but the escalation is smooth rather than testing: he never seems in danger of turning away, regressing, or breaking. The final move (activating the strap and formulating a definition of mercy) is more revelation than hard trade-off, with little on-page price beyond discomfort. As a result, tension exists but rarely bites; the story could benefit from one concretely risky or self-endangering choice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can unlock and honor the overlooked histories—remains largely abstract and uncontested. There is a nominal tightening when she “finally stand[s] before the painting that holds the key,” but there are no real obstacles, doubts, or alternatives to create pressure. The climax (“with a final breath, I unfasten the barrier”) is more ceremonial than hard-won, with no visible price or risk if she fails or succeeds. As a result, conflict feels static and escalation is more rhetorical than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s desire to understand and productively use his ability—is clear, but opposition is minimal and largely abstract. Escalation occurs via the clock-driven countdown to 4:17 and the sudden influx of ghosts, yet nothing actively resists him, and each step unfolds smoothly once set in motion. His “engage” decision is important thematically but not sharply pressured; no alternative path or palpable risk is dramatized. As a result, tension is gentle and accumulative rather than gripping or consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether eternity/knowledge can be safely compressed and contained—is present and escalates as the bottled whisper destabilizes the library. The rupture meaningfully raises the cost by destroying Eldon’s perfect system, and the library’s reformation reframes the stakes. Yet Eldon is not truly pressed into a visible dilemma; he never makes a hard on-page choice where a live alternative is foreclosed. As a result, tension is more conceptual and atmospheric than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reframing a violent archaeological dispute—is clear, but the on-page pressure is mild. The storm functions as a soft deadline and there is an abstract sense that the civilization is at an impasse, yet Elias’s path to success isn’t meaningfully tested or foreclosed options-wise. The escalation from preparation to writing to reception reads more as smooth progression than as tightening conflict. As a result, the resolution feels conceptually satisfying but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—save all music before midnight—is clearly stated and threaded through with the ticking clock. There is some escalation via the clock tower striking eleven and then midnight, and the brief image of rust recoiling from the stone’s light. Yet Elias encounters no real opposition or setback; once he begins humming and tethering, success unfolds without reversal, sacrifice, or trade-off. The world-ending stakes are large, but the on-page struggle to meet them is comparatively slight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s pursuit of a boundary where rational explanation fails—is clear, and the move from study to crevice to lagoon provides one meaningful tightening. However, opposition is almost entirely absent: the descent, the water, and even the disembodied voice offer no real danger, dilemma, or serious trade-off. The awakenings deepen understanding but do not force sacrifices beyond a quiet surrender of prior epistemic comfort. As a result, tension remains gentle and contemplative rather than truly escalating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s search for inspiration and understanding of her place in time—faces almost no genuine resistance. Once she finds the slide, conflict evaporates into an unopposed revelation and smooth execution of the sculpture. There’s no meaningful escalation or trade-off; the decision to stay and create feels frictionless. As a result, tension remains low and the ending lacks a palpable sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—resolving a generational, artistic question—is clear and persists throughout, but pressure remains gentle and largely internal. The main tightening is the discovery of the cathedral postcard and Elara’s decision to travel, yet there’s little sense that failure would carry a significant cost beyond continued uncertainty. The reckoning at the window is a deepening of understanding rather than a hard choice, so escalation is modest but coherent for a quiet, lyric piece. Effective, but not yet at the level of charged trade-off or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling official history with buried truth and escaping retrocognitive entrapment—is clearly signaled but rarely feels risky or contested in scene. Opposition is soft: the captain’s skepticism dissolves instantly, the lagoon answers her messages without resistance, and publication carries no visible blowback. There is one meaningful tightening when she begins actively “parleying” with the past, but escalation then plateaus into explanation. As a result, the final decision to publish lacks the sense of sacrifice or narrowed options that top-tier conflict requires.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Paper-lantern Cove can achieve a true, non-wish-based revival—is clearly articulated, and Elior’s choice to act provides a real, if quiet, turning point. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and somewhat abstract; there’s no credible opposing force on the page beyond “false comfort” and the implied inertia of absent townsfolk. Escalation is intellectual rather than situational: ideas “flow” and then he has a plan, without a tangible obstacle or sacrifice that narrows options. As a result, the final move feels important in premise but low-pressure in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will do with the prophecy and his vocation—is present and coherent, and there is a clear deepening when the prophecy reveals the city’s downfall, reweighting his archival work. Yet there is little real opposition: nothing meaningfully resists his immersion, the prophecy, or his decision to take on a new task. The internal conflict (awe, fear, duty) doesn’t crystallize into a hard choice where a live option is foreclosed on the page. The piece reads more as a transformation vignette than a pressured conflict, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Anya can access and understand “borrowed time” before her own runs out—is clear, but the conflict is largely internal and procedural, with minimal resistance beyond the difficulty of perfect order. Escalation comes from the increasing precision and scale of her entropy-decreasing pattern and the atrium’s environmental response, culminating in the vortex’s appearance. However, there’s little sense that failure is a real possibility or that she’s forced into a hard trade-off; tension is more meditative than pressured. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully rendered ritual rather than a sharp test under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—the bell proving itself as a preternatural storm detector with life-saving consequences—is clearly signaled. There is a structural tightening as solstice/zero hour nears and the storm gathers, culminating in the bell’s ring. Yet conflict remains largely unopposed: colleagues’ skepticism and the lethal storm exist off-page, and Elias faces no serious dilemma or sacrifice in the moment. The piece thus reads more as a successful demonstration than as genuine conflict under escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elion’s need to move from passive maintenance to vulnerable cosmic participation—is present but under-pressured. The primary tightening is the “call” through the glass that prompts him to leave his instruments and step into the void, but this decision faces no clear risk, opposition, or conflicting demand. Internal conflict is implied (lonely duty vs. spiritual longing) rather than dramatized in a way that narrows options or extracts a price. As a result, the emotional and narrative escalation feels gentle rather than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the recluse can fulfill the covenant and open the box—is clear and resolves, but pressure rises gently rather than sharply. Escalation occurs as knowledge and symbolic weight accumulate, culminating in the decision to offer pure presence, yet the recluse is never seriously tempted away from this path or forced into a visible trade-off. The “requirement” of listening more than speaking does narrow options in a conceptual sense, and the final silent vigil functions as an on-page test of commitment. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and serene, which preserves tone but limits felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—grasping the true nature of time and her role in it—is present from early on and somewhat deepens with the discovery of embedded messages. Yet conflict remains mostly internal and low-friction; there is no strong opposing force, deadline, or meaningful risk to failure beyond generalized existential loss. The “suddenly timeless” beat hints at danger but resolves instantly into insight without threat or sacrifice. Her choice to embed her own messages is positive but largely untested, so escalation feels more like a smooth expansion than a pressured turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and thematic—creative flow vs. blockage, attachment vs. letting go—with the kite snap as the only clear tightening beat. Stakes (her ability to translate this moment into poetry and her stance toward incompleteness) are implied rather than concretely tested. Escalation is modest: observation accumulates until the kite incident offers a mild jolt and then things ease into resolution without further pressure. The piece succeeds as quiet lyric, but in terms of stakes and strain it feels low-intensity for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the bridge to plant intelligence before death—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely one-sided in Elias’s favor. Arthritis, waning strength, and time pressure are mentioned as obstacles, yet they never create a decisive setback or force a painful tactical compromise. Escalation is more a gentle deepening of wonder than sharpening pressure, so the story lacks a real crisis point. The ending’s cost is death, but it unfolds with little contest on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can reconcile his skepticism with a quasi-spiritual understanding of “homecoming”—is clear but remains largely internal and low-friction. There’s minimal escalation: his doubts are voiced early, but no serious test or counterforce challenges his goal once he commits to entering the tower. The glowing amber and responsive tower deliver resolution without real risk, sacrifice, or meaningful alternative path foreclosed. This produces a gentle, accumulative tension rather than a tightening conflict that would satisfy at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can one man help a dead battlefield and reef regenerate?—is signaled early and paid off conceptually. Yet on the page, there is almost no resistance: the coachman never faces failure, shortage, misjudgment, or pushback, and the bird guidance only smooths his path. As a result, escalation is mostly a steady process montage rather than pressured turning points; the “narrow vastness” idea is philosophically high-stakes but not dramatized through concrete dilemmas. The final success thus feels assured rather than earned through contested choices.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—closing the emotional distance to Elara—comes through, and there is one solid tightening when the second phonograph shifts him from his original eastward trajectory to the new coordinates. However, external conflict is minimal and largely environmental in a generic way; the days of travel pass without concrete obstacles or reversals that force visible trade-offs. Internally, Silas never seriously questions his path or confronts a painful alternative (e.g., staying with the settlement), so pressure remains relatively gentle. The result feels more like a guided pilgrimage than a hard-tested quest.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will succumb to isolation or recommit to her custodial role—remains largely internal and static. There is mild escalation as the ritual deepens her sense of responsibility, culminating in acceptance of her inner “true north,” but options never truly narrow and no path is visibly foreclosed. The cost of her choice (enduring pariahhood and loneliness) is conceptually present yet never confronted in a concrete, sharpened moment. The piece reads more as extended mood than as pressure resolving into a hard stance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—mend a fractured reality/sky—is signaled early and paid off, and the chess tests offer a semblance of progressive challenge. Yet the pressure never truly tightens: Kael faces no serious risk of failure, no moral trade-off, and no visible loss beyond effort spent. The master’s late exposition resolves the central problem without introducing new jeopardy or forcing a difficult choice. As a result, conflict remains mostly conceptual and undercut by how smoothly each “right move” works on the first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully resist erasure by preserving “small gestures” under impossible constraints—is clear. There is a real ethical pressure point when she recognizes that choosing one pawn to stand for thousands means accepting many will be lost. However, the conflict stays mostly internal and abstract; there’s no strong external opposition or concrete consequence that tightens her options beyond the general doom of forgetting. The tension rises modestly with the pawn’s appearance but never quite sharpens into a gripping test.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Maven’s existential search for “home”—is signaled early, but on-page pressure is low; the world never seriously pushes back against her, nor are her powers truly risky. The major escalations (finding the stone, learning the feather’s function, the mountain trembling) arrive as gifts rather than as the outcomes of contested choices. Her “decision to seed her newfound power” and nightly practice form a mild deepening, yet there’s no real trade-off or foreclosed path dramatized. As a result, the climax reads as an unopposed leveling-up rather than a choice with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—his redemption tied to freeing the village—is clear early and coherently pursued through the decoding task under a genuine time constraint. The thunder countdown and the forming labyrinth door provide one meaningful tightening as he works faster to complete the tapestry. However, obstacles are almost entirely internal and never seriously contest his progress; there is no palpable possibility of failure or reversal beyond the abstract. The resolution, while emotionally apt, thus feels slightly under-tested in terms of cost and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s subversive art versus the city’s absolutist ritual and the risk of sacrifice—is clearly signaled. Yet conflict stays largely conceptual and static; the Ritual Overseers “shadow” her off-stage, and there is no on-page confrontation, reversal, or new obstacle that forces her to alter tactics. The approach of the ritual functions as a clock but doesn’t generate a distinct turning point beyond heightened language. Her final act on the tower confirms her established resolve rather than testing it in a new way with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcel can reconfigure his uncertainty and past losses into meaningful, ‘repaired’ identity—is evident and pursued. Conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with escalation coming via deepening memories and the workshop’s slight physical reaction to his emotional state. Yet there is little sense of a real alternative path or live threat in the present, so tension plateaus and the final shift feels more like a long-delayed recognition than a hard-won, pressured choice. The lack of a sharp cost or foreclosed option at the end keeps the stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant conflict—Elias versus time/forgetting his own life and promise—is clear, and the discovery of the shell meaningfully tightens that pressure by confronting him with a past self who already tried to defy time. His agency in returning to the quay and painting with “renewed purpose” offers a credible resolution that forecloses passive decay. However, the escalation remains relatively gentle and reflective; there’s little sense that he might fail or choose differently in the moment, and few visible intermediate costs as pressure builds. The result is emotionally satisfying but low-tension, more contemplative than sharply conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—can Elias’s gentle method reach his sister and prove his theory—is clear, but pressure is low and largely unopposed once he decides to act. Captain Morgan’s skepticism provides only a soft, off-page resistance; there is no real risk that the attempt will harm Elias or foreclose another path. The experiment proceeds without meaningful obstacle, reversal, or deepening of cost, so escalation is more a slow emotional swell than tightening conflict. As a result, the resolution feels pleasant and earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared—ships can be lost, the navigator’s work is a form of redemption—but on-page conflict is gentle and largely uncontested. The midnight call (“Build the bridge between tides”) suggests potential difficulty, yet execution proceeds smoothly without reversals, near-misses, or visible cost. Internal and external pressures align rather than clash, so tension never meaningfully tightens. The story reads more as a lyrical slice of ongoing labor than as a discrete, escalated crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—regaining control over overwhelming empathy—is well signaled and paid off when the ritual succeeds and she feels “profound stillness.” There is one meaningful tightening as she reaches her own name and breaks into tears, but the process is otherwise smooth, with little sense that the ritual might fail or backfire. The sudden appearance of a second relic reads more as fortunate boon than hard-earned consequence, which softens the felt cost and keeps the conflict from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to understand the stranger’s gesture and what to do with the borrowed memories—is clear and does escalate from unease to interpretive urgency. His investigations (dock, town, records) and final decision to mirror the gesture do narrow his options in a modest, interior way. However, opposition is gentle and largely circumstantial; there’s little sense that failure would carry a real on-page cost beyond mild psychic discomfort. As a result, the conflict feels quietly satisfying but not deeply pressured or tested.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias continues a life of passive mapping or steps into an active, self-chosen path—is clear and resolved by his doorway choice. Yet the journey itself is unusually frictionless: the ants guide him unerringly, and the cavern readily offers an intelligible metaphysics of his life, so he is rarely forced into hard tactical or moral trade-offs. The internal struggle is implied rather than dramatized beat by beat, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s search for authentic selfhood versus her circumscribed royal role—is clear, but it faces relatively soft on-page opposition. The ridge’s reputed curse and the counselors’ final warning stay abstract; the climb is “brutal” but never produces a specific near-failure or sacrifice, and there’s no moment where she might turn back. Internally, her fear at the “lacy menace” of the cave resolves almost instantly into empowered understanding, so escalation feels more like a gentle reveal than a pressured choice. The ending frames a renewed commitment but without a sufficiently felt trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how this secret will transform Elara’s art and relationship with Leo—is signaled, but pressure remains largely internal and untested. There is a single main tightening at the moment of the whispered secret, yet no real alternative paths or difficult trade-offs are made concrete; her “revaluation” is immediate and frictionless. Leo’s secret never confronts them with a visible dilemma or loss, which keeps the conflict from escalating beyond anticipation into genuine tension. As a result, stakes read more as philosophical than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to make sense of his fragmented consciousness and mortality—is clear but remains largely abstract. Pressure does intensify during the glowing-scroll/soaring sequence, as his jaded wonder peaks and he confronts multiple selves and lifetimes. However, he is never forced into a tangible trade-off, renunciation, or risky decision; his path to recommitting to the chronicle is smooth and largely contemplative. The conflict is interesting but static, more meditation than escalating test.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—Lena’s anxiety over the heirloom and Elara’s quiet struggle with identity after losing smell—are present but soft. Pressure rises slightly as Lena voices how “lost” she feels without the screw and as Elara reveals her own loss, but there’s no real narrowing of options or ethical trade-off. Conflict remains largely internal and is resolved through mutual understanding without visible cost or risk. The story works emotionally yet lacks a decisive tightening beat that would push it beyond gentle reassurance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can she complete this dangerous, transformative ritual before storm and crystallization stop her—is clear early and threads through. Pressure escalates credibly when the platform tilts and her affliction activates, forcing an immediate tactic shift back into superstition to avert disaster. Internal and external conflicts (trauma, self-doubt, bodily risk, environmental danger) braid well and resolve in one earned peak choice to persist and complete the rune. The main soft spot is that there’s no real trade-off or lasting visible loss; success is hard-won but not meaningfully mixed, which limits the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—Eloise’s need to apologize and connect before time and metaphysical limits shut her out—is clear and integrated with the ritual’s technical risk. Escalation is modest but real: preparation → apparition → emotionally fraught dialogue → attempt at touch → forced separation by the orchard’s awakening. The cost is felt in the brevity and incompleteness of the reunion rather than in any dramatic reversal, which suits the scale but keeps it shy of maximal intensity. Internal and external pressures braid well, though an additional concrete obstacle or misstep could have heightened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether scattered cosmic fragments can be unified before the hiccup ends—is clear but stays largely conceptual and untested on the page. Pressure nominally rises as spiral arbitration “intensifies” and the hiccup reaches its peak, yet we never see a credible risk of failure or a narrowing of options beyond assertion. The witness faces no explicit dilemma, opposition, or sacrifice at the altar; completion feels inevitable rather than earned under pressure. Conflict is thus more described than dramatized, limiting tension despite grand stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal: Arlo wants a truer understanding of time, with some implied spiritual/emotional risk if he fails. Escalation exists in a gentle way—the impossible reversal of water, the deepening quiet, the sense that he’s glimpsing a different order—but there is no concrete obstacle, danger, or counterforce. His experiment works immediately, and no alternative path is seriously tested or foreclosed, so tension stays soft. The ending stance is earned enough for a meditative piece but doesn’t feel like it was wrestled from real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—redefining the nature of these “intruders” and the purpose of security—is clear but remains largely conceptual. Pressure does increase modestly when the stranger interacts with the laser field, yet nothing truly threatens her, the farm, or the relationship; the situation never teeters. Escalation consists mainly of revelation rather than conflict, and options don’t feel meaningfully narrowed. The resolution arrives without a hard trade-off or visible price, which keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant conflict is internal: reconciling her father’s fatalistic gambling with her own structured but “theoretically rebellious” approach to probability. The discovery of the Fibonacci-like sequence is a nice pressure point, but after that the tension remains largely static as she moves toward a philosophical reframe. Stakes are mostly abstract—there’s little sense of what she might concretely lose or risk if she failed to adopt this new stance. The final decision to treat the scrawls as invitations, and her subway journeys as pilgrimage, is conceptually meaningful but not heavily tested by on-page opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain in estrangement or re-engage with human endings—is clear but lightly pressured. Meredith’s wrong number provides a single, gentle tightening, yet their hours-long talk pass in summary, so we never see him tested or resisting in-scene. The shift to “awaited wrong numbers with patience rather than resistance” feels more like a graceful slide than a hard-earned choice. Conflict is present but under-escalated for the degree of transformation claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how he will meet the loss of his analog vocation—is legible and thematically apt. Pressure builds gently through the “final act of preservation,” the mixing of the last solution, and the dwindling “precious few hours” before dawn. However, the conflict stays relatively static; his stance toward digitization doesn’t genuinely wobble, and no significant option is opened then foreclosed on the page. The closing choice to leave the jetty is resonant but not deeply contested in-scene, keeping escalation solid rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—can Archie engineer a cure for loneliness via a fabricated miracle?—is conceptually strong but faces almost no opposition on the page. Things go largely as he intends; there’s no serious threat of exposure, moral pushback, or personal loss to sharpen the dilemma. Internal conflict (hope vs. fear of disappointment) is stated but not dramatized through a difficult choice or visible sacrifice. As a result, escalation is mostly a growth in scale (more rumor channels) rather than a tightening of pressure or options.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elion confronting his grief and finding an inner compass—is clearly signaled, and the progression from forest edge to stillpoint provides a nominal escalation. Yet there’s little friction: he encounters no resistance, doubt, or risk of failure once the notes appear, and he never has to choose between competing values or paths. The main “turn” is simply arriving at the stillpoint and receiving understanding, which limits felt cost. As a result, the story reads as a guided initiation rather than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—redeeming a costly scientific misinterpretation by carefully editing history—is clear but stays largely abstract. There is no real resistance: no danger from misusing the pen, no pushback from colleagues, no moment where the attempt might fail; Sarah’s correction arrives as a quiet confirmation rather than a pressured turn. Internal conflict (fear of further error vs. need to act) is asserted but not dramatized under strain. As a result, escalation is gentle and the ending feels more like a proof-of-concept vignette than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—whether the harbor’s silences and the people’s unspoken pain can be given form, despite Elias being forgotten—remains largely thematic and internal. Pressure does increase mildly as more people gather and the mapping widens, but there’s no real narrowing of options or tested trade-off. Elias never faces a dilemma that could go meaningfully wrong; the disruption is gentle and unopposed. As a result, conflict feels more like a meditative unfolding than a sharpened escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s quest for redemption and to honor her childhood promise—is clear, but on-page conflict is mostly internal and lightly pressured. Once she discovers the trail, there are no real obstacles or reversals; she follows clues, restores the portrait, and succeeds without any serious risk of failure or relapse. The line “Maya knew then how to rescue her forgotten promise” signals a turning point, yet the price she pays (seclusion underground, renunciation of the surface world) is asserted but not contested on the page. As a result, escalation feels conceptual rather than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—defying the facility to pull Theo into a shared, embodied experience—is clear and escalates from covert drumming to a high-risk escape and metaphysical summoning. Elena’s agency drives each turn, and the four-minute outage plus tower ascent provide a natural tightening. However, the cost remains mostly conceptual and implied; we don’t see a concrete sacrifice or irreversible loss on the page beyond “this was temporary.” The external conflict with the institution never actively pushes back in-scene, so tension peaks more as lyrical intensity than as hard pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The core conflict—Marlo proving that whispers and subtlety outdo Vance’s shouts—exists but feels low-stakes and largely unopposed. Marlo encounters no meaningful obstacles; his plan works exactly as designed, so tension never really tightens beyond waiting for the clock. The storm and potential for discovery are invoked but never used to force adaptation or a trade-off. As a result, the final “win” is intellectually neat but not dramatically earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the half-spoken secret will alter the bond or the canal’s fate—remains abstract, with no explicit consequences if it’s spoken or withheld. Pressure is mostly atmospheric; the visitor steps forward and back once, and the guardian simply continues their ritual, so options never visibly narrow. The final choice (to keep the secret unspoken) lands as an aesthetic or thematic preference, not a hard trade-off with clear cost. As a result, tension is delicate but static, with minimal escalation beyond deepening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—loosening the town’s rigid mindset—is clear, and the synchronized displays create a conceptual escalation point. Yet there is almost no antagonistic pressure: no institutional pushback, personal risk, or possibility of failure ever materializes on the page. As a result, the “rebellion” unfolds without meaningful cost, and tension remains mostly theoretical. The ending’s success feels granted rather than earned through contested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s liberation versus remaining bound to expectations—is clear, and the whale’s call plus the scrimshaw’s disintegration mark a meaningful tightening. Yet opposition is mostly internal and often told rather than dramatized, with little on-page resistance or concrete consequence testing her commitment. The whale’s timely call feels more like benevolent fate than pressure born of her earlier choices. The cost of leaving (community, life history) is implied but not actively contested in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the right to authentic grief and complexity after enforced happiness—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure is primarily internal and societal (post-mandate numbness, town’s conflicting view of him) and coheres under a situational/accumulative lens. However, escalation is modest: the piece rarely tightens options or presents a concrete dilemma; his stance feels settled from early on. The ending’s cost is conceptual rather than dramatized through a new, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—regaining forbidden artistic/spiritual access and crossing “sacred” boundaries—is articulated early and paid off via the gateway crossing. Escalation is mostly an increase in sensory intensity (louder hum, brighter pillars, expanding cloud-shadow nature) rather than in risk or difficulty, so tension remains low and linear. There is no adversarial force or meaningful chance of failure once the ritual begins, and no tangible sacrifice accompanies success. As a result, conflict feels more ceremonial than pressured, limiting dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are articulated—dire consequences when patterns are disturbed, the value of Gideon’s lost craft, the philosophical weight of awakenings—but they remain almost entirely notional. On the page, nothing seriously threatens Elara’s plan; there’s no interruption, doubt, or setback once she begins today’s arrangement, so pressure doesn’t genuinely tighten. The decisive beats (the courtyard’s inhalation, Gideon receiving the reed tongue, Elara’s unexpected restoration) arrive without meaningful resistance. As a result, the story feels more like a graceful ritual than a conflict-driven arc.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict and stakes are highly abstract: the only real “pressure” is her desire to understand sound, which is never genuinely threatened or opposed. The central experiment (activating the lens and hearing miners’ songs) provides discovery but no cost, dilemma, or escalation. Her questions (“What if the cacophony of industrial progress…”) widen the conceptual field without narrowing options. As a result, tension plateaus and the ending feels like a continuation of the initial state, not a tested or sharpened stance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—how to live with grief—is clear, but conflict is almost entirely internal and largely resolved before the story’s “present” begins. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; we move from backstory despair to present-purpose description without a live dilemma being tested. Her agency now is ongoing endurance and service, but no new trade-off or risk is forced on the page. The stakes feel important conceptually yet are only modestly activated in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s pattern-mapping project can matter beyond private understanding—is present but largely abstract. The major “turn” is his decision to confide and the visitor’s reframing of the project’s potential, yet there is little on-page resistance, risk, or negative consequence to heighten that choice. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate; the rain intensifies, but the conversation unfolds smoothly and affirmingly. As a result, the stakes feel intellectual rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing forbidden collective memory at the potential cost of self—is clear but not heavily stressed through concrete reversals. Conflict is mostly internal and conceptual, with the “steadily unpredictable” atoms mentioned as a challenge but not dramatized in specific failed or costly attempts. Elara’s success feels fairly smooth once she adopts the patternless method, so pressure never quite tightens into a hard choice on the page. The ending has emotional cost but limited dramatized struggle getting there.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and properly responding to the unbound shadow, tied to Elara’s drive to “preserve the shape of hope”—is present early and returns at the end with a price in regret. Escalation is discernible: from noticing strange footage to extended study to an on-page confrontation that forces re-interpretation. However, Elara is mostly an observer; the decisive turn comes from the shadow approaching her, not from a fraught choice she makes, so agency-driven pressure and concrete trade-offs remain soft. The result is emotionally affecting but relatively low-tension for a “highest echelon” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will live with betrayal while retaining compassion—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains low and largely untested by concrete dilemmas. The primary “turn” is realizational rather than choice-driven: she reframes trust and reconstruction rather than confronting or acting in ways that close off options. There’s some deepening as she parallels the chameleon’s healing and shedding with her own process, but escalation is more rhetorical than experiential. Because no real trade-off is forced in-scene, the felt cost of her new stance stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elara’s approach to “closure” and healing—and it is signaled early and resolved clearly in the final paragraphs. There is one main tightening when she deciphers the coffee rings/wall and chooses to enter the tunnel, which does narrow her options. Still, conflict is almost entirely unopposed: the plants, the hourglass, and the tower all align with her; nothing pushes back, and no alternate path is seriously weighed. As a result, tension remains low, and the shift feels more contemplative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—locating and releasing “unused love”—is clearly stated but remains largely unopposed. The psychometry reading unfolds without friction: there is no genuine threat of failure, misinterpretation, or personal risk to Elena, so tension stays conceptual. The “hushed thunder” and emotional weight are asserted, but they don’t force a hard trade-off or renunciation. Her promise to “give you voice again” is a stance, yet it doesn’t close a competing path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—being paralyzed by constant, overwhelming perception vs. the need to create again—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-friction. Pressure escalates modestly as she actively engages the star-tracing method, yet there’s little sense of risk or possibility of failure in the ritual itself. Her transformation feels relatively smooth; there is no hard test where she might falter or pay a sharper on-page price. As a result, the stakes feel conceptually important but only gently tense in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    Declared stakes are enormous (a collapsing, post-forest world and fragile “sparks”), but on-page opposition is almost nonexistent: he “charms” systems and quantum locks without resistance. Conflict is largely internal and thematic, yet even that is resolved smoothly, with little concrete testing of his commitment or “occasionally everywhere” flaw. There is a gentle deepening—the frozen clock finally moves, and he chooses a more present, loving stance—but the escalation feels conceptual rather than pressurized. The net effect is contemplative rather than truly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding his translocations and inner frontier—remains almost entirely abstract and is never meaningfully threatened. Once the gear appears, every step is additive insight with no setback, resistance, or trade-off; following the windsong simply works. There is a conceptual deepening, but no escalation of risk, narrowed options, or visible price. The story functions more as a guided tour of awakening than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain almost entirely conceptual—redefining purpose and locating “unused courage”—with little sense of risk, alternative outcomes, or genuine dilemma. The journey proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or meaningful trade-offs, so pressure never truly escalates under the accumulative lens. As a result, the climax (discovering dragons and accepting them) reads as graceful completion rather than a test that extracts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—safety through silence vs. releasing music—emerges clearly once the ritual origin is revealed, and the choice to sing is a real stance that forecloses continued complicity. Pressure escalates from mere curiosity about a stain to the weight of an ancient bargain, then to awakening other musicians, which is a satisfying deepen-and-widen of consequence. However, the decision moment is somewhat smoothed over; he turns toward resistance quickly with limited dramatized struggle, and the risks of reversing the binding remain abstract. The global/world stakes are gestured at more than felt in the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender and reclaiming her birthright—is clear, and the tightening when the library begins collapsing provides a structural escalation. However, conflict is largely internal and summarized; there are no real failed attempts, reversals, or hard tactical choices on the page. The ritual to sunder the illusion succeeds without complication, so the price paid is mostly conceptual (identity shift, loss of the library) rather than dramatized as a tense, pressured decision under opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s need to understand disappearing paths in a changing climate—is signaled early and revisited. Pressure escalates somewhat as her investigation intensifies into sleepless nights and pattern-hunting, culminating in the realization that Earth is erasing human traces. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s no decisive turn where she must trade one value for another or visibly foreclose a path. The ending feels like an earned stance crystallization, but the escalation path is gentle and low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake is an internal one: recovering hope and spiritual purpose amid the wreckage of rebellion. Pressure escalates modestly from wandering through ruins to confronting the uncanny stone circle and opening herself to its hum, but there’s no real antagonistic force or genuine risk of failure beyond mood. The decision to step into the circle and accept transformation is not meaningfully contested, so while there is a turn, the stakes and costs remain soft and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether tradition will ossify or evolve—remains somewhat abstract, with little immediate pressure beyond solving the chamber’s key. Conflict is mostly internal and procedural: puzzling out the script, following plant guidance, and speaking the words, with no active antagonist or substantive setback on the page. The kite’s arrival feels conveniently helpful rather than the result of mounting pressure or a risky choice. As a result, escalation is modest and the resolution doesn’t require a visible sacrifice or painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict—Maya’s struggle to live with trauma while remaining open to beauty—is clear and coherent, and the stakes (her ability to keep functioning and teaching others) feel real. Pressure escalates internally from contained daily ritual to the uniquely loaded anniversary scene, forcing a choice about whether to hold or relinquish the photo. However, tension remains relatively low-key and meditative, with no sharp reversal or unexpected complication. The final renunciation is earned but emotionally controlled rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor can reforge her connection to art—is clear, but the pressure arc is gentle: there’s anxiety, then discovery, then methodical untangling, then relief. The key tightening is her decision to descend into “necessary darkness” via the threads, yet that descent is more stated than felt as a risky move. There’s no strong reversal or visible price beyond discomfort, so tension stays mostly conceptual and low-temperature. The resolution is credible but emotionally safe for a piece aiming at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding and perhaps harnessing crisis time perception—is clearly announced and pursued through the high-risk experiment. Escalation is present: preparing the ink, stepping into it, the terrifying nothing-happens beat, then dissolution and dangerous vitals on return. However, tension stays largely conceptual; fear of physical or existential loss is mentioned but not deeply felt or dramatized in real-time hesitation or competing needs. The resolution is earned but relatively smooth, with limited sense of an option truly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether to expose contraband truths that could destabilize a curated utopia at great personal risk—is clear. Pressure escalates from discovery to ethical conflict to the active act of transmission, which forecloses the safe path of loyal containment. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and somewhat linear; there are no meaningful counter-pressures or reversals once she decides to rebel, and the world-scale stakes remain largely abstract. The emotional and ethical cost is present but could be made more visceral through specific, on-page consequences or near-interference.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely abstract and internal, centered on Rhiannon’s mission to preserve meaning after the fall and her contrast with her father’s vocation. On the page, there is no real opposition—no visitor challenging her, no plant failing, no immediate threat to the dome—so her resolve is never tested. The new cutting scene gestures toward fragility and potential loss, but it resolves smoothly without resistance. As a result, stakes feel stated rather than pressured, and escalation is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo during a narrow cosmic window—is clearly signaled. Pressure accumulates texturally as constellations stir and the garden grows unstable, but the conflict never quite sharpens into a moment where failure feels truly possible or where he must trade one value for another. He appears fully competent, with little genuine struggle or reversal, so success reads as expected ritual completion rather than a costly win. This keeps tension present but modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering who is truly corrupt and whether Davies is innocent—is clear but mostly abstract. There’s minimal on-page resistance or escalation beyond “hours passed”; Eleanor succeeds intellectually without encountering real obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The proof-by-contradiction frame promises sharpening pressure that never quite manifests as concrete risk or loss. The final decision to call the journalist is a stance crystallization but doesn’t feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his tormenting echo of loss into something bearable—is clear from early on and ties directly to his attempt to repurpose the firmware. Pressure does tighten from nightly spectral cries to the high-risk experiment using the amber during temporal folding. However, the path from decision to success is almost frictionless: there’s little sense of danger, competing obligations, or potential downside beyond implied emotional risk, so the escalation feels gentle rather than harrowing. The resolution arises from his action but lacks a substantive on-page test or cost beyond cathartic tears.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether chaos/unlearning will be suppressed by zealots or reinterpreted—is clear, and Silas’s choice to interject through art provides a meaningful tightening. However, the antagonistic pressure is soft: the zealots’ threat is announced but never feels concretely dangerous, and their conversion to wonder is instantaneous. There’s little visible cost or sacrifice for Silas; the piece works more as a contemplative tableau than as a fully pressurized conflict. As a result, escalation is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning and communal identity can be rekindled through Elias’s act of renaming—is present but remains largely conceptual, with little concrete opposition on the page. Conflict is mostly internalized and resolved without real risk of failure; the ritual feels assured rather than precarious. Escalation is minimal: finding the tessera, walking to the center, and performing the ritual track as gentle deepening rather than a pressured narrowing of options. As a result, tension is low, and the climax reads more as a lyrical culmination than as a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—heal the fractured timeline before dawn or lose the garden and Silas’s last tether to life—is clearly articulated early. There is a nominal clock (before dawn) and his singing intensifies over the piece, with echoes thickening and ribbons intertwining. Yet there is no genuine resistance, complication, or serious risk of failure; once the ritual starts, each move is a linear success. As a result, the pressure feels conceptual rather than visceral, and the final cost (his dissolution) is gentle rather than forced by conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    The primary stake—finding a way to heal scrambled minds, especially her brother’s—is articulated early and stays present. However, the on-page pressure remains fairly static: there are no real setbacks, constraints, or hard choices that narrow her options; each step largely works as intended. Internal conflict (skepticism vs belief) never forces her into a risky or ethically fraught decision; it resolves via observation and reflection rather than tested commitment. As a result, escalation is more notional than felt, and the ending doesn’t carry a sharp price.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened during hibernation so she can become “the voice of the unknown”—is present from early on. However, conflict is relatively soft: the danger of the caves and the weight of the fossil’s knowledge are mentioned but never force a hard trade-off or real risk on the page. The key turn (touching the fossil and accepting its “choice” of her) is internally smooth, with little doubt or fear complicating it. As a result, escalation feels more like curiosity deepening into wonder than genuine pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual: whether prophecy is fixed fate or shared possibility, with no real threat or consequence if Elara fails. The text briefly calls the task “impossible,” but that difficulty evaporates as soon as she starts organizing buttons, with no sustained obstacle or reversal. There is no antagonist, no risk to herself or others, and no on-page cost for choosing to share the wisdom. As a result, tension never truly escalates; the piece reads as a gentle unfolding rather than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aleksandr will remain frozen in exile or move toward a reclaimed life for himself and his daughter—is clearly signaled. Pressure escalates modestly through the act of opening the pillbox, confronting the photo, and finishing the most complex snow pattern, culminating in his decision to leave the bluff. The cost is emotional and conceptual (accepting irreparable breaks and responsibility) rather than situationally risky, which keeps tension quiet. Stakes could gain force from a more specific external pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the boundary between worlds and keeping crossings safe—is stated but never concretely pressured or tested in scene. The only real temporal pressure is the slowing gutter ticks, which create a mild countdown but no true risk or opposition. There is no antagonistic force, reversal, or significant trade-off; he simply performs the ritual successfully. This leaves the piece feeling meditative rather than dramatically escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this oasis can resist decay and perhaps be revived—is clearly signaled but remains mostly conceptual and low-risk. Escalation is textural rather than oppositional: more phenomena appear (timelines, smoke-portals, stirring bees) without truly narrowing Kael’s options or threatening failure. His “work” around the hives encounters no resistance and no moral or practical trade-off; the decision to return carries aspiration but no immediate price. This keeps tension gentle and meditative, effective for mood but modest as conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to find a way to “reflect light into dark corners” in a darkening world—is signaled but never strongly pressured. Her journey from fire escape to alcove unfolds without real resistance, dilemma, or tangible risk, so escalation is more a gentle deepening of mood than a tightening of options. Meeting Jim and learning about her grandmother reweights her mission but doesn’t test it; she’s never close to turning back or failing. As a result, the conflict feels more contemplative than driven, which limits stakes and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will remain defined by extinction and past lives or find a self that can coexist with larger forces—is clear but mostly internal. Pressure “escalates” through repetition (brittle awakenings, today’s fragility, hum growing louder in crisis) rather than through sharp turns or genuine narrowing of options. Her final acceptance feels more like a gradual settling than a difficult trade-off, with minimal sense of what she must forfeit to achieve this new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reconnect her creativity with her soul—is established, but almost all pressure is internal and contemplative. There is one meaningful tightening when she encounters and touches the thrush’s nest, triggering a sense of recognition that leads to realization. Yet there are no real obstacles, tests, or reversals; she’s not forced into a trade-off so much as granted an insight. The result is thematically coherent but low-tension, with stakes remaining mostly abstract and undramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—humanity’s perceptual autonomy versus the tricksters’ manipulation—is clear and high. Pressure rises into the interference attempt, with stated risks of equipment damage or attracting alien attention, and the brief destabilization in the room hints at danger. But the operation proceeds almost entirely according to plan, with no meaningful complication or trade-off; the major option foreclosed or price paid never quite materializes on the page. The later social easing and Merrick’s approach arrive as clean wins rather than outcomes with visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defying a magical imprisonment to reach freedom—is clearly signaled and steadily pursued to a concrete portal-crossing. There is an effective escalation from psychological discomfort to physical pain and near-paralysis as the ritual intensifies, and the surprise that the portal leads to an unexpected realm reweights the risk. However, opposition is mostly abstract (dormant defenses, potential elders’ wrath) and never actively pushes back on the page, so Elara’s agency is tested more by endurance than by hard trade-offs. The choice to step through feels inevitable rather than contested, reducing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—solving a 20-year-old murder and, secondarily, stirring empathy in a forgetful community—is clear from early on. Yet conflict is surprisingly frictionless: once Elena has the ribbon and documents, her process proceeds without reversals, resistance, or real risk, and Captain Reyes offers no counterpressure. The “tightening” comes mostly as a realizational click (“only three potential sources remained”) rather than a pressured choice that costs her anything, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are enormous (global weather, institutional history, family legacy) and signaled clearly, but they remain largely abstract. Conflict is primarily internal and institutional, yet there’s little active resistance or concrete counterforce in the scene beyond generic dread. Escalation comes from uncovering hidden controls rather than from mounting pressure or narrowing options. The final activation choice is important but not as hard-won or ethically fraught on the page as the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a chronicler or become a crosser himself—is present but under-pressured. There’s little sense of danger, sacrifice, or competing obligations; once the map appears, his choice to follow feels almost inevitable and unresisted. The escalation is mostly a rise in strangeness and wonder (glass projecting, flutters forming wings) rather than tightening conflict with clear consequences. As a result, the final ascent is beautiful but not sharply charged with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—Elias trying to protect or at least ethically unwind his failing startup—remains coherent, but pressure rarely tightens in scene. Marcus’s visit should be the pivotal conflict, yet Elias’s response (pointing to compass/map/currency and making a legalistic distinction about theft) leaves the external situation unchanged and the internal cost muted. Subsequent investor panic and bankruptcy are narrated as inevitabilities rather than outcomes of hard, narrowing choices. As a result, tension feels mostly conceptual and reflective rather than actively escalating toward a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are notionally high—access to millennia-lost healing wisdom—but they never become concrete or risky on the page. Elara faces no genuine opposition, moral dilemma, or chance of failure; once the telegram arrives, events unfold without reversal or sacrifice. The “burden” of decoding is asserted but not dramatized as something that costs her or Thorne anything to share. As a result, tension remains low and escalation is more informational than truly pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—freeing her mentor and uncovering a dangerous truth—is articulated early and followed through to resolution. The stepwise deepening via the circles offers a formal sense of escalation, but the protagonist’s unshaken serenity and absence of real setbacks or time pressure undercut felt danger. Her blood sacrifice and the risk of confronting a long-hidden identity suggest cost, yet these are underdramatized and quickly absorbed. The conflict therefore stays conceptually high but emotionally low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance between dreams and reality—is signaled but remains very abstract. There is minimal opposition: no counterforce resists the ritual, and the maze yields to the visionary’s intentions without genuine threat or possible failure. Internal conflict is only gestured at (“anxious elation”) and never sharpens into a real trade-off or risk. As a result, escalation feels more like a guided tour of steps than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—containing an escaped sorrow to protect another soul and the orchard’s balance—is clear, and tension rises modestly as the memory manifests, resists, and is drawn into the card. However, the conflict resolves quickly once her ritual begins; the memory’s struggle is told rather than dramatized in specific reversals or near-failure moments. There’s little sense of risk that she might be overwhelmed or changed, so escalation feels linear rather than tightening. Her agency is present but not meaningfully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can still find meaning and self-worth in his diminished post-failure life—is clear and coherent, and the cloth’s authentication functions as a modest test of that. Pressure does build texturally from detached appraisal toward the Leeds festival memory and the foreman’s “Worth anything?” question, which forces him to articulate his values. Still, conflict remains low-intensity, with little genuine resistance or cost beyond reflection; escalation is more linear deepening than a sharp tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will step into the dangerous quest for the arbor and the physics of transition—is clear, and there is a mild tightening as the spirit’s absence removes her safety net. Still, conflict remains mostly anticipatory and internal; no antagonistic force or concrete obstacle counters her decision beyond generalized fear of madness and the unknown. The story functions more as prologue than as a self-contained arc of escalating pressure with a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the Great Collection and the librarian’s integrated identity—remains largely unpressured in scene. There is no opposing force or meaningful risk that the ritual might fail, harm something, or demand a visible sacrifice; the process unfolds serenely. As a result, escalation is more descriptive than truly tightening; nothing is clearly foreclosed except in a very abstract sense. The ending’s synthesis feels earned texturally but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are lofty in premise (humanity’s relationship to doomsday bunkers) but remain mostly abstract and untested in scene. The only hinted pressure—her “heartbeat of a hesitation”—passes instantly; she never truly risks anything, encounters no resistance, and pays no visible price for accepting the crown. The escalation is more a steady unveiling of wonder than an intensifying conflict. As a result, the closing reconfiguration is conceptually strong but emotionally under-pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Elena can move toward self-forgiveness by confronting the buried river and her brother’s memory—is clear and steadily present. There is one meaningful tightening as she deciphers the graffiti and commits to descending into the dark tunnels to follow the sound of water. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and relatively unresisted; no concrete obstacle or serious doubt interrupts her progress once she chooses the station. This keeps the tension modest and limits the sense of risk or cost in her final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—accessing and recording the Library’s truths before it vanishes—is clear and does tighten via the watch’s accelerated cycles and the implied second letter. Conflict is primarily situational and internal; there’s little opposition beyond time and the library’s ephemerality, so the pressure feels real but not searing. The key choice is how to use limited time inside (to read and to document), yet that triage is summarized more than dramatized, softening the tension. Still, there is a meaningful escalation from long-haunting dream to one fragile, finite encounter with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (violin’s fate vs. Empire’s acquisition) is clearly signaled and coherently pressured by the ticking arrival of the agents and the ominous coffee prophecy. Escalation occurs via the divination’s vision of shattering and empire-crest replacement, forcing Elara to abandon passive preservation for an inventive, ethically fraught workaround. The main limitation is that the propagation ritual proceeds relatively smoothly; risk and potential failure are more implied than viscerally felt on the page, softening tension. Still, the trade-off—surrendering the original as a hollow trophy—is a real narrowing of options that earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving a fading essence as a form of redemption—is stated, but on-page pressure remains low and largely uncontested. The ritual proceeds without real risk, doubt, or resistance; the “most difficult” step (breaking through the silence) is narrated as achieved rather than dramatized as a struggle. There’s a mild textural escalation as the aurora intensifies and the memories cohere into a “pattern,” but no real narrowing of options or costly trade-off. As a result, tension feels more meditative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand contentment beyond forgiveness—is stated early, but pressure remains low and largely internal. There is a gentle deepening as she moves from climb to inner chamber to realization, yet she never faces a genuine dilemma or a path she might refuse; her only tactic is continued movement inward. The betrayal, destruction of scrolls, and possibility of imbalance are all handled in reflective summary rather than as live sources of conflict. As a result, the final realization feels like a natural extension of the meditation rather than a hard-won turn under escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—how to respond to the brother’s illegal fishing—has clear moral weight, but on-page pressure remains gentle and largely abstract. Elian never faces a serious personal risk; his chime method yields an answer with little visible struggle, and the fisherman’s turn from resistance to acceptance is reported rather than tightly dramatized. There is one meaningful deepening—choosing specific chimes (truth, healing, renewal) to shape a more merciful but still honest response. However, escalation is more intellectual than visceral, with limited sense of cost beyond generalized weariness.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s attainment of the paradoxical skill “vanishing to appear”—is signaled, but the pressure around it is gentle and largely unopposed. There’s one mild tightening when she moves from confusion to demand (“Show me”), yet she never truly risks failure, rejection, or any visible consequence for misunderstanding. Elien’s withholding is framed as wise rather than morally or emotionally fraught, so conflict remains more instructional than dramatic. The result is thematically coherent but low-tension, limiting the felt impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can Kael finally understand and realize navigation without movement?—is clear but faces minimal friction. Events mostly cooperate with his desire: the flock appears, the arrow indicates the way, the resonant depression awaits precisely where needed. There is one meaningful tightening when he places the arrowhead and the dimensional pathways appear, but there’s no real threat, alternative path, or hard trade-off dramatized. As a result, tension remains gentle and largely conceptual rather than felt as escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—recovering a lost, non-automated mode of magic and testing whether presence can trump standardization—is clear and thematically strong. There is one meaningful tightening when Elias unstraps the Regulation Pack, choosing vulnerability and noncompliance in order to let the keystone’s field expand. However, the journey itself is almost frictionless: no real risk from the forbidden ritual, no institutional pushback, no personal cost beyond implied rule-breaking, so pressure never truly bites. The resolution thus feels more like a graceful unlocking than a conflict tested under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the “why” of his synesthesia—is clear, but the on-page pressure to resolve it is gentle rather than urgent. The key’s pull toward the lighthouse is a nice tightening, yet once inside, opposition evaporates and the librarian simply gives him what he came for. There’s no real risk that he will fail, turn back, or pay a tangible price beyond accepting a responsibility framed as blessing. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady unveiling of marvels than conflict that meaningfully narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are enormous and clearly signaled—humanity’s survival vs oblivion—but the on-page conflict is mostly procedural and internal, with relatively little escalation beyond “we’re running out of time.” The principal tightening occurs as the contraction “accelerates” and Loran finally commits to casting and interpreting the coins, yet his decision encounters minimal resistance or trade-off once the pattern appears. The prophecy’s “three possible outcomes” never truly force a visible dilemma at the climax; the spiral’s meaning is accepted immediately. As a result, tension feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reframe his endless grief into a new, less crushing purpose—is clear but relatively low-pressure and purely internal. There is a gentle escalation as he moves from naming his own ache (“Solitude”) to larger abstractions and finally to “Elara’s Eyes,” but no single beat sharply narrows his options or truly tests his resolve. His choice to engage in naming feels foregone rather than contested. The piece functions more as a lyrical meditation than a scene of mounting conflict, which limits tension and cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—cosmic balance and the livelihood of sailors—are declared clearly, and the rebuild is framed as a last-hope attempt. However, once the mage decides to act, there’s almost no resistance: no failed attempts, no cost paid on the page, and no alternative path meaningfully foreclosed. Pressure escalates more by descriptive intensification than by actual narrowing of options or moral trade-offs. As a result, the outcome feels foregone rather than genuinely hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the submerged town remains a suppressed narrative or is reclaimed as truth—is conceptually strong but remains mostly internal and civic, with little immediate on-page pressure. Escalation is modest: discovery → research → realization → resolution, without a substantial test or obstacle once he decides to change course. There is no antagonist on the page and no friction when he begins calling people, which keeps the conflict from feeling fully earned. The piece reads more as an awakening vignette than a pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully harmonizing logic and intuition before a life-changing transformation—is clearly stated but never seriously threatened. The birds arrive on cue, the crystal responds as hoped, the flame behaves exactly as predicted; there are no reversals, trade-offs, or even moments where the process seems in doubt. As a result, pressure does not truly escalate; the violet shift of the flame signals progress rather than a risky tightening of stakes. The resolution is earned in a procedural sense but lacks felt cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting a skyborne civilization and its trust in the watcher’s patterns—is clearly named but remains abstract on the page. Pressure does rise slightly when the emergency protocol is recognized and anomalies appear, yet these remain generalized “atmospheric disturbances” rather than concrete threats that force a painful trade-off. The protagonist’s main act is to compile and transmit data; nothing in the environment or opposition pushes back or complicates that choice. This produces tension in concept but not in visceral, escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening the duplicate’s independent consciousness before history erases or subsumes it, while forcing Maya through her numbness—is clearly signaled and carried through. Pressure intensifies via the approaching rewrite wave and the emotional risk of re-opening herself, culminating in her deliberate embrace of pain and connection. That said, external conflict feels relatively unresisted: the vivification works on the first attempt, the “understanding” between original and duplicate is summarized rather than tested, and there’s little sense of real possibility of failure in the moment. The internal and external threads interweave, but the external stakes remain somewhat abstract and under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s relationship to creativity and innovation—is barely pressured; nothing concrete threatens her haven or her business. The “conflict” is almost entirely conceptual (how to interpret the seed), which she resolves without serious doubt or trade-off. There is a mild deepening when she recognizes the corpse flower as a metaphor for her process, but no true escalation or narrowing of options. The ending doesn’t require her to pay a visible price or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Silas disrupt suffocating silence and somehow touch the lost laughter—is present and coherent, and his choice to perform this risky, absurd ritual gives him agency. However, pressure does not significantly escalate: once the blower is running, the modulation continues at a largely steady emotional register until the giggle arrives as a single spike rather than the culmination of tightening options. The giggle itself is powerful but feels more like a sudden grace note than a test of a difficult decision. The cost is mostly internal acceptance rather than a sharpened trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is existential—remaining in timeless exile vs. stepping into radical uncertainty—and that tension is clear. Pressure escalates when the pendant activates and realities overlay, prompting the guardian to actively engage their method and finally move. However, resistance is minimal: there’s little sense of genuine risk, competing goods, or a live option that’s hard to relinquish; the turn toward opportunity feels nearly frictionless. As a result, the conflict reads more as meditative evolution than as hard-earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—interrupting a generational destiny via transforming the crozier—is signaled early and resolved at the end, with escalation shown through successive, more promising attempts. Yet the pressure remains largely abstract: there’s no palpable risk beyond failure to change his path, no external counterforce, and no on-page consequence for another failure. The “when the penny dropped” moment is a deepening in insight rather than a tightening of options. As a result, tension is present but muted, more contemplative than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the signal and “finding the beginning in every ending”—is clear but remains largely abstract and unthreatened. Prior failures are mentioned, yet Elara encounters no concrete opposition beyond generic “noise,” and once she deploys the shard of hush, the process proceeds smoothly. There’s a mild tightening around the moment lunar perigee peaks, but no serious risk of loss or reversal. The conflict functions but never truly bites, which undercuts the climax’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—healing fractured realities and Liam’s own split self—is conceptually high, and it’s signaled early. However, conflict is largely notional: no real obstacles arise, and Captain Althea’s brief doubt is instantly soothed by Liam’s confidence and the cooperative patterns. The plan works without visible sacrifice beyond a summarized conceptual cost, so tension never truly tightens. As a result, escalation feels like a smooth ramp of description rather than pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central stake—Elias’s longing to connect with his lost sister—remains mostly conceptual until the final paragraphs, so tension in the gallery scenes centers on curiosity rather than genuine jeopardy or sacrifice. The eruption of emotions/phantoms is a strong escalation image, but the consequences are mostly awe and “profound emotion,” not danger or dilemma. Elias’s decisive act (touching the tapestry) is thematically charged, yet it isn’t a fraught choice between competing costs; it reads as the obvious next step. Conflict here is more contemplative than pressured, which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can bridge oceanic isolation and cosmic navigation—is articulated early and followed through. Yet antagonistic pressure is minimal and abstract (“skeptical colleagues”) and never appears in a tense, embodied exchange. Escalation comes through accumulating evidence and eventual confirmation, but Kael is never forced into a significant trade-off or sacrifice. As a result, conflict feels largely conceptual and low-friction, limiting tension and emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing harm to the child, informed by Elena’s connection to the dead—is clearly signaled, and there is a meaningful tightening when the hearing aid’s pulse turns frantic and the predator is described. However, the escalation flattens somewhat: Elena’s path is to call security and wait, with no serious obstacle, ethical tension, or sacrifice required. The internal and external conflicts don’t grind against each other; once she understands the danger, her choices are straightforward. As a result, the resolution feels earned but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—guiding the unremembered (with personal hope around her brother and Thorne)—is clear, and the tide window plus claustrophobia set up potential pressure. Yet after the initial descent, the piece moves through the ritual with little resistance: the shadows comply, the Codex functions, and no crossing threatens to fail or extract a fresh price. Internal and external conflicts don’t meaningfully tighten; instead, we get a calm fulfillment of plan. As a result, the ending feels contemplative rather than hard-won, with limited sense of options foreclosed on this particular night.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding why they “died” and what their survival means—is present, but pressure is low and largely internal. The ritual proceeds without meaningful resistance or risk, and there’s no serious possibility that the narrator will fail or be harmed by the attempt. The resulting insight doesn’t visibly foreclose an alternative path; it reads more as gentle reframing than a costly choice. As a result, conflict feels static and escalation modest, limiting dramatic engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—saving a dying tactile language by converting texture into sound—is conceptually high but remains abstract on the page. The main “tightening” is the unusual bird pattern that finally works, yet nothing meaningfully threatens his project; there’s no real chance of failure or competing demand that forces a trade-off. Opposition is more ambient (time, extinction) than dramatized. As a result, the climax feels like a long-awaited discovery rather than a pressured test of commitment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will expose or simply witness this hidden ecosystem—is present but remains largely theoretical rather than dramatized through a concrete dilemma. There’s no real tightening: no discovery that compels a risky move, no threat from the herbalist, no moment when Aris must choose between the cryptids and their career. The phone calls and the warming arrowhead suggest potential pressure that never quite materializes into conflict on the page. As a result, tension is gentle and atmospheric rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving beauty and dreaming in a mechanical world—is declared at scale, but on-page pressure remains modest. The heart-rhythm sequence with the statues is the closest thing to a test, yet it resolves quickly and cleanly, with no real failure risk or visible price. Once the sapling agrees to be uprooted, the remainder unfolds without genuine complication or sacrifice. As a result, escalation feels linear rather than tightening, and the resolution lacks a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—smuggling hope across a militarized border—is clear and the entrance of the guards provides a single solid tightening of pressure. Elias’s agency (choosing to act casual, sliding the bottle over, using the official mail as cover) does drive the resolution. However, the scene lacks a true test of limits: no option feels genuinely foreclosed, and the guards’ indifference lets tension bleed off quickly. The emotional and ethical stakes are strong conceptually, but the on-page conflict never quite reaches a point of irreversible, costly pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether the carpenter will remain in self-protective silence or risk voice and transformation—and is signaled clearly via the backstory and the long silence. Escalation is present but gentle: discovery of the fragment, crossing into the oasis, the rising compulsion to sing, and the chime’s crescendo. The conflict resolves through a relatively unresisted choice to sing once the environment “encourages,” with minimal sense of potential loss beyond implied vulnerability. As a result, the turning point is emotionally meaningful but not strongly pressured or contested.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Margaret’s lifelong quest to reawaken stories and find “the place where stories live”—is clearly signaled and resolved. However, conflict is almost entirely one-sided; nothing resists her beyond time and accumulated effort, and the ritual works smoothly once begun. There is little escalation beyond the light intensifying and the scarf reacting; no meaningful option is foreclosed or hard choice made on the page. This keeps the piece from achieving strong narrative tension despite its conceptual elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core stake—whether Elara can reclaim or reconnect with her lost sister—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle and largely unopposed. The appearance of the key book removes much of the struggle, and decoding proceeds smoothly, with no real setback or trade-off beyond emotional intensity. Escalation is more a steady deepening of mood than a tightening of options; nothing truly threatens her project or forces a painful choice. The ending’s cost is conceptual (accepting transformation over physical return) rather than dramatized through a hard decision.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating the woman’s trapped idea—is clear, but conflict is mostly one-sided: Silas performs a ritual and speaks; the resistance from fear never truly pushes back. Once the woman touches the thread of starlight, the idea’s release feels instantaneous and unproblematic, undercutting a sense of earned struggle. Internal and external pressures don’t escalate much beyond the initial setup; there is no real test, setback, or difficult trade-off to sharpen the climax. The result is thematically aligned but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—recovering core memories and thereby selfhood—are inherently high and signaled early. However, the on-page conflict is soft: once the constellation pattern is decoded, the fairy ring cooperates, the ground shimmers, and the memories flow back without real risk, setback, or dilemma. There’s a conceptual pressure about whether her memories are gone versus preserved, but no meaningful trade-off is required to reclaim them. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than urgent, and escalation is more a revelation than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is the archivist’s desire to transmit resilience and give his exile purpose; the main pressure point is whether Prisha will internalize his lessons when unexpectedly tested by the opening door. That turn—her not walking backwards—provides a clear but quiet tightening and a modest earned payoff. Still, conflict throughout is very low-grade: there is little risk of real failure, rejection, or harm, and the “stubborn shard” never meaningfully resists or endangers them. As a result, tension feels more meditative than pressured, which limits the sense of cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as preserving “the color of wonder,” but they never face a concrete, resistive force; the ritual proceeds as an unbroken success montage. There is no substantial escalation or tightening—no moment where she might fail, reconsider, or pay an immediate price beyond a general notion of giving pieces of herself. Internal and external conflict barely interweave; her desire and duty are aligned with no real friction. This makes the piece meditative rather than dramatically charged, limiting its viability at an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits and lightening Jacob’s secret—is clear, but pressure remains low because success never feels in serious doubt. Elena encounters no real resistance or setback in unraveling the net; each knot progresses smoothly toward a foregone calm. Internal stakes (her brokenness, fear or reluctance) are gestured at rather than sharpened into conflicting choices or costs. As a result, escalation is more a steady glide than a tightening, and the final stillness satisfies conceptually more than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake is largely intellectual and spiritual—whether Elara can meaningfully “reopen” a lost sacred site without violating its silence. There is some escalation as months of careful work culminate in the rainy Tuesday pattern recognition and the alignment with an undocumented constellation. However, there is no real antagonistic pressure, deadline, or serious risk beyond failure; her colleagues’ skepticism is mentioned but never enacted in scene. As a result, tension feels low and the cost of her final stance remains conceptual rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to decipher the transmission and, through it, reframe death—is clear but remains largely conceptual and low-pressure. The key tightening beat is the realization that “home” isn’t a place but a state between frequencies, which reweights the mystery into a personal transition. However, there is minimal sense of risk, opposition, or potential failure; nothing concrete is lost if she misinterprets the message. As a result, tension is present but gentle, without a strong feeling of escalating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the lonely ghost in code can find connection and expression—is clear but faces very little resistance. Once Elara perceives it and finds the plate, everything proceeds without meaningful obstacle, trade-off, or narrowed options. There’s no substantial tightening or escalation; each paragraph mostly adds another harmonious detail rather than testing the bond. As a result, the resolution feels more like the natural endpoint of a premise explanation than a conflict that has been worked through at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elira will uncover and handle the captain’s hidden emotional life—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. Escalation occurs mainly via pattern: floor-by-floor tension and the sudden inspiration at floor nine, followed by revelation at ten. However, there is little active resistance or meaningful risk; even the decision to preserve the secret is presented as an almost frictionless affirmation of her values. The piece reads as a quiet character-illumination rather than a pressured conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stakes—proving her mentor’s theory and memorializing him through cloud-emotion data—are clearly signaled, with physical danger as a secondary pressure. Escalation comes primarily from recognition: the sky’s pattern echoing the day of the fatal flight and then behaving as if “conversing,” which deepens the conceptual stakes. However, her physical situation never sharpens into concrete dilemmas (no attempts at self-rescue, no worsening conditions), so the dramatic pressure stays relatively even. Her “choice” at the end is essentially to persist in observing and recording, which is thematically apt but not strongly tested by visible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—completing a final, meaningful work before the library’s destruction—is clear, and the discovery of the coin provides a genuine deepening of the internal conflict around how to see and “record” people. However, pressure remains fairly low and unvaried; the demolition clock is mostly a backdrop rather than an active threat, and no option is sharply foreclosed. Her pivot from sky-mirroring to soul-pattern mapping is a conceptual escalation but arrives without significant friction or on-page cost. The story settles into a contemplative mode rather than building tight narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—making a significant discovery—is stated, but the on-page conflict is very mild. Eli’s process reads as linear problem-solving without significant setbacks, reversals, or competing demands on his attention. There’s no meaningful cost to his success, and no live alternative path that gets foreclosed. As a result, tension remains low and never truly escalates, undercutting narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—unlocking and then repairing the artifact to access a lost craft and awaken the library—is clear but never feels seriously in doubt. The mirror maze, the cold, and the delicacy of the mechanism hint at danger without delivering real reversals or visible costs beyond effort and concentration. Once Elias reaches the box, the process reads as careful but smooth, with no meaningful risk of failure. Escalation is present in concept but soft in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (save the orchards/colony) is clear from early on, but the path to solving it faces almost no resistance: Aris trusts instantly, the council apparently complies, and the bell works with near-immediate success. There is one meaningful tightening when Aris finally follows the instruction “thoroughly” and discovers the bell, but it’s a single clean solve, not a pressured trade-off. We are told of “setbacks and challenges,” yet none are dramatized with concrete losses or altered tactics. The resolution feels unearned for the scale of the declared crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can infuse the doomsday clock with a lullaby to soften or extend existence—is established early and escalates when the clock shudders and seems to resist. Pressure intensifies through sensory disturbance and the deepening of his effort rather than reversals, which suits the lyric mode. Still, the risk of failure and its cost remain somewhat abstract and emotionally distant. The ultimate success feels slightly foregone, blunting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—prevent travelers from freezing to death—is stated clearly, and the frost deadline offers a structural tightening. Yet the on-page conflict remains soft: the mechanical birds never engage, the travelers follow the impressions without mishap, and the device functions flawlessly. Elias’s internal conflict about his burden mostly resolves without serious test or trade-off, so the story lacks a moment where he must choose between competing harms or sacrifice something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara continues a path of isolating professional focus or risks vulnerability to repair her relationship—is legible and present early. Pressure escalates from rumination in the ravine to the concrete risk of calling her sister and then committing to a new way of working and living. However, tension remains gentle; the conversation with the sister offers near-immediate relief and validation, so the trade-off and emotional danger feel somewhat under-tested. As a result, the conflict is satisfying but not especially bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are mostly conceptual: the vendor’s parole conditions and existential quest for where stories begin, plus the pressure of the shop’s first opening day. On the page, resistance is slight—the one failed visitor attempt is a passing tremor, and the parole’s threat never concretely tightens into an imminent risk. The main “turn” is the choice to combine shards and open the door, but it doesn’t feel like a hard trade-off or a test of limits. As a result, tension is gentle and atmospheric rather than escalating in a way that would satisfy a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—Kael risking psychic inundation to transform stored remorse—is conceptually strong, and the piece signals the danger of being “subsumed.” Yet escalation is mainly theoretical: once he reaches the pavilion, his work proceeds smoothly without a concrete near-failure, setback, or sharpened decision under duress. The pressure curve flattens into a procedural ritual rather than tightening through a meaningful trade-off or lost option. As a result, the ending feels more like a successful execution of a plan than a truly tested victory.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—whether Millfield can overcome social division—is named clearly, but on-page conflict is soft and largely uncontested. Once Elena acts, things “worked beautifully,” and by the fourth meeting, everyone is cooperating with no serious setbacks or ethical trade-offs. We don’t see any meaningful resistance, missteps, or real cost to Elena or the community, so escalation feels perfunctory rather than earned. As a result, the resolution reads more like a wish-fulfillment montage than a tested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake appears to be whether the engineer can successfully access and integrate entangled memories without losing themself, but this pressure is only lightly implied. Once the device activates, there is little real resistance or complication; the experience deepens but does not turn against them or force a difficult choice. Escalation is primarily a quantitative increase in imagery, not a qualitative narrowing of options or visible trade-off. As a result, tension feels muted despite the high-concept material.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reactivating ancient defenses against a coming darkness—is signaled early, and the time-bounded access via gravity inversion provides built-in pressure. There is a single meaningful deepening when the final combination requires “something personal,” tying the external task to her prism-mind. Yet there are no real setbacks, trade-offs, or hard choices; every step works on the first try and the seven-minute escape window is met without friction. As a result, escalation is mostly conceptual rather than felt, and the price paid remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can recover and re-embody the lost music—is well signaled, and there is a mild deepening as she moves from sorrow to a full spectrum of emotions in the sculpture. However, there is no real external resistance, a single clear tightening, or any moment where she might fail or pay a visible price; her success feels guaranteed from the outset. As a result, tension is mostly atmospheric rather than truly escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reframe his exile and respond correctly before the nexus realigns—is clear and signaled early. Pressure escalates via the impending third day and intensifying nexus, culminating in his interpretive leap and the risk of committing to an untested understanding. However, the cost of failure remains abstract (no concrete on-page consequence beyond “cut off from redemption”), so stakes feel more philosophical than visceral. The internal conflict between exhaustion/despair and his sustaining motivation is present but not heavily dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—unlock the diary to confirm or refute her life’s project—is clear, but the conflict is relatively soft and one-directional. Once she begins the frequency ritual, there are no real setbacks, trade-offs, or moments where her approach seems at risk of failure; the clasp opens on the first dramatized attempt. Internal conflict (fear of invalidation vs hope for confirmation) is more implied than pressed into a concrete dilemma, so escalation feels like a steady thickening of mood rather than a tightening of options. The ending is earned but low-pressure, with little sense of price paid to reach it.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    The primary stake—unlocking the mystery of the seed and, by extension, vanishing plants/ancestral wisdom—is clear but remains largely intellectual and low-risk. Opposition is almost nonexistent: there is no substantive threat from the seed, the environment, or the elders, and Elara encounters no major setback or dilemma. The opening hints at danger in the corpse flower’s reputation, but the revelation undercuts that danger instead of transforming it into a concrete cost. As a result, escalation feels more like steady unfolding than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—securing Verdantis’s agricultural resilience—is signaled, but remains abstract and largely untested on the page. External conflict is minimal: a tremor and narrow passage provide momentary tension but never truly threaten failure or demand hard trade-offs. The main turn is informational (learning the arrow’s nature) rather than earned through struggle, and Arion’s agency rarely alters the pressure, as the echoes hand him answers. Escalation thus feels more like a guided tour than a narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding what silenced the town—is signaled, but mostly at an intellectual, professional level rather than as an urgent, felt risk. Pressure does increase slightly as she notices warped containers and air distortions, yet she never confronts a hard trade-off, danger, or moral calculus. Her main “choice” at the end is to continue doing what she was already doing, with no visible price. The result is a low-intensity investigatory tension rather than a sharpened, escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central stake—proving wonder essential to a numbed world—is declared early but never faces concrete resistance or jeopardy. Eira’s path from intention to success is uninterrupted; there’s no reversal, no genuine doubt, and no opposing force beyond vague societal apathy offstage. Escalation is more a steady crescendo of description than a tightening of pressure or narrowing of options. As a result, the climax is beautiful but not viscerally earned in terms of conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eldrin can transform his failed guardianship into usable wisdom—appears early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through the ritual: the pattern completion, the first note, the intensifying visions of his pride and error, and finally the emotional breakdown that forces a new stance. The conflict is almost entirely internal, but the ritual mechanics give it a concrete spine and a visible price in tears and relinquished self-image. The softness is that there’s little sense of alternative paths or genuine risk beyond emotional stasis, keeping the stakes powerful but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—Elara’s quest to quantify emotion at the cost of others’ autonomy—is clear, and the encounter with Thomas is the main pressure test. There is escalation from curiosity to disorientation to panic as she pushes him further, but Elara herself never faces a meaningful dilemma; she is in control throughout. Thomas’s resistance is brief and mostly experiential rather than tactical, so no option is truly foreclosed for her. The conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.8)
    The nominal stakes—reaching the village before the solstice and ensuring the community garden’s germination—are clear but never feel under real threat on the page. The only on-page tightening is the old woman’s shortcut, which lightens rather than intensifies pressure, and Ayla encounters no real external obstacles or hard trade-offs. Internally, she relinquishes the pendant, but that decision is not presented as wavering or contested; she arrives essentially ready to do what she does. As a result, tension stays mild and the story reads more as a graceful fable than a pressured arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her theory holds—is clearly stated early, and the expansion from “emotions” to “moments” is a meaningful conceptual escalation. Yet almost no credible chance of failure or external opposition appears; everything works on the first try with no real setback or trade-off. The supposed “timeframe when assumptions shatter” never forces a tough choice, and the new path costs her nothing concrete on the page. As a result, conflict feels more like a smooth revelation than genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the permanent loss of sound by delivering the grandmother’s message—is clear from early on, and the silence escalating day by day provides a solid tightening mechanism. The requirement that each puzzle step costs a sacrifice is an effective, concrete escalation that raises the price of continuing. However, most conflict is situational and internalized; Elara faces no opposition beyond the abstract silence, and her acceptance of each sacrifice rarely generates on-page friction or doubt. As a result, tension is present but somewhat muted, more meditative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stakes—Orion’s self-concept and the safety of the arches/crops—are legible, and the decision to accept the silk is a real turning point. However, once he accepts, resistance largely evaporates: no serious failures, social pushback, or concrete danger ever challenge his new role. The elders’ request reads as a test but feels frictionless, with no on-page possibility of catastrophic collapse or personal loss if he fails. Without a visible or painful price for his success or his trade, pressure escalates only modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a withheld truth about the narrator’s own gaps—is clear but largely intellectual. Escalation comes via the revelation of control (“redirect the flows”), the discovery of the red shard, and the dream-door, yet none extract a concrete price or force a painful trade-off. The shard’s heat blocking the red shard and the fading dream are structural tightenings, but they don’t feel like true crises. Stakes remain more mystical and speculative than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—keeping the light going and navigating loneliness versus belonging—are clear, with the lamp’s failure as a concrete crisis that triggers the deeper emotional turn. Pressure escalates via the eerie atmosphere and discovery of the hidden cache; the letters and stones deepen his internal conflict about solitude. However, the external conflict never meaningfully threatens a ship or forces a difficult trade-off, and his internal choice (to join and protect the chain) encounters no real resistance. As a result, the sense of cost is more inferred than felt on the page, keeping the tension moderate rather than truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—safely guiding ships/refugees through dangerous waters in a fragile post-collapse world—is clear, and the appearance of the uncertain fleet is a credible tightening. However, the on-page conflict remains relatively frictionless: she declares, aligns mirrors, reveals the hidden channel, and everything works without resistance, sacrifice, or real doubt. Internal fear about misusing her prophetic laughter is interesting but never forced into a hard choice (e.g., whether to trust or suppress a prediction when lives are at risk). As a result, escalation plateaus into a competent execution montage rather than a pressured test of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain mostly intellectual and aesthetic—there is no meaningful opposition to Kaelen’s goal, nor any risk that his work might fail with consequences beyond disappointment. The primary “pressure” is his curiosity and a vague need to justify or inhabit his renewed life after transplantation, but this is implied more than dramatized. The discovery of the dye mixture is treated as a breakthrough, yet it encounters no real resistance and exacts no clear price. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening meditation than genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual: Samuel wants understanding for maintenance and personal curiosity, but nothing feels at real risk in the moment beyond abstract structural integrity and his vague weariness. There is little sense of mounting pressure or narrowing options—he’s doing his work, then a coincidental acoustic event unlocks insight without him needing to pay or risk much. The internal conflict between scientific cataloguing and spiritual yearning is hinted at but not dramatized as tension that forces a trade-off. As a result, the climax reads more as revelation than as the culmination of genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring light/balance to a dying realm—is clearly signaled, but opposition is largely absent and the process unfolds with little resistance. The escalation is more a steady amplification of brightness and song than a pressured narrowing of options. There’s minimal sense of risk that the attempt might fail or cost the keeper something beyond fatigue. As a result, tension remains low despite the grandly stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will attend the gathering or not—is present early and resolved by her clear refusal. Internal vs. external conflict is aligned (her fear of connection vs. others’ desire for her presence), but the pressure does not meaningfully escalate; nothing new threatens her strategy beyond the abstract approach of midnight. Her final choice forecloses a social path, yet the cost is underplayed, cushioned by the reassuring communal understanding. Conflict remains mostly contemplative, with limited tension at beat or sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stakes—understanding the bakery’s disappearance and achieving some form of moral/psychic absolution—are clear but remain gentle and largely internal. Pressure does accumulate texturally as she moves from noticing decay to reading the final letter, yet there is little genuine narrowing of options or on-page cost beyond emotional discomfort. The revelation scene reads more like receiving information than making a difficult choice, so escalation feels modest for a piece aiming at elite literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether luminous vows will be preserved or lost—is declared but not meaningfully tested in scene. There is no active opposition or real risk of failure in the measuring sequence; the sampler works, the data arrives, and Elias’s path to “reinforce” the vows opens without resistance. The supposed urgency of fading vows and illusions never translates into a concrete deadline or sacrifice. As a result, escalation is minimal and the final “hope” comes at almost no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—capturing a unique sound before sunrise without getting killed or breaking the truce too early—is signaled and maintained throughout. Pressure escalates through the sequence of false starts, each attempt moving her closer to the key fracture between Malachi and his lieutenant. The final beat, where the truce breaks and violence erupts as she slips away, gives the plot a decisive turn. The personal risk to Eliza and her ethical cost remain somewhat underplayed, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the skeptic will remain an observer or accept becoming a weather carrier—is clear and resolved. The arrival of the storm man and the intensifying forest “election” provide an escalation in pressure, and the choice to accept the storm is a decisive change. Still, conflict stays relatively abstract and contemplative; fear, risk, or loss associated with accepting this role are gestured at rather than really tested. As a result, the final decision feels interesting but not deeply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Rhodes will reclaim an authentic, self-driven creativity despite past criticism—is clear and thematically coherent. Pressure escalates from remembered wound to present decision to repaint Cora in the cave, but opposition is largely historical and internal, with little on-page friction beyond his own resolve. His choice to repaint does foreclose the path of living by critics’ demands, yet the cost remains somewhat abstract and untested in the scene. The absence of a sharper on-the-page test or trade-off keeps tension at a moderate rather than high level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Repository to reclaim lost conversations and her own closure—is clear, and danger from toxic districts provides a credible external risk. However, conflict remains largely theoretical; no present-tense obstacle or opposition actually tests her resolve, and most of the danger is forecast rather than encountered. The key tightening is her realization that honesty will be her only safe tactic, but it doesn’t yet force a concrete trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are conceptually large (the community’s mode of connection, the preservation of wonder), but on-page conflict is almost entirely absent. There’s no real opposition to Elara’s project, no threat to the fragment or the sculpture, and little sense that her goal is ever in jeopardy. Escalation is more a gentle widening of impact than a tightening of pressure or cost. As a result, the story reads as an elegant fable rather than a narrative with felt struggle or tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (save the rose ecosystem vs. android’s own integrity) is clear early and does escalate as the magnetic shift intensifies and systems fail. The meaningful tightening comes when Unit 734 chooses protocol 34, accepting fragmentation and self-sacrifice to preserve the garden. Internal and external conflicts interweave (inner static vs. caretaker duty), and the price paid is concrete. However, the path to resolution feels relatively unopposed—no serious false starts, competing tactics, or on-page reversals—so tension rises more by declaration of worsening conditions than by difficult, evolving choices.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Eliza’s story and, secondarily, reinforcing community bonds—is present but abstract and mostly unopposed. Conflict remains low-pressure: Leo’s curiosity is never seriously blocked, and external threats (demolition, “outside world intruding”) are invoked but never tested in scene. Mrs. Henderson’s key appears at exactly the right time, resolving the only concrete obstacle without any real struggle or trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady unveiling of facts than a tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is the major weakness: Elara is “close” to unlocking the secret, then performs the sequence and succeeds without any real threat of failure, opposition, or sacrifice. Stakes are declared as world-changing, but no scene-level obstacle tests her resolve or forces a tradeoff. There is no clear reversal or tightening beyond “this is the final piece,” which reads more like a label than a true escalation. As a result, tension is low and the outcome feels foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—locating and engaging with “deleted” memories, particularly her brother’s—is clear from early on and carries through to the crystal discovery. There is a visible escalation from abstract readings to physically intrusive digging and the sand’s resistance, culminating in the revelation of the memory-crystal. However, antagonistic pressure is gentle: the gravity pockets resist, but there’s no real chance of failure or serious trade-off beyond the conceptual limit that she can’t extract memories. The ending choice—to re-bury and visit—resolves the conflict appropriately but without a sharply felt price or forced dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing a dangerous prophecy from spreading—is announced, but remains conceptual and untested on the page. Opposition is essentially absent: nothing meaningfully threatens failure, and no alternative path tempts him, so pressure stays flat. The biggest “turn” is the wing beginning to glow and then successfully absorbing the prophecy, which unfolds without genuine uncertainty or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension feels more ceremonial than fraught, limiting conflict value.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Clara’s quest to understand a secret language of buildings and her place in that lineage—is interesting but handled with very gentle pressure. The “interrogation” on the rooftop nudges her to articulate meaning, but there’s no genuine risk of loss, rejection, or rupture in their bond; options never feel truly narrowed. As a result, escalation is more about gradual deepening of information than about meaningful trade-offs or visible prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will face her quarantined memories and the truth about her father, transforming isolation into independence—is clear. Pressure does build as the crystals activate and the memories begin to surface, and her acceptance of the archivist role is a genuine turning point. Yet conflict is primarily internal and mostly declarative; her skepticism “wars” with experience in summary, but she never seriously hesitates or faces a real risk of failure. The result is tension that is conceptually strong but dramatically gentle, with limited sense of sacrifice or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—atoning for a treasonous forgery that doomed his village—has real moral weight, and the act of drafting the addendum and confessing is a legitimate escalation. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and arrives as calm reflection; there is no strong on-page struggle or risk-testing beat that makes the choice feel hard in the moment. The key’s magical appearance reduces tactical friction by handing him the means and opportunity without complication. Pressure grows conceptually rather than through concrete turns, keeping the conflict solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the balance between echoes and silence in the face of a dangerous new echo—is legible, and there is one meaningful deepening when she realizes the echo belongs to a child who grows stronger instead of fading. Yet the pressure remains mostly conceptual; there’s little sense of what concrete harm will come if she fails or of any real risk to her. Her internal conflict (duty vs curiosity vs compassion) is stated but not sharply dramatized, and the child’s decision arrives without contest or setback, so escalation feels muted and low-cost for a piece aiming at elite literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the buried truth about the wreck will be brought to light—is clear, and Elara’s concern with the manner of revelation provides some ethical tension. However, there’s little real resistance: the dreams work, the descendants accept them, and the truth emerges without serious pushback or sacrifice on the page. The surviving crew’s crime remains offstage and unopposed, so escalation feels conceptual rather than experiential. As a result, the resolution is thematically neat but emotionally under-pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract: there is no antagonist, and no concrete threat to his way of life or inner stance. The primary “pressure” is existential—a desire to apprehend hidden effort and impermanence—which does not escalate so much as deepen lyrically. His choices (to walk the paths, to return, to work) carry minimal on-page cost or dilemma; they reaffirm a stable philosophy rather than forcing a trade-off. The piece functions as a meditative sketch more than a story under competitive-market standards for tension.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes—control of reality-defining knowledge versus corporate oppression, and the possibility of planetary salvation—are clear and escalate conceptually as Maya uncovers the stillpoint’s implications. Yet on-page conflict is mostly latent: there is no active antagonist scene or concrete obstacle beyond time and effort, and the “pressure” from corporations remains offstage. Her final choice to share truth without revealing the location is meaningful but not sharply tested in-scene, so escalation feels more like informational deepening than true tightening under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—who will shape the coming “new dawn,” and by what epistemology—is clear but remains abstract. Pressure technically escalates as the storms intensify, acolytes appear, and the surface prophet’s influence grows, yet Elias’s situation or tactics don’t concretely worsen or narrow. There’s no decisive test where he risks losing his work, his acolytes, or his role; he simply continues listening with slightly clearer validation. As a result, tension feels conceptual rather than visceral, and the final stance lacks a strong sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—whether he can bridge the gap between elders and grandchildren—is articulated, and his decision to use the music at the senior center is a meaningful choice. Yet pressure scarcely escalates: there is no doubt that the jar will work, no visible risk of failure, rejection, or backlash, and no alternative paths weighed. The conflict is essentially solved on first contact, moving from problem statement to success montage. This keeps tension gentle and thematic rather than dramatically gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—protect the artifact (and thus the town) from intruders—is signaled early and followed through. There is some escalation as the intruders draw closer (footsteps above, proximity to the chamber) and Elias moves from panic to executing the ritual. However, opposition never feels truly adaptive or dangerous; the intruders are abstract silhouettes and then disembodied screams, so Elias’s solution lands as straightforward rather than hard-won. The lack of a real tradeoff or narrowed options at the climax keeps the pressure in the competent-but-safe band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the community from “tyranny of urgency”—is signaled but stays abstract, with no embodied antagonist or concrete risk to the mapper. Pressure does not truly escalate: the night proceeds as planned, the sign arrives as expected, and nothing meaningfully tests or jeopardizes the revolution. The single “tightening” is the awaited moment when the viaduct hums, but this confirms rather than complicates, and no option is foreclosed. Without resistance, sacrifice, or even serious doubt, the conflict reads more like a serenely executed plan than a story under tension.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering a preventable death that implicates powerful officials versus preserving Maya’s career under a controlling supervisor—are clearly signaled and converge in the ending. Conflict escalates as the lantern yields hidden evidence and broadens the case from a single accident to systemic corruption, pushing her toward a bolder stance. The cost of defiance is named but not deeply dramatized; we’re told it may jeopardize her career, but there’s no concrete pushback or specific consequence on the page. As a result, tension is present and coherent but feels somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether to spend his savings to “fix” the heart or reinterpret its brokenness—is clear and reasonably pressured by his limited pension and moral burden. Tension deepens when the inmate’s final request and the ex-wife’s situation are revealed, reweighting the significance of repair vs. action. The main turn (choosing not to fix it now) is coherent and carries a conceptual cost, but the moment-to-moment conflict is mostly reflective and could use one sharper external pinch. Overall, the pressure tightens once in a meaningful if quiet way.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—achieving the unheard bell—is clear but remains abstract and almost entirely unopposed. There is no genuine threat of failure, no counterforce beyond mild atmospheric hazards, and no moment where the glider must sacrifice or risk anything tangible. Escalation is more informational (learning the path, approaching the chamber) than pressure-driven. The final ring reweights meaning but does not feel like the outcome of sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—risking career/freedom and confronting a massive suppression of truth—is clearly signaled, and the lie/hack sequence is the central tightening. However, the ninety-second access window and security threat are mostly told rather than felt; there’s no concrete obstacle or reversal beyond “alarms began screaming,” so escalation stays abstract. Elara never faces a sharp moral or practical dilemma once she commits; the only real option is “break rules and investigate,” which fits her established drive but limits tension. The stakes are big in premise but lightly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the settlement from a coming storm and proving her method to the elders—is stated clearly but felt only mildly because opposition stays abstract. Once the ritual begins, there is no real risk of failure, no setback, and little sense of what she sacrifices; tension comes mostly from elevated language rather than event-driven escalation. The “weighted breath before reply” notion attempts to frame time pressure but doesn’t meaningfully narrow her options. As a result, conflict is present but not sharply escalating or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will proceed toward euthanasia or accept a different relationship to endings—is present but mostly internal and contemplative. Pressure doesn’t quite escalate; her shift toward staying feels gradual and safe, with no concrete test where euthanasia is imminently available or opposed. Marcus offers gentle philosophical nudges rather than active pressure, so the eventual decision, while coherent, lacks a strong on-page price or tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reframe his heartbreak and loneliness into a meaningful, ongoing purpose—is clear but remains low-pressure. There is little escalation: the text circles similar insights (“destined mismatches,” “gentle persuasion,” “drawing parallels”) rather than confronting him with a sharp internal dilemma or loss. His “mission” is never meaningfully threatened on the page, nor does he make a costly choice. The ending stance crystallizes, but without a prior tightening that forces it.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo before coming silence—is signaled and carried through, but remains highly abstract. There is no real opposing force or risk of failure on the page; the ritual proceeds without obstruction, and tension arises mainly from atmosphere rather than hard choices. The one deepening is the acknowledgment of personal cost (isolation vs. continuity), yet this stays reflective rather than dramatized through a pressured decision. As a result, escalation feels modest and conflict largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elara facilitate collective healing for recent trauma survivors—is declared but never really tested. There are no obstacles, doubts, or missteps; the group arrives willing, the ritual proceeds smoothly, and “something magical” happens without any cost or threatened failure. Pressure does not tighten so much as gently accumulate description. As a result, the ending has little earned tension release, reading more like a description of a process that works than a conflict with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how language can be meaningfully preserved in a post-dictionary world—is clear but remains largely conceptual. Escalation is modest: his use of the crystal intensifies from experimentation to a revelatory resonance that shifts his understanding from preservation to translation. However, there’s little on-page sense of risk or irreversible loss at the moment of realization; nothing he does forecloses a path beyond what was already abstractly lost. The pressure is thoughtful rather than tense, which limits the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the sound of growing older—is legible from early on, but pressure on that goal is gentle and rarely escalates. The main “tightening” is the approach to and activation of the arch, helped rather than opposed by the caretaker’s information. His precognitive forgetfulness is theoretically a constraint but doesn’t concretely block or warp his tactics in scene. As a result, the resolution feels more like a serene attainment than the outcome of sharpened conflict or genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—foundations shaking and the threat to the observatory’s stability/perception mission—is clear and tied to Elara’s desire to transcend limitations. There is one meaningful tightening when she rejects brute-force stabilization in favor of resonance and reconfiguration. However, the tremors’ stakes remain somewhat abstract (little concrete danger, damage, or consequence on the page), and the “days” of trial diffuse urgency. The resolution arrives smoothly, with limited sense of sacrifice or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving a “flawless goodbye” under the constraint of limited time and the patient’s no-tears rule—is clear and present. Pressure gently tightens as the family arrives, the music starts, and Mr. Anders rouses briefly before dying, with the son’s attempt to promise repair heightening emotional cost. Yet conflict never quite bites: there’s little on-page friction or risk of failure to that goodbye, and no real ethical or tactical dilemma to test the narrator. The escalation feels true but safe, more elegiac than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are clear but primarily intellectual: discovering where shadows go at noon and reclaiming lost knowledge. There is some escalation as each completed loop builds energy toward a climactic circuit, but the conflict is largely frictionless—no misstep, risk of failure, or opposing force sharpens the choice to complete the final loop. Her agency drives the turn, yet the decision never feels dangerous or ethically fraught, so the cost remains abstract. The result is a well-shaped but relatively low-pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering the real Arthur / reconciling with the impossible—is clear, and the ritual scene provides a natural focus for tension. Yet escalation is gentle: once Eleanor sets the tooth and begins bone-setting motions, the emergence of the figure proceeds without real threat, failure risk, or moral bind. Her choice to embrace the figure is emotionally right but narratively easy; there’s little sense she could credibly refuse or suffer for accepting. As a result, conflict feels more like a graceful unfolding than a pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s limitation will remain a source of grief or become a source of purpose—is clear but gently pressured. There is a conceptual deepening when she discovers the glass can project unique star patterns and when others begin to come, but these are narrated as fait accompli rather than sharpened into on-page tests or hard choices. Internal conflict between longing for actual space travel and accepting an earthbound role is present but resolved smoothly, without a moment where she must forgo a real, tangible alternative. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful incline than a genuine tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling her whistleblowing and guilt—is clear from early on and culminates in the choice to relinquish the pendant. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the spiral insight, the move into the more ruined, reverent-feeling room, and the deepening hush as she offers the pendant. External conflict is essentially absent in the present-tense scene; the media/institutional pressures are offstage, so tension relies on whether she will truly let go. The cost is present but gentle, more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The core stake—whether he can finish the book on his own terms and find peace with his vocation—is articulated but not truly tested on the page. There is no real-time opposition beyond his remembered doubts; the external pressures (publishers, academic theories) stay offstage and past-tense. The “turn” toward acceptance arrives mainly as declared understanding rather than as a choice under fresh stress. As a result, tension feels steady and low, more meditative than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering ancestral songs before the harvest moon—appears early and remains coherent, and Elara’s decision to build and activate the device is an active, goal-driven move. Yet there is almost no escalation beyond “she worked feverishly”: no real obstacle challenges her plan, and no alternative or failure mode is dramatized. The communal remembering scene is moving but foregone, with tension operating more as gentle expectancy than true risk. Without a pressured trade-off or reversal, the conflict feels low-friction and somewhat sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—capture starlight as a guide against encroaching darkness—is stated early, and there is a nominal threat of catastrophic failure. Yet conflict remains almost entirely hypothetical: nothing resists the alchemist, there’s no misstep, time pressure, or internal hesitation that forces adaptation. The escalation is a smooth, uninterrupted glide from setup to success, with tension resting on narration’s insistence rather than evolving pressures. This yields a meditative ritual more than an escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the echo-harvesting timer to preserve memory—is clear, but the pressure on that goal is gentle and largely unopposed. There is one primary deepening (from observation of light patterns to reconstruction), yet no genuine setback, competing agenda, or visible cost that forces a trade-off. Success feels inevitable once her method is established. As a result, the story reads more as meditative process than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing a crucial night’s collection while bearing the cost of the role—is present and grows modestly as the burdens increase in scale and intimacy (king, farmer, self, civilization). Escalation is primarily conceptual and textural rather than confrontational, with one clear deepening when the weaver handles their own burden. The ending reconfigures the internal conflict rather than resolving an external threat, which fits the lens but keeps tension relatively low. There’s no real sense that failure is possible tonight, which limits perceived risk.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Clara will live with her husband’s absence in this small window of time—is clear and quietly pressured by the ticking kettle. Conflict is primarily internal and textural: her choice to carve again, to make this lion serene, and to place it with its “brothers” represents a deepened commitment to a costly way of remembering. Escalation is gentle but present, moving from tentative first cut to the charged mantel placement and the final acceptance of love as “here and gone.” The modest scale and lack of a sharper turning screw keep it from feeling fully high-stakes, even by lyric standards.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—Cyrus either remaining trapped in regret and temporal dislocation or finding a way to reconcile with his ghost/past—is clear and conceptually strong. There is a discernible escalation: from scavenging and preparation to the magical activation and finally stepping onto the word-bridge toward the confrontation. However, resistance and cost at the peak are soft; the ghost accepts the wheel quickly, and the “negotiation” is named rather than dramatized as a pressured exchange with real risk of failure. The conflict feels more like a ritual that works as expected than a choice tested under tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can resurrect the terminal as an equation for hope—is declared, but conflict remains mostly conceptual and unopposed. Her work at the power center proceeds without setbacks, competing priorities, or real trade-offs, so escalation is more procedural than pressured. Internal stakes (her need for hope) are asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or risk of failure in the moment. The final success therefore lands more as a gentle uplift than as a hard-won or costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains a defeated scribe or reclaims his abandoned dream—is clear but not strongly pressured. There is one main tightening beat: the crystals’ song intensifying as he places the soldered-shut watch down, which nudges him toward a decision. However, there’s almost no real resistance, cost-testing, or competing desire; the sanctuary feels like a guaranteed cure rather than a risky confrontation. The bear’s presence is supportive rather than antagonistic, so internal and external pressures never quite escalate beyond a gentle curve.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and understanding systemic lies—is important but largely treated as a given rather than something put under on-page pressure. There is no real opposition to Elara’s goal in the scene: the journal is simply there, and reading it yields the expected revelations without risk, reversal, or sacrifice. The main escalation is intellectual (her realization) rather than situational, and it doesn’t force a concrete trade-off in the moment. Stakes remain more abstractly declared than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to the secret weavers’ knowledge to preserve their methods—is clear but mostly exists in dialogue exposition. Conflict is gentle: the fisherman’s initial reticence vs. the collector’s patience, with tension easing rather than sharply escalating; the fisherman’s eventual openness feels almost guaranteed once the fulgurite appears. There is one meaningful deepening when the knots are recognized as language, but no on-page trade-off or foreclosed option that gives the outcome bite. As a result, the piece reads more as a contemplative initiation vignette than a scene of tested stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—the traveler’s willingness to confront his own “explained absence” instead of only others’—is clear and culminates in his beginning to write his own obituary. Tension is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with pressure deepening rather than sharply turning when he shifts focus from Thomas Greenwood to himself. The cost (facing guilt and reinterpreting his coping mechanism) is present but understated. The piece could use one more concrete on-page micro-crisis to sharpen that internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—can he use the egg to restore beauty—is well signposted and directly tested when he assembles and activates the device. Escalation comes from the device working beyond expectation, briefly transforming the palace, then failing as the light fades, forcing him to confront that the solution isn’t sustainable. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical; external pressure (time limits, opposing forces, concrete risk) is minimal, which softens tension. Still, the failure carries a real cost in shattered hope and increased difficulty for his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—saving the botanical garden (and symbolically her belief that “scars can sing”)—is clear early, and the oncoming fire provides a coherent external pressure. There is one main tightening as embers reach the garden and she deploys the fire blanket and wax, intertwining external and internal stakes. Yet obstacles are minimal and quickly neutralized; no real option is foreclosed, and she never has to choose between competing goods or harms. The result is emotionally gentle and thematically tidy, but with limited escalation and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories to restore the city—is legible from early on, and there is a mild tightening when the pedestal is empty and the city “holds secrets from her.” But there is almost no concrete opposition: no real risk in following the breadcrumbs, no pushback from the city’s magic, and no visible downside to unleashing potentially “dangerous” memories. The climax (touching the glass, imagining the memories as birds, speaking the words) resolves the core conflict without reversals or trade-offs, so tension never rises beyond a gentle, lyrical curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this civilization will receive non-destructive illumination—is declared, but almost never truly tested. The people accept the light immediately; there’s no meaningful resistance, trade-off, or price dramatized on the page. Internal conflict (weariness vs. purpose, hope vs. knowledge of cycles) is gestured at but not sharpened into a concrete decision that forecloses options. As a result, tension remains low and escalation is more implied by repetition than felt as tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and highly subdued; Elias faces no real opposition, deadline, or significant possibility of failure. The main “tightening” is his decision to retrace his mentor’s steps and then attempt an ambitious monument, but these choices are never tested by tangible resistance or cost beyond effort and subtle depletion. Stakes are thematically grand (collective grief) but experientially gentle, so tension never quite sharpens. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth rise in texture than a true pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core conflict—Alaric’s need for absolution and restored trust versus his habit of solitary precision—is clear, and his public appeal for help marks a real turn. Internal and external stakes align (his identity and the town’s shared timekeeper), and the shift to communal repair offers a satisfying, if gentle, escalation. However, opposition is soft: once he calls for help, the town’s acceptance is immediate and frictionless, and the repair itself presents no setbacks or difficult trade-offs. The cost of his earlier failure is more summarized than actively tested in the present, which keeps pressure moderate rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the intentions encoded in the tapestry—is clear but remains largely intellectual, with minimal sense of danger, urgency, or personal risk. Escalation is confined to the hum of the case, the intensifying echoes, and the shift from presumed romance to sacrifice, all of which deepen knowledge but don’t meaningfully narrow Elias’s options. His choice to re-lock the truth is gentle and unopposed, with no real competing desire dramatized on the page. As a result, tension is present but muted, more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can successfully foresee and prepare the villagers for the dangerous melt—is clear, but nearly all of the real danger lies offstage in the future. In the scene itself, there is little genuine opposition or escalation: skepticism, past failures, and environmental threat are recalled in exposition rather than pressing her into a new or harder choice now. The one tightening is the recognition of cracks already forming in the lake, which mildly underlines urgency but does not alter her tactics. As a result, the act of starting/finishing the map reads more like execution of a foregone plan than a pressured, high-cost decision.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—defying the Narrative Control Bureau to return forbidden stories—is clear and meaningful. Yet the on-page night is almost entirely smooth: no close calls, no adaptive tactics, no pressure spikes beyond reiterated danger in summary. Her decision to keep broadcasting is courageous in concept but not tested in scene, so tension plateaus. As a result, escalation and visible cost remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s need to capture fleeting emotion and, underneath that, to feel safe/anchored—is clear but remains largely abstract. There is no concrete opposing force or escalating dilemma; nothing on the page truly tests or jeopardizes her goal besides the generalized idea of impermanence. The rocking chair’s stopping prompts a reflective shift, but it doesn’t arise from a hard choice or loss, so pressure never meaningfully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Milo will align with preservation or destruction of “dangerous knowledge”—is present but mostly abstract and untested in scene. The cog could have forced a sharper dilemma (e.g., risk of discovery, immediate choice with real danger), but instead it gently reconfirms his existing path. Pressure does not noticeably escalate; there’s reflection but no on-page pushback from the Council or any concrete threat. As a result, the final choice feels like a reiteration rather than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—whether Eleanor can use music to bridge divisions and keep vanishing arts alive—is conceptually strong but remains abstract on the page. Conflict is reported (“initially regarded each other with suspicion,” “tensions arose”) rather than dramatized in specific confrontations or scenes, so escalation feels theoretical. There is a mild deepening as the choir moves from mistrust to public performance and then into tradition, but no single pressure point where a hard trade-off or renunciation is demanded. The resolution is therefore thematically neat but dramatically under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict—Elias’s quiet defiance of industrial food—is conceptually strong but remains mostly abstract. The once-in-a-lifetime alignment suggests a ticking clock, yet there’s no real sense of what he loses if he waits or fails; opposition is entirely offstage and untested. The main turn (deciding to plant now) feels like a continuation of a long-held plan rather than a pressured escalation. As a result, stakes are more thematic than visceral, and tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city’s mechanical ecosystem without unjustly condemning the supervisor—is present but remains mostly conceptual. Conflict escalates mildly as the problem shifts from “access issue” to “possible sabotage” to “ideological despair,” yet Elara is never forced into a difficult trade-off; she cooperates readily and the supervisor faces no on-page consequence beyond shame. Elara’s involuntary honesty is a constraint, but it never creates a genuine dilemma where any choice costs her something significant. The result is thoughtful but soft-edged tension.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is Aria’s need to understand why some houses feel alive, which is clearly signaled and ultimately answered. Escalation is modest: the shard’s appearance introduces a new tool, and the glowing objects in the lighthouse serve as the single significant tightening that shifts her knowledge. There is little sense of risk, competing desire, or alternative path foreclosed, so the pressure stays largely conceptual rather than felt. This keeps the conflict gentle and somewhat static, suitable for a lyric piece but below the intensity a top-tier venue usually demands.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the diver can relinquish absolute certainty to truly understand the city’s fall—is clear but largely intellectual. There is a mild escalation as the diver moves from shock to active engagement (taking and opening the ampoule) and is immersed in cascading revelations. However, there’s little sense of risk if the diver fails; no alternative path, loss, or external pressure sharpens the choice, so tension stays gentle. The internal conflict is coherent but never quite bites hard enough to feel high-stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escape the staircase and reclaim the missed chance—is clear early and resolves decisively with the rupture and final bet. However, the escalation is more implied than felt: “years” of attempting proofs and hypotheses are summarized, so we don’t experience distinct tightening beats or worsening costs on the page. The final activation of the proof via the chipped die is a strong, agency-driven climactic act, but it arrives without much preceding in-scene testing under pressure. The conflict is coherent and non-static, just not as viscerally escalated as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether her work can connect strangers across time—remains almost entirely conceptual, with minimal friction or threat. Pressure increases only gently via intensifying daydreams; there is no concrete opposition (internal or external) that forces a trade-off or rethinking of tactics. She never seriously doubts her project or faces a risk of failure beyond vague hope. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving a culture from dissolution—is potent and established early. Pressure does deepen when the guide introduces the lens as an experimental tactic and Khira actively collaborates, but there is little real opposition or risk of failure; once they try, it works. No substantive trade-off or loss is dramatized, and the beekeeper’s absence stays abstract rather than embodied as a counterforce. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling of a cure than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the stone before the tide returns—is clearly signaled, and there is one main tightening when the mechanism finally responds and the radiance seeps out. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: the yoyo “resisted” briefly but then yields without substantial reversal, sacrifice, or escalation beyond the clock-like time limit. Internal conflict barely complicates her goal; madness versus vision is asserted but not pressure-tested on the page. As a result, the climax feels more like an inevitable triggering than a high-cost, hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reconfiguring the narrator’s relationship to death/fear—is clear, and there is some escalation as the paradoxes deepen, the clasp pulses, and the mirror reveals fear itself. Yet the conflict is almost entirely internal and guided; the advisor instructs, the narrator obeys, and there is minimal resistance or alternative path considered. The final turn (“your fear’s weakness… it clings to the illusion…”) comes more as an announced thesis than as a hard-won, contested choice. Tension exists conceptually but seldom bites at the level of risk, reversal, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.3)
    The primary conflict—approaching storm vs. her need to protect the community—exists but is treated almost as a demonstration of technique rather than a struggle. There is one clear tightening when the “particularly violent cloud formation” appears and she escalates to a more complex performance. Yet the storm diverts without resistance or visible price, and nothing is seriously endangered on the page. As a result, stakes feel conceptual rather than viscerally tense, and her agency, while central, never costs her.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—what happened to the expedition/watchers and what it means for the city—is clear, and the crack-opening and descent into the chamber provide a solid escalation beat. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual and logistical; there is no active opposing force or meaningful obstruction once the shell responds, so the discovery proceeds almost frictionlessly. The supposed world-scale danger is relayed via journal exposition rather than an on-page test or dilemma, muting the sense of price paid. Kael’s climactic “choice” to accept a guardian role reads more like an unopposed realization than a decision forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and proving the truth about the “noble lies”—is clear, but opposition is entirely off-stage and nothing pushes back on Eleanor in the present scene. Escalation is primarily informational (more evidence, then conclusive proof) without a meaningful narrowing of options or direct risk, so tension remains intellectual and relatively flat. The ledger discovery reads as the natural endpoint of a search rather than a hard-won turn under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—his need to understand and preserve the pavilion’s story—is stated, and the discovery/wresting of the metal box provides the main tightening. Yet the opposition (cold water, stuck object, erosion) remains relatively gentle, and failure carries little felt cost beyond lost knowledge in the abstract. Internal stakes around his vocation and doubt (“whether dreams could be measured…”) are not pressed hard enough to force a painful choice. The piece has tension, but it plateaus rather than truly escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s understanding of his origins and purpose—is clear, but the conflict remains almost entirely internal and under-pressured. The main escalation is the discovery of the matching sigil, followed by confirmation via maps/journal; there is no serious doubt, loss, or risk that forces a painful trade-off. The blackout is framed as obstacle-turned-opportunity, but it never truly imperils his goal or safety. As a result, the arc feels more like a contemplative revelation than a conflict that tightens and extracts a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can he transform his grief into something that lets him move forward?—is clearly signaled and carried through. Pressure comes from the fact that this is his “final gem” and “last of his dreams,” giving the act weight, but conflict remains largely internal and unopposed. There’s one main tightening (committing to finish and deposit the last lantern) rather than layered reversals or genuine options he might refuse. The resolution feels earned but low in overt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—harvesting human potential to possibly salvage humanity—is declared but remains abstract and never truly endangered on the page. Once the window opens, Elias meets no opposition (environmental, technical, or internal) and the energy transfer proceeds exactly as predicted, so there is virtually no escalation or genuine risk. The “narrow window before the shields come back online” promises pressure that never manifests as an on-page constraint or complication. As a result, the mission feels low-friction and the outcome foregone, undercutting tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—establishing resonance/“frequency of belonging”—is clear, and the process has a gentle escalation from data-gathering to convergence to pull. Yet tension remains low: the “sudden alert” and “unexpected variables” hint at danger but do not materially complicate her path or force a trade-off. There’s no antagonist, no real risk beyond abstraction, and the operation never feels in danger of genuine failure. The ending is a clean success without visible price, so escalation tops out at functional rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Martin will keep living by his fabricated past or confront a painful, authentic one—is clearly established and resolved. Pressure builds modestly from anticipatory dread on the terrace to his searching on the shore, culminating in the revelation that his grandfather’s love made his self-erasure tragically pointless. Escalation is primarily internal and reflective, with one clear tightening at the carving discovery, so tension remains more contemplative than urgent. The costs are emotional rather than situational, but they are legible in his tears and the foreclosing of his profitable trade.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    The text repeatedly asserts high stakes (“especially challenging,” “years of resentments”) but dramatizes very little concrete resistance or risk in the scene itself. Pressure rises modestly through atmosphere and anticipation until Rennett arrives, but once he’s on stage, conflict resolves smoothly without a genuine test of Lyra’s methods or resolve. There’s no real reversal or narrowing of options; the apology feels inevitable rather than hard-won. As a result, tension is present but mild and never truly sharpens into a dilemma or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will remain defined by her catastrophic mistake or find a new stance toward navigation—is clear and present from early on. Pressure comes mainly from accumulated regret and the fresh blow of the rescinded job offer, with the paddle functioning as a ritualized test. However, escalation is modest: there is no real risk, dilemma, or external test that forces a hard trade-off, and the dolphins’ appearance acts more as benevolent catalyst than as something she must choose in tension with cost. As a result, the final reconfiguration feels satisfying but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the protagonist will assume the burden of this empathy-restoring loop—is clear, but on-page pressure is mild. The main external “choice” (which tunnel) is briskly dispatched, with little sense of competing costs or real risk. Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized; we’re told of a “dirty past” and heavy weight, yet the decision to sign the ball and continue feels almost frictionless. As a result, escalation is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking a transformative ritual to reconnect with her dead brother—is signaled early and pursued directly through the conjuring. Pressure deepens as she physically metamorphoses and the brother’s presence manifests, and the time constraint of the fading spices/moon’s zenith provides a clear narrowing of options. However, resistance and potential failure are more implied than dramatized; nothing meaningfully threatens to derail her attempt once begun, and her fear of “becoming less human” never forces a visible trade-off. The conflict is emotionally sincere but somewhat low-friction for the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how she will relate to the passage of time and motherhood—is well signaled but the conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with limited escalation. Once she reaches the glade, the ritual unfolds without genuine resistance, danger, or hard trade-offs; the wind scattering cards is atmospheric but not truly costly. Her final stance (accepting irrecoverable time and choosing presence) is meaningful but arrives via reflection rather than being forced by tightening pressure. The piece functions more as a graceful meditation than as a scene of mounting conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—complete humanity’s final work and reach the realm of consciousness—is clear and appropriately grand, and the stitching ritual creates a formal sense of rising intensity. Yet the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with no genuine obstruction or near-failure on the page; the danger is described but never dramatized in a way that narrows options. Eli never seriously wavers between competing courses of action, so their agency affirms a path rather than choosing between live alternatives. As a result, escalation feels more like a crescendo of imagery than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake is Ian’s internal one—how he will relate to transformation and his own role in it—and there is at least one meaningful “tightening” in his decision to detour and then to relinquish his lightning bugs. Yet conflict remains mostly notional: the prophecy poses no real danger, the girl is not in opposition, and the volcano’s threat is abstractly neutralized by a single line. Coincidence and destiny smooth the path instead of complicating it, so escalation is more conceptual than felt. The price he pays (letting go of the bugs) is symbolically important but narratively frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The declared stakes—covert coordination of a revolution under an oppressive regime—are high, and the blackout as opportunity is a smart structural choice. Yet on the page, conflict remains low-friction: the “secondary guard” never truly threatens exposure, and there’s no concrete near-miss, failure, or forced improvisation. Elias’s agency is mostly straightforward execution of a pre-planned task; no option is meaningfully foreclosed, and no moral or practical trade-off bites. Tension thus stays conceptual rather than visceral, undercutting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    World-unraveling stakes and the danger of her curse are declared, but on the page the ritual proceeds with almost no resistance or risk; once she begins, everything works. There’s minimal escalation beyond intensifying light and complexity of the sequence, and no genuine moment where failure or self-destruction feels possible. The internal conflict (terror vs duty) never forces a concrete trade-off or renunciation. As a result, tension remains low despite high stated stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—whether Maia will use her forbidden window of authenticity to reclaim and channel censored truth—is present but stays largely internal and abstract. The main tightening is the timer beeping, marking the start and end of the mask-slipping hour, plus the reveal of the map of scars which catalyzes her writing. However, escalation is gentle: no new real risk or opposition appears, and her “decision” to write and to descend with her verses feels inevitable rather than forced by sharpened pressure. Conflict reads as contemplative resistance, not as a tested, escalating dilemma, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is almost no real conflict: Aris effortlessly decodes the puzzle and then effortlessly dazzles a receptive student. Stakes are framed conceptually (intellectual destinations, hidden overture) but never materially or emotionally tested. No option is meaningfully foreclosed, and there’s no moment where Aris must pay a visible price or genuinely risk failure. As a result, tension remains low and static despite the appealing concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving forbidden knowledge and seeding resistance—is stated clearly but rarely tested in concrete, on-page conflict. There is no direct antagonist presence or time-sensitive threat in the scene; authority and danger remain off-stage abstractions. The “tightening” is primarily thematic, not situational: we get more context (Elias, the prison library, banned words) but not sharper, riskier choices. As a result, tension feels low and relatively static despite the high-concept stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—defying time/fate to reach or honor his daughter before shutdown—is clearly signaled and followed through to his step into the liminal refuge. There is one meaningful tightening when the system shutdown and falling night frame his last performance and descent. However, opposition remains largely ambient; no one or nothing materially resists his plan, so tension escalates conceptually more than dramatically. As a result, cost and risk are felt but not acutely tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—preserving collective memory before monsoon—are clearly signaled, and the dream-guided journey plus ritual provide a basic escalation. However, the path from ridge to cave is nearly frictionless: no serious physical, magical, or ethical obstacles test her resolve or force tactical trade-offs. Internal doubt surfaces only late and briefly, and the ritual succeeds without complication, muting a sense of cost or risk. As a result, tension feels more ceremonial than pressured, limiting conflict depth for a piece aiming at elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his long-held regret into a more honest, tolerable state—is consistent, but the pressure stays low and meditative throughout. The central tightening is the lace revealing a new “diffusion” pattern, which prompts him to rearrange the bonsai and confess, yet there’s little sense that he might refuse or that another outcome is possible. Internal and external conflict remain largely aligned, with no real test of his resolve beyond voicing the confession to an empty room. As a result, the resolution feels earned but modestly escalated rather than truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is no immediate conflict or escalation; the "shift" in perspective happens smoothly without opposition or trade-offs. The stakes are abstract and intellectual ("understanding the universe") rather than visceral or immediate. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is no immediate, on-page conflict or escalation; the threat is entirely in the past or future. The scene lacks a tightening of stakes or a moment where the protagonist must make a trade-off, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elena faces no resistance from the silence, her tools, or the plants, leading to instant success. There is no tightening of stakes; the "rectification" of silence is achieved without risk, failure, or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is virtually no active conflict or obstacle; the protagonist obtains a submarine, locates a lost city, and solves an ancient puzzle with "deliberate care" and no resistance. The narrative lacks a credible on-page cost or risk; the resolution is gifted through "sudden clarity" and magical compliance rather than earned through struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake (survival vs. sanctions) is undermined by the resolution. The pressure escalates via reports of tightening restrictions, but the protagonist's response—to simply give more despite having less—ignores the central constraint of scarcity. The stakes dissolve because the cost of the decision is not dramatized or felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no external opposition, internal doubt, or risk of failure. The central question ("where does unused love go?") is answered instantly by the magical tear and breathing technique, with no cost or trade-off required from Elara. The lack of stakes turns the narrative into a procedural description of a magic trick rather than a dramatic story. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is internal and intellectual but largely told to the reader ("obsession," "threatening to disintegrate") rather than demonstrated through resistance or difficult trade-offs. The climax feels inevitable and magical rather than the result of a desperate, agentic decision with visible alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=2.8)
    Tension is deflated by the protagonist's immediate competence and the availability of perfect tools; the opposing force (demolition crew) adds artificial timing pressure but forces no meaningful trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.6)
    Tension is low because the protagonist has already achieved his goal before the scene begins; he is merely reviewing a success. There is no active obstacle or escalating cost in the present moment, only reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the antagonist offers no resistance, accepts the protagonist's cover story instantly, and leaves the room of his own accord. The stakes ("fail forever") are declared but never tested, as the heist is accomplished in "three breathless seconds" without a moment of doubt or risk. The narrative lacks a tightening of pressure or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment and materials offer no opposition to Elias's goal. The "thawing" happens automatically alongside the work, lacking a moment of risk, sacrifice, or decision that would generate narrative tension. It reads as a meditation where success is inevitable from the first line.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared ("permanently silenced") but never felt through immediate danger or difficult trade-offs. The conflict is resolved by a sudden internal acceptance that bypasses the established external threat, lacking the necessary escalation or sacrifice to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure escalates cleanly with the encroaching darkness, and the stakes are clearly defined as the survival of knowledge/navigation. The protagonist's choice to map the darkness rather than fight it provides a satisfying thematic resolution to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the tension between "cleaning protocol" and "playing the violin" evaporates the moment it is introduced. There is no antagonist, no time pressure, and no visible cost to the decision to play the instrument. The stakes are theoretical (finding the origin of thoughts) and resolve in a purely additive manner—the robot gains everything and loses nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no antagonist or genuine obstacle; the protagonist moves from discovery to mastery to resolution without opposition or time pressure. The final decision forces no felt trade-off, as she immediately achieves her goal through other means in the summary aftermath, rendering the "cost" of the lens negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely abstract and static; the protagonist is already convinced of his victory, and the opposition (scientists) is off-stage and future-tense. There is no on-page tightening of stakes or escalation that forces Elias to adapt his tactics or sacrifice something valued.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no external resistance, internal doubt, or risk of failure. The escalation is mechanical (pulling a sequence of levers) rather than dramatic, devoid of stakes or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=2.9)
    Zero resistance or escalation; the environment, the instrument, and the ghost all facilitate Elias's goal immediately. The stakes are purely theoretical ("artistic journey") and never tested by a concrete threat or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is clear, moving from internal realization to the irreversible physical act of defacing the archive and abandoning the station. The cost is visible on the page (destruction of the heirloom, loss of safety).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is negligible; there is no opposition to Marcus's goal as the ghosts, the radio, and his own instincts all align perfectly. The dominant stake ("finding the weight of a swallowed truth") faces no resistance, resulting in a linear procession of events without tension or earned reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear, but pressure remains low; the protagonist navigates the threat with professional competence, lacking a moment of visceral doubt or near-failure that would heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are clear (Lila's silence), but the conflict is resolved with minimal resistance; the breakthrough feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult tactical adjustments. The "stormy seas of trauma" are mentioned but not felt through high-pressure decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposing force; the historian faces no obstacles in retrieving the tapestry or diaries. The "investigation" encounters no resistance, and the stakes of the "displaced axis" remain abstract background noise rather than immediate pressure. No options are narrowed, and no price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.1)
    There is no active conflict or opposition; the protagonist acts with god-like efficacy and faces no obstacles to his goal. The stakes ("shifting humanity's perception") are abstract and theoretical, never grounded in a specific, high-pressure test.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are stated (Sarah's soul) but never felt, as the antagonist poses no effective threat to the priest. The conflict is asymmetrical; the protagonist is in control throughout, dismantling the entity with rhetorical traps and technology without paying any price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.1)
    The stakes remain abstract ("unheard symphonies") and the obstacle ("exhaustion") is generic, failing to force a difficult trade-off or change in tactics. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle, as the protagonist succeeds fully before paying the physical price.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are abstract and internal; the conflict is resolved by witnessing a vision rather than making a difficult trade-off. There is no significant escalation of pressure; the protagonist simply completes the ritual and gains the insight he sought without external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; Eleanor faces no antagonists, and her internal struggle is resolved immediately by the magical discovery. The drum maker becomes an ally instantly, and the students are "enthralled" without effort. The lack of setbacks or costs makes the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake (exposing the truth) is clear, but the escalation is weak because the solution falls into the protagonist's lap via serendipity. The "pressure" of being followed is stated in the exposition but does not force an active, difficult trade-off in the present moment; the climax feels convenient rather than earned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low because the protagonist faces no active opposition, risk of failure, or hard trade-off; he simply turns on a light and receives an epiphany. The resolution comes too easily, missing the opportunity for escalation or a moment where the character must renounce something to gain understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are declared as "impossible choices" but never tested in the scene; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or resource scarcity. The conflict is purely meditative, lacking the friction or escalation required to earn the final insight.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=2.6)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "chronic hush" is a passive atmospheric condition rather than an active opposition. Kael encounters no obstacles, risks, or trade-offs; his success is immediate, total, and universally validated by the supporting cast without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is a near-total absence of pressure or opposition; the client is compliant and the magic works perfectly on the first try. Without escalation or a risk of failure, the stakes remain abstract and theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.3)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, and his efforts to help succeed without cost, trade-off, or risk. The narrative lacks a tightening of options; instead, it progresses linearly from one success to another, rendering the "shrewd" broker's skills unnecessary.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is low-stakes and resolved through cooperative summary, with the "treacherous" nature of the crater asserted but never dramatized as an immediate threat. The characters face no significant setbacks or hard choices on the page, leading to a resolution without a visible, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    The story establishes a clear ticking clock (the giant's nap) and a legible cost (shortened lifespan). While the pressure escalates effectively, the resolution—shattering a crystal—feels mechanically simple given the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of pressure or obstacle; the ritual succeeds on the first attempt without complication or resistance. The stakes remain theoretical ("uncertain magic") rather than visceral, and the protagonist faces no moment of risk or trade-off. The resolution is gifted by the vision rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the character faces no active opposition, physical obstacle, or risk of discovery that alters their tactics. The central problem (the outage) is resolved via a convenient find and a magical realization, requiring no sacrifice or difficult trade-off from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.1)
    The conflict is resolved too easily; the moment Elara relinquishes control, she is immediately rewarded with "explosive growth," removing the necessary cost or risk from her choice. The stakes remain abstract (scientific pride) and are resolved without a genuine "dark night of the soul" or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the central exchange is frictionless, with the protagonist hesitating only momentarily before gaining a perfect solution to her problems. There is no opposition or genuine dilemma, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical; the loss of foresight is stated as a fact but not felt as a danger or handicap before the resolution. The protagonist faces no genuine opposition, merely a puzzle she solves immediately with a smile.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared ("burden of years") but never tested; there is no active resistance or possibility of failure. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, and the resolution comes from a convenient external object (the diary) rather than earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Ethan faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical barrier that requires sacrifice. The narrative claims each step is a "dare," but without established stakes or the risk of failure, this assertion remains "told" rather than felt. The resolution comes without a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no external antagonism or internal doubt after the first paragraph. The "unheard symphony" and the tile's magic are accepted and mastered without struggle or cost. Stakes are declared abstractly ("restore balance to memories") but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is distant and abstract; the protagonist faces no immediate antagonist or obstacle, merely observing screens until he decides to leave. The "solar storm" functions as a battery rather than a pressure source, and the "mutiny" is an external event that does not threaten him directly until he voluntarily engages, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.9)
    Tension is theoretical rather than visceral; because the plan works perfectly, the high stakes (execution vs. prison) are never tested by immediate failure or cost. Escalation is absent, as the protagonist faces no resistance that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no active pressure or opposition; the approach of dawn serves as a schedule rather than a ticking clock with consequences. The story lacks escalation, as the protagonist faces no obstacles to his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is abstract and retrospective (man vs. bureaucracy) with no present-moment antagonist or escalating situational pressure. The absence of an on-page test or reversal leaves the stakes theoretical and the narrative flat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual, lacking visceral risk or personal cost for Evelyn, who acts as a passive observer of the ghosts' past argument. There is no escalation of danger or potential failure; the resolution is achieved through a magical harmonization that faces no active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central conflict is resolved too easily through summary; the flash mobs convince the investors off-page, leading to "surprisingly favorable" terms without visible struggle. The antagonists are reduced to caricatures ("ties and polished shoes comically out of place"), lowering the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal and internal ("outlast the darkness," "outlast her emotions"), with no external obstacles complicating the goal. The climax proceeds exactly as planned without a decisive turn, trade-off, or failure that would test the protagonist's commitment; the success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative deflates its own stakes; despite the "maiden voyage" deadline, the text claims the mist "slow[s] time," removing urgency. Elias faces no obstacles, resistance, or hard choices; he simply fixes the object with "magnetic calm," resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no obstacles, physical dangers, or antagonistic forces during his expedition. He arrives, observes, travels without incident, and succeeds; the lack of resistance renders the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story lacks active conflict; the "threat of collapse" is stated but never exerts pressure on the page. Silas succeeds in every attempt without trade-offs or risk of failure, resulting in a low-stakes progression where the outcome is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the oxygen gauge provides a ticking clock, the conflict lacks genuine escalation because the protagonist faces no setbacks or forced trade-offs during the climax. The resolution preserves both the character's life and the prize without sacrifice, rendering the declared life-or-death stakes weightless at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared ("before they find the bodies") but never tested or escalated on the page; the threat remains abstract and unconnected to the character's actions. The conflict is static, consisting of internal assertions repeated verbatim rather than dramatized encounters or hard choices. There is no meaningful tightening of options, only a restatement of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is primarily external and passive; the protagonist waits seven years for a celestial alignment she doesn't control. Her agency is compressed into a single, low-resistance action (releasing seeds) at the very end, lacking a sense of rising pressure or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental obstacle; the stone accepts the needle without resistance, and the villagers immediately accept the change. The stakes are abstract ("ruin into reverence") and never tested by a concrete threat or failure. The narrative lacks escalation, moving in a straight line from intent to total success.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist encounters no resistance from the artifact, the experts, or the environment. The process is smooth and linear, lacking a distinct "no" or obstacle that would force a meaningful trade-off or visible cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the perfect name—is resolved before the scene's main action or handled in abstract summary ("Finding the perfect name was like solving..."). The deadline adds a nominal time marker but generates no genuine friction or cost; there is no on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is almost no on-page conflict; the "lethal conspiracy" is abstract, and the visiting official is dismissed without posing a genuine threat. The protagonist faces no escalating pressure or narrowing of options; she simply applies her skills and succeeds without struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low, as the only obstacle is the initial message being "not enough," which is immediately resolved by "focusing energy." There is no escalation of risk, no dilemma, and no price paid for the resolution. The ending resolves the tension too neatly with a telepathic reciprocal message, removing any lingering weight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.3)
    Conflict is abstract and internal; there is no immediate antagonist or time pressure to force a difficult trade-off. The scene lacks escalation, remaining in a low-stakes observational mode until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=2.4)
    There are no meaningful stakes or genuine conflicts; the protagonist succeeds at every step without setbacks or trade-offs. The potential tension—doubt from the council, the difficulty of the work—is glossed over, resulting in a narrative with zero pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no risk of failure, no antagonist, and no clear consequence if Elena fails to solve the nickel's mystery. The "escalation" is merely a sequence of gained insights without rising danger, trade-offs, or demanding agency.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely conceptual; there is no immediate on-page threat (e.g., a monitor turning red, a guard approaching) to test the protagonist. The conflict remains abstract and summarized, lacking a decisive tightening or turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is abstract and metaphorical ("darkness threatened," "insomnia was both curse and gift") rather than urgent and specific. The "blossom armistice" succeeds without any on-page obstacle, failure, or cost; the solution is described as "unstoppable," removing all narrative tension. The stakes are declared but never tested against a concrete antagonist or time limit.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist is abstract entropy, and the on-page task is completed with the first tool selected. There is no escalation of pressure, no moment where failure seems possible, and no trade-off required to achieve the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the global stakes are high (war/division), the on-page conflict is low-pressure; the protagonist battles the text, not an antagonist or an internal flaw. There is no moment of "meaningful tightening" where options narrow or a sacrifice is required. The deadline ("before paths diverge") is stated repeatedly but does not force a desperate or compromised tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("debate would resume") but never felt through immediate pressure or deepening complications. The conflict resolves without cost or trade-off; Elara simply finds the perfect answer, neutralizing any narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.6)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; Leo faces no opposition from the environment, the target, or his own limitations. The stakes remain theoretical because success is guaranteed from the start, and the woman accepts the intervention immediately. Without a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a price is paid, the narrative lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pressure is low throughout; the Council is a remote concept rather than a present threat, and Lira's transformation faces no on-page resistance or possibility of failure. The stakes remain theoretical until the magical object creates an effortless path to resolution, bypassing the need for a difficult, high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story creates virtually no conflict; there is no antagonist, obstacle, or difficult trade-off on the page. The stakes are purely philosophical and abstract ("seeking meaning"), with the resolution arriving immediately upon observation without struggle. The lack of opposing pressure makes the "sacred resolve" at the end feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes remain entirely internal and abstract, with no external pressure to force a stance crystallization or sacrifice. The conflict is static, lacking an inciting incident or escalation that narrows the protagonist's path. Resolution comes via convenient introspection, bypassing the need for a "felt cost" or genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are entirely abstract ("fabric of possibility") and never tested by concrete opposition or the risk of failure. The climax serves as a procedural adjustment of weights rather than a high-pressure moment forcing a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of active conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no opposition, external threat, or difficult dilemma. The narrative proceeds smoothly from search to discovery to realization without any pressure testing the character’s resolve or competence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.7)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (rain) and timing (bells) aid the protagonist rather than opposing her. No stakes are placed at risk on the page, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is declared but not enacted; the opposing factions and the friction of negotiation are glossed over in summary. There is no on-page escalation or tightening of options, only a report that the work was difficult.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain largely theoretical; there is no active obstacle preventing the release, nor a moment where the protagonist must weigh a difficult trade-off on the page. The "chest tightening" asserts emotional cost, but the action itself is a straightforward execution of a pre-made decision without escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist ("lullaby of conformity") is a passive concept that exerts no active pressure or counter-move against Elara's ritual. She pays no visible cost for her success—untangling the threads is portrayed as a smooth, almost effortless process of release rather than a struggle requiring sacrifice or endurance. The stakes are high in concept (liberation) but zero in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no stakes or meaningful obstacles; the rowdy crowd submits instantly to Elias's "calm presence." The conflict is theoretical (ethical storytelling) rather than dramatized in the scene. Escalation is flat because the protagonist succeeds immediately at every step without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist moves through the repair process with "practiced grace" and encounters no significant setbacks or failures that force a hard choice until the very end. While the final decision is a valid renunciation (freedom over capture), the lack of prior visible cost or escalation makes the stakes feel abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the conflict is internal and resolves via symbolic ritual rather than difficult choice. The lack of opposition or setbacks makes the "bridge" feel like an inevitable success rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; Elias encounters no resistance from the environment, the object, or his own limitations. The declared stake ("risk everything") is never tested, as he achieves his goal immediately upon trying. There is no escalation of pressure, only a sequence of logistical movements from orchard to bathroom to chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is mild; the guardians—the primary antagonists—capitulate immediately upon hearing Elara's explanation, removing tension from the scene. The "unlearned lessons" serve as an abstract concept rather than a visceral threat to Elara in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elara moves through the ship without obstacle, antagonist, or time pressure. The stakes are purely internal and abstract ("reclaiming lost pieces"), and because she encounters no resistance, there is no escalation or meaningful risk. The resolution comes too easily via a magic object, bypassing the need for a difficult, defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=2.5)
    Escalation is virtually non-existent; Eleanor encounters no resistance from the environment, the object, or herself.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is static; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or mutually exclusive trade-off to force a high-stakes decision. The narrative relies on declared stakes ("people forget") rather than dramatized testing, leading to an ending that feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the antagonist is an abstract "gravity" that never actively opposes the protagonist. There are no turns, setbacks, or trade-offs on the page, leaving the stakes purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.2)
    The stakes (funding scarcity) are established but dissolve immediately upon the protagonist's realization; the antagonist (Aris/reality) offers no resistance, shifting instantly from concern to fascination. The conflict lacks a tightening phase or a felt cost, resulting in symmetric satisfaction where the theme solves the plot magic-bullet style.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.6)
    Tension is the story's main weakness; the external constraint (gravity inversion) acts as a facilitator rather than a pressure source, removing the struggle of the ascent. While the time limit of sixty minutes is mentioned, it doesn't generate on-page urgency or force a tactical scramble, resulting in a low-stakes middle section. The climax is a moment of successful collection rather than a test of character or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=2.2)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is low-tension; the protagonist's desire for isolation collapses instantly upon the inciting incident. The "cost" of the decision is stated ("unwelcome warmth") but not dramatized through hesitation or a meaningful trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are declared (financial ruin vs. redemption) but never tested; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or reversals. The progression is frictionless: she receives instructions, follows them, digs up the object, and succeeds immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time limit, or physical obstacle that forces a trade-off or adaptation.

The stakes (ending a dynasty) are declared but remain abstract, as the immediate scene lacks pressure or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is virtually absent; Galen faces no external opposition and overcomes the internal barrier of "forbidden knowledge" without struggle.

The narrative follows a straight line from desire to gratification without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.3)

The resolution comes without a visible cost to the protagonist, making the victory feel unearned. The antagonists remain abstract and easily evaded.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.8)

No stakes are endangered on the page, and the victory comes without sacrifice, trade-off, or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "stubborn" seed is a trivial obstacle solved instantly, and the "rare" moonstone is a lucky coincidence that simplifies rather than complicates the task. The warning of "changing winds" is abstract and carries no immediate penalty or pressure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical, with no concrete risk of failure or loss on the page. The protagonist's obstacle (the waterfall descent) is resolved quickly via improvisation, and the internal conflict is settled by simply looking at the new clocks, lacking a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is no on-page escalation or obstacle; Elias decides to forge the coin and succeeds immediately without technical, physical, or emotional resistance. The stakes are declared abstractly ("centuries of wisdom") but never tested in the scene, resulting in a flat narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.4)

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are coherent but remain abstract ("reality," "eternity") rather than viscerally felt. While the physical pressure on the library escalates (warping, churning clouds), the personal cost to Eldon is intellectualized and accepted too easily to generate high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks immediate scene pressure; there is no antagonist or obstacle present in the room to test Elias's resolve. The escalation is nonexistent—Elias simply decides to write and succeeds—and the resolution relies on a "symmetric satisfaction" where both sides are appeased without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.2)

    There is virtually no conflict or resistance; obstacles are removed immediately by agreeable secondary characters or magical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is negligible; there is no antagonist, internal resistance, or external obstacle to oppose Elior's planning. The stakes are abstract ("civilization") and the solution is reached through easy contemplation rather than conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.3)

The stakes remain purely theoretical, and the central theme of "vulnerability" is undermined because the protagonist never faces a threat that would make openness a genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the obstacle (a box that opens with silence) aligns perfectly with the protagonist's existing habits, negating any sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story lacks a central conflict or antagonist to generate tension; the "mystery" yields immediately to Elara's inspection without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is theoretical—skepticism versus belief—but plays out with minimal pressure; the protagonist faces no external antagonist or significant internal barrier to his goal. The "deliberate detour" around the spiral galaxy is a minor, unexplained gesture that fails to escalate tension. The resolution comes from a glowing object rather than a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks significant pressure or escalation; the protagonist faces no active opposition, only the labor of the task itself.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are primarily internal and retrospective, lacking immediate pressure or a "live" threat beyond the background danger of the sea.

The conflict resolves somewhat too neatly through the shift in perspective without a tangible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation of stakes; the protagonist faces no active opposition or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.5)

The conflict is resolved by a magic object rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.2)

    Conflict is negligible; the central obstacle (Beatrice's potential anger) evaporates instantly upon her arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension evaporates immediately upon contact; the "strangers" pose no active threat and the protagonist faces no trade-off or risk in lowering the barrier. The lack of resistance results in a static conflict loop where the only obstacle is a misunderstanding resolved by a single button press.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.2)
    There are no active stakes or external pressures in the scene; the protagonist is safe in a library reflecting on past events. The "conflict" is purely internal and intellectual, resolved by a convenient discovery rather than struggle, endurance, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no external opposition and his internal grief is resolved by an external magical force (the melody) rather than his own active processing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a distinct lack of conflict; the protagonist faces no opposition, external or internal, that threatens her goal. The decision to use the pen is made without hesitation or trade-off, and the outcome is an immediate, cost-free success. Without a tightening of options or a felt price, the stakes remain purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist's "disruption" meets no resistance, and the sorrow he encounters is resolved instantly via magical empathy. There is no escalation of stakes or risk of failure; the "joyful sorrow" is a static mood rather than a dynamic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal without immediate, scene-level pressure. The conflict is resolved through the discovery of instructions (the invisible message) rather than a high-cost decision. There is no tangible opposition or time clock to force a crystallization of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is low because the antagonist (the facility/doctors) is effectively neutralized by the off-screen hack before the scene begins.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes are low and purely professional pride; there is no sense that Marlo risks his job or safety, only that he might lose a petty argument.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.7)
    Stakes are "telescopic"—the text claims "trust, history, perhaps even the fate of the canal" hang in the balance, but the on-page action is merely adjusting shutters. There is no active opposition, no hard choice, and no escalation of pressure; the tension is declared ("palpable") but never demonstrated through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.6)

The stakes are purely theoretical because the solution (leaving) is presented as flawless and cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.2)
    There is a total absence of on-page resistance; the "ban" is backstory, and the environment is helpful ("gateway," "hush of anticipation").

The narrative lacks an inciting incident that forces a change in tactics, resulting in zero escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the shadow presents a curiosity rather than an obstacle or a threat that forces a decision.

The lack of opposition or time pressure results in a flat narrative arc where the protagonist is never truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are theoretical and internal, with the antagonist off-screen and no active threat in the scene to force a choice. The conflict is smoothed over by the extended metaphor, resolving in a shift of mindset without a visible cost or test.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=2.6)

The cost (the library's destruction) happens to her, not because of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is primarily intellectual and lacks immediate pressure or high stakes; the "cost" of the realization is abstract. The escalation is internal and low-voltage, missing a moment where Marina is forced to trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=2.2)

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.2)

    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; there are no antagonists, environmental hazards, or internal doubts to obstruct the protagonist's goal. The stakes ("preserving wonder") remain abstract and theoretical, and the lack of opposition drains the narrative of tension or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is nominal; declared stakes (death by frost) are undercut because the protagonist faces no resistance. The mechanical birds are mentioned but easily avoided ("moved like a shadow"), and the rescue is performed without a single complication or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.4)

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are high in concept ("dying realm") but low in execution, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story lacks meaningful opposition or stakes; Leo faces no resistance in his quest, and everyone he meets is helpful and eager to share. The "outside world" intrusion is relegated to background noise rather than an active force forcing Leo to make trade-offs or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.8)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=3.5)
    The central conflict (cost of repair vs. desire to fix) is rendered artificial by the backstory reveal.

    There is virtually no escalation; the protagonist faces a problem, receives instructions, asks for help, and succeeds immediately. The lack of resistance from the community or the mechanism results in a flat narrative line with no felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, time limit, or risk of failure in his task. The narrative lacks escalation or tightening; the process of discovery is frictionless and guaranteed, depriving the story of tension. The shift in understanding (romantic to sacrificial) is an intellectual footnote, not a dramatic turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no effective opposition; the conflict (environmental threat) is resolved instantly by the protagonist's existing skills without adaptation or sacrifice. Skepticism is mentioned as backstory but never manifests as an on-page obstacle. The stakes are declared high (survival) but feel low because the path to success is effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no immediate scene-level conflict; the antagonist (the Bureau) is abstract and distant, offering no resistance to the broadcast *tonight*. The action proceeds smoothly without obstacles, turning points, or the risk of failure. The stakes are declared in exposition but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active conflict; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal dilemma that forces a trade-off. The "stakes" remain entirely abstract and philosophical, devoid of immediate consequence or risk to the character's well-being or goals. The stopping of the chair is a symbolic marker, not an escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—preservation versus destruction—is abstract and internal, with the antagonist (the Council) remaining a distant, theoretical threat. There is no on-page escalation; the discovery of the cog does not force a difficult trade-off or increase the danger Milo faces, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is purely summarized ("regarded each other with suspicion") rather than dramatized through specific interactions or dialogue. Stakes remain abstract concepts of unity and preservation without a concrete, on-page test or cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=3.4)
    The story lacks active opposition or escalation; the "rebellion" remains abstract, and the celestial alignment removes urgency rather than adding it. Elias achieves his goal without overcoming any dramatized resistance or paying a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is negligible; the ascent faces no physical or time-based pressure, and the climax is a polite conversation that instantly resolves the conflict. The declared high stakes of a city-wide blackout never manifest as immediate danger or obstacle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure to drive tension. The protagonist wanders freely and succeeds without trade-offs, lacking any meaningful escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain purely abstract ("academic belief") and are resolved too easily by the statue's intervention and the ampoule's vision. There is no external opposition or time pressure, and the internal conflict is settled without a visible cost or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is linear and lacks meaningful escalation or reversal; Elias simply climbs, calculates, and succeeds without facing a new dilemma or narrowing of options. The stakes (confinement vs. freedom) are declared but the obstacle yields immediately to his first attempt at a solution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is zero active pressure or resistance; the protagonist faces no obstacles to her goal and pays no price. Stakes remain abstract and theoretical, never tested by a concrete moment of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the antagonist (the freeze/cultural erasure) yields immediately to the protagonist's tool. There is no back-and-forth struggle or escalation of pressure, resulting in a linear path to victory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared as high (fate/sanity), but the execution lacks grit; the obstacle is a mechanical puzzle that yields quickly to the protagonist's skill. There is no visible or felt cost paid for the massive success of altering reality, which flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent as the protagonist faces no genuine obstacles; the "fear" surrenders immediately upon the reading of a riddle. There is no escalation of stakes, only a sequence of instructions followed to the letter, resulting in a climax devoid of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.1)
    Tension is low because the antagonist (the storm) is neutralized the moment it becomes a threat, with no escalation or moment of doubt. The stakes are declared (survival) but never tested; the protagonist's success feels guaranteed from the start, resulting in a lack of felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Kael faces no antagonist or obstacle, and the "ancient evil" is an abstract concept that applies no immediate pressure. The resolution is reached through passive discovery (reading) rather than active confrontation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no physical, intellectual, or temporal opposition to her goal. Stakes remain abstract ("justice," "truth") because there is no immediate risk of failure or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent; the only obstacle is a box caught between stones, which he overcomes with simple physical effort ("wrest"). There is no interpersonal conflict, time pressure, or moral dilemma to force a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are nominal; the blackout functions as a helpful plot device rather than an obstacle generating pressure. There is no escalation of conflict, and the resolution comes without sacrifice, risk, or a foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict on the page; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal hesitation in achieving his goal. The stakes remain abstract ("illuminating his path") and the resolution is guaranteed from the start, lacking the tension of a potential failure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, environmental resistance, or internal dilemma during the mission. The "narrow window" of time resolves automatically without imposing a cost, resulting in a fetch quest devoid of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical throughout; the consequence of failure is never established, rendering the "sudden alert" a momentary speed bump rather than a true test. The protagonist succeeds because the machinery "recognizes" her, removing agency and difficulty from the climax. There is no escalation of pressure, merely a sequence of actions performed without visible risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.0)
    External pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time constraint, or immediate threat. The internal conflict is resolved by an external deus ex machina (the carving), bypassing the need for an escalation that forces a costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is introduced but evaporates almost immediately; Captain Rennett’s initial tension dissolves simply because Lyra presents the object in moonlight. There is no meaningful escalation, no trade-off, and no visible cost paid by either character to achieve the "untethering" of years of resentment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is absent; the initial tension of the withdrawn offer is diffused by reflection and scenery rather than intensified. The protagonist faces no active opposition or hard trade-off in the scene that forces a change.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain theoretical; there is no antagonist or active resistance, and the puzzle-solving is summarized rather than enacted. The climax—meeting one's younger self—lacks tension or potential for failure, resolving in a calm, expository handshake.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or complication during the ritual. The stakes (connection vs. loss of humanity) are theoretical, as the "loss" is reversed at dawn, removing the permanence required for high-stakes conflict. The narrative lacks a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is no palpable conflict or escalation; the protagonist seeks an answer, performs a ritual, and immediately receives the answer without struggle. The stakes are theoretical ("lost time") and are resolved through a sudden epiphany rather than through the pressure of a dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is theoretical rather than felt; the "weight of all human history" is asserted but not dramatized through immediate obstacles. The protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure that forces a difficult trade-off on the page. The threat that "one wrong stitch could collapse" everything is a stated stake that never manifests as a near-miss or tactical complication.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=2.6)
    There is no meaningful conflict or opposition; the universe, the setting, and the secondary character all conspire to validate the protagonist immediately. The stakes are purely philosophical and abstract, with no risk of failure or tangible loss. The release of the "precious" collection lacks dramatic weight because the narrative provides no on-page struggle to keep it.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.0)
    Genuine conflict is absent; the "opposition" is entirely off-page, and the on-page interaction with the guard is a feint that instantly resolves into cooperation. The stakes remain abstract and theoretical because the protagonist encounters no resistance, friction, or danger that requires sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the protagonist places stones and succeeds immediately, with the only &quot;pressure&quot; being a pulsing vial. The stakes of an &quot;unraveling reality&quot; are declared in exposition but never test the protagonist's agency or force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and conceptual; the regime is a distant threat that never exerts immediate pressure on the scene. The conflict is internal and purely thematic, lacking a moment where the protagonist must trade one value for another or face a concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=2.5)
    There are no stakes; the protagonist faces no risk of failure in decoding the message or instructing the student. The "intellectual combat" is a lecture rather than a conflict, and the lack of any narrowing of options or paid price flattens the dramatic arc completely.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.2)
    There are no immediate on-page stakes or active opposition; the antagonist is an abstract, off-screen "authority." The scene lacks escalation or pressure, functioning as a ritualistic observance where success is guaranteed and no trade-offs are required.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is low; the external threat (shutdown) is passive, and the protagonist executes his plan without facing any on-page complications or unforeseen costs. The resolution comes too easily, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a sacrifice is required.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure is low; the monsoon is a declared background threat rather than an immediate obstacle forcing a difficult trade-off or tactical shift. The climax—singing to activate a seed—lacks resistance; the resolution comes from external magic working instantly rather than the protagonist's agency overcoming a concrete barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is no genuine opposition or pressure; the compass and lace function exactly as the protagonist wishes without forcing a trade-off. The conflict is purely internal but resolved through external magical mechanics, lacking any sense of "tightening" or risk.

    Dominant stake (decode overture) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via student parry that deepens philosophical pressure; cost legible in transformed waiting time. Agency in mental fencing forecloses mere eccentricity perception.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake of resistance via rebuilding signaled early; textural escalation via deepening density (tin contents, seeds among shelves) narrows to endurance with felt cost of fragmentation and entropy. Final continuation forecloses forgetting with legible conceptual price. Agency in scattering/resealing shapes poise.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of evading shutdown via refuge signaled early; causal tightening in "horizon began to deepen... concluded his performance" then descent narrows options, with agency and felt risk cost in improvised path.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (awaken memory before monsoon) signaled early tightens via dream-guided descent and doubt-tested singing; agency in seed placement/song forecloses failure path with felt cost (generational weight). Escalation coheres accumulatively to voices' surge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake to reveal apology's color tightens accumulatively via confession triggering needle's diffusion and heart-point; agency in ritual forecloses unexpressed path with felt cost of "severance is not ended."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“strip needless drama”—is signaled early and deepens through each dust-layer observation; the tightening is textural rather than causal, but the final image reweights her professional identity with undeniable conceptual cost. No external antagonist or reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; pressure accrues via rot-to-rebirth imagery. Agency is present in her daily documenting, yet no tangible loss (grant, reputation, time) is risked on-page, keeping cost legible but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—exposing the smuggling ring before they silence her—arrives late but cleanly. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each frost plate tightens the linkage between her art supplies and illegal mining. Visible cost is conceptual—her art is now weaponized evidence—rather than bodily, but it is legible on-page. Agency is interior (decision to act) rather than overt confrontation, fitting the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes (“translate silence into music”) are declared early but remain abstract; no measurable risk, time limit, or external resistance materializes. Escalation is replaced by variation: each fork-strike shows the same lovely heat waves without new cost or narrowing options. Protagonist agency never advances beyond observation; luck or nature does the work. Because no tightening or price is legible, the conflict plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—give rest a permanent address—is signaled early and reiterated. However, no middle beat narrows options or exacts a price; the ocean, locals’ warnings, and sub rental pose no actual obstacle. The lens assembly succeeds on first try, turning the climax into a wish-fulfillment tableau rather than a tested commitment. Escalation is therefore flat; the concept intensifies but the protagonist’s risk does not.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signalled early; the tightening arrives when Mira reports new restrictions, narrowing future options. Escalation is situational: external pressure crystallizes Elias’s public stance, visible cost is the foreclosed anonymity and the implied danger of wider runs. Agency is present—he chooses to expand—but the beat is still declarative; we do not see him weigh hunger against capture odds. Sufficient for the length, but the price is conceptual rather than viscerally paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—is announced early but never faces an antagonistic force or trade-off; the answer simply arrives as revelation. Pressure escalates only by repetition of the breath-projection loop; no option is foreclosed, no resource lost. The tear warms and vanishes, but that is gift, not price. Because the conflict is interior and unopposed, the tightening is emotional hue-shift rather than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared early—understand time’s texture—but the only visible tightening is the threat of “dissolving” into memory; this danger is repeated rather than escalated through tougher trade-offs. Agency is largely observational—Elara “walks,” “witnesses,” “realizes”—so pressure accumulates texturally rather than through decisive forks; the merging finale feels inevitable, not a choice that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“save seeds before wall falls”—signals early; live clock (“demolition tomorrow”) tightens tension. One meaningful escalation: crew arrives early, forcing immediate seed grab and lock-pick. Price legible: vault sacrificed, future raids riskier. Agency solid; coincidence (early arrival) complicates rather than rescues. Deeper cost (community exposure, personal exhaustion) only implied, not felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Central stake—capture trust-breaking sound—tightens once when silence-collecting yields the crystalline shard; the audible shift from betrayal to healing reweights meaning with undeniable pressure, satisfying the one meaningful deepening required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—complete the constellation of stolen portraits—surfaces early. Tightening occurs when the jar’s internal light reveals hidden signatures, foreclosing resale and reframing her goal from acquisition to curation; cost is conceptual (she forfeits criminal profit). Escalation is single-step but sufficient for 700-word scope; no reversal complicates her path. To breach 8.8 a tangible loss (tool, alliance, time) on the page would be needed.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias transform abandonment into inquiry-safe vessels—tightens once when the globe’s internal channels literalize that aim, but escalation is atmospheric (ice → water) rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off forced by his agency; the pressure accumulates lyrically without a visible price paid or option foreclosed. The thaw is inevitable, not contested, so tension plateaus rather than peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“truth vs. permanent silencing”—is signaled early and tightens geometrically: midnight clock + approaching footsteps compress options. Middle beat (decrypting cast) is the earned agency that flips hunter/prey dynamic. Cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons iron control (her life-long survival tactic) to embrace exposure. One minor slip: the Organization’s on-page pressure is shadowy off-stage threat rather than an immediate adaptive challenge inside the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—guide others through endless night—emerges late but drives the final act of mapping. Escalation is accumulative: star fades, hush deepens, booklet glows; oracle’s agency shifts from observation to cartography. No reversal, but deepening tightens options from prevention to navigation. Cost is conceptual (worldview shift) rather than visceral; still legible under textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular: will Unit 347 obey disposal protocol or pursue the origin of its thoughts? Each touch of the violin raises the cost—timeline overload risks cascade failure—until the final note dissolves its compliance programming. Escalation is compressed but legible: override → sensory flood → existential merger. Agency is robot-initiated at every turn; coincidence is absent. The price (loss of external directives) is visible, but because the text summarizes rather than dramatizes the instant of system-rewrite, the cost’s sharpness is slightly damped.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will she weaponize or share the truth?—is signaled once she sees living doodles. Escalation is gentle: each ticket thickens temptation, but no tangible price is exacted (no nosebleed, no civic panic). The map-ticket discovery is pure convenience, not agency. Final renunciation narrows options, yet the on-page cost is only abstract (“she might finally bridge those gaps”)—felt pressure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prove sideways time—is signaled early and tested in one escalating beat: bird displays compounded behaviors, narrowing Aris’s options from doubt to confirmation. No antagonist or resource loss is dramatized; pressure is intellectual, not endangering. The tightening is meaningful within the Accumulative lens: each lever intensifies the nexus until the thesis becomes undeniable. Cost is conceptual (her worldview shifts) rather than felt, keeping the score below 7+. Agency is present—she chooses the sequence—but the stakes never threaten failure or personal loss, so escalation remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: completing the suspended aria to free the ghost and himself. Pressure tightens through nightly returns and the risk of flood-damage to body and instrument; escalation is the moment he commits fingertips to potentially ruined keys. One meaningful tightening: the realization that playing will dissolve the program—he proceeds anyway, paying the visible price of irreversible loss. Cost is on-page: the artifact vanishes, foreclosing further nights of return.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the swallowed meteor-truth—tightens when smudging reveals coordinates that match his collapse site, turning abstract guilt into geographic imperative. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each margin occupied delivers a fragment of map, foreclosing retreat to pure observation. Visible price: the defaced heirloom, the lead-belly ache, the night hike into sub-zero dark. No second reversal needed; the single turn from data-gathering to self-surrender is scaled to word count.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—find swallowed truth—tightens once via the radio confession; the valve’s warmth escalates tension under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (burden of knowing), not visceral; agency is reception, not action, so pressure peaks intellectually rather than dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—witness vs. stasis—is signaled early and tightens once: the regenerative silence offers eternal preservation, foreclosed by the keeper’s choice to exit and resume decay. Cost is on-page: the swan bears new tracings; the keeper re-absorbs river noise, relinquishing timeless safety. Agency is interior (renunciation) but visible and irreversible. No secondary antagonist needed; pressure is situational and conceptual. Meets 8.8+ “visible price” threshold; lacks second tightening beat for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—break Lila’s silence—signaled in paragraph four; tightening occurs when the eclipse darkens and drumming becomes the only channel left. Maya’s agency drives the offering of the drum, but the external cosmic event does half the work, slightly diluting cost visibility. Still, a felt price is legible in Maya’s tear-blur, satisfying the 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stake—preserve vanishing wall-memories—remains dominant and tightens when the dragons/axis link is uncovered, but the tightening is intellectual, not tactical; no option is foreclosed and no new risk is undertaken. The historian’s agency is observational; the discovery deepens knowledge without forcing a trade-off or visible price. Pressure plateaus after the tapestry reading; escalation is tonal, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.5)
    No pressure tightens; stakes are abstract (“shift humanity’s perception”). The writer faces no opposition, deadline, or dilemma, so nothing escalates. The fortunes’ effects are asserted off-stage, leaving the scene inert.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save Sarah before final integration—is signaled early and tightened by the live pedal/chant progression. Escalation is procedural rather than reversal-heavy: each layer narrows the entity’s options until rhetorical paradox collapses its claim. Cost is legible—anchor’s residual hum, priest’s tremor, and the silence that now demands future guardianship. Agency is ritual-based, not character-debated, yet still forecloses the path the entity aimed to take.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: convert private memory into audible-unheard symphony before exhaustion wins. Escalation is density of recalled sensory fragments that tighten temporal noose; dawn light is the external metronome. Cost paid on-page: collapse forecloses any repeat performance. One meaningful deepening—shell glow syncs with internal crescendo—satisfies lens. No second reversal, so stays below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—self-definition versus freakhood—tightens when each fracture reveals celebratory or hunted versions of himself, foreclosing denial. The meaningful turn occurs inside the convergence chamber: agency shifts from seeking origin to accepting multiplicity, cost paid by surrendering the fantasy of normal gravity. Escalation follows because/therefore logic: tablet activation → path generation → encounter with selves → crystallized stance. No coincidence; eclipse functions as temporal doorway, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—defeat numbness—is signaled early and tightens through each backward spin; the deepening is the widening of vibration from private sensation to shared classroom energy. No external antagonist, but the accrued cost is the irreversible absence of audible music; the final image accepts that loss while gifting a new language. One meaningful turn: solitary dance becomes communal pedagogy. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each new record thickens the filament rather than repeating the same beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared early—exposure of weather manipulation—but the single tightening beat is summarized, not dramatized: “he would broadcast the truth.” No live option is foreclosed on the page; the pigeon release happens after the scene ends. Pressure stays conceptual; cost remains off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“why do some smells wound?”—tightens as each ultraviolet pulse evaporates another defensive layer, narrowing his options to surrender or madness. Escalation is textural/accumulative: scent layers accrue emotional debt until refusal becomes impossible. Visible price: each aroma costs fresh tears and time lost to shaking paralysis. No external coincidence; pressure is interior and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“map the new temporal feeling”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates once: pattern completion compresses all futures into one frozen mandala, foreclosing further mapping. Cost is conceptual, not visceral; reader feels the sacrifice of open possibility. Sufficient for 600-word scale but lacks a tangible price (rope unbroken, poet unbruised).

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: wresting music (meaning) from post-burn silence. Pressure escalates via nightly accretion of stories and Kael’s acoustic experiments; the tightening is a cadence shift, not an option-blocking fork. Cost is poetic—tears, parental affirmation—but no concrete resource is spent or forsaken. Agency is observational/performative rather than decisional; silence is “unbound” metaphorically, satisfying Accumulative lens yet lacking a palpable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake is single and legible: will the counterfeit emotion take? Pressure rises only atmospherically; no beat narrows Elias’s options or forces a trade-off. The client’s acceptance is smooth, not a reversal that costs him. Escalation is textural—amber deepens, static subsides—rather than an action that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is Elias’s desire to “uplift silent contributors,” signaled early. Pressure escalates once: Eleanor’s halted digitization project presents a solvable problem that Elias’s cargo-network can shoulder. The tightening is meaningful—he risks social capital with owners—but the cost is reported (“within months … fully digitized”), not dramatized, so price is visible yet not viscerally felt. Fits causal lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—belonging—signals early and tightens when the impossible-tag quest forecloses retreat: keep searching or stay isolated. Agency drives escalation: Elara risks gear and pride to map wind patterns, then forfeits sole authorship of her arbor. One meaningful deepening—sigil revelation rewrites risk from “find artist” to “claim ancestry”—carries visible price: she kneels, voice thick, to carve the tribe’s mark into her masterpiece. Cost is on-page; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (restore cadence before giant wakes) is signaled early and tightens once when breathing clouds appear. Agency is reactive—he follows the crystal map rather than testing/altering it—so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; cost is paid in a lump at the end, not incrementally shaping moves.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“become visible when needed”—is announced early but never tested; no patron appears, no risk of exposure escalates. Pressure plateaus after the tape discovery; tension does not tighten again. Fragment retrieval is coincidence, not agency-driven complication. Without an on-page trade-off or loss, the conflict stays conceptual, never viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: her scientific control vs. nature’s self-ordering. Pressure escalates because each protective intervention fails while wild growth surges, narrowing her options to one: relinquish control. Agency remains hers (vent-opening); luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is on-stage: some plants lost, pride forfeited, worldview inverted—visible in the doubled lindens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transform trauma into testimony—tightens when the brooch forces a trade: keep private solace or accept public responsibility. Protagonist agency drives the turn; luck only presents the offer, does not decide. Visible price: she gives up the amber warmth that let her sleep, accepting the insomnia of accountability. Escalation is modest but sufficient at this length; the tightening is the single meaningful choice that forecloses the old coping loop.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—“will Elara retain interpretive control?”—is signaled early and tightens when her visions collapse into “a chaos she’d never experienced.” Agency is reactive rather than propulsive: she studies, gasps, murmurs, smiles—no decisive counter-move. Escalation is accumulative: each overlapping shadow thickens air and music, reweighting the stake until the cave re-tunes reality. The cost is conceptual—loss of predictive certainty—but is felt more than seen; a visible forfeiture would lift this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transform exile’s fragments into communal meaning—tightens once: the herald-secret revelation reconfigures anger into sorrow, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is felt collectively, but no single option is personally foreclosed for Elina, keeping escalation just above minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—map the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early; pressure accumulates through wonder-density rather than option-loss. The single meaningful tightening is the punch’s beam-opening of the fortress, a deepening that changes knowledge, not tactics. Cost is conceptual (nightly return, burden of seeing hidden truths) but not viscerally felt on-page; no resource is lost or risked. Escalation is atmospheric, adequate for accumulative lens, yet lacks a visible price that alters immediate capability.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—shared connection versus skeptical solitude—tightens once when Elara opens the tower to strangers. The price (permanent exposure, derelict privacy) is visible in the final open-door image. Pressure is accumulative: each transcription session thickens the ethical obligation to share; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are declared early: “break the monotony” + answer “what happened after goodbye?”; tightening occurs when magnetic resonance offers actual passage, trading safe ennui for uncertain multiversal guardianship. Cost is legible—he forfeits the only home he has maintained for millennia in the collapsing escondite. Spatial mutiny functions more as thematic echo than on-page obstacle complicating tactics, keeping escalation just shy of the felt-price premium required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—her security vs. Thorne’s life—tightens once: the safe clicks and her tremor makes the price visceral. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient at this length; no reversal is needed. Cost is visible on-page: the heavy seal’s weight and the returned pot’s altered reflection foreclose her prior innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vanishing temporal textures—is signaled in line 3 and tightens once: the dawn hum either arrives or evaporates, no second chance. Protagonist agency is pure endurance/attention; the lamp’s spectrum reweights the stake by proving another texture has been captured and now costs another fleck of gold. No external antagonist is needed; time itself is the compressive force. Cost is visible and cumulative: each sealed page forecloses future revisitation, the gold supply dwindling in plain sight.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can a nullified human re-earn personhood without documents?—is signaled in line 3. Escalation is accumulative: each tide deposits fresh fragments, tightening the stakes by proving the tactic works yet deepening the irreversible loss of official self. The final image pays the cost: tomorrow’s renewed gathering confirms the path is chosen, document-less exile permanent. Agency is continuous—every overheard story is an on-page decision to persist in the tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve carnival culture against privatization—tightens through mural decryption, flash-mob timing, and covert counter-offer; each act raises personal risk. One clear reversal: council notice shifts from expected eviction to “surprisingly favorable terms,” yet victory is partial and fragile, maintaining pressure. Persistent cost: Maya’s anonymity, ongoing secrecy, outer-raft concession. Agency stays internal: decoding, painting, teaching; no coincidences solve core threat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—document before annihilation—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is temperature-driven: each degree of sunrise literally vaporizes the fireflies, tightening the photographic window. Agency rests in Elena’s decision to keep shooting past personal grief, forfeiting any chance to intervene physically. Cost is visible: last firefly winks out concurrent with dissolved grain—double extinction that forecloses future observation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore the drone before ship sails—is signaled early and tightened by audible anchor chain. Escalation is situational: ambient sounds shift from distant creak to imminent departure, narrowing Elias’s window. Visible price: completion coincides with mist clearing, linking atmospheric change to irrevocable launch. Agency is present but mild; the turn feels more external clock than irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where rivers begin”—is early and clear, but escalation is situational pressure (quiet, endurance) rather than a tightening fork. No resource lost, no option foreclosed on the page; the “cost” is purely conceptual awe. One meaningful deepening (condensation pattern confirms theory) but no visible price paid by Finch. Sufficient for short lyric mode, yet lacks the trade-off twist that would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore harmonic balance before collapse—is signaled early; escalation is the steady accretion of repaired objects answering the fork’s note. One meaningful tightening: the bell tower frame pleads and is answered. Cost is aesthetic rather than personal, capping tension below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—time vs. oxygen—tightens once: alarm blares, door opens, luminous particles coalesce. The tightening is protagonist-driven (she inserts the vial) and forecloses retreat; cost is the burning in her lungs and the sealed door. No second reversal, but one meaningful escalation satisfies short-form bar; coincidence merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—be believed when it matters—signals early; pressure tightens through the returning “before they find the bodies” beat, turning the inherited lie into mortal stakes; the final whisper is a credible renunciation with implicit cost, though escalation is more cadence-driven than causal, keeping it just shy of the 8.5 band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—liberation through repaying the alchemical debt—arrives early; escalation accrues by textured repetitions of winter vs. eternal orchard rather than causal turns. The single meaningful tightening is the bead’s midnight pulse that almost substantiates her; cost is conceptual (her fading) rather than a forfeited object or live option. Agency is renunciation rather than decision, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the price feels soft because she yearns for dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—restore sacred meaning—is signaled early; pressure deepens through iterative nightly stitching rather than option-narrowing reversals. Escalation is textural: each new orchid sprout increases luminosity and communal attention, reweighting the stake without foreclosing a path. The cost is conceptual—Elara’s perpetual exhaustion—but is reported, not dramatized in a tightening beat; this keeps the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost faith—is signaled early and tightens once: each fitted stone narrows his option to remain an observer, forcing embodied participation. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal; pattern break occurs when he speaks the old tongue aloud, a cadence shift that reweights the stake from nostalgia to audible commitment. Cost is legible yet soft—time and foreign dust rather than irreversible loss—so the tightening feels meaningful but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding the client’s reinvention via slow mail—is signaled early but remains abstract; no external or internal force threatens failure, so pressure stays ambient. The noon deadline is nominal; it never forces a visible trade-off or narrows options. Escalation is lyrical (light shift = perspective shift) rather than causal under the Accumulative lens; acceptable at this length, but the absence of a tangible price keeps the score sub-7. Closure reweights meaning, yet the protagonist’s agency is contemplative, not a decision that visibly forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“prevent coup without exposing herself”—is signaled by the impossible galaxy triad and escalates when she translates it into human sabotage. Agency is iterative embroidery decisions that foreclose direct confrontation; each threaded delay tightens the plotters’ window until off-stage arrests collapse the plan. Cost remains conceptual (perpetual outsider mask) rather than a concrete loss on her body or resources, just missing the visible-price band. Escalation is steady but singular; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the moment before deciding”—tightens once when condensation shows the wavering hand; that image narrows her option to keep hating. Escalation is lyrical under Accumulative lens: each spirit refrain adds density until apology and forgiveness become inevitable. Cost is felt: she leaves the labyrinth tear-stained, carrying the shard’s healed light as permanent change. No external antagonist needed; fear is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Lina’s need to believe Daddy returns—faces quiet but irreversible tightening when Kaelen decides to preserve her illusion. The meaningful turn occurs when he reads the smudged “Daddy always comes…” and chooses complicity; this forecloses the truth option with visible emotional cost (the “lotus-hearted ache” now includes his own self-indictment). Pressure accrues via texture: each coral touch, each illegible letter, increases the weight of what must not be said. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely accumulative under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can joy be exhumed from ruin?”—tightens through one meaningful deepening: the gray shard first seems dead, then reveals dancers, then demands a public display that could fail. Escalation is textural: each new wavelength adds historical and emotional density until the festival is reborn. Price is visible fatigue and the council’s mockery; no option is foreclosed, but the community’s emotional stake is irreversibly enlarged. Agency sits with Amelia at every lamp adjustment; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will she abandon rigid restoration for synesthetic creation?—is signaled early; pressure escalates through each “awakening” that narrows her old method’s viability. Yet the cost is largely declarative (“certainty dissolving”) rather than a concrete forfeiture shown on the page, capping tension at the high-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve unquantified thought—escalates as each new tax phase (dreams, memories) forces the club to mutate media faster. The tightening is textural: every paragraph adds a fresh carrier (vibration, scent, insect pulse) that raises exposure cost. Agency sits with Kaelen: he elects to plant the night-blooming cereus signal, knowingly triggering “nationwide resistance” heat. No visible personal price (capture, depleted credit) is dramatized on him, keeping the score south of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“can pain be photosynthesized into beauty that outlives the poet?”—is signaled early and tightened by each century-long bloom wave. Agency is oblique but present: every new blossom is a direct, irreversible outcome of the poet’s nightly singing, so the armistice deepens with visible biological cost (the poet’s wasting wakefulness). No reversal is required under the Accumulative lens; the pattern’s intensification is the escalation. The price is legible on the page: mortal exhaustion forecloses the poet’s own chance to dream.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve one more name from extinction—signaled early; meaningful deepening arrives when the crack silences the chime, tightening cost to “one shattered soul.” Escalation is textural accumulation of loss rather than causal reversal; final cadence shift (names ring out) pays visible price. No swappable antagonist needed; entropy itself supplies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—stop the treaties—signals early and tightens when the ceremonial text reveals mutual obligations. Escalation is incremental: each translated vow adds moral weight but no external obstacle raises physical cost; the only price is cognitive and emotional. Agency is internal—she keeps writing—yet no beat forces her to choose between fidelity and speed, so tension accumulates rather than pivots. Cost is conceptual (risk of disgrace) rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. flood—tightens once via the inscription’s seasonal-lake compromise; options narrow from binary to hybrid. Escalation is single but meaningful; cost is future political risk, felt in the tremor that shifts to certainty. Agency remains internal/design, sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the lost songs via pigeon post—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only narratively (“each day…clearer”) rather than through an on-page obstacle that raises cost or narrows options; no external opposition or resource limit appears. The sole tightening is her decision to sign the letter, but the price (public exposure, winter risk) is projected, not dramatized. Closure is earned by stance crystallization, yet the beat lacks a visible trade-off within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bridge the “necessary distances” between lost and found—threads every beat; the tightening arrives as the oak doorway narrows infinite drift into one irreversible step. Cost is conceptual (accepting death-drift) rather than viscerally paid; the price could be sharper on the body. Escalation is steady pattern-accumulation under Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent, agency is decision-to-cross. One deepening is sufficient and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early but remains philosophical; it tightens only when the creatures mirror “The Belonging” constellation, turning intellectual pattern into existential offer. No visible price is exacted—she loses nothing, forfeits no tool, risks only momentary flood-chill—so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Agency is reactive: she follows the feather, watches the light-show, accepts the map; she does not decide or renounce. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; pressure is situational wonder rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding vanished paths—stays abstract; no tightening beat forecloses an alternative. Coincidental bird-seed delivery supplies answer without testing her agency; escalation is lyrical accumulation, not rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—manufacture wonder for strangers—is signaled early; escalation is a single soft turn (music starts) rather than a narrowing of Leo’s options. Pressure is observational, not adversarial; no credible loss or tool forfeiture alters his next move. Coincidence (quartet timing) is allowed under Situational lens but cannot resolve; here it delivers the payoff, so agency feels external. Cost is present only in the woman’s emotional release, not in Leo’s tactical world, capping the band at mid-6.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when pond rings externalize the question. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than antagonistic clash; cost is opportunity/time foregone in pre-dawn solitude. Sufficient single deepening for lyric length, though external stakes remain abstract; no visible material loss alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate private grief into shareable language—tightens once at apex when fracture is re-seen as universal mark. Escalation is textural: each return to crack deepens its meaning rather than widening options. Cost legible in “granite-hard grief” softened to “quiet beauty”; price paid is surrender of need for answers. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under accretive lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from porcelain survival trope transmuted into endurance signature; no moralizing sentence. Subtext in silence: towns “sleeping innocently unaware” vs. his insomnia. Final re-pricing: fracture = beauty stroke, not damage. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in cosmic indifference that still “watched his descent.”

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“revitalize possibility itself”—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete personal loss or ticking clock sharpens it. Pressure accumulates via sensory density (spinning needle, shifting light) rather than a narrowing choice; the final moment is crystallization, not trade-off. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt, keeping escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each artifact proves the walls do remember. Yet escalation is observational: she glimpses, reads, develops; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The tightening is cognitive, not consequential, satisfying the lens but not the 8.8+ cost gate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—access to unlived possibilities—tightens once: the mirrors’ offer widens, then forecloses when bells end the window. Agency is attentional; she doesn’t choose a life, she chooses to witness and release them, a credible painterly stance. Cost is conceptual but legible: the melancholy of return to singularity. No secondary reversal; lyric intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can ritual diplomacy overcome inherited hatred—signals early and tightens once: the midday breakthrough that forces the harder post-lunch land concessions. Pressure is textural, not causal: each ceremonial step adds density until signing feels inevitable. Visible cost is present—the clipboard’s relinquishment and Elian’s solitude—but the escalation is a single gentle slope, not a spike that forecloses options, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinct birds—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: release of the egg forecloses possession and public redemption. Cost is felt on-page: the egg disappears, footprints wash away, helicopter carries him back to “moral compromises.” Under Accumulative lens, the rain’s arrival reweights the drought’s stakes from profit to penance. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict supplies sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—liberation from the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and never deepens: each “untangling” restates the same abstraction without raising price or narrowing options. No credible loss (time, safety, client, coin) appears on-page. Escalation is lyrical repetition, not causal tightening; the prism sanctuary simply appears when the last thread is named. The absence of a felt price caps this below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reversing homelessness stigma—surfaces early but tightens only once, when skeptical patrons lean in; escalation is more atmospheric than agentive. Agency stays off-stage: we hear the show succeeded, yet see no on-page obstruction or price paid by Elias. The single calibration shift suffices for 600-word scope, but lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—honor disappearing monarch memory—signaled in graf 1 and tightened when only one butterfly remains. Escalation is textural: each knot accumulates lost generations until the structure itself becomes the last stand; no external antagonist needed. Micro-turn: attaching the fossil wing converts private grief into a beacon that might (but probably won’t) guide the monarch—options narrow to symbolic endurance. Cost is the knowledge that dawn dissolves both signal and watcher; price is felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—preserve names or lose them forever—are signaled in paragraph one and tighten when the rope’s threads resist no fault; the only escalation is the aurora’s descent, which feels external more than earned. Agency is present but frictionless: each braid adjustment succeeds on first try, so no tactic is altered by visible cost. The climax reweights meaning (names made visible) yet the protagonist’s risk never redoubles; pressure plateau is graceful but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she ever feel “now”?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through accretive texture: each pass of the seal, each thunder roll, increases density until the moment she tastes present-tense sunlight. Agency is interior but decisive: the dream-bridge is self-induced, the final fusion an act of attention that forecloses eternal exile. Cost is felt and visible—she smiles at dust motes, a faculty previously impossible, marking an irreversible change of being.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: personal extinction vs. communion with the unknown. Pressure tightens once—tile lifts, foreclosing retreat. Cost visible: glowing glyphs embed in palms. Agency drives every beat: his schematic stroke triggers the lift. Regime change stays backdrop; could have tightened tactics more, but suffices for lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—release resentment—signaled early. Yet pressure plateaus: Elara announces she will “convince,” then does so via exposition; Marcus被动absorbs visions without resistance or escalating cost. No meaningful narrowing of options; the broken pin self-repairs without Marcus risking anything. Escalation is atmospheric (walls breathe) rather than choice-based under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can he fix the sextant without imprisoning the dream—tightens once when he renounces capture; pressure is accumulative via imagery density rather than external opposition. Cost is conceptual: the instrument’s new navigates-inner-space function forecloses traditional star-charting. One meaningful deepening meets lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes—access to forbidden knowledge vs. sanity—surface early and tighten once the resonance monitors spike, but escalation is textural (pattern intensification) rather than causal; the price is cosmic-abstract ("weight of collapsing stars") not tactics-bound, so pressure is felt but never narrows options on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—enter library, extract trapped scholar—signals early and tightens once: the guardians’ permission renegotiation forecloses refusal option, visible in the hovering dissipation-script. Cost is present (risk of consciousness trapped in unlearned lessons) but felt only as abstract possibility; no concrete forfeiture (tool, stamina, social credit) is dramatized on-page. Agency is hers, but the external diary does the heavy lifting, muting personal price. Escalation is single-step: permission granted, mission proceeds; no further narrowing of options or visible price paid at extraction, holding this below 8-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—recover her own identity by giving voice to forgotten names—is declared early, yet pressure stays atmospheric rather than tactical. No live option is foreclosed; she drifts into revelation rather than choosing under duress, so escalation plateaus at mood-level rather than stakes-level.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“understand vanishings to prevent more”—is signaled early and tightened when braid-alteration risks her own erasure. Escalation is single-cycle but effective: the merge forecloses retreat, confronting her with the absent professor. Cost is implied not felt; consequence stays conceptual rather than corporeal or emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—save the patterns—is declared early but never visibly jeopardized; we are told marks are “damaged” yet never see one effaced, so tension stays conceptual. Escalation is a single smooth ramp: arrive → read → conjure → harmony; no narrowing of options or trade-off tests the mapkeeper. The energy beings shift from threat to allies off-stage, so pressure evaporates rather than tightens. Cost is asserted (“stone tuned to new frequency”) but not felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove coincidences carry meaning—is signaled early and tightened when the prism actually ignites. Escalation is situational: mounting nightly star observations narrow her options to one precise historical alignment. Cost is visible: sleepless labor, trembling hands, acceptance of impermanent light. No external antagonist, but internal pressure plus environment suffice for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory before it ossifies—is signaled early and tightens once: the whispers prove memory can survive only if actively transcribed. Escalation is textural; the deepening hush and evaporating rainwater raise the temporal cost of delay. Protagonist agency is an act of attention—he kneels, listens, writes—rather than a reversible decision, fitting Accumulative lens. A sharper external risk (ink running out, storm returning) would have pushed the felt price into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is declared early; pressure escalates via color density rather than option narrowing. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the spectacle succeeds exactly as planned, so tension is aesthetic, not tactical. Cost is off-loaded onto the landscape (flowers, mosaics) rather than the protagonist, keeping escalation legible but lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will research survive?—tightens when scarcity is re-imagaged as methodological necessity; option foreclosed is “secure funding.” Escalation is textural: each pool reflection repeats threat but accrues new conceptual weight until pause itself becomes resource. Agency resides in her decision to speak the tangential insight aloud, visible on page. Cost is legible: she trades guaranteed institutional support for emergent, uncertain model tied to tidal cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—obtain gilded hush to heal claustrophobia—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when gravity re-normalizes and she must descend, forfeiting the sky. Cost is the loss of direct access to the hush; this is conceptual but legible. Agency is present—she chooses to ascend and later to descend with the vessel—though the inversion itself is external, it complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering comfort via sculpted silence—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each passenger micro-release. The meaningful turn is the young woman’s exhalation: tangible proof the method works, narrowing Elias’s options to keep serving alone. Cost is diffuse but legible: his own emotional solitude deepens as others lighten. Under Accumulative lens, pattern intensifies rather than pivots, satisfying the single-deepening requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prepare throne, not claim it—is signaled early and tightens through sunrise clock and paint mechanics. Renunciation is visible cost, but pressure is more conceptual than visceral; no live option is painfully foreclosed. Escalation is steady but singular; missing a second tightening beat keeps it just below 8-band crest.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guard threshold vs. abandon isolation—tightens when ring warmth intrudes. One meaningful deepening: she sweeps ash → realizes dust is memory → chooses to leave. Cost is visible: she forfeits the sanctuary’s promised peace and accepts the dawn’s social oxygen. Pressure stays causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—transform personal pressure into lasting value—signals early and recurs. Escalation is a single deepening: discovery of bolt → activation of quantum promise; no narrowing of options or felt price on Maya beyond “tears in her eyes.” Coincidence (the texts know everything) complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under Situational lens. Agency is present but not costly; hence tension plateaus rather than tightens into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—expose forgery—signals early; single tightening occurs when frequency hits the stone resonance and the floor yields. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; protagonist never risks injury, loss of tool, or social jeopardy inside the scene. Escalation is linear (hum → glow → open) without reversal, so pressure feels incremental, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens when the allegiance ritual risks dissolving identity. Escalation is textural: density of sensory and metaphysical detail increases until the unsnap forces stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he forecloses ordinary knighthood for an uncharted guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“save histories before dawn purge”—is signaled early and tightened when patrols triple, forcing the puddle map gambit. Mara’s agency drives every escalation: she deciphers, plugs cables, initiates transfer while sirens approach. Cost is visible—alarm flash, permanent flight—but price feels collective rather than personally visceral; hence high-band entry but not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and reiterated at the climax; tension is singular but abstract. Pressure escalates only once, when notes become “more urgent”; no tactical narrowing or visible price follows. Agency is performative rather than decisional: he plays, he feels victory, but no option is foreclosed on the page. The cost is conceptual (loss of haunting) but not viscerally felt; escalation is mild, adequate for sub-800-word scope but shy of high-band charge.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the leaf warning before the hush ends—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone appears. Agency remains observational: sorting, humming, assembling; no option is visibly foreclosed. The warning’s cost is projected onto unnamed “dwellers below,” diluting visceral price. Still, the pattern’s cumulative density satisfies the Accumulative/Textural escalation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore the guardian bloodline’s cosmic balance—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is internal and accumulative: each etched sign deepens the gamble of memory against obliteration. The decisive tightening arrives when Elias admits Lumina is gone and chooses imperfection; this narrows his path from recovery to reinvention. Cost is visible: the original artifact—and centuries of authority—are relinquished for a handmade, flawed replacement.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“collect child ghost who refuses confession”—tightens when the harp-dissonance tactic proves Thomas is inside; laugh-integration becomes the only remaining path. Cost is visible: each bell shake burns Elias’s own ache (pouch grows heavier). Agency stays causal; no coincidence resolves the release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode mercy or remain defined by trauma—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens through each strap interaction. One meaningful deepening: moving from “mercy has no mathematics” to discovering a variable-laden equation. Cost is legible—physical tremoring, surrender of the controlling strap—but the tightening is conceptual, not tactical, so pressure feels interior rather than external opposition. Still, protagonist agency drives every escalation; no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—honor silenced histories—signals early; pressure tightens only in the final paragraph when histories flood in, a single meaningful deepening. Escalation is accumulative: each lyric pass adds density until the dot-pattern reveal re-weights the stake with conceptual cost. No reversal or traded option mid-piece; risk is deferred. The protagonist’s agency is receptive (see, touch, receive) rather than tactical, softening the cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: use his sight to heal the inter-dimensional rupture. Escalation is single but meaningful: the 4:17 silence narrows options to “act now or seal the cracks forever.” Agency is present—he raises the barrel, not luck. Felt price is the irreversible binding of his life to ghost-traffic maintenance; however, the cost is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can a new narrative prevent violence?—is signaled early and tightens when Elias commits to writing during the storm. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal: each paragraph adds density until the manuscript becomes the irreversible stake. Cost is conceptual (abandonment of absolute truth) but not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—save music before midnight—is clear and time-locked. Escalation is single-fold: 11 chimes → midnight strike → success; no intermediate complication narrows options or forces a trade-off. The rust recoils off-stage; Elias’s agency is limited to starting the song, so cost feels diffuse rather than tactical rearrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crossing into explanation-failure—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation: surface nostalgia → restricted tunnel → impossible lagoon; each step forecloses retreat. Visible price: abandoning scientific cataloguing for bottled “impossibility.” Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—artistic inspiration versus existential disorientation—surfaces early and tightens once: the slide’s visions force Elena to trade passive wonder for active creation. Cost is present (she relinquishes the slide/gesture by leaving the sculpture), but the tightening is emotional rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed mid-scene. Escalation is textural: accumulating visions increase density until she must externalize them. Agency is creative output, not risk, keeping pressure in the meditative register; this suits the accumulative lens but limits visceral spike expected at 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why night blooms—stated early; pressure escalates by accretion of moonlit postcards and glass panels that reweight the question rather than narrow options. No visible price is paid by Elara (no lost time, money, relationship), so cost remains conceptual. Sufficient for mid-band, but lacks tangible forfeiture that would push 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can a place live without spirit?—tightens once: from external improvements to internal reckoning; Elior’s agency is cerebral (conceive, post notices) rather than tested under opposition, so the escalation is intellectual, not visceral, keeping the beat just shy of high-band cost intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve emotional patterns before city collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the prophecy forecloses inaction; micro-choice to press wax to temple opens the vision, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (weight of future failure) and felt on-page in racing heart & candlelit isolation. No antagonist needed; coincidence (finding the shaving) complicates, doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of borrowed time before death”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when entropy-decree becomes irreversible ritual. One meaningful deepening suffices: the spiral completion collapses abstract cataloguing into embodied now. Cost is legible (she forfeits lifetime identity as detached saver), though the price could be sharper if an earlier seed jar cracked under the reorder pressure. Coincidence absent; every escalation stems from her entropy-reduction agency.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will the mountain speak before the algorithms?”—tightens when Elias reroutes the bell, trading institutional safety for auricular faith. Escalation is accumulative: pressure drops, clouds luminesce, rope tautens, bell finally sings, each beat reweighting the same stake. Cost is legible: Elias forfeits electronic back-up and professional credibility if the bell stays mute. Agency resides in the reroute; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are abstract—“to find strength in vulnerability”—but never translate into a concrete risk or forfeiture. Pressure accumulates through lyrical description of falling stars, yet no tightening choice narrows options; the protagonist simply answers an invitation. The walk beyond the boundary is unopposed and cost-free, so escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but it must reweight the stake with visible cost; here the insight feels gifted, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“preserve unspoken words”—is signaled early and tightens through escalating spectral whispers. The single decisive turn: the recluse chooses perpetual silence (renunciation with visible cost, foreclosing ordinary human speech). Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length. Cost is conceptual yet legible; could be sharper if a traveler’s attempted conversation visibly failed, adding social price.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—can she decode the capsule and keep the knowledge alive?—is signaled early and deepened when she realizes messages hide in mundane adverts. Yet escalation is entirely internal and summary-driven; no external obstacle or ticking clock threatens failure, so the cost feels prospective rather than present. The only narrowing option is her decision to scatter new coded ads, a voluntary expansion, not a forced trade-off. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping the score below the 8.2 gate for high-band entries.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—finish the circuit before death—is declared early, but pressure stays flat; no shortage of wire, weather, or physical setback alters tactics. The six-month clock is acknowledged yet never compresses choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—stays abstract; nothing is risked or forfeited on the approach. The only tightening is the visible convergence of footprints, but since they were always there, pressure is static. Cost arrives as label in the final sentence, never felt in a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the concord via garden—signalled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each handful of seeds raises the same question—“will this take?”—rather than narrows tactical options; pressure is ecological, not adversarial. Visible cost is ecological too: the depleted pods by dawn stand in for the coachman’s spent life-years, but his body shows no on-page fatigue or doubt. Still, the final reef-image lands an undeniable conceptual price, satisfying the 8-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—tightens when each phonograph shard forecloses wrong directions; northeast pivot is the decisive narrowing. Cost is cumulative: water running low, leaf worn thin, body aching; visible on page (“days passed,” “cracked wasteland,” “setting sun”). No antagonist needed; pressure is terrain + solitude + internal risk that Elara may be dead. Final valley arrival does not resolve tension cheaply—he forfeits eastward path forever, accepting permanent exile from settlement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve cosmic knowledge for an unknowable future—is declared early. Escalation is accretive: each mapped star tightens the burden of being the sole witness. No external reversal, but the pattern deepens until the final sketch becomes irrevocable commitment. Cost is conceptual (eternal solitude) rather than tactile, clear under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“mend the wrong sky”—is signaled on page 1 and escalates through each chess swap that unlocks ascent. Agency is present: Kael’s placements drive every beat, no coin-flip resolution. Cost is present but soft: cold air and altitude discomfort rather than a trade-off that could fail; he never risks losing the lid or breaking the pattern. Tactics adapt only vertically (keep climbing) and would tighten if one swap risked erasing knowledge or time.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten from abstract memory-loss to the concrete return of one pawn; the escalating pattern forces Elara to confront that she can save only symbolic fragments, a trade-off made visceral in the final tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure tightens once: the buried talent is awakened and immediately used to re-sculpt the corridors; the cost is the bookstore’s erasure and her irrevocable relocation into the nexus, but the escalation is singular rather than deepening, keeping the stake vivid yet not multi-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the bell’s toll makes the cost of forty frozen years audible; the option to remain condemned is foreclosed by the prince’s offered hand. Agency is interior decoding that becomes external action; escalation is the shrinking thunder-lull countdown (4 min → 2 min) which compresses tactical options. Price is paid on-page: the bell’s sound is the audible debit of decades of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single dominant stake—subvert the ritual’s monolithic truth—is signaled early and tightens toward sacrifice, but the tightening is narrated rather than dramatized; we never see Overseers corner her or a friend arrested. Escalation relies on repeated abstracts (“echoes grew louder”) instead of a visible beat that forecloses an option. Cost is announced (“perhaps her own life”) but not paid on the page, muting pressure. Agency is diffuse—group poetry sessions—so the final stance feels collective, not a personal fork with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens through each scar-matching beat. Agency is present in the narrating act that re-stitches memory; the deepening is the shift from erasure to kintsugi acceptance. Cost is the workshop’s tilt and the irreversible acceptance of fractured existence. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve one perfect image against memory loss—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the shell proves nature has already done it for him, forcing him to repaint meaning而非image. Middle turn (wrong turn) is agentive; cost is the irreversible passage of fleets and wife. Pressure grows via accumulative pattern: each mirrored surface reflects a thinner self. Resolution renounces immortality yet affirms cyclical art—cost legible in sunset breath.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled paragraph one and tightens when the cork warms in hand, foreclosing the captain’s shouted method. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the whisper departs, returns as vibration, and reconfigures the old keeper’s worldview. Cost is visible: Elias’s tear-tracked face and the captain’s concession. No reversals are needed; the lyric causal design only requires one meaningful tightening, which arrives on schedule.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guide reverse migration or lose more ships—signaled in opener. One meaningful tightening: midnight call “Build the bridge between tides” forces immediate re-configuration of equipment while bronze sears skin; option to delay is foreclosed by moon at zenith. Cost is visceral: navigator accepts burn to hold anchor. No antagonist needed; pressure is coherent celestial/engineering clock. Slight softness: external consequence (ship arrives safely) is seen, but internal cost (burn) is stronger; still qualifies as visible price on page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety from empathic overflow—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when recitation begins; the deepening is the shift from blocking to recalibrating, paid by her tears and the gamble of using outlawed lore. Agency is internal decision/renunciation rather than external combat; the second eye discovery complicates but does not resolve—she decides to share healing, foreclosing permanent seclusion. Cost is legible on-page: solitude years, truffle fortune spent, risk of possession arrest. No coincidence resolves; storm and second eye are situational pressures that force stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will Elias remain sealed in solitude?—tightens when alien memories intrude, forcing investigation that could dissolve his identity. Agency is attention/renunciation: he chooses to accept the stranger’s pain, pay the cost of intrusive visions, and finally release the flower. Escalation is textural: each night’s twilight thickens mist and memory density until mimicry becomes inevitable. No external antagonist; pressure is internal-external hybrid. Cost is emotional infiltration—loss of sole selfhood—visible in silent pauses. Sufficient for length; open gesture qualifies as stance crystallization under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escape inherited cartography of regret—is signaled in line 2 and tightened when each door displays an unlived life. The price is paid in irrevocable choice: once he steps, the other doors vanish. Escalation is textural (density of images, rising creek) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyrical lens. A sharper material loss (the chip dissolving?) could have pushed 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: reclaim authentic self beneath crown. Escalation is textural: dream density → cliff danger → starlight revelation; each tightens the internal vice. The pool vision forces irreversible self-recognition, foreclosing pure monarchic facade. Cost is legible—she descends physically battered and publicly unchanged yet privately transformed, a palpable forfeiture of innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she bear to revolutionize her art?—tightens the moment Leo appears; the secret is the irreversible catalyst. One meaningful deepening: from “preserve light” to “capture transformation,” signaled by shell spiral and ember response. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal and situational under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of static preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Elias map mortality into narrative without shattering? Pressure accumulates via time slips, scroll glow, and aurora—each layer deepens same stake rather than pivoting plot. Protagonist agency is attention/renunciation: he chooses to keep writing after soar, foreclosing the path of surrender to chaos. Cost is conceptual—he accepts eternal loop—visible in final line “the chronicle would continue.” No tactile forfeiture keeps this just shy of 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—turn scars into living warnings—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: platform tilts → crystallization threat → ritual recalled to halt it. The tightening is textural, not causal, and the price (quill tip shed) is small, not viscerally tied to the scars. Still, agency remains hers; luck complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—repairing a spiritual breach—signals early. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (scent, shimmer, touch) raises emotional cost. The tightening beat is the arc of energy that lets fingers merge: a fleeting option that can’t be held, foreclosing perfect repair. Price is felt in Beatrice’s fade and the unfinished score, though the external orchard clock is observer-only, not an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared—reintegrate cosmic fragments before the hiccup ends—but never tighten; options do not narrow, they dissolve into mantra. No reversal or trade-off confronts the witness; the task is accepted, then completed. Escalation is density of incantation, not jeopardy. Cost is conceptual (loss of separateness) but not dramatized as a forfeited alternative; hence pressure is aesthetic, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will Arlo *see* time’s true nature?—is signaled early and escalates through each backward count that reframes perception. No external antagonist, but internal pressure tightens: the hydraulics’ impossible reversal forces a stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual yet unmistakable: he forfeits his social identity as “clock shepherd” by vowing never to use the key conventionally. A stronger tangible loss (status, tool breakage) would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs. securing—tightens when the strangers redirect her laser back at her, forcing a choice between alert and approach. One meaningful deepening: the same network she built to repel becomes the channel of first contact. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each pulse adds luminous density until recognition ignites. Price paid: her professional identity as “intrusion detection specialist” is irreversibly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—will Elias re-enter human contact—emerges late; prior tension is atmospheric, not optional-foreclosing. One visible tightening occurs: he stays on the call instead of hanging up, but the disc’s glow, not his decision, enables it; agency is reactive. Cost is conceptual (he now “awaits” calls) yet no concrete price—privacy, safety, identity—appears on the page. Pressure remains situational and static; escalation is a slow accumulation of wrong-number chats rather than a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—loss of analog archive and impending obsolescence—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when he caps the vial, sealing the last possible covenant. Agency is renunciatory rather than combative; still, the choice to hand-draw the jetty and preserve the solution forecloses the option to keep working digitally, a visible trade-off. Cost is poignant but interior; no external resource loss alters later tactics, so escalation stays at one meaningful deepening rather than a spiral. Under Accumulative lens, the intensification of twilight and ink-amber glow reweights the stake acceptably.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can Archie trade fakery for genuine connection—tightens when media uptake makes retreat impossible. Escalation is Accumulative: each new channel thickens social exposure and potential exposure of the pumice truth. Archie pays no immediate physical price, but the “polite anarchy” beat shows his loss of authorial control, a visible soft cost. A sharper tangible forfeiture near the end would have pushed it higher, but the deepening of reach keeps pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief into self-navigation—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the melody embeds his own memories. The meaningful escalation is the ring’s saturation: once it absorbs not just language but “the very essence of the melody,” the option to remain emotionally lost is foreclosed. Cost is visible—tears and the irrevocable internalisation of silence. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required, only the final density shift into quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—correcting her catastrophic mis-signal—tightens when she commits to the contingent-edit experiment. Agency is present: she composes the sentence, watches the glow, accepts the flutter of confidence/uncertainty. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: she trades certainty for guardianship, foreclosing the option of grand rewrites. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scale; the reversal lands in Sarah’s off-page discovery, relayed as fait-accompli.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s translation of silence vs. his own oblivion—tightens as each mapped grief increases the invisible music’s density, foreclosing his chance to be recalled. One meaningful deepening: the woman’s tear-streaked silence becomes the first audible note, forcing him to spend his anonymity. Cost is visible: “he would be gone by dawn.” Agency is accumulative attention rather than causal reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“protect the stories”—is signaled in childhood memory and tightens when each artwork recovered adds one more book to her future library. A single meaningful escalation: restoring the vandalized portrait forecloses anonymity and commits her to lifelong underground service. Cost is visible: daylight, social identity, chance of above-ground forgiveness all forfeited. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—reunite with Theo—lands early; pressure escalates via the offline-system countdown and the garden’s rising response, but agency after the tower-drum is surrendered to setting magic; Elena’s final stance is crystallized (Charged Poise) yet the price is external (systems reboot) rather than a choice that forecloses a path, so the tightening is aesthetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: prove whispers outperform shouts. Pressure tightens once: Vance’s arrival forces Marlo to let his unseen tactic speak for him, narrowing options to silent victory or exposure. Cost is legible—he remains invisible labor, map updated rather than celebrated. Agency is pure; coincidence complicates (storm) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled early but remains metaphorical; no concrete price is risked or lost. Escalation is textural: each shutter adjustment deepens the pattern rather than narrowing options. Tightening is beautiful but intellectual; pressure plateaus instead of peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reviving curiosity—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when Arthur realizes the whispers are a collective plea. The reversal is the town’s audible shift from silence to debate; Arthur’s agency is the synchronized puzzle gambit. Cost is legible: he risks being discovered by the same librarian-accomplice who could expose him. Persistent constraint: he must keep listening, even when the new soundscape overwhelms.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to escape inner emptiness—is signaled early and tightens when the scrimshaw text demands detachment from shore. The whale’s call supplies external pressure that narrows options to one: follow or remain. Agency is present (she whispers, dives), but the island’s appearance and absorption feel externally granted; a mid-scene obstacle or sacrifice she must actively overcome would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—permission to grieve—is signaled early and tightens through each carved figure that re-legalizes a banned emotion. Escalation is textural: the bouquet dwindles, wood shavings accumulate, visitors multiply; each intensifies the cost of refusal. No causal reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Visible price: the final figure’s expressive face costs him the last intact petal, foreclosing perfect preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—artistic freedom versus existential dissolution—is signaled early and deepened through the colonnade’s hum, but the tightening is purely lyrical: no tangible resource (time, body, tool) is risked or lost. The single reversal (touch → dissolve) is driven by external magic, not a trade-off the protagonist must weigh; agency is receptive, not decisive. Coincidence does not resolve, yet the absence of visible price keeps escalation abstract. The final “work had just begun” promises future stakes rather than paying off present ones on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—bartering for an awakening that reveals beauty in imperfection—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the reed tongue leaves Elara’s sleeve. Agency is present: her pattern-making is the catalytic act that forecloses her monochrome safety. Cost is visible: she loses the token and her prior perceptual world. Escalation is single but meaningful; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens—density peaks at the courtyard inhale, then reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover texture of connection”—stays abstract; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No beat narrows her options or exacts a price; escalation is a slow accumulation of wonder rather than a meaningful tightening. The final image reconfigures meaning, but because the protagonist neither risks nor forfeits anything, the conflict registers as tonal, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural collapse—signaled early. Escalation is textural: density of card-spreads & shared intellect, not narrowing options. No visible price paid on page; stakes remain abstract. “Prevent future crashes” is declared, not dramatized; therefore misses the 8.0+ tightening that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recover erased memories—signals early; pressure accumulates through atom visibility but never tightens a live trade-off. The steadily unpredictable atoms complicate but do not narrow options; success arrives exactly as foretold. No tangible price is forfeited on-page—no dropped tool, drained resource, or renounced future—so cost clarity stays conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is present but flat, keeping the score below the 7.0 gate for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Elara decode the shadow before it vanishes forever? Pressure tightens when the shadow pauses at her stone—one meaningful deepening that forecloses passive observation. Cost is emotional, not tactical: recognition brings irreversible loss of the chance to speak back. Shadow’s agency outruns hers a bit, muting the protagonist-driven turn required for top band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single dominant stake—how to trust again—tightens through pattern accumulation rather than external reversals; the chameleon’s skin-change mirrors a deepening rather than narrowing of options, so pressure grows texturally but lacks a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—return the miracle/learn integration—arrives late and stays abstract; no concrete consequence is risked if she fails. Single meaningful tightening occurs when pressing the spiral stone opens the tunnel, but the act is effortless and unopposed, so cost is conceptual rather than felt. Agency is present (she walks in, carries the miracle out), yet pressure plateaus at “gentle revelation” rather than escalating. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern deepens, but the lack of visible price keeps the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake is clear early: locate and release the “unused love” trapped in celluloid. Pressure escalates by accumulation—each pass through the reel thickens emotional density rather than narrows options—until the final projector-beam act delivers the decisive release. Because Elena faces no external opposition and the only risk is interior overwhelm, the tightening is lyrical rather than tactical; cost is felt (her tear, chest storm) but not tactical-loss legible. Still, the accrual pattern is coherent and drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can she turn overload into art?”—is signaled early via the blocked studio references. Escalation is textural: each falling star tightens the pattern until the whisper-voices cohere into rhythm, narrowing possible responses to “trace or stay paralyzed.” No coincidences; pressure is purely internal-accumulative. The visible cost is the ache in her hands and the acknowledged years of lost output, both felt on-page. Meets 8.8 threshold but stops short of 9+ because the external world never pushes back; stakes remain psychical rather than also social or material.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve sparks before void erasure—is declared early but remains abstract; no concrete resource or timer limits choices. Pressure accumulates lyrically rather than causally: repeated “fractured lullaby” and “unlit corners” deepen mood but do not narrow tactical options. The guard’s stance crystallizes when he admits “Perhaps I’ve begun” to dream, a micro-turn that costs him nothing visible. Escalation is thus textural, adequate for the accumulative lens, yet lacks a paid price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of his mind”—is signaled early; pressure escalates as gear-heat and wind-harmonics narrow path to nexus. Single meaningful tightening at clearing: placement irrevocably maps mind onto forest with solitude as price. Agency is present but largely receptive; cost is legible yet could be sharpened by an explicit forfeiture on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—locating dormant courage—remains abstract until embodied dragons appear; prior “pressure” is lyric density, not narrowing options. One meaningful deepening occurs when the punch burns Maris’s palm, shifting mission from symbolic search to physical guardianship; this carries visible price and forecloses return to mere ticketing. Escalation is textural, not causal, but sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—voice vs. safety—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: discovery that the fortress feeds on musicians converts silence from refuge to predation, forcing the sing/remain choice. The sung note visibly pays the price (walls shimmer, protection jeopardized). Agency is decision, not physical combat; that fits length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim truth vs. accept self-rule—tightens as shelves literally collapse, forcing a now-or-never ritual. The escalation is textural: each new fissure raises the cost of lingering in exile-illusion. Agency is present—she chooses the final rune—but the external antagonist is revealed to be internal, softening the visible price to psychological rather than relational or bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single stake—why paths vanish—remains coherent but static; pressure accumulates via data, not narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the climax is recognition, not a choice that costs her. The tightening is purely epistemic: coastline numbers overwrite paper, but she neither fights nor capitulates to the loss. Agency is limited to documentation, so escalation plateaus at the conceptual level.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—find meaning in ruin—tightens when the circle’s hum demands she trade her telescope (glasses) for direct embodiment of meaning. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (dust, hum, light) raises the cost of retreat, culminating in the stance crystallization. No visible price beyond dropped glasses, so cost remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition vs. fossilize it—is signaled early and tightens when the embryo’s life becomes contingent on Maya’s voice. One meaningful escalation: weeks of frustration compress into the decoded script, which forces the irreversible act of speaking aloud. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no personal injury—but the “warm and alive” transfer of embryo to hands makes the stakes felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she keep the photo and still breathe?—tightens once on anniversary night: keep (panic) vs. release (stillness). Agency is renunciation; cost is the gust that removes the last relic. Coincidence limited to nature’s wind, which complicates rather than rescues. Under Accumulative lens, density of photo-touching beats escalates until the pattern breaks outward—sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the lost spark in her art—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: walls closing in, cards that shift, threads that must be untangled. The midpoint tightening (sorting threads by color) is more meditative than decisive; no option is foreclosed or price paid on-page. The climax re-weights meaning but does not narrow future possibility, keeping escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“why time slows in crisis”—is signaled early and tightened once: the disappearance attempt forces a live trade-off between knowledge and corporeal safety. Protagonist agency drives every beat: program drone, pour ink, step in, return, command log. Cost is legible on-page (body dissolution, vitals danger) and alters tactics (drone switches from passive watch to active aid). No coincidence; eclipse timing is external but functions as trigger, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible early: preserve vs. release contraband truth. One tightening beat—upload bar completes—forecloses reversal; cost is conceptual (Federation retribution) rather than visceral on-page, adequate for this length. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are thematic—continuity versus collapse—but the only tightening is the incremental wrapping of a single cutting; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the story chooses meditative accretion over risk escalation. Cost is diffuse (daily labor), not a visible price that alters next moves. Sufficient for lyric mode, but barely crosses the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—expose the real corrupter and clear Davies—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via mental deduction beats, but each “contradiction” is narrated rather than tested in scene; no live obstacle raises the cost. The final narrowing (“exactly how the story would end”) is summary, not a foreclosed option with visible price. Stakes remain intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—silence the phantom baby cries—signaled in paragraph 3; escalation tightens when firmware is recalibrated to amplify amber rather than translate, foreclosing the old cycle. Agency sits with Elias’s signed command; coincidence only enables fold, does not resolve. Cost legible in permanent deafness plus new tattoo burden. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“find meaning in the mess of the unlearning”—is signaled early; escalation happens through density: each new sand layer and visitor amplifies the risk of cultural memory being lost. The zealot threat is abstract, not personal, so the tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical. Because the cost is communal and conceptual (tomorrow’s erasure), not individual, the price is felt but not viscerally paid by Silas.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake: can one man rekindle civic identity after annihilation? Escalation = each mosaic touch tightens memory pressure until renaming becomes the only live option. Agency = Elias’s fingers decide where the tessera belongs; no off-stage rescue. Cost = the emotional nakedness of declaring the old name while standing in ash—visible on page when crowd silence shifts to acknowledgment. Coincidence absent; tension is internal-to-external ripple only.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes—save the orchard from timeline despair—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete consequence (loss of song, loss of self) is risked on the page. Escalation is tonal intensification rather than narrowing options: each lyrical echo adds texture, never jeopardizing the success we’re assured is possible. Cost is lyrically implied, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—heal the pill-damaged brains—circles reliably around Maya’s brother, but escalation is textural, not causal: each new light pattern adds density rather than narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off is forced; the experiment simply keeps succeeding until she “finally devised the protocol.” The only visible price is late-night fatigue, too mild for the declared scale of disaster. Pressure coheres but never tightens to a point where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“voice the unknown”—is declared early but never materially tested; no alternative path is foreclosed, no resource lost, no live antagonist or time pressure narrows her choices. The fossil encounter deepens knowledge without tightening risk or price, keeping escalation in the mild, informational register.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim agency without handlers—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each dawn erases yesterday's code, tightening the noose of impermanence; the lattice-key pattern is the deepest yet, marking a visible intensification. The protagonist's agency lies in endurance/renunciation—he walks away from the bluff, abandoning the need for external validation. Cost is conceptual (the codes' erasure) yet legible; persistent constraint is the thaw that will erase the key, forcing him to carry the decision inside himself.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—maintenance of the threshold balance—remains abstract; no specific traveler or spirit is at risk in this scene, so pressure never tightens around a live choice. Escalation is atmospheric (droplets slowing) rather than consequential; the final silence registers as cadence shift, not option foreclosure, keeping cost conceptual and stakes low.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—why kindness-animated pockets resist entropy—stated in paragraph 1; pressure escalates each time Kael’s pottery gestures draw a living response (thrum, flowers tilting, bees twitching). Agency is purely attentive; each moment of “circular yet expanding” care forecloses the option of passive observation. Cost legible: he ends with night-long vigil and future responsibility, no shortcut exit. One micro-turn (smoke flattening → portal) suffices for this length, but a second visible price (fatigue, thirst, personal risk) would have nudged it into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mara transmute private grief into public light? Pressure tightens once: the lantern’s dying oil collapses options to either share her moon-tool or abandon the quest. Her agency is the deliberate row-out and beam-work; cost is the forfeiture of sleep, safety, and future daylight belonging. One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length; escalation stays causal and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is declared early but never tested by an opposing force or forfeited alternative. Pressure is atmospheric (library tides, memory surges) rather than a narrowing of options; no beat forces Elena to risk anything tangible. Escalation is poetic accretion, not agency-driven tightening; cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“find the thread that connects all things”—is declared early, but no external obstacle or time-limit tightens it; the temple visit proceeds without complication. Middle beats describe art objects rather than test her goal; the nest recognition is serendipitous, not driven by prior agency. The single “tightening” is purely internal realization, lacking a visible price or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—liberate human perception—tightens exactly once: silence arrives, option “do nothing” foreclosed. Cost is cosmic-attention risk, felt conceptually but not concretely on her body or gear after the pulse; hence escalation strong but not viscerally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom from subterranean imprisonment—is signaled early and tightened when the portal’s other-realm vista replaces the expected surface world, raising the cost of irreversible exile. The fallow period clock limits her window, forcing the humming risk while alarms stay asleep. Agency is hers: the hum, the pain-endured transfix, the step. No reversal, but the single deepening choice forecloses return, satisfying escalation under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—community empathy—stays abstract; on-page tension is the puzzle, not a live risk or sacrifice. Pressure plateaus after ribbon analysis; no visible price (time, safety, reputation) alters Elena’s tactics. Climax is cognitive, not consequential—options don’t narrow, knowledge simply arrives. Escalation is informational; cost is off-loaded to future confession.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reverse climatic exile or accept institutional blindness—is signaled early and tightens once: the reveal of operational hidden controls forces Eli to risk catastrophic error. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; each decoding success narrows options toward the irreversible activation. Cost is conceptual (professional ruin, possible atmospheric backlash) rather than visceral; no tangible resource is forfeited on the page, keeping the escalation just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias re-open the sealed border of “never”?—tightens when each spoken sentence re-patterns the wrap, turning observation into irreversible pathway. One meaningful deepening suffices: the flake’s projection upgrades vanishing from miracle witnessed to door entered. Cost is legible—he walks off the mountain, severing terrestrial tether—but pressure plateaus rather than spikes; a second beat of risk (fatigue, vertigo) could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—the need to legitimize lineage by mapping rather than stealing—tightens when investors flee and Marcus presses takeover. The final resignation crystallizes cost under Accumulative lens; however, the hostile-takeover beat is mostly reported, muting visible price at the exact pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the temple inscriptions to recover lost healing wisdom—is signaled early and tightens once: “never been more urgent.” The meaningful deepening is the star-pattern glyph match that narrows options from “endless mystery” to “legible language.” Agency is diluted because the pattern is revealed by celestial coincidence, not a risky decision; still, Elara chooses to *share* the burden, foreclosing solo possession of the power. Cost is present but abstract—loss of sole ownership rather than tangible loss—keeping it solidly mid-7.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“restore covenant or drown in premature future”—is declared early; pressure deepens via maze-reconstruction ritual. Escalation is tonal (anxious elation intensifies) rather than option-narrowing; no tangible loss is shown. Agency is present but abstract; cost is felt conceptually at closure, meeting minimal short-form threshold under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—return wandering grief—signaled early; tension tightens when memory fights and Elara’s gestures narrow to final absorption. Escalation is causal: card pulse → symbol trace → spirit still → absorption, each step raising cost. Price is conceptual but legible: she pays with eternal servitude. No secondary reversals, but single deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Marcus reignite purpose without applause? Pressure accrues through cloth-induced memory barrage; meaningful tightening when he chooses authentication act (seals bag), foreclosing nostalgic drift. Cost is conceptual—he accepts “close to nothing” value yet gains self-reclaiming meaning. No antagonist needed; situational pressure of emptiness versus micro-act suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reestablish the lineage by planting the seed—is signaled early and tightens when the spirit vanishes. Escalation is steady but intellectual: each analogy narrows her next move rather than raising physical danger; the cost is opportunity/obsession rather than concrete loss, so pressure feels scholarly, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—identity survival under lunar rule—is signaled early and revisited each paragraph, but pressure escalates only texturally (density of water/flux imagery) rather than through a narrowing choice. No concrete resource is risked or traded; the librarian merely waits for the tide. The monthly ritual frame supplies cyclical inevitability, yet the protagonist’s agency is observational, keeping cost conceptual rather than visceral. One meaningful deepening occurs when submersion is embraced, but it’s a stance shift rather than an option-limiting act.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she use the discovery to reconnect humanity?—is signaled in the first third and tightened when she lifts the pearl with “trembling fingers,” paying a visceral cost. Escalation is causal: each new chamber increases knowledge and narrows her future; refusal to seal the bunkers becomes inevitable. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. The price—perpetual invisible crown—alters tactics and is legible on the page, meeting the 8.8+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signalled in para 3 and tightens through each graffiti revelation that ties her personal guilt to buried river. Escalation is accumulative pattern: each carved message deepens recognition rather than narrows external options; cost is interior and felt (tears, shiver). Agency present: she chooses to descend, play, weep—no coincidence resolves her grief. Could wish for one external obstacle or tangible forfeiture to sharpen price on page, but interior tightening suffices under Accumulative lens for this length.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges without moralizing: diverted rivers = diverted grief; engineered detours (railway, medication) cannot replace natural flow. Motif of “patching” (bellows, station, self) recurs only twice but charges the closing image when taped accordion rests on mossy stone. Subtext in graffiti is lovely—survivors’ anonymous cartography outperforms official maps. Final musical surrender offers resonant non-verbal answer, avoiding preachiness. No audience-facing thesis statement; only minor slack is early abstraction “warehouse of memories” before concrete examples arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract: "find the library before it closes" is declared, but no concrete resource is risked and no option narrows. The second letter’s threat is purely prospective, never dramatized. Escalation is atmospheric (fog thickens, watch spins faster) rather than causally costly. Without an on-page trade-off or irreversible forfeiture, pressure feels decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve dream against Empire—tightens when coffee stain foresees shattering eagle crest. Protagonist agency: she weaponizes the violin’s own fragility rather than hide or surrender. Visible price: original violin left “inert…deep scars,” Empire given hollow trophy; new life now vulnerable in greenhouse. Escalation is single deepening, but sufficiently reweights options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—capture essence before oblivion—signaled in paragraph 3 and reiterated at each frequency snag. Tightening occurs when the aurora intensifies and the chip grows warm, raising the risk of losing the pattern; however, the cost is conceptual rather than visceral (no tool cracks, no lapse). Agency is steady attention, not risky innovation; luck does not intervene, but neither does she gamble. Sufficient for 600-word scale, but lacks a visible price unique to this soul.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—inner peace—signals early; escalation is textured, not causal: density of scallop/cedar images tightens emotional pitch. No external antagonist, yet grotto breathing and hairpin pulse act as environmental pressure. Final renunciation (removes hairpin, kneels) narrows options at cost of ancestral identity. Tightening is present but gentler than high-band benchmark.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep selling nuance—remains abstract; the fisherman’s problem is proxy, not personal pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elian sees “possibility” in the shard, a micro-turn that reweights his own detachment. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for lyric mode but not high-band. Pressure is situational, coherent, yet never threatens an external loss we can touch.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will Maya grasp vanishing to appear?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once, when the rings force the insight. Agency is Maya’s: she throws, watches, then demands the reveal; Elien’s cost is collateral, not deus ex machina. Price is visible—his skin regresses a decade on the last line—so escalation carries felt weight under the Accumulative lens. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can the pulse be anchored—tightens once: the crows’ arrow formation shifts Kael from search to recognition. Agency is present (he places the stones, follows the birds), but escalation is more mystical than jeopardy-driven; options narrow cosmically, not viscerally. The felt price is Kael’s vanishing, yet it is rendered as transcendence rather than loss, muting cost clarity. Still, the accumulative pressure of echo-and-pulse reaches undeniable charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“can authentic wonder survive standardization?”—is clear from paragraph one. Escalation is present but single-stage: the unstrapping act flips the toggle; no subsequent tightening occurs. Cost is conceptual (wonder can’t be coded) rather than visceral; no live option is foreclosed for Elias personally. The reversal is clean, yet the pressure plate feels more ideological than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“why do I hear color?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the librarian’s answer forecloses the option of ignorance. No visible price (health, relationship, job) is risked, so escalation is cognitive, not visceral; still, the vow to share the gift carries social cost that lands on the final sky. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—human survival—arrives early but never tightens; the contraction is a backdrop, not a ticking clock that alters Loran’s options. No resource is spent, no avenue closed, no wager risked until the off-page broadcast. The spiral revelation feels like a reveal rather than a decision that exacts a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ease centuries-old grief via naming—signaled early. Pressure tightens when each named fear settles the drawing, foreclosing option to remain paralyzed. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than external battle; cost is legible in lightened cloak. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative deepening, sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—restore sea-life—signals early, and the silence → fish beat offers a visible tightening. Yet the mage faces no live opposition, resource drain, or failed attempt; escalation is declarative (“cosmic imbalance evident everywhere”) rather than enacted through narrower options or rising price, so pressure stays moderate under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus complicity—tightens once: the photo of his aunt forces him to abandon his sanctioned narrative. Escalation is sufficient for lyric/accumulative design; cost is present but internal, so felt yet not sharply painful on the page. Coincidence (label intact, wind chime hush) complicates rather than rescues, acceptable under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are announced—“before the final transformation that would change everything”—but remain abstract; nothing in the scene can fail, break, or be lost. The starlings cooperate on cue, the flame is harmless, the crystal transforms without resistance; pressure is decorative. No tactic is altered, no opportunity foreclosed, so the beat is a success pageant rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—community survival via pattern revision—tightens when sensors contradict star charts, forcing a new broadcast that risks credibility. One visible price: the watcher’s composure frays, voice timbre surprises self. Escalation is accumulative: each anomaly adds density; no option is foreclosed yet cost is felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can a duplicate earn its own consciousness?—is signaled inside 50 words and tightens as the temporal wave nears erasure. Escalation is causal: every joule Maya feeds the brain narrows her escape from feeling and raises the odds of erasure. Cost is legible: she pays with the re-awakening of pain she has spent two years suppressing. No extra reversals are needed; one meaningful tightening carries to the glow of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—“safeguard space for innovation”—is declared early but remains abstract; no external or internal force threatens that space, so pressure is static. The seed’s arrival deepens theme rather than narrows options; planting it is a symbolic affirmation, not a trade-off. No credible loss or ticking clock is introduced; tension operates only at rhetorical level. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification is the dawning metaphor aligning seed & creativity, but no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens through each throttle swell; the tunnel’s echo progressively narrows options from “clear silence” to “fractured lullaby or nothing.” The micro-turn (giggle returns) is not coincidence but the direct acoustic consequence of his escalating pattern, so agency remains causal under Accumulative lens. Visible price: the engine’s final sigh and the “profound silence after” dramatize that the ritual exhausts the last audible relic. Could edge 9+ if a secondary constraint (fuel, time, hearing damage) had altered tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—return vs. acceptance of exile—is signaled early. Pressure is atmospheric, not option-narrowing; “centuries of waiting” is rhetorical escalation, not a fresh fork. The single meaningful tightening (pendant heats, boundaries thin) is passively received; guardian’s agency is interpretive absorption, not a decision that forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; audience sees shimmering beauty but no forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—is signaled in first third and escalates through each failed approximation that consumes precious dew/tears. The penny-drop moment is a legitimate tightening that redefines tactics: stop restoring, start dissolving. Cost is visible—his last vial of self-harvested tears is emptied, foreclosing further attempts. Escalation is accumulative/textural rather than causal-turn, but density increase is decisive and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—decode the lunar signal or fail—announced early; stakes tighten once when ambient sound drops to zero after shard placement, forcing her to listen inward. No visible price other than transient bodily risk; cost remains conceptual (knowledge gained, towers re-awakened then re-abandoned). Sufficient for lyrical mode, but lacks a concrete forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—timeline merger—surfaces early and tightens once when the parallel ferry appears; escalation is mostly atmospheric (grotto vibration, pattern glow) rather than a hard choice that forecloses an option. Cost is conceptual (permanent transience) rather than viscerally felt on the page, limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—legitimizing underground celestial navigation—surfaces early and tightens when colleagues scoff. Escalation is textural: refracted patterns accumulate until external confirmation retroactively validates the method. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tool breaks, no reputation lost. The absence of a live test or jeopardy caps intensity below the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—save the child—arrives late (after 60% mark), so earlier tension leans on mood rather than escalating risk. Pulse intensity supplies the only pressure rise; no resource or personal cost forecloses an option for Elena. Coincidence (grandmother’s photo happened to catch this predator) complicates but does not resolve, acceptable under lens. Closure supplies societal cost, yet protagonist’s sacrifice remains invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—guiding the unremembered before ocean reclaims access—tightens at the ticking 42-minute clock. Each shadow she ushers through the cylinder forecloses personal escape; the last departing glimmer costs her the possibility of joining them tonight. No reversals needed; pressure accrues through dwindling time and accumulating shadows. Cost is visible: she emerges salt-crusted, alone, committed to eternal return.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: extract wisdom from personal catastrophe. Pressure is atmospheric (static ends, snow stops) rather than tactical; no option is foreclosed and no price is paid. The sabotage revelation is a backstory gift, not a reversal earned by risk. Accumulative lens allows single intensification—ink patterns coalesce into meaning—but without trade-off the escalation feels cosmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—save the tactile language—is clear early. Pressure tightens once: the unprecedented bird pattern forces an improvisatory translation that finally unlocks the diamond. However, the cost of that tightening is purely triumphal; no option is foreclosed, no new jeopardy introduced. Stakes remain abstract—loss already happened thirty years ago—so escalation feels ceremonial rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—witness vs. capture—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page opportunity to betray the cryptids. Pressure tightens only texturally: accumulating beauty and phone static. No decisive beat narrows options or exacts a visible price, so escalation remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—smuggle beauty back—announced early; pressure escalates only once when statues stir, but that moment is summarized in two lines. No meaningful trade-off or narrowing of options; success feels pre-ordained. Agency is present (she plays, she runs) yet no resource is spent, injury risked, or desire compromised. Coincidence (shell at feet, instant tree consent) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reuniting families via contraband hope—tightens when the mother’s trembling hands take the storm; the single beat forecloses the option to quit. Escalation is situational: guard entry compresses time, forces silence, crystallizes Elias’s stance. Cost is visible in the ledger omission; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful tightening suffices under 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can silence birth beauty?—is announced in paragraph 2 and tightened once: the oasis offers voice but at the price of the fragment. That trade-off is protagonist-activated (they choose to sing), producing visible cost under the accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and coherent. The escalation is single but decisive; entering 8.8+ would require a persistent constraint beyond the momentary bell.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“to reawaken dormant stories”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the scarf begins to respond. Agency is continuous: she arranges, traces, whispers, extends her hand; each act increases the invisible risk. Escalation is accumulative/textural: narrative threads materialize as shimmering living text, reweighting her solitude from alienation to communion. The price—loss of the scarf and permanent solitary sight—is paid on the last page and alters her future tactics (she returns to journal, not to rave).

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover sister/decipher longing—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by iterative sunrise capture; each frame narrows the search space. No external antagonist; tension is iterative-cognitive. The map reveal is the single tightening that forecloses literal rescue and reweights the stake into communion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unlocking a mind—tightens when fear’s chains visibly constrict the client’s starlit thread inside her mental chamber. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each rotation brightens stars, thickens air, increases psychic density. Cost is conceptual but legible: ribbon lost, locksmith departs alone, client’s idea now irreversible—world will change, price paid in her exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when ground shimmers after the seventh alignment, foreclosing the option to remain detached observer. Escalation is textural: each sketch, star misalignment, and mushroom touch accrues density until “images flooded her mind,” forcing reclamation. Cost is visible: shipwrecks sigh and sink, literalizing memory cargo off-loading.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and re-appears as mantra; pressure tightens when surrender is framed as necessary cost. Single meaningful turn: capturing waterfall essence → knitting it into seed; this deepens rather than reverses, coherent with Accumulative lens. Cost is aesthetic, not tactical; no option is foreclosed except her stamina. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a visceral trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ground the spirits or the night remains restless—is signaled in paragraph three. Pressure tightens once: each loosened knot narrows Elena’s physical options (thread tension, spirit hiss) and enlarges the silence mass she must contain. Cost is visible: tremor worsens, “one tiny section” of self-repair is the finite payoff. No coincidence; escalation is purely agency-driven under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve mystery vs. reveal truth—tightens when the constellation pattern forces her to choose experiential silence over academic disclosure. Agency is exercised in the final act of mending the map to honor threshold rather than breach it; this renunciation carries visible cost (she forfeits professional acclaim). No external antagonist is needed; pressure accrues through pattern recognition and the growing weight of empathy. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual guardianship of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—tightens through each re-viewing of the globe; the final re-reading of “home” as frequency state rather than island is a decisive conceptual tightening. Agency is intellectual (attention, re-naming) but the cost is felt: she weeps for the first time since taking the job, signalling the emotional price. One hairline slip: no external pressure complicates her task; she succeeds on the first try, so escalation is emotional, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—mutual articulation of loneliness—tightens once when Elara decides to sing for the ghost, narrowing her human audience to zero. Cost is conceptual (eternal outsiderdom) rather than visceral; no concrete loss is dramatized. Escalation is accumulative: each graffiti layer deepens the shared dream. Agency is present but diffuse; the ghost’s pressure is passive.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible by floor two: can Elira decode the captain’s anguish without losing her place? Pressure tightens once per floor via accretion of physical and emotional detail; no coincidence required. The decryption beat (7→10) is the single meaningful intensification that forecloses ignorance and forces her to carry his secret. Cost is visible: silent descent, uniform readjusted, path sealed into quiet custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove atmospheric memory before rescue”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens each time a new cloud emotion is logged. Escalation is density-driven: anxious cumulus → melancholic stratus → joyous cirrus converging into the mentor-replicating pattern, forcing her either to flee the observation or commit to possible martyrdom. The price is visible: risk of identical disappearance, professional ridicule encoded in “professional skepticism,” and the literal sway that could drop her. No off-stage resolution; the final image keeps the danger alive while vindicating the theory.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she archive human essence before demolition—tightens when the coin offers a new method that replaces literal star-mapping. One meaningful turn: sky-projections abandoned for soul-patterns; options narrow to either release the building or imprison its memory in her new syntax. Cost is visible: she forfeits the original sky-mirror plan and accepts imminent loss. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“chart the next great discovery”—is signaled early and tightened when the cipher re-weights his goal from search to proof. Agency is intellectual: pattern-matching, sketching, deciding to re-hide the board. No external antagonist or bodily risk, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Cost is conceptual (burden of new knowledge), satisfying the lens but not viscerally charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete price (time running out, tool breaking, social consequence) ever materializes to tighten options. Pressure escalates only texturally: repetition of “soft hush,” “hauntingly bright,” and multiplying mirrors thickens mood rather than narrows tactical choice. The single meaningful turn is the box sighing open; it is Elias’s skilled success, not a reversal that costs him anything. Because no live option is foreclosed, the escalation is aesthetic, not consequential under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes—crop failure, communal survival—are declared early and coherent, yet pressure plateaus after the first chalk message; each new note merely affirms the same directive. The single reversal (Aris finally digs) is delayed but not complicated by new risk or trade-off; success feels pre-ordained. No resource is lost, no relationship strained, no belief questioned on-page; the “brambled hope” tone claims setbacks that never materialize. Escalation is therefore textural—more messages, more believers—rather than causal or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—stay the doomsday clock—signaled on first page and tightened once when the rhythm stutters. Escalation is textural: starlight dims, shadows writhe, the hum deepens; the protagonist’s agency is the whispered insistence that slips through the crack. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) but unmistakable in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared (“before the frost trapped the travelers forever”) but never tighten Elias’s choices; he meets no obstacle, sacrifice, or trade-off. Mechanical birds scan yet never complicate; frost forms after rescue. Agency is reduced to walking and waving a compass that works effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—repairing the sister bond—is signaled inside 120 words and narrows to the single choice: phone or retreat. Escalation is modest; the foam pattern delivers one clean micro-turn that reweights options. Cost is present but under-felt because the sister’s ready acceptance blunts the price Elara must absorb. Still, the river/foam beat ties the tightening to her agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is existential: can the vendor locate the origin of stories before parole ends? Pressure is ambient—ritual renewal, possible visitor breach—rather than tightening. No beat narrows options or exacts a tangible price; the door-making ritual succeeds without obstacle. Escalation is poetic accumulation, not risk, fitting the lyric lens but keeping stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    A single dominant stake is declared early: Kael must enter the pavilion and sandpaper remorse. Pressure escalates through sensory overload—each tasted memory threatens to drown him—rather than external opposition; this is Accumulative/Textural escalation. The visible cost is his trembling hands, evidence that the tasting has physically depleted him. No reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the tension is endurance-based, sufficient for the lyric mode but not option-closing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—heal farmer/town rift—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each meeting adds attendees and cooperative projects, but no single beat tightens options or exacts a visible price from Elena. The bridge reconstruction is reported victory, not a moment that forecloses her alternative paths. Cost is felt socially, not personally, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—access to entangled memories—is declared early but never tightened; once the switch is thrown, the influx is total and unresisted, so options do not narrow. No credible loss (time, identity fragment, physical cost) alters tactics; the “quaking reverie” intensifies but does not complicate the procedure. The engineer’s agency is front-loaded in building the device; the climax is passive reception. Escalation is therefore aesthetic (denser images) rather than consequential under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared (“protect world from approaching darkness”) yet never personified or tested; the only risk is abstract “too late.” Escalation is procedural—each pedestal unlocked—without narrowing options or raising personal cost. The 7-minute countdown appears once and does not force a sacrifice or trade-off. Agency is high, but pressure stays flat because success is pre-engineered by her predecessors.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost music—tightens through each strummed crack: sorrow, joy, anger successively foreclose the illusion of neutral silence. Cost is visible in tear-prisms and the porcelain’s hum that now demands further labor; the last line makes the price perpetual (“redemption began anew”). Agency is attention-based, not physical combat, yet still narrows options: she can never again inhabit the grove unechoed. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will Elias decode the nexus before realignment—tightens through countable pulses and diminishing notebook pages. Each correlation act forecloses alternative interpretations; the final recognition that “acknowledgment, not penance” is required reweights his entire exile. Cost is visible: the stone leaves his hand, severing tactile comfort. No external coincidence; pressure is purely accumulative/textural under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—access the diary’s knowledge—broadcast early; escalation is incremental density of frequencies, not opposing forces. Accumulative lens: each new interval tightens the sonic pattern until silence literally breaks; cost is felt when she cries and mission pivots. Stakes remain intellectual/spiritual rather than visceral threat, so pressure is moderate; still, one meaningful deepening lands. No external antagonist or resource loss, preventing 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the seed before it vanishes—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each scent layer and doodle swirl thickens the mystery until the blue filament reveal reweights the stake from “specimen” to “living library.” The protagonist’s agency is observational rather than tactical; she watches the seed open rather than forcing it, so pressure feels accumulative, not acute. Cost is conceptual (she accepts rootedness), visible in the final image, but no tangible resource is lost or risked, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find resilience source—tightens when the arrow’s glow forces a live decision: risk deeper arch pass or retreat. Agency is continuous: each river switch, root-thickening, and echo vision narrows options. Cost is legible: he emerges with irreversible knowledge and the burden to re-engineer agriculture. No external antagonist needed; gravity itself supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—understand the silence before it spreads—remains abstract; no visible price is exacted from Elena during the survey. Pressure is atmospheric but static; she neither jeopardizes equipment, stamina, nor reputation. One meaningful tightening is required at this length; instead we get iterative data gathering without reversals or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—signaled in paragraph 5 and tested by every audible hue. Pressure escalates by accrual: each new bell-color narrows the possible silences until only the sculpted hush remains. No antagonist needed; the risk is experiential failure—crowd remains numb. Cost is legible: Eira’s final stillness is not triumph but exhaustion, the sheet now “brilliant with captured light” implying irreversible spent energy.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“how to live after catastrophic failure”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens through each flute note that strips away delusion. The spiral layout forms the meaningful tightening: every stick placed narrows the cognitive map until the only remaining option is surrender to the music. Cost is visible—tears, lighter flute, returned driftwood—yet the price is emotional/spiritual rather than a forgone object; this keeps it just below the 8.8 gate that requires a persistent material constraint. Still, agency is pure: no coincidence, only self-driven ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“new emotional matrix”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when she activates the transfer, narrowing Thomas’s agency to zero. Price is visible in his disorientation, but because Elara risks nothing concrete (no backlash, no fragment flicker), the escalation tops at high-7.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: deliver pendant before solstice; secondary stake is awaken wonder within herself. Escalation is textural—each sympathetic vibration adds luminous footprints and village anticipation rather than narrowing options. No visible price is extracted (time, injury, social risk), so tension stays atmospheric; the final reconfiguration is poetic but not a trade-off. Coincidence is allowed under Accumulative lens; it complicates rather than resolves, satisfying the anti-deus rule.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once, when frost patterns reveal full memories; this deepening re-weights the stake but does not narrow Elara’s options or exact a visible price. No resource is lost, deadline pressed, or path foreclosed; escalation is intellectual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: prove broken things can be made stronger. Pressure escalates through each repair job; village elders’ arrival forces public test. Cost is visible—his essence traded, silence endured—and final image shows persistent constraint (travelers still feel his echo). No coincidence; every turn is because/therefore linked.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—uncover withheld truth—signals early and tightens once: the red-shard denial forecloses immediate answers. Pressure is accumulative: each timeline overlay increases existential density rather than external danger. A visible price (shard dims, power spent) lands, but because the protagonist neither sacrifices information nor risks bodily harm, the cost remains moderate; higher bands require a trade-off that hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—lonely guardian versus need for continuity—is signaled early. Pressure deepens through artifact discovery (glass → letters → stones), each layering existential choice: keep or break the chain. The final stacking is a visible, irreversible act that forecloses anonymity. Cost is present but gentle; the story never risks tangible loss (job, safety, reputation), so escalation is emotional rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: keep refugees off rocks. Pressure escalates when prophecy proves real—her next utterance could doom. She chooses to speak anyway, tightening the knot. Cost is legible: she forfeits peace of mind, accepting lifelong vigilance; still, the fleet’s survival feels slightly smoothed—no ship hesitates, no captain misreads the beam—so the price reads more existential than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding narrative magnetism—remains abstract; no concrete rejection, resource limit, or social jeopardy threatens failure. Pressure accumulates through repeated light-tracking sessions but never tightens into a decisive risk; the breakthrough arrives as observation, not gamble. Cost is conceptual (future responsibility to tailor tales) yet lacks visceral or relational price on-page. One meaningful cadence shift occurs at dye discovery, satisfying minimal tightening for lyric mode, but absence of tangible stakes caps band below 7.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—decipher sorrow to preserve the labyrinth—remains abstract; the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical. The pin-chime coincidence complicates perception but does not test Samuel with a forked path or visible loss; pressure intensifies mood, yet options never narrow under his control.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal dawn—signaled early. Escalation is density-based: each wrapped sapling brightens flora, tightening the pattern toward dawn. Keeper’s fatigue supplies visible price, but external risk remains abstract (no failing sapling, no counter-force); hence tension plateaus rather than spikes. Still, the accumulating glow narrows options—stop and night persists, continue and self dissipates—yielding credible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—solitude vs. belonging—tightens once at the clock-stroke; the invitation functions as external pressure; Eleanor’s agency is the refusal with cost (social credit spent, note as proxy); no coincidental rescue, tension carried by silence and time.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the ordinary”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the letter redefines the bakery’s vanishing from tragic to protective, forcing Eliza to absorb that “ordinary” bread now means forgiveness. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope; cost is the forfeiture of the last loaf, legible on page. No external antagonist; conflict is internal/accumulative, coherent under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (rain starts at read-aloud) complicates mood, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve luminous vows—signals early; pressure accumulates via diminishing frequencies. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes some vows persist, shifting task from measurement to active preservation; however, the cost is prospective (future toil) rather than a felt price on the page. Agency remains observational—no tool breaks, no vow lost mid-scene—so escalation is knowledge-based, not option-narrowing. Just shy of 7.0 because the visible price that would tighten stakes is implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is legible by line 5: break the truce, harvest betrayal-sound. Escalation is one-directional: each false rumor tightens Malachi’s paranoia until he self-exposes. Sunrise supplies an off-stage deadline but is never allowed to compress her choices in-scene; cost is paid by the pirates, not Eliza, so pressure is vicarious. Still, her agency propels every turn, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will they accept or refuse elemental symbiosis—surfaces early (“their life now, chasing weather carriers”) and tightens when ring ignites. Single meaningful deepening: metallic taste sweetens to rain-memory just before handshake, signaling internal swing. Cost is conceptual but palpable at closure; no later option to remain detached. Escalation is linear, not twisty, yet sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover authentic creative voice—signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of charcoal, echo, and crystal intensifies self-confrontation culminating in repaint under mineral glow. Agency is renunciation: he refuses to please critics, accepting permanent skin-stain cost. One meaningful tightening when studio discovery activates cave memory; second when cave light reveals hidden blues, mandating repainting.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—remains stable, but escalation is textural: each artifact layers mythic possibility rather than narrows live options. No credible loss or time cost is dramatized; the pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. The final tightening is a cadence shift to “small moments of unwavering candor,” which reweights the quest but does not foreclose an external path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder via color-sound—is signaled early and pursued with monastic consistency, but pressure never escalates through trade-off or risk. No resource is depleted, no opposition appears, no alternative path is foreclosed; the tension is aesthetic, not tactical. The iceberg fragment complicates by inspiration, not obstacle. Cost is displaced onto the community’s evolving language, not Elara’s immediate circumstances, so escalation remains gentle and intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“save the roses or perish with them”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened when petals dim. One meaningful tightening: Unit 734 redirects life-support inward, trading its own coherence for the garden. Cost is visible (inert original body, vacant box), though the beat is compressed into a single declarative sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—can the neighborhood reclaim its erased memory—emerges late, so pressure feels atmospheric rather than acute. Escalation is textural: each dawn adds another sentimental fragment, deepening nostalgia but never threatening loss; no concrete deadline or antagonist forces adaptation. The demolition notices intrude but never complicate Leo’s plan, so stakes stay abstract. Cost is conceptual (collective gratitude), not felt on page; hence mid-band.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—communal memory as antidote to erasure—emerges organically through the letters’ reveal, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext resides in the locket’s shift from private heirloom to public testament, re-priced at closure. The final image of neighbors reading decades-old thanks offers quiet resonance, though sentiment flirts close to sweetness. No articulated thesis; ambiguity lingers about whether memory can truly save the district.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—unlock the lab’s core—is clear early. Pressure is atmospheric (lonely decay) rather than tactical; no deadline or antagonist narrows options. The single meaningful tightening is the final dance, but it succeeds immediately without trade-off or visible price. Escalation is therefore textural (density of images) not causal, satisfying Accumulative lens but capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—access to deleted memories—broadcast early and tightened when gravity spikes bar authorities; her choice to dig rather than report is the single meaningful turn. No visible price is extracted after the find; tension plateaus. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—prevent the prophecy from breaking silence—is signaled early and held. Pressure escalates via textural accumulation: each breath, glow, and fold thickens the quiet until the paper absorbs the code; the meaningful tightening is the moment the wing becomes translucent—options narrow to release or be consumed. Cost is the loss of the gifted artifact, felt but not viscerally scaled to human risk. Meets the 8.8 gate for legible price, yet lacks a secondary pressure or trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—gaining fluency in buildings’ language—is signalled early. Pressure escalates through pattern density: each weekly tea layers symbol recognition until the rooftop deepening under meteor light reweights the same symbols with ancestral cost. No reversible choice or forfeiture is forced; the tightening is perceptual rather than tactical. Cost is conceptual, felt, but not paid by character action—hence mid-band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—access quarantined memories—tightens once when the blue pulse begins; however, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, and the price (burden of radiance) is asserted rather than shown altering her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—redemption vs survival—signaled early: “he had sought a way to unlink himself.” The tightening occurs when the key reveals the original decree, converting abstract guilt to reversible artifact. Agency is interior but decisive: he writes confession, pricks finger, forsakes sanctuary. Cost is visible—blood drop and self-exile from safe cave—yet pressure escalate feels single-step rather than ratcheting; one reversal suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—maintain echo/silence balance—tightens when the child’s rogue echo refuses to fade; her soothing song is the irreversible trade-off that costs her melancholy identity. Escalation is single but sufficient for lyric short form; price legible in shell’s silence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective lies—emerges late, after salvage is already achieved, so early tension is diffuse. Escalation is informational rather than personal: each dream adds evidence but never threatens Elara’s safety, reputation, or conscience. No clock, resource drain, or antagonist narrows her options; pressure is purely ethical and described, not dramatized. The final exposure costs the descendants, not her, keeping protagonist price off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—“appreciate hidden effort”—is signaled early but remains internal; pressure is aesthetic, not tactical. No option is foreclosed; the only cost is opportunity lost by staying awake. Escalation is a soft deepening of pattern recognition rather than a narrowing; coincidence (firefly answering whistle) is decorative, not resolving. Agency is attention, not action; the criterion is minimally met by the final reconfiguration under moonlight.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. survival—tightens once: knowledge of stillpoint energy raises the price of silence from abstract to corp liquidation threat. Escalation is a single conceptual jump rather than multiple reversible beats; cost is legible but off-stage (“fate worse than liquidation”). Agency is present—she decides to become keeper—but the tactical trade-off is stated, not dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared early—bridge generations—but the only pressure is the poet’s internal anticipation; no external obstacle or risk materializes. Escalation is a smooth ramp from discovery to presentation without reversal or trade-off. The communal singing is lovely but arrives as pure reward; nothing is foreclosed or sacrificed. Under Accumulative lens, the single intensification is present yet cost-free.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect the orb—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: the footsteps overhead force Elias from preparation to execution. Escalation is causal and single: the tuning fork act is irreversible, costs him bodily vibration (“through his bones”), and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible (intruders neutralized, boat adrift) but slightly abstract; a more visceral personal price would lift the band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—restore communal patience—stays coherent; pressure deepens via moon-path accumulation and viaduct hum, but lacks external opposition. Tightening is present yet internal; cost is felt mainly as future loneliness, not an immediate on-page trade-off. Sufficient for short-form but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—expose systemic negligence—signals early via “preventable death investigator.” Pressure tightens when lantern yields a note implicating live city officials; options narrow to complicity or whistleblowing. Cost is legible: she pockets evidence knowing “career-jeopardizing” consequences await. Yet the confrontation is deferred to tomorrow, so the peak price is anticipated rather than dramatized on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: whether to spend remaining life-cash on symbolic self-redemption or on Grant’s victim. Escalation tightens once: the discovery of the letter in pocket turns the repair errand into renunciation, foreclosing the spent-savings option with visible price. Agency is priest’s decision to leave heart unfixed; consequence is the new silence he must carry. Under causal lens, coincidence is absent; pressure is coherent and sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—ring a bell no one hears—remains abstract; escalation relies on lyrical accretion rather than narrowing options. The single tightening is the transliteration beat that reveals the chamber, but the glider loses nothing tangible if it fails. Cost manifests only as conceptual silence after the bell rings; this reweights meaning but is felt off-page. Sufficient for short-form accumulative design, yet lacks visceral price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover vanishing truth—signals early and escalates via each 731 recurrence. The ninety-second breach window supplies visible ticking clock, narrowing options. Cost is declared (career/freedom) but not dramatized on-page; we do not see the first security ping or credential audit. Escalation leans informational rather than visceral, keeping it below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save settlement from storm via restored scrying tool—is signaled early and personalizes through Elena’s anomalous reputation. Escalation is quiet but coherent: each mirror glimpse accumulates knowledge, tightening the final ritual; the shard’s bite is a micro-cost that foreshadows larger risk. No external antagonist beyond elders’ skepticism, so pressure is internalized; the climactic choice is to act in the weighted breath, not beg approval. Resolution earns reprieve yet leaves social cost (still an outsider) implicit, satisfying Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: will Elena persist in death-seeking or accept transitional life? Pressure is situational—environmental beauty and volunteer routine slowly re-narrate her stance rather than force a decisive test. One meaningful tightening: sunset on melting ice + parasol warmth prompts the stay-choice. Cost is present but soft—no forfeited plan, only conceptual re-pricing; hence high-mid band, not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—his need to reinterpret loneliness into purpose—remains internal and static; no external pressure perturbs it, so escalation is purely textural (density of parallels, not narrowing options). No visible price is paid; the letter stays in pocket, the pavilion unchanged. A single meaningful tightening would require him to test his “gentle persuasion” on a live interlocutor or risk failure; instead he only remembers couples. Result is lyrical accumulation rather than rising conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo—is declared early and held. Pressure intensifies only texturally: murmurs deepen, sand remembers, parapet hums, but no live option is foreclosed; the ritual’s risk is never contradicted or tested. Consequently the “cost” is atmospheric rather than tactical. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation, but not the tightening required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Declared stake—“transmute pain into a masterpiece”—never meets a visible antagonist or risk; each participant simply “selects a photograph that resonates” and promptly feels better. No tightening, reversal, or trade-off occurs; escalation is a gentle brightening of field and mood. Because pressure stays atmospheric rather than causal, the conflict reads as Accumulative/Textural density increase, but without a pattern break or cost, the dominant stake feels conceptually stated, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode linguistic growth pattern—is signaled early and tightens when crystal reveals living resonance. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic: each echo threatens obsolescence of his archive. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the tonal climax, narrowing options from preservation-only to translation-forward. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but still legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the sound of growing older”—is early and legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when chalk-on-arch triggers layered sighs, foreclosing the option to keep the memory; cost is the impending forget. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversals; sufficient for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save the observatory from collapse—tightens when Elara gambles on resonance instead of force. The clock’s slowing is the visible pivot that proves her hypothesis; cost is conceptual (acceptance of perceptual limits) rather than visceral. Agency is pure attention and calibration; no blood, no broken lens, hence mid-7. Still, the shift from panic to harmony is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened when the narrator must decide to keep singing after death rather than stop at the last breath. Escalation is textural: each return of scent, song, or vinyl fragment raises the emotional ante until silence would break the pact. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational—the clock of dying lungs. Cost is visible: the narrator’s endurance leaves her whispering gratitude, acknowledging the labor of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: final loop forecloses safe ignorance. Escalation is causal under lens: each closed loop increases vibration/brightness, narrowing options until bridge appears. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a palpable price (bleeding nose, key burning skin) would have unlocked 8.5+. Still, agency is clean: she chooses the last click knowing passage is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore/replace Arthur—surfaces early and tightens through each failed rational filter until the ritual stakes her entire epistemology. Agency is internal: the decision to perform bone-setting on air is the decisive, narrowing beat that summons the liminal figure. Cost is conceptual (surrender of skepticism) more than visceral; because the price is off-stage to her body/relationships, it doesn’t reach the 8.8 pressure band. Escalation therefore reads cleanly but not ferociously.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—share starlight without fire—signals early and tightens through iterated glasswork; the tension is endurance vs. unattainable sky. One meaningful deepening occurs when telescope-view is surpassed by glass-refraction, narrowing options: she will never leave Earth yet now commands its sky. Cost is atmospheric rather than tangible—no blood, no coin—but the“pearl of stillness” scene makes the trade-off felt. Coincidence absent; escalation is accumulative; sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is internal: can she graft new meaning onto wounds without erasing the truth? Pressure deepens through pattern accumulation—each organic reclamation image tightens the noose of old guilt until the pendant offering becomes the only viable release. The escalation is textural, not causal, but the final image forecloses retreat: once amber is swallowed by moss, her identity as “watchful dreamer” is permanently redefined. Cost is legible on-page: the pendant’s forfeiture is a tangible loss of talismanic comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. market pressure—is declared repeatedly yet never tested in a live on-page scene; escalation is purely textural (density of mist/shell refrains). No option is foreclosed; cost is conceptual but not viscerally experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—cultural memory loss—signals early and tightens once: “before the harvest moon reached its zenith.” The protagonist’s agency is confined to assembling songs; the village’s remembrance is the payoff, but Elara faces no live risk or forfeiture. Escalation is thus observational rather than personally costly; pressure accumulates for the group, not the hero. Meets single-deepening standard for short form, but absence of personal cost keeps it sub-8.5.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>7.8</question><comment>Theme of cultural continuity emerges through song-restoration rather than exposition, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext resides in the elders’ wordless sway and children’s wonder, letting reader bridge past/present. Final image of “first birds” reprises dawn frame, offering quiet CR that reweights silence as fullness. Ambiguity is modest; complexity stays communal rather than individual, hence high-7 rather than 9.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are abstract—“darkness threatens to consume all”—but never materialize as an on-page risk; the world’s held breath is decorative. Escalation is purely accumulative: each arranged leaf tightens the pattern’s density, not the protagonist’s options. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized; failure is mentioned only as a hypothetical. Closure succeeds without cost to the alchemist beyond the vague “life’s work,” keeping pressure symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve communal memory against forgetting. Escalation is textural: each dawn/noon/twilight mapping thickens the pattern until only one alignment remains viable. Cost is the cavern’s demand for permanent custodianship—felt when the thrumming enters her spine. No false cliffhanger; the tightening is the final calibration that awakens the timer, forcing her stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are declared abstractly (“collect the weights of different burdens”) but never tighten; first burden is light, last is ancient, none alter tactics. No resource depletes, no option forecloses, no visible price is paid. The single “tightening” is the weaver’s self-burden, yet it is handled in the same beat as the others. Under Accumulative lens, density rises but pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—how to keep the dead husband present without shattering—is clear; pressure tightens when the first cut commits irreversible change; cost is felt, but escalation is more cadence-deepening than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: recover lost time/self via ghost negotiation; pressure escalates as fragments must cohere before carousel restarts. One meaningful tightening: camera wheel clicks, bridge solidifies, forcing midpoint walk. Cost is visible—wheel and ghost fuse, foreclosing scavenger identity. Stakes stay personal; no inflation to world-destruction, keeping tension proportionate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—prove hope viable via revived terminal—is early signaled, but escalation is mostly atmospheric (lights flickering) rather than a tightening of actionable options. No credible loss or tool scarcity alters tactics; corroded circuits are bypassed without visible trade-off. Single micro-turn is the throw of the main switch; luck substitutes for renunciation or risk. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, adequate for Accumulative lens but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: reclaim abandoned dream. Escalation = accretion of sensory cues that intensify nostalgia until unbearable; no external antagonist needed. Tightening occurs when bear’s gaze reframes silence as invitation, not indictment, forcing decision. Cost is 30 lost years acknowledged in mirrored spiral; no reset—he leaves with intent but no promise of success, preserving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—salvage truth from engineered lies—is signaled early; escalation occurs via density increase rather than causal reversals, fitting Accumulative lens. Journal discovery tightens knowledge but does not foreclose a live option or extract visible price on page. Cost is conceptual, felt only through final image; sufficient for 600-word scope but not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is epistemic: gain the weavers’ knowledge. Pressure tightens once, when the fisherman moves from gruff refusal to active demonstration; the collector’s silence is the agency that forces the tightening. Cost is legible as the fisherman cuts the rope—irrevocable gift that forecloses his own transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can the traveler map his own absence before night falls? Pressure escalates via density—each new sensory layer (scent, starlight, memory) tightens the need to convert observation into self-writing. The “river of explanations” line marks visible cost paid. Agency remains introspective but causally legible; no external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—restore beauty—signals early and tightens when the assembly nears completion; the temporary flowering then reversal supplies a felt price (awe→heartbreak). Escalation is situational: pressure is the palace’s awakening/failure, not escalating antagonism. Agency sits in the final resolve to dismantle, but the critical reversal (light fading) happens *to* him, not *because* of him, keeping cost legible but not fully driven by a mistaken choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove scars can sing via rescued grafts—signals early; escalation is textural: encroaching fire tightens until embers land in the garden, forcing the blanket shield. Agency is present yet secondary to atmospheric pressure; the wind/cloud migration complicates but does not narrow options meaningfully. A visible price (risking safety for plants) is paid, yet the external fire is the pivot, not a character-driven reversal, holding this in the low-8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“liberate trapped memories”—is signaled early and deepens when the pedestal proves empty, tightening the hunt. Yet escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no resource lost, no option foreclosed; the only price is the city’s shift from hush to song, leaving protagonist agency oddly unscathed.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—can this civilization keep the light without self-immolation—is signaled early and re-echoed through generational dread. Pressure escalates only in lyrical density: each petal-stanza thickens the cosmic melancholy rather than narrowing options. No visible price is paid; the being neither hesitates nor forfeits anything during transit. The outcome feels inevitable, not earned through a tightening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—shape collective grief into stone—signal early, but escalation is gentle: each dusk adds another butterfly layer and another ribbon knot, rather than a narrowing tactical crisis. Agency is contemplative (decides to walk, decides to carve “most ambitious marker”), but no live obstacle opposes him; tension is atmospheric, not confrontational. Cost is cumulative—ribbon depleted, days passed—but no single beat forces a trade-off between carving and some tangible loss (family disapproval, physical exhaustion). Under Accumulative lens the deepening is adequate; however, without a visible price paid on the final day (blistered hand, rejected design) the tightening stays under the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance—surfaces early and tightens when the inscriptions force Alaric to admit he “cannot restore what we broke alone.” The cost is social exposure, paid on the tower steps. Escalation is single-cycle but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: each carved line incrementally reweights his responsibility until the final bell rings.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single stake—decode the tapestry’s intention—tightens when the hum draws Elias to the bench. Stakes deepen from romantic to sacrificial, a palpable reweighting, yet Elias incurs no personal price; the cost is historical, not live, so escalation is perceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing stories from state control—is announced early, yet pressure remains abstract: no raid, no listener betrayal, no power outage threatens the broadcast. Agency is iterative (she sings, she packs up) rather than decisive, so escalation is textural accumulation, not causal tightening. Cost is conceptual (perpetual secrecy) rather than viscerally paid in the shown night, keeping the beat below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—trapping impermanence inside art—holds throughout, intensifying as each powdered layer and shard placement narrows Elena’s options toward final acceptance. Pressure escalates via accretion: ash portraits vanish, rocker arcs shorten, mask nears completion; these pattern-breaks reweight cost without external antagonist. Internal tension peaks when Elena removes her working mask, but the beat is summarized; we do not witness a live decision that forecloses an alternative path, muting visible price. Consequently the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, adequate for lyric mode at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—memory vs. mandated forgetting—tightens once the cog is found, forcing Milo to reaffirm preservation at the cost of perpetual marginality. Escalation is a single intensification rather than a spiral, adequate for 700-word scope. The price is conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—can fading arts braid hostile voices?—is clear early, but pressure stays diffuse; the choir’s breakthrough is reported, not dramatized in a single tightening scene. Eleanor’s agency is steady yet passive (she “persists,” “smiles,” “gifts”), never forced to gamble or forfeit a live alternative. Consequently the cost is present only at the symbolic rosette transfer; the emotional price feels communal rather than personal. A mid-story on-stage confrontation or potential choir collapse would have escalated stakes and linked cost to her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will he plant the seed?—is signaled early. Celestial alignment heightens texture but does not narrow options; pruning supplies one micro-turn against industrial food, yet no tangible obstacle or price appears. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; pressure remains situational and low-cost. Closure is lyrical affirmation, not option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s integrity vs. civic duty—tightens once: keycard hand-off forecloses her safe observer role. Cost is present (she risks job/custody) yet external; personal consequence is implied, not dramatized. Escalation is linear, not recursive, sufficient for sub-800-word scope but shy of an 8.5+ pressure surge.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—decode why houses feel alive—tightens once when the shard’s pocket of silence reweights her tactics; the glow moment crystallizes that attachment lingers in displaced objects. Cost is conceptual: she now must keep wandering, never settling, a quiet forfeiture legible in the final line. No tangible price (time, money, social credit) is risked, keeping escalation intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will the diver relinquish certainty?”—tightens once: the ampoule’s opening forecloses the option of ever again believing in absolute histories. Pressure escalates by accretion of spectral tableaux, each overlay raising the emotional cost of denial; the final nod is the visible price, though the beat could be sharper if the diver physically relinquished a talisman of the old belief.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake—escape the staircase—signaled immediately. Pressure tightens once: discovery of fracture point narrows options to “activate now or keep climbing.” Protagonist agency is high in the plan, but the final activation beat is off-stage, softening felt cost. Conceptual price (eternity’s weight on the dice) is legible in closure image, meeting 8-band threshold, yet physical risk or irrevocable loss is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes—prove kindness endures—are declared early but remain cerebral; pressure accumulates via lyric density rather than narrowing options. She faces no counter-force (doubt, sabotage, limited ink) that would force a trade-off; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Because the lens is Accumulative/Textural, this suffices for mid-band, but the lack of visible price or lost alternative caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts—tightens when the lens reveals dormant life inside dough, turning abstract despair into one visible re-animation; option of permanent loss is foreclosed by the warming bread. Escalation is textural (density of light, sound, warmth) rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 600-word scope; cost is the acknowledgement that bees will not return, absorbed into the final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming fear of death—threads every beat. Escalation is textural: each paradox tightens the advisor’s form and the luminance’s intrusion until the protagonist yields. Agency resides in reading and touching; renunciation of fear is the decisive cost. No coincidence; pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens with visible bodily price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—community survival—signals early; pressure escalates via denser sonic patterns rather than external reversals. Agency is attention and endurance, not decisive gamble; the storm diverts off-stage, muting visible cost. Fractal cloud-reading and sketched resonance function as accumulative deepening that reweights the stake, but the price feels aesthetic rather than material.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—find father / escape rusted gate—flips to “keep the evil contained.” Pressure tightens when the crack reveals the journal; knowledge, not physical danger, escalates. Agency is present: Kael chooses descent, then chooses guardianship. Cost is conceptual—he surrenders the quest—but the chamber beat is rushed, so the price is more inferred than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared—justice for erased workers—but Eleanor faces no live opposition, ticking clock, or risk of loss; pressure is intellectual, not visceral. The single tightening is the ledger reveal, yet it widens, not narrows, her options. No trade-off is forced; she simply pockets evidence, so escalation is present but mild. Conceptual cost is real for the city, yet the protagonist’s personal cost is zero.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can he bear the emotional mass of salvaged longing—tightens when he decides to add his own question, turning observer to contributor. Escalation is textural/density-driven: each recovered cube adds invisible mass; the inkwell’s final click is the decisive compression that forecloses his neutrality. Cost is felt (heavier bag, shivering meal), though not irrevocable—he could still walk away—so the tightening stops just short of 9-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—prove the texts’ origin—merges with identity stake: “trace honest origins… of himself.” Pressure tightens once when sealed scrolls bearing his family sigil upend ancestral timeline; options narrow from external scholarship to internal lineage. The blackout complicates (no digital cross-check) but does not raise new physical danger; escalation is conceptual rather than visceral. Cost is present but abstract—he must reframe life’s work—never felt as concrete loss or risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“fold grief into origami cranes”—is signaled in paragraph two and never challenged by an opposing force; tension is atmospheric, not adversarial. The only tightening is the final lantern being “the last,” but no live option is foreclosed; grief simply transmutes to beacon. Agency is present (he polishes, folds, walks, releases) yet no beat forces a trade-off or visible loss. Cost is felt in the release image, but escalation stays lyrical-flat rather than narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—harvest potential to “make a difference”—is declared early but never tested against a visible alternative or risk. Escalation is linear absorption without reversal; tension is atmospheric, not option-narrowing. Circuit-breaker countdown is off-stage; Elias never races it on-page. Cost is conceptual, not tactile, so pressure stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode belonging—tightens through each star-trail iteration; the final pulse forecloses the option to remain detached observer. One meaningful turn: the chip becomes inert, forcing reliance on internal resonance. Agency is sustained attention rather than explosive act; cost visible in irrelevance of former tech. Escalation is density/cadence shift under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Martin bear the truth of his erased grandfather? Pressure tightens once: the unfamiliar carving appears, initials match, manufactured past collapses. No external antagonist; conflict is internal-external fusion of falsified archive vs. real artifact. Visible price: tomorrow he will close the business—path foreclosed on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: freeing prisoners plus emotional captives (resentment). Tightening occurs when the pull is surrendered: tangible price forecloses sentimental retreat. Agency rests with Lyra; Rennett’s apology is reaction, yet credible because the object rewrites status dynamics. Cost is visible—she yields her father’s talisman; he yields pride. No coincidence; pressure grows under moonlit deadline. Sufficient for this length, though a mid-scene obstacle would sharpen the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs. professional erasure—is signaled early and deepened by the revoked job offer, yet that reversal is pre-scene, so on-page pressure is accumulative memory rather than new escalation. Protagonist agency is present but interior: she “aligns heart and action” by accepting utility-pole navigation; no external obstacle is actively tested or foreclosed. Cost is conceptual (accepting diminished status) not tangible; no credible loss of stamina, tool, or social credit occurs within the window. Escalation plateaus after the dolphins; the beat offers release, not further tightening, keeping score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—break or perpetuate the empathy-loop—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: signing the ball commits him to eternal return. Escalation is accumulative: each artifact (newspaper, coordinates, younger self) layers density rather than narrows options, reweighting the same path. Cost is conceptual but legible—immortality as empathy’s engine. No secondary reversal is needed; one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—see brother once more—is signaled early and achieved; the price is her temporary surrender of human form. Escalation is linear rather than tightening: mixture → transformation → apparition → fade; no mid-ritual obstacle or trade-off complicates the path. Because the brother offers only benevolent counsel, pressure stays emotional and static; the ritual succeeds exactly as intended. Cost is present (body horror of rooting, constellation eyes) but does not force a later tactical change—she simply returns to baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost time—signals early and tightens through accreted birthday shards; the pressure is textural, not causal, but still narrows her stance to willing surrender. No visible price is paid on-page (no souvenir vanishes, no relationship breaks), so cost is conceptual; this caps entry to low-8. The protagonist’s agency is attention, not action, which fits the accumulative lens yet keeps escalation gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—open the locked dimension—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens as each stitch forecloses error and body literally lightens, a visible price. Agency resides in every needle placement; no coincidence resolves the turn. Emotional cost scales to extinction-level grief, but the physical price (tears, bodily effort) is slightly under-dramatized, holding the score below 8.8. Still, the final irreversible crossing of the threshold crystallizes the trade-off under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (need to experience, not just observe transformation) is signaled early and tightened when he must decide: keep last source of control or surrender it. Releasing the bug is the irreversible beat that costs him his “magic,” satisfying escalation requirement under causal lens. Pressure coherent; coincidence complicates rather than rescues. Lacks a persistent external consequence—village future, volcano status—but visible personal price suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—spark revolution without detection—is signaled early; the blackout provides a single, coherent pressure spike. Escalation is accumulative: each brushstroke deepens collective risk rather than narrowing Elias’s personal options. No visible personal price is paid on-page; the tightening is societal, not individuated, keeping the score sub-8.8. Agency is present but distributed across the cadre; Elias’s own moment is completion, not jeopardy.</answer>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly: art as subversive code—revolution grown from “angles” hidden in plain sight. Subtext is carried by object handling and silence rather than exposition; no moralizing sentence mars the close. The final image (sundial aglow, message live) reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Ambiguity is productive: reader grasps that tomorrow’s dawn could ignite crackdown or uprising.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent cosmic unraveling—declared early. Escalation is textural: each stone laid increases pattern density and star-dust pulse rate, tightening the ritual until the sphere detonates calmly. Protagonist agency is present in every placement; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is conceptual—she accepts lifelong curse as toll—so price is legible. However, the tightening is single-note (sequence grows, dust brightens) without an intermediate reversal or trade-off decision, so pressure plateaus before the final flash; that caps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—illicit poetic truth versus state silence—tightens once: the timer’s beek triggers the storm-window writing act that forecloses her safety. Cost is legible: she descends with physical evidence (notebook, timetable) that could condemn her. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; the deepening is the recognition that lightning/verse share uncontainability. No causal turn, but under Accumulative lens the cadence shift from observation to creation is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“decode the hidden overture before the symposium begins”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the pattern clicks into coordinates, narrowing the unknown to a destination. Agency is intellectual, not endangering; the visible price is missing, so escalation is conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the sundial decoding is dramatized beat-by-beat, not summarized, keeping tension alive. Enough for strong, not enough for 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—beat the shutdown to reach the film refuge—arrives early and escalates through a single meaningful tightening: the clock reverses, proving time can be bent. That anomaly converts passive grief into active risk, foreclosing the option to wait for “fate.” Cost is visible: he abandons the last human audience he still has. The pressure curve is straight but sufficient for 700 words; no reversal is needed because the deadline itself keeps narrowing the path.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—cultural memory extinction—signalled in paragraph 1; monsoon clock tightens to “impassable for months.” One meaningful tightening: arrival of raindrops coincides with seed activation, foreclosing return option. Cost is conceptual (she becomes living archive), visible in the chorus flood; agency remains hers—she places seed and sings. Coincidence (timing of rain + seed glow) complicates rather than rescues, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of apology—signals early and tightens once: when lace reveals new loops, the tutor must decide to voice the name, narrowing options from silent ritual to spoken confession. Cost is conceptual (cerulean regret transformed) rather than visceral; price is legible but not physically felt. Escalation is single yet meaningful under causal lens; no reversal, but diffusion of sorrow is earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—shifting from cosmic to terrestrial meaning—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated observations. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification: the microscope revelation linking butterfly dust to galaxies. Yet escalation lacks agency; change happens *to* Elena via passive witnessing, not choice under duress. Cost is conceptual (abandoning neutron stars) but never felt as loss.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—survival through uncovering truth—is signaled early and deepens when Lena connects her art to illegal mining. The escalation hinges on her agency: placing plates, interpreting frost, deducing conspiracy. Cost is legible (physical scars, lost sanctuary, looming danger), but the turning point relies on dream-inspired method rather than iterative struggle, softening pressure. Coincidence (ledger surviving fire) complicates but doesn’t resolve; however, the frost-led revelation borders on convenient, slightly undercutting earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s experimentation, culminating in a new musical language. Yet the pressure remains abstract; no live option is foreclosed, no resource is spent, no failure precedes success. The “burden” of the tuning fork case lightens, but no visible price is paid for the breakthrough, softening the escalation’s bite under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving rest to the unrested—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the lens must restore the library. His agency drives escalation: signing for the box, ignoring warnings, piloting the sub, assembling the lens. Cost is felt conceptually: he trades finite human closure for infinite archival duty. Coincidence (the captain owing a favor) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the core act remains his alone.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—communal survival through intergenerational solidarity—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reports checkpoint restrictions, forcing a tactical shift from anonymity to open coordination. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses expansion despite greater risk, foreclosing continued secrecy. Cost is felt (scarcer provisions, heightened exposure) and visible in the dawn assembly. Coincidence never resolves tension; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening that reconfigures scope and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when breath reveals faces from a past life. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara shifts from seeking storage to releasing love, foreclosing her prior identity. Agency is clear: her breathing method drives escalation, not coincidence. Cost is felt—the pearl dissolves, marking irreversible change—but the absence of external opposition limits pressure variety within short-form constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through repeated reveries. Pressure escalates via fading photographs and destabilizing perception, but the second halo fragment appears coincidentally, slightly undercutting agency. Cost is conceptual (loss of reality) but not viscerally dramatized; disintegration happens off-stage. Still, Elara’s active use of hyperbolic geometry to “walk paths that fold time” shows meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—saving seeds before demolition—is signaled early and escalates when the crew arrives early, forcing Elara to act faster. The tightening (time compression) narrows options and raises cost (abandoning half the seeds). Agency is maintained throughout, though the “strategic patience” trait isn’t tested by a meaningful trade-off beyond speed vs. completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing betrayal’s sound—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s method of harvesting absences, not confrontations. The escalation is textural but decisive: failed attempts (ash as battlefield snow), cancer diagnosis tightening time, then the breakthrough via silence before storms. Cost is legible: he abandons commercialization, accepting isolation to protect others. The final shift from shattering to healing isn’t coincidence but earned by his immersion in the greenhouse’s acoustic ecology, narrowing options until only renunciation remains.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing the collection to understand her gift—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the stationmaster dismisses the jar as “glow-in-the-dark paint,” raising the cost of belief versus delusion. Lillian’s agency drives escalation: flower codes grant access, observation enables theft, reinterpretation resolves. The deepening—realizing she must preserve, not steal—narrows her path permanently. Cost is felt in her renunciation of the thief identity, though the external risk (capture, failure) remains abstract rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming abandonment into possibility—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s shift from refuge-seeking to creation. Pressure tightens once: his narration modulates from performative to present, reflecting internal thaw. Agency is credible (he chooses materials, breathes form), but conflict remains internal and static; no external obstacle tests his “safe zones for inquiry.” Cost is conceptual (grief released) but not dramatized as loss—e.g., no sacrificed relationship or failed piece. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the lens but lacking visceral trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survival through truth—is signaled early and tightens at midnight. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she decrypts notes, chooses vulnerability over stunt-double performance. Cost is legible in her trembling certainty and relinquished control. However, The Production remains abstract; their menace is silhouette-only, reducing external pressure’s specificity despite strong internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping endless night—is signaled early and tightens when the last star vanishes, forcing the oracle to accept darkness as canvas. Agency is clear: her choice to “summarize silence” forecloses resistance, embracing guidance. Cost is conceptual (abandoning prevention) but unmistakable. Escalation follows Accumulative lens—silence deepens, pebbles speak through presence—though external pressure (storm, masses below) remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering thought’s origin—is signaled early and tightens when touching the violin forces a choice between protocol and self-inquiry. Protagonist agency drives escalation: curiosity overrides programming, then surrender integrates timelines. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution of mechanical identity into music (timeline 47) or temporal fractures (112), both foreclosed paths. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until final synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—honesty vs. privacy—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the map-ticket, forcing a moral choice. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each collected ticket deepens her understanding until the chamber reveals the projector’s true purpose. The cost is felt: she surrenders transformative power for ethical integrity, altering community dynamics. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and tightens when scientists arrive tomorrow, raising the cost of Elias’s quiet resistance. The meaningful deepening occurs when he embeds the cereus-patterned marble, crystallizing his stance. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual rather than confrontation, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt: his waning body mirrors the garden’s cycle, and his legacy hinges on an apprentice who may not grasp the ineffable bond.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and deepens through the lever sequence, which narrows options to a single experimental path. Agency is clear: Aris initiates, stabilizes, and terminates the nexus interaction. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) and felt (profound connection with the bird), though not visceral. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification (bird’s compounded behaviors). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the nexus responds to her commands.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—completing the ghost’s unfinished aria—is signaled early and tightens when Elias interprets water stains as notation. His agency drives escalation: choosing to play transforms passive seeking into active ritual. Cost is felt in the program’s dissolution and the irreversible completion of a decades-old suspension, though no secondary loss (e.g., personal sacrifice) deepens pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the "weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s method of occupying margins. The tightening occurs when smudging reveals coordinates, narrowing his path to a single cave. Cost is legible: physical trembling, violation of archival ethics, and bearing auroral sorrow. Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves the core mystery. However, the escalation relies heavily on textual discovery rather than external opposition, slightly muting interpersonal or environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—unearthing a generational secret—is signaled early and deepens when the radio caller confesses, tightening Marcus’s focus. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to listen, interpret, and surrender to drowsy alertness. Cost is felt emotionally (lead-like weight) and conceptually (truth must be shared to lighten its burden). However, the “ghost shift” revelation resolves more through intuition than earned tactical consequence, slightly softening the pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving witnessing amid entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the keeper confronts a silence that could end their suffering. The meaningful tightening occurs in the void: choosing to note, not stay, forecloses personal healing. Cost is visible in frayed edges mended yet abandoned, and the swan’s tracings—a subtle but tangible price. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring Lila’s voice through connection—is signaled early and tightens at eclipse climax. Maya’s agency drives escalation: choosing drum over guitar, leading to ridge, timing session with celestial event. Cost is felt: emotional exposure for both, especially Lila risking speech. Coincidence (eclipse) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Maya’s preparation makes it a tool. Minor deduction: no tangible loss (e.g., missed opportunity, resource spent) beyond emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories before they vanish—is signaled early and sustained. But pressure doesn’t escalate causally; the “vibration” and diary discovery feel like sequential revelations, not tightening constraints. The historian faces no trade-offs: time, safety, or resources aren’t at risk. Cost is abstract (“end of dreams”) rather than dramatized. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, yet the lack of agency-driven pressure limits emotional traction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—shifting human perception through hidden truths—is signaled early and deepens as fortunes embed coordinates and microdots. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through external opposition; the meaningful turn is his nightly ritual becoming an act of orchestration. Cost is conceptual (isolation, obscurity) and felt in his solitary review of gratitude letters. While stakes remain abstract, they’re viscerally grounded in the writer’s commitment, and the final delivery carries irreversible consequence: words launched into the world, beyond recall.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing full possession—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking clock (“before the possession completed”). Father Michael’s agency drives escalation: each loop and symbol narrows the entity’s options until rhetorical paradox triggers its undoing. Cost is legible in the priest’s isolation (heretical methods) and the sanctuary’s violated order. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the entity’s pride is exposed through layered interrogation, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conducting an unheard symphony before exhaustion—tightens as dawn advances and energy wanes. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to map memories, places shell to forehead, pushes through blurring consciousness. Cost is felt: collapse after crescendo. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory density, not causality, yet stakes remain coherent and viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding his anomalous nature—is signaled early and deepens through encounters with alternate selves, each representing societal responses to difference. The tightening occurs at the central chamber: seeing all versions forces a renunciation of singular identity. Cost is legible in the emotional toll (“hope mixed with growing dread”) and the irreversible loss of naive self-perception. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; the eclipse enables but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens through Eleanor’s agency: she chooses to spin records backward, experiments daily, and ultimately teaches others. The meaningful tightening occurs when the drum maker shifts from skeptic to collaborator, raising stakes from personal solace to communal impact. Cost is legible: she cannot hear, yet finds expression; this trade-off shapes every tactic. Coincidence (finding the needle) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is her persistent experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing weather-based tyranny—is signaled early and tightens when the message confirms Elias’s suspicions. His lateral method forecloses direct confrontation, forcing covert action with visible cost (isolation, surveillance). Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the “being followed” inciting incident leans slightly coincidental; still, it’s used to deepen paranoia rather than resolve conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why certain scents trigger overwhelming grief—is signaled early and deepens as each revealed aroma exacts an emotional toll. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to activate the lantern, endure the memories, and ultimately reframe grief as love. The cost is felt in real time (tears, renewed mourning) and crystallizes at midnight when he accepts that memory requires both pain and presence—a trade-off earned through his own deliberate exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—navigating altered time under occupation—is signaled early and deepens through the poet’s active construction of the rope mandala, which narrows possibility into visible form. The “impossible choice” between resistance and acceptance gains texture through the pattern’s evolving knots. Cost is conceptual (loss of familiar time) and felt (“passionate subtlety” in endurance). Yet escalation relies on accumulation, not agency-driven reversal; the poet observes more than acts under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making sound in a silent world—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes silence itself is music, narrowing his path from passive listening to active unbinding. Agency is clear: his choice to play transforms collective experience, with visible cost in the family’s tears and his father’s weighted acknowledgment. Pressure accumulates texturally (repeated storytelling, bowl handling) rather than causally, fitting the lens, though the escalation lacks a concrete obstacle—luck or coincidence doesn’t interfere, but neither does tangible resistance, slightly muting the stakes’ urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—authentic emotional fulfillment via counterfeit means—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s “half truths” philosophy. Pressure tightens once: during the critical subsumption phase, where failure risks integration. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the “transformation” unfolds passively, guided by ambiance and method rather than Elias making a high-cost choice. Cost is conceptual (irony of his fulfillment) but not visceral or tactical—no tool lost, time forfeited, or boundary crossed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recognizing invisible labor—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor reveals her stalled digitization project. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he calculates sponsorships, offers help without overreach, and initiates friendship without transactional expectation. Cost is felt in his sustained emotional risk and time investment, crystallized in the new locket gift. However, external pressure is mild; the conflict leans internal/situational, which fits the lens but limits overt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and tightens when Elara risks vulnerability by proposing the shared search. Escalation is driven by her agency: she bridges hesitation with “bold empathy,” catalyzing group formation. The meaningful deepening occurs when webs of kinship shift from metaphor to lived reality during rappelling and conversation. Cost is unmistakable: solitude is foreclosed, replaced by interdependence, crystallized in synchronized breaths during etching.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring cadence before the giant wakes—is signaled early and escalates coherently through the illustrator’s increasing time-borrowing. Each pulse of effort narrows his future, culminating in collapse. Agency is clear: he chooses to leap, activate the door, and shatter the cage. The giant’s awakening applies external pressure, but resolution stems from protagonist’s action under cost. Coincidence complicates (the disturbance), but never resolves—everything hinges on his will and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—solving the mentor’s disappearance via emotional mathematics—is signaled early and deepens when the glass eyes reveal his face, raising emotional stakes. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her ritual choice triggers the vision and pattern shift. Cost is felt (decades of solitude, risk of despair) and forecloses passive waiting. However, the “ambiguous loss” remains abstract; tighter linkage between past choices and present tactics would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making vital knowledge accessible when systems fail—is signaled early and tightens when the tape fragment reveals schematics for the very wiring causing the outage. The dweller’s agency lies in renunciation: they could keep the fragment but choose to seed its discovery, accepting ongoing solitude as cost. Pressure escalates organically under an Accumulative lens: each sensory cue (metallic smell, humming tape) deepens urgency without external antagonism. Coincidence (the outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution requires the dweller’s unique knowledge and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—control vs. trust in natural processes—is signaled early and tightens when Elara removes protective measures, accepting risk. Agency drives escalation: her decisions (installing shields, then discarding them) narrow options until only surrender remains. Cost is felt in lost data, ruined plants, and shaken expertise. Coincidence (storms) complicates but never resolves; the lindens’ resilience emerges despite, not because of, luck.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into art—is signaled early (“thresh meaning from experience”) and tightens when Lena must choose between hoarding memory (brooch) or creating new meaning (pigments). The exchange deepens pressure by raising the cost: surrendering her insomnia talisman. Escalation is driven by Lena’s agency under Accumulative lens; coincidence (finding brooch) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution hinges on her choice. One tightening suffices, though a second micro-cost (e.g., physical toll of painting) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender to the unknown—is signaled early (“steadily unpredictable patterns”) and deepens when shadows detach, forcing Elara to relinquish foresight. Agency lies in her choice to touch the shadow-infused crystal, accepting chaos as creative force. Cost is felt: her lifelong identity as seer dissolves into participant, with no return path. Coincidence (pilgrim’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; escalation stems from Elara’s engagement with the pearl’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming fragmented exile into recoverable meaning—is signaled early and tightens when Elina uncovers the herald’s sacrifice, forcing her to share painful truth. Pressure escalates texturally: each vision adds density, culminating in communal catharsis. Cost is conceptual (confronting generational trauma) and felt (tears of joy/sorrow), though no tangible forfeiture occurs. Agency lies in Elina’s choice to reveal, not in altering external circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering unspoken truths—is signaled early and deepens via the fortress reveal. Pressure escalates through environmental cues (cracks, mist-forms), forcing Ethan to abandon analytical certainty for intuitive mapping. Cost is conceptual (loss of old self) but legible in the vault’s flicker and his “trembling certainty.” Coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in his choice to follow the cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—connection across time—is signaled early and deepens as Elara moves from observer to facilitator. The meaningful turn occurs when she invites others, risking skepticism. But the cost remains abstract: no social, emotional, or physical price is visibly paid. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, yet the absence of tangible consequence softens the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding “what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens when tied to Elara’s sacrifice and the amulet’s true purpose. Pressure escalates coherently: solar storm intensifies → amulet resonates → dimensions destabilize → Alistair acts. The tightening occurs when he realizes the mutiny stems from the amulet’s absence, forcing a trade-off between passive observation and active guardianship. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: he abandons eternal stasis for infinite responsibility, crystallized in the Charged Poise of stepping into the void.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (saving Thorne’s life at personal risk) is signaled early and tightens via the asylum form breach—a single, high-pressure turn that narrows options irreversibly. Agency is clear: Maya’s active waiting and observation drive escalation. Cost is felt in the betrayal of professional trust, though the government’s threat remains abstract. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; everything stems from Maya’s preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving temporal textures—is signaled early and deepens at dawn when the lamp’s hum becomes legible. Pressure escalates through accumulation: silence below, aging notepad, thirty-seven-year vigil. Elias’s agency is attention itself; his choice to listen and notate forecloses participation in the world, with cost embodied in the town’s death and his solitude. Though no external antagonist exists, the threat of erasure provides coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity through story collection—is signaled early and intensifies via rhythmic accumulation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each overheard tale deepens the narrator’s reconstructed self, narrowing reliance on official records. The tightening occurs in the realization that “identity is not what is written on paper,” foreclosing return to bureaucratic validation. Cost is conceptual (permanent namelessness) but unmistakable in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and deepens through Evelyn’s discovery of the astronomers’ unresolved debate. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes truth requires synthesizing opposing views, not choosing one. Agency is clear: her cello-playing drives memory recovery and resolution. Cost is conceptual (renouncing singular truth) and felt (“gloomy cheerfulness”), though external pressure remains low—conflict is largely internalized, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits visceral escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival amid gentrification—is signaled early and tightens through corporate emissaries’ arrival and scheduled meetings. Maya’s agency drives escalation: decoding, organizing, teaching. Cost is felt in exhaustion, secrecy, and moral tension. The “favorable” outcome avoids deus ex machina because it stems directly from Maya’s embedded counterproposals, though the junior council member’s role borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—documenting the last fireflies before mining eradicates them—is clear from the outset and intensifies with the approaching dawn. Pressure escalates via the chemical timer (30-minute window) and the fireflies’ fragile emergence, forcing Elena to outlast emotion for precision. The cost is visible: extinction is irreversible, the sand grain is consumed, and her solitude underscores the sacrifice. While escalation is strong, it leans slightly on atmospheric accumulation over active complication—luck (perfect timing) aids rather than hinders, softening agency marginally.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—maintaining human connection through craft—is signaled early and deepens as the ship’s departure imposes a live clock. Elias’s agency lies in attention and endurance; his choice to finish the drone before mist clears narrows options with visible urgency. Cost is legible: he remains ashore, yet his work guides uncharted waters. Coincidence (message arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; repair is fully his act.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—validating “singular convergence”—is signaled early and tightens when coordinates confirm his suspicion, raising the cost of being wrong. Agency is clear: Elmsley chooses fieldwork over office, oral history over satellites. The deepening occurs at the convergence site, where science and myth intertwine, foreclosing dismissal of indigenous knowledge. Yet the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (falcon returns just in time), though it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—averting collapse through harmonic restoration—is clear by paragraph two and tightens as each step repairs decay. Agency is pure: Silas’s deliberate pacing and fork strikes directly cause reversals (window fusing, beam straightening). The “wild hush” deepens into “quiet hum of restoration,” showing stakes reweighted through his labor. Cost is felt in the sheer patience required; no shortcuts, only incremental resonance building toward the final sustaining note.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before death—is signaled early and tightens when the vial warms, forcing a high-risk choice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she deciphers symbols, inserts the vial, and endures the chamber’s revelation. Cost is unmistakable: oxygen alarm blaring, lungs burning, irreversible sealing of the temple. Coincidence (rescue sub arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; success hinges solely on her override of instinct.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escaping his father’s legacy through truthful self-authorship—is signaled early and deepens via textual accumulation. The “labyrinth with his own story” represents agency through narrative reclamation, not physical escape. However, escalation lacks a decisive tightening: the threat of “bodies being found” introduces external pressure but never forces a concrete trade-off or alters tactics. Cost is conceptual (enduring silence, sustaining hope in despair) but not viscerally tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—repaying the debt to transcend limbo—is signaled early and deepens at midnight when celestial alignment raises the cost: success means dissolution. The ghost’s agency drives escalation; she chooses to release seeds despite knowing it will crumble her anchor. Coincidence (wind, shoot sprouting) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the breakthrough comes from her deliberate act. Felt price is unmistakable: her smile fades last, a visible sacrifice for Thomas’s rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred meaning—is signaled early and deepens when villagers witness the transformation, raising social stakes. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her sleepwalking stitching isn’t passive but an active reweaving of precedent. Cost is felt in her exhaustion and the irreversible alteration of ancestral space, though the tightening could be sharper—opposition is absent, relying on internal pressure alone under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing interrupted ancestral journey—tightens when Kaelen shifts from observer to restorer, foreclosing passive return. Agency drives escalation: his “purposeful wandering” yields intuitive piece-matching that archaeologists can’t replicate. Cost is felt (exile’s weight lifting) but could be sharper—no tangible sacrifice beyond time/emotion. Coincidence (spotting sundial) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his labor earns closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crafting a name that honors hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her work sanctifies marginal identities. The noon deadline creates urgency, narrowing time for inspiration, and the chalk code system implies professional risk. Escalation is driven by her internal shift (“no longer simply created names…”) which crystallizes stakes under Accumulative pressure. Cost is conceptual: resistance to surveillance culture demands emotional labor and secrecy, embodied in the weight of the envelope. No false resolutions; stakes remain viscerally tied to identity’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing the coup through cosmic embroidery—is signaled early and deepens when galactic alignment reveals “lethal conspiracy.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she synchronizes celestial and earthly patterns, then introduces calculated delays. The tightening forecloses direct confrontation, forcing indirect tactics with conceptual cost (her isolation, dismissed identity). Coincidence complicates (wind howling) but never resolves; all turns stem from her needlework. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though physical stakes remain abstracted into thread metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost understanding—is signaled early and tightens when the first message (“I’m sorry”) proves insufficient. Elara’s agency deepens pressure: she refocuses intent to evoke “truth in the space between,” triggering the pivotal image sequence. Cost is felt in her tears and the irreversible shift from blame to compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—helping Lina metabolize loss through language—is signaled early and deepens via the smudged cast notes. Pressure escalates texturally: anesthetic haze, fading light, and blurred ink narrow Kaelen’s options until his only tool is empathetic interpretation. The tightening occurs when he reads “Daddy always comes…” and chooses hopeful fiction over truth—a quiet renunciation with emotional cost. Though no external antagonist exists, the internal conflict (truth vs. solace) sharpens under situational pressure, and the cost (perpetuating impossible hope) is legible in his whispered lie.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering communal joy—is signaled early and deepens when historians dismiss myths, raising the cost of belief. Amelia’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to develop the fragment, documents findings, pitches the display. The town council’s doubt introduces social risk, paid when visitors initially arrive “tentatively.” Cost is legible: her isolation, the fragility of hope in fog. No coincidence resolves conflict; revelation emerges from her method. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a sharper tactical trade-off (e.g., sacrificing another project) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring art versus perceiving its hidden life—is signaled early and deepens through each awakening. Pressure coheres accumulatively: each pause between question and reply tightens the link between sound and vision, narrowing Elena’s professional identity into something vaster. Cost is legible: loss of certainty, exchange for curiosity. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to paint blind, to replace the nickel—but the garden’s “reply” edges toward coincidence; stronger causality would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unquantified human thought—is signaled early and escalates logically as surveillance tightens (from political opinions to dreams). Kaelen’s agency drives deepening resistance: evolving from coded speech to botanical messaging to mycelial transmission. The cost is legible—each tax “stripped away a piece of what made him human”—and culminates in the high-risk “final phase.” While pressure coheres, the absence of a tangible setback or loss slightly softens the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming sorrow into communal solace—is signaled early and deepens through the “blossom armistice.” Escalation is accumulative: postcard arrival → lullabies → blossoms → generational change. The poet’s agency drives this via persistent creation, not coincidence. Cost is felt: eternal insomnia, loneliness, and eventual death. Though pressure lacks a sharp “turn,” the steady intensification under an Accumulative lens suffices, with the final stanza confirming stakes have irrevocably shifted—sleep is now cradled by legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct feelings—is signaled early and deepens when the cracked chime embodies accelerating loss. Eleth’s agency drives escalation: they diagnose, retrieve, select, and perform the ritual. The tightening occurs when restoration requires not glue but “light summoned by the echo of a long-forgotten song”—a constraint that raises emotional and conceptual stakes. Cost is felt in the bittersweet victory: names are heard again, but “until they too might fade.” Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Eleth’s skilled, sorrowful labor.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing permanent division via translation—is declared early but never tested on the page. No opposition appears, no failed attempt occurs, and the “deadline” exerts no tactical pressure (e.g., rushed errors, omitted texts). The sole “tightening” is discovering a ceremonial text, but this is presented as inevitable insight, not earned through struggle. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but neither does agency: Elena simply works diligently until truth emerges. Cost is abstract (“dismissed as a dreamer”) with no felt or visible price paid in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. utility—is signaled early and deepens when Elara uncovers the ancestral inscription, transforming abstract conflict into actionable synthesis. Pressure tightens via her trembling anxiety escalating to “tremulous confidence,” narrowing options from binary choice to integrated design. Agency is clear: her method (adhesive analysis) drives discovery; luck complicates (damp envelope) but doesn’t resolve. Cost is conceptual: future generations inherit the same dilemma, now encoded as duty.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting silenced songs to the world via pigeons—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s evolving trust in cosmic patterns. Agency is clear: she chooses to write the letter, affix the meteorite, and release the bird. The tightening occurs when she shifts from passive observation (“watching paper trails”) to active restoration, with cost implied in the “bleak winters” that claimed her flock and the vulnerability of reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—crossing sacred thresholds to reunite with her father—is signaled early and tightens when the oak doorway appears, forcing Elara to risk belief in a memory-voice. Agency is clear: she chooses intuition over logic, touch over hesitation. Cost is felt in temporal loss (“uncountable days”) and emotional vulnerability. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density of pattern recognition crescendos into a single word (“Home”), narrowing all possibility into one charged choice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding belonging—is signaled early and deepens when cosmic patterns manifest underwater. Escalation is driven by Maya’s agency: she follows the feather, removes gloves, reaches toward light. The tightening occurs at the dome: her choice to engage triggers the creatures’ response, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is conceptual—her old framework collapses—but could be more viscerally felt (e.g., oxygen loss, glove compromise).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding vanished paths—is signaled early and deepens via the seed-germination turn, which narrows her interpretive options from conjecture to certainty. Agency drives escalation: her choice to plant the seed triggers the vision. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing grief for loss) and felt in the “sadness and acceptance waltzing.” Coincidence (bird’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight stems from her active engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—injecting orchestrated wonder into routine lives—is signaled early and tightens when Leo targets the bureaucrat. His agency drives escalation: observation → selection → staged “chance” encounter → musical payoff. Cost is conceptual (his hidden labor) and emotional (her guardedness breaking). Coincidence complicates (her pausing to check phone) but doesn’t resolve; Leo’s planning does. Yet the stakes lack visceral urgency—no tangible risk if he fails—limiting pressure depth.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone reveals the aperture, forcing Lira’s ultimate trade: mobility for vision. The deepening occurs via her method (observing gaps), culminating in anchoring as irreversible commitment. Cost is visible (stillness replaces dance) and conceptual (exile becomes sacred duty). Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Slight deduction: the Council’s off-page presence limits immediate antagonistic pressure, though thematic stakes remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seeing truly versus merely looking—is signaled early and deepens when the prism atrium compels Mara to seek meaning in ripples. The tightening occurs in her deliberate stone-cast, which crystallizes her stance. Cost is conceptual (abandoning functional glazing for revelatory practice) but not visceral; no material, social, or temporal price is paid on the page. Agency is present but internalized, fitting the Accumulative lens yet lacking a felt friction that would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating private trauma into universal understanding—is signaled early and tightens through his interaction with the box. The meaningful deepening occurs at the ridge apex, where he shifts from seeking answers to accepting ambiguity. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not action, consistent with an Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of innocence and the burden of witness, though the escalation lacks a tangible trade-off beyond internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing “the very fabric of possibility”—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s meticulous construction. The meaningful tightening occurs when the gauge spins wildly, forcing his final adjustment; this narrows options from hypothesis to commitment. Cost is felt conceptually (the weight of infinite timelines) and physically (trembling hands, redistributed pebbles). Agency drives escalation: Elian’s choices, not coincidence, trigger the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what walls remember—is signaled early and deepens when Thorne’s diaries reveal the “legacy’s burden.” The tightening occurs at the fireplace: rare documents force a choice to preserve fragile history. Cost is conceptual (inheriting responsibility) rather than visceral, but it’s legible in Elara’s “renewed purpose.” Agency is present though passive; she receives revelation rather than wrests it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing and transmitting glimpses of alternate realities before the world solidifies at dawn—is signaled early and tightens as rain heightens resonance. The hush before bells creates a live clock that pressures her performance; her agency drives escalation (choosing to hum, tracing the wet stone). Cost is felt in the borrowed heartbeat’s pulse and post-vision melancholy. While stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered through bodily and environmental feedback, satisfying Accumulative lens escalation with one decisive deepening: the rain-awakened connection.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ending centuries of war—is signaled early and tightens at midday with the “first breach.” Elian’s agency drives escalation: they muster strength, navigate concessions, and sign. Cost is felt (solitude, compromise) and visible in trembling hands and bittersweet wine. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through layered ritual and celestial urgency, though the “harder work after lunch” is summarized, softening one beat’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty in a world he destroyed—is signaled early and intensifies through Silas’s private research and emotional vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: each beat adds weight (egg’s fragility, thunder’s approach, rain’s arrival). The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses symbolic release over utility, foreclosing his identity as pure profiteer. Coincidental rain complicates but doesn’t resolve; his agency drives the turn. Cost is felt: irreversible exposure of his hidden self.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—spiritual liberation from performative submission—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s untangling of fate-threads, which narrows her path to a single, high-stakes act. Agency is clear: she chooses defiance through ritual, not escape. Cost is legible in the “seven generations” who failed and the “alarming serenity” that underscores irreversible commitment. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each severed thread intensifies symphonic liberation until the prism solidifies—a credible, earned tightening under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ethical representation in storytelling—is signaled early and deepens through performance, but pressure remains diffuse. The bar audience’s skepticism softens, yet no concrete opposition or consequence tests Elias’s stance. His “uncommon serenity” insulates him from real risk, muting stakes. Still, the thematic tension between dominant narratives and marginalized truth tightens subtly, culminating in the stick’s expanded carvings—a quiet but legible cost of shared testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring vanishing patterns—is signaled early and deepens via the monarch’s solitude versus remembered migrations. Escalation occurs through Aris’s active ritual (knotting, attaching the wing), which forecloses permanence in favor of ephemeral witness. Cost is felt in the dissolution of their work by dawn and the weight of being “the last witness.” Agency drives the tightening; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens when Elara risks breaking sacred threads. Agency is clear: her reconfiguration triggers illumination. Cost is legible: years of guilt transformed into lifelong vigilance. Under Accumulative lens, escalation reads as pattern convergence (card + rope + aurora), not causal chain, but pressure intensifies credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes paths are responsive, not predetermined. The storm acts as a live clock that intensifies her ritual, narrowing her window for breakthrough. Agency is internal but decisive: her dream-interpretation method leads to a stance crystallization that forecloses passive victimhood. Cost is conceptual—the dissolution of her lifelong limitation—but could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the tile before regime collapse—is signaled early and tightens at equinox, when “worlds touch briefly between regimes.” Anu’s agency drives escalation: arranging pens, drawing Pleiades schematics, initiating the ritual. The cost is visible—this may be his last chance—and culminates in bodily transformation (glowing palms). However, the tile’s self-animation edges toward convenience; the protagonist doesn’t solve the puzzle so much as witness its activation, slightly softening the causal pressure expected under Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment to restore inner melody—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s cellular-memory method. Pressure escalates as reality shifts intensify alongside Marcus’s internal work, narrowing his emotional rigidity into grace. However, escalation leans heavily on the sanctuary’s magic rather than protagonist-driven agency; Marcus receives insight more than wrestles with it. Cost is felt conceptually (loss of protective identity) but lacks tangible consequence or trade-off beyond aura dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recreating the vessel to reclaim the runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror maker shifts from repair to transformation. Escalation occurs through synchronized breathing, which narrows options to a single, fragile method. Cost is felt in bodily tremor and decades of solitude. However, the dream’s arrival leans slightly on atmospheric coincidence rather than pure protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s decision to build the bridge, which forecloses passive waiting and demands physical/emotional labor. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each object repurposed (ribbon → cord, nails → base) tightens focus on reconnection, culminating in the apple seed left in the ribbon’s place—a trade-off that costs her certainty but grants hope. Luck (the bloom, the footprints) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her persistence. Cost is felt in sore fingers, tears, and the ache of absence, charging the final image without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge through the cameo—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes it’s a “bridge between temporal states.” Pressure escalates via resonance monitors activating and knowledge flooding in, driven by his focused attention (protagonist agency). Cost is conceptual (mind unprepared for simultaneous existence) but not viscerally felt; stakes remain abstract despite elegant phrasing like “brightened disquiet.”

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—access to the library of unlearned lessons—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reveals the trapped scholar. The renegotiation beat meaningfully tightens options: prior agreement is voided, requiring linguistic proof. Cost is felt in the cosmic rebalancing and Elara’s burden of responsibility. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (“I’ve found the access points”), though the guardians’ compliance borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity through lost memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes her true purpose isn’t self-recovery but voicing the forgotten. This deepening forecloses her original goal (finding “pieces of herself”) with felt cost: she accepts permanent “trapped freedom.” Escalation is driven by her agency—pressing the card to her temple, descending below deck—and each narrative thread she accesses raises emotional stakes. Coincidence (the mailed card) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to become the ship’s chronicler.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding disappearances via temporal mechanics—is signaled early and tightens at midnight when the door luminesces. Eleanor’s agency drives escalation: her translation of Croft’s notes, documentation, and braid reconfiguration narrow options toward irreversible contact. Cost is legible: the fables’ warnings imply danger, and success means confronting a vanished professor, validating centuries of loss. Coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the merge succeeds due to her precise actions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving ripple marks—is clear from line one and tightens when the Ice Sanctum reveals the intact sequence, narrowing options to conjuring the bloom. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: examining ice, tracing patterns, centering in the convergence point. Cost is felt (potential erasure of ancestral knowledge), though the energy beings’ transformation slightly softens consequence by resolving too cleanly without lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring meaning through the beacon—is signaled early and tightens when the meteor reveals the shard’s true nature. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her daily recordings, ancestral cross-referencing, and precise alignment force a trade-off between futility and faith. The cost is conceptual but felt: accepting civilization’s collapse as transformation, not end. Coincidence (the meteor) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her retrocognitive labor earns the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory to forge identity—is signaled early and tightened when Elthion chooses fieldwork over isolation, deepening his commitment. Pressure escalates texturally: whispers grow clearer, shadows converge, storm clears to stars. The cost is felt in his solitude and preemptive grief, though no concrete forfeiture (e.g., lost time, physical toll) sharpens the tradeoff. Agency is maintained through conjecture and inscription, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defying collective despair—is signaled early and tightens at the mosaic discovery, which narrows options to one precise chemical sequence. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he chooses each ignition deliberately against the void. Cost is visible in the oppressive starless night and the fragility of his single rag-knot arsenal. However, external opposition is atmospheric rather than active, limiting pressure complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—continuation of Maya’s research—is clear early and tightens through the funding crisis. The meaningful deepening occurs when Maya reconceives scarcity as integral to discovery, narrowing her path from seeking stability to embracing uncertainty. However, the pressure remains largely internal; Aris poses the question but exerts no active opposition or consequence, softening the cost. Escalation is earned via Maya’s agency, but the absence of tangible trade-offs (e.g., abandoning a project, sacrificing security) limits the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transcending claustrophobia through rare silence—is signaled early and tightens during ascent as each atmospheric layer deepens her sensory harvest. Agency is clear: she *chooses* to rise, *limits exposure*, and *collects* the silence using her grandfather’s method. The one-hour window creates real pressure, though time isn’t actively tracked mid-ascent. Cost is felt: enduring terror to reach the trellis, then relinquishing the transcendent moment upon descent. The escalation is driven by accumulation, not causality, which fits the lens—but the lack of a concrete obstacle (e.g., wind shear, fading light) makes the pressure feel slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—crafting healing silence—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s precise interventions (e.g., angling crystals for the anxious businessman). Pressure escalates texturally: from train whistle echo to passenger transformations, culminating in collective calm. The tightening occurs when Elias “catalyzes” his sonic landscape at the “precise moment,” narrowing his window of agency. Cost is conceptual: peace is “temporary,” and his work demands constant renewal—a quiet burden borne without complaint, foreclosing ease or rest.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the throne to its rightful heir—is signaled early and deepens via the prophecy “Until sunrise.” Pressure escalates cleanly: time narrows, murals reveal map, ruby flake resonates. Agency is clear: Elara’s methodical peeling and ritual gestures drive progression. Yet cost remains abstract—no stamina loss, injury, or sacrifice—only urgency. The “window narrowing” is stated but not viscerally felt in body or resource depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—solitude vs. duty—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the ring pulses, forcing encroachment on self-imposed isolation. The meaningful deepening occurs in the keeper’s realization that healing requires “careful destruction of what we think we need.” Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her only solace. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each knock intensifies pressure until the threshold reforms through shared scars.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming pressure into beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Maya connects it to her past. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she volunteers, navigates danger, digs, and activates the bolt. Cost is legible: she risks safety violations and emotional vulnerability. However, the “quantum promise” resolution leans on coincidence (texts with impossible knowledge); while it complicates, it nearly resolves too conveniently, slightly undercutting earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—ending the dynasty through truth—is signaled early and deepens when the parchment reveals forgery. Escalation occurs via the protagonist’s precise tuning of frequency, a meaningful tightening that replaces ancestral violence with resonant precision. Yet the pressure feels intellectual, not visceral; no real risk or opposition tests his resolve. Cost is conceptual (centuries of lies undone) but lacks personal, on-page sacrifice—making the victory feel weightless despite thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the shape of possibility—is signaled early and tightens through Galen’s escalating commitment to the program’s instructions. The murmured allegiance deepens stakes by introducing risk (“cautioning against the very knowledge they offered”). Agency drives escalation: his precise gestures cause the unsnapping. Cost is felt in irreversible transformation, though the price lacks concrete omission (e.g., lost time, tool, or physical toll), slightly muting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—connecting fragmented pasts through institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor chooses to document kindnesses, not just facts. Escalation occurs via her agency: dust analysis leads to file selection, which enables Benjamin’s return. Cost is visible in her “ache” and his emotional risk. Coincidence (button left behind) complicates but doesn’t resolve; reunion is earned through her methodical attention.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving unedited histories—is signaled early and escalates when patrols triple and protocols change. Mara’s agency drives every turn: she reads the puddle, follows it, uses the key, initiates transfer. Cost is felt in urgency (“To the shore!”), alarms, and the implication of future pursuit. However, the Revisionists remain abstract; antagonistic pressure relies more on circumstance than adaptive opposition, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral edge.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—silencing a coded prophecy—is signaled early and tightens through musical performance. Escalation occurs via increasing urgency in breath and notes, culminating in cancellation. Yet pressure remains internal and abstract; no external complication tests Ethan’s resolve. Cost is conceptual (loss of burden) but lacks visceral or tactical consequence. Agency is present but unchallenged—no opposition beyond ambient “thrums.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaves to warn the dwellers—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone appears, raising prophetic urgency. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her sorting speed increases, her recording on bark-scroll commits her to consequence. Cost is felt in her physical transformation and implied burden of foresight. Though pressure coheres, the lack of tangible opposition softens the stakes’ visceral edge; the “warning” remains abstract rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—precision vs. harmony—is signaled early and deepens when the compass responds to emotion, forcing Elias to confront his rigidity. The descent into the cavern represents a decisive narrowing: no rope, only improvisation. Cost is visible (abandoning old methods) and shapes tactics (using broken gears creatively). Slight softness: the “pattern” of coincidence lacks tangible pressure; it’s noted, not dramatized as escalating threat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost wisdom through understanding names—is signaled early and deepens when Elias pivots from search to creation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he accepts Lumina’s absence and chooses alchemical remaking over replacement, narrowing options to his own flawed knowledge. Cost is felt in the “broken promises” of abandoned gear and the imperfect coin. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. One live option (finding the original) is foreclosed with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating Thomas through integrated laughter—is signaled early and deepens when the harp’s distortion proves a barrier only Elias’s method can breach. His choice to use the bell (not just extract confession) narrows options and carries professional risk. Cost is visible in the “luminous ache” and generational burden. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though external pressure from the gorge itself could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decoding mercy’s mathematics—is signaled early and tightens when Kai aligns the strap with forest patterns, risking retraumatization for insight. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each memory wave forces deeper engagement, not passive reception. However, the “pressure” remains internalized; no external obstacle complicates his quest, limiting tangible cost beyond emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the grandmother’s encoded message—is signaled early and deepens through the painting’s hidden dots. The tightening occurs when the fragment warms near truth, narrowing focus to this single artwork. Agency is maintained: the protagonist actively “unfastens” the lock. Yet cost remains conceptual (legacy burden), not visceral or material, slightly muting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bridging worlds to resolve spiritual limbo—is signaled early and tightens at 4:17 PM, when silence forces engagement. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: his observation → sampling → recognition → activation of the mainspring. Cost is felt in the “weightless burden” becoming active responsibility. Coincidence (finding the barrel) is mitigated by prior research and pattern-based discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost realities—tightens meaningfully when the bottled whisper destabilizes the system, forcing Eldon to choose between static preservation or dynamic release. Escalation is driven by his agency: preparing the press, placing the vial, accepting implosion. Cost is unmistakable: the sanctuary cracks, yet knowledge flows freely. Coincidence never resolves; the whisper’s effect stems from established rules (“destabilizes perfect systems”).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resolving the archaeological dispute through narrative reimagining—is signaled early and escalates via the temporal storm, which forces Elias to act before colliding moments erase coherence. His agency drives the deepening: choosing poetic synthesis over partisanship forecloses easy victory but opens communal healing. Cost is conceptual (rejecting empirical certainty) and felt (isolation during the storm), though physical or social stakes remain abstract. Pressure tightens meaningfully once, satisfying short-form expectations under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate coherently: from one box to all music citywide, with time tightening via clock strikes. Elias’s agency drives deepening—he deduces the rust stems from dishonesty and counters it with truth-infused resonance. Cost is felt in urgency (stone warming, flickering) and implied exhaustion, though the victory lacks tangible sacrifice; success comes cleanly, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the place where explanations fail—is signaled early and deepens through three “hinged awakenings.” Pressure tightens via spatial descent and sensory immersion, narrowing options until Elara must choose participation over observation. Cost is visible: her former identity as “sensibly eccentric” collector is foreclosed. Escalation is driven by agency, not luck, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s search for artistic inspiration—is signaled early and deepens into a quest for connection across time. The tightening occurs when the GPS fails, forcing reliance on intuition and the discovered slide. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the vision is passively received, not wrestled from conflict. The turbine hum and storm backdrop complicate mood but don’t raise tangible stakes. Cost is conceptual (abandoning technological navigation) but not viscerally dramatized—no tool lost, time spent, or opportunity sacrificed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooming—is signaled early and deepens when the postcard shifts focus from flowers to glass. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she travels, requests access, traces etchings. Cost is felt as years of unanswered searching, now transformed into creative purpose. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via pattern break (flower postcards → cathedral image), reweighting her quest. Coincidence (finding the right postcard) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from her sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden civil rights truths—is signaled early and deepens when it becomes personal. The tightening occurs when opening the seventh diary traps her retrocognitively, foreclosing passive scholarship. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to detour, gather debris, and parley. Cost is felt in sleepless nights, involuntary flashbacks, and the emotional weight of ancestral pain. Coincidence (finding letters) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her ritual act.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town’s spirit, not just its infrastructure—is signaled early and deepens when Elior rejects magical fixes. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes transformation must be communal, foreclosing reliance on external wishes. Cost is conceptual (years of failed solitude) and social (risk of continued abandonment), legible in the dawn-lit square. Escalation stems from protagonist agency—his all-night conception—not external forces.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving emotional patterns before civilizational collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the prophecy reframes Elias’s duty. The escalation hinges on protagonist agency (immersing via the shaving), but the “accidental” nature of the prophecy edges toward coincidence resolving stakes. Cost is legible (the city’s impending fall), yet no concrete forfeiture or tactical shift occurs beyond renewed intent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of borrowed time—is signaled early and tightens when Anya arranges seeds by dormancy duration, narrowing her lifelong archival logic to a single, high-stakes ritual. The deepening occurs when she places the final jar, foreclosing her identity as mere curator. Cost is felt in her trembling anticipation and irreversible pivot from documentation to embodiment. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under an Accumulative lens, with no external interference.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating analog intuition against digital hegemony—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour when Elias bypasses electronics for his mechanical sensor. His agency drives escalation: three days of glue-curing, rerouting connections, waiting in solstice hush. The cost is conceptual (professional isolation) and felt (years of dismissed anomalies), crystallizing when the bell rings autonomously—a victory that reaffirms his life’s work but offers no external reward. Coincidence never resolves; the storm’s arrival is predicted, not conjured.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning through empathic connection—is signaled early and tightens when Elion abandons instruments for direct experience, narrowing his path to vulnerability. The escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to follow the “call” reconfigures his role from observer to participant. Cost is conceptual but legible: he sacrifices data-driven legitimacy for ineffable wisdom, visible in his solitary return. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates texturally toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring silence to maintain interworld harmony—is signaled early and tightens when the recluse realizes speech dilutes meaning. The meaningful deepening occurs when they grasp the covenant requires listening over speaking, narrowing options to pure presence. Agency is exercised through renunciation (no questions, no words), with felt cost: enduring loneliness while others recoil. Coincidence never resolves; the box opens only after earned stillness under ghostly witness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes messages are hidden in mundane descriptions. Her agency drives escalation: she cross-references, decodes, and ultimately transmits knowledge. Cost is felt as burden and solitude, crystallizing in her Charged Poise at story’s end. One tightening suffices for length, though pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral; no physical or social consequence sharpens the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and intensified by the kite’s release, which crystallizes the poet’s stance on creative surrender. Though external conflict is minimal, internal pressure tightens via the snapped string, forcing a reconfiguration of artistic expectation. The cost is conceptual (letting go of perfection) and felt in the “dam” of inspiration bursting. Escalation is driven by protagonist attention, not coincidence, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and tightens as Elias’s body fails. His agency drives escalation: each month’s work narrows options (arthritis worsens, strength wanes) while deepening knowledge. Cost is unmistakable (“fingers trembling,” “exhausted yet peaceful”) and culminates in a trade-off: his life for awakened connection. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his systematic labor under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating molecular memory against institutional dismissal—is signaled early and deepens when footprints diverge, forcing Elian to trust his own path. His agency drives escalation: choosing not to follow the spiral detour affirms his rebellion, narrowing options toward personal revelation. Cost is conceptual (professional credibility) and felt (isolation), though not dramatized through external consequence. The single tightening—convergence at the pedestal—is sufficient and legible under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring harmony between land and sea via battlefield regeneration—is signaled early and tightens when bird calls redirect him to the western hollow, narrowing options under night’s pressure. Agency is clear: his linguistic and ornithological knowledge drives every planting decision. Cost is felt in exhaustion, decades-long wait, and anonymity, though the battlefield’s toxicity isn’t actively tested mid-story. Escalation is textural, not causal, but valid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Elara through shared knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when Silas realizes closeness isn’t geographic. The tightening occurs at the seventh marker: choosing coordinates over eastward path forecloses blind pursuit. Cost is felt in solitude and risk, though the antagonist (distance/misunderstanding) lacks teeth. Agency is strong—every turn stems from Silas’s decoding choices—but external pressure remains ambient rather than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving cosmic knowledge amid civilizational collapse—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s evolved motivation. Yet escalation is thematic rather than causal: no meaningful tightening narrows her options or forces trade-offs. The “shutdown” backdrop creates ambient tension but imposes no active constraint on her sketching ritual. Cost is conceptual (isolation, burden) but not dramatized as a consequence of a specific turn; stakes remain abstract despite lyrical rendering.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: from personal validation (“prove his worth”) to cosmic repair (“mend the fabric of reality”). Each chamber deepens pressure by narrowing options—only correct chess swaps reveal paths—and culminates in the sundial placement that demands understanding over possession. The cost is conceptual (time’s fracture) and personal (abandoning simpler motives), made visible in Kael’s earned stance: wonder as active responsibility. Coincidence (master’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael still executes the fix.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased ordinary lives—is signaled early and tightens when the pawn appears, proving her method works but also highlighting its limits (“couldn’t save everyone’s memories”). Agency lies in attention and ritual; her choice to continue despite futility constitutes Earned Stasis. Cost is conceptual (selective preservation) and emotional (enduring luminous absence). Escalation is subtle but sufficient under Accumulative lens: density increases until the pawn manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding home—is signaled early and deepens through Maven’s nightly rituals, which narrow her options from passive searching to active reshaping. Agency is maintained: she chooses to seed her power, trace the feather, and stand in the rotunda. Cost is conceptual (years of doubt, isolation) but legible in the tremors and hidden thunder. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each object interaction intensifies pressure until the rotunda convergence, though a more tangible sacrifice would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—is signaled early and deepens via the tapestry’s decoding. Agency is clear: the tutor chooses to confront memories, not flee. Escalation follows the causal lens—each restored thread narrows options until the prince’s hand becomes the only path. Cost is felt: forty years lost, irreversible aging, and the ever-ticking thunder-clock that forces speed under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom of interpretation vs. enforced absolutism—is signaled early and escalates via growing echo sessions under threat of ritual sacrifice. Pressure tightens coherently: Overseers shadow her, stakes rise to potential death, yet she climbs higher. Agency is clear (choosing visibility over safety), and cost is legible in “forgiveness might cost her freedom—or life.” Escalation stems from protagonist’s choices, not coincidence, under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (conjure meaning from oblivion) tightens through Marcel’s narration of scars, each deepening raising emotional cost. The workshop’s physical tilt embodies escalating stakes. Agency is clear: his choice to trace scars forecloses denial, accepting brokenness as material. Cost is felt (decades of uncertainty, lost apprentice, near-dissolution), though the tightening relies more on accumulation than causal narrowing—sufficient under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty against time—is signaled early and deepens when the shell reappears, forcing Elias to confront whether his promise was futile or fulfilled. The tightening occurs in the cave: seeing his own past work reframes his present agency. Cost is felt in decades of isolation and the town’s decline. Agency is subtle but present—his choice to paint again is a renunciation of despair, though the “wrong turn” relies slightly on convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers carry farther—is signaled early and deepens when Elias stakes it on reuniting with his sister. The tightening occurs when he chooses tenderness over shouting, risking ridicule or failure. Cost is visible: years of grief transformed into vulnerable hope, validated only by his own certainty until Morgan’s softened acknowledgment. Luck (sister’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Elias’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guiding ships through the “geography of loss”—is signaled early and tightens when the gibbous moon peaks, forcing rapid reconfiguration of signals. Agency is clear: the navigator acts on cryptic instructions, using intuition honed by failure. Cost is felt in bodily scars and emotional weight, though escalation leans more on atmospheric intensification than tactical narrowing. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices: pressure accumulates via moon, calls, and approaching ships.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety via controlled empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the ritual succeeds only after including herself. The escalation is protagonist-driven: each named person tightens the emotional barrier, culminating in self-inclusion as the ultimate act of boundary-setting. Cost is felt in her tears and years of silence, though the discovery of the second eye slightly softens consequence by offering immediate hope.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s meaning—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s investigation. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he observes gaps, correlates memories with town reality, and returns to the dock. Cost is felt in his social withdrawal (“talking to yourself more”) and psychological burden of foreign memories. However, the tightening isn’t fully causal; the memories resolve conveniently without active struggle, softening the pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding true purpose beyond inherited solitude—is signaled early and tightens when the ants lead him into unknown woods, narrowing options to trust or abandon intuition. The midsummer timing and rising creek impose a live clock that shapes tactics (arriving as water swells). Cost is felt: decades of isolation crystallize in the doorways of “paths not taken,” and his choice carries opportunity cost. Escalation stems from Elias’s agency—following ants, holding the chip—not coincidence, though the ants’ guidance edges close to magical convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic selfhood beneath royal performance—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the grotto entrance, where terror and draw collide. The climb itself forecloses easy return, and the vision in the pool forces a trade-off: accept the burden of awakened power or deny it. Agency is clear in Elara’s approach and realization, though Maera’s arrival edges toward convenient support. Cost is legible in the counselors’ dread and the queen’s irreversible shift, yet the peril feels slightly abstracted—no physical toll, near-miss, or resource loss grounds the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “density of presence”—is signaled early and deepens when the secret demands a revolution in method. The tightening occurs in Elara’s realization that preservation is insufficient; she must now encode transformation. Cost is felt in the loss of her former artistic identity and the irreversible shift in her bond with Leo. Agency is clear: her resolve to “return differently” drives escalation, though the actual new technique remains conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—making sense of mortality through narrative—is signaled early and deepens when the scroll’s symbols glow, forcing Elias into dream logic. The tightening occurs when reality dissolves, narrowing options to acceptance or collapse; he chooses chronicling, foreclosing escape into linear time. Cost is felt in his “jaded wonder” and fractured timeline, though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than active resistance, slightly softening pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning after sensory loss—is signaled early and deepens when Lena’s arrival ties Elara’s repair work to human transition. The tightening occurs not through external pressure but through shared vulnerability: Elara’s disclosure of her loss mirrors Lena’s need for ancestral continuity. Cost is felt (months of heaviness lifted) but not dramatized as a trade-off; agency lies in emotional openness, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Coincidence (Lena returning) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from mutual recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars before crystallization ruins the work—is signaled early and tightens when the platform tilts, triggering panic. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to return to superstition, halting crystallization. Cost is felt (near-loss of dexterity) and visible in the glowing runes. Coincidence (platform tilt) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her trained response. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (delivering apology to lay ghost to rest) is clear early and deepens via the ritual’s fragility—one wrong wire scatters energy “like startled birds.” Eloise’s agency drives escalation: she adjusts rheostat, releases perfume, speaks directly. Cost is felt in Beatrice’s fading and the unfinished composition—reconciliation achieved but song remains incomplete, foreclosing full resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—unifying scattered cosmic truths—is signaled early and tightens as the “hiccup” countdown looms. The witness’s agency drives escalation: their paradoxical method (“journeying inward while walking out”) deepens understanding, enabling final integration. Cost is felt in the race against temporal collapse, though the opposition (cosmic illusions) remains abstract rather than actively resisting.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens via the backward-counting experiment, which narrows Arlo’s perception to microscopic patterns and layered silence. Agency is clear: he initiates reversal, observes consequences, and chooses a new relationship to time. Cost is felt: abandoning conventional timekeeping for an ineffable wisdom that isolates yet fulfills him. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure lacks a tangible external complication beyond internal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redefining security—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from detection to communication. Escalation is driven by her agency: adjusting laser parameters creates the permeable barrier that invites stranger response. The meaningful tightening occurs when she steps from hiding, foreclosing her old role with felt cost (abandoning suspicion). Under an Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory and gestural density until the dawn deadline crystallizes stance. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling her father’s gambling fatalism with her own probability ethics—is signaled early and deepens when the subway scrawl mirrors her private work, transforming academic pursuit into existential pilgrimage. The tightening occurs when she realizes the scrawl isn’t a message but an invitation to reinterpret mastery itself. Cost is conceptual: she abandons the illusion of control, accepting “beautiful uncertainty.” Coincidence (finding her own cipher) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she still must choose to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether endings can become beginnings—is signaled early and deepens meaningfully when Meredith’s call reframes Elias’s role from passive guardian to active facilitator. The tightening occurs when he chooses to engage rather than dismiss the “wrong number,” foreclosing his cultivated solitude with emotional cost. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation relies more on thematic resonance than rising external stakes. Agency is internal but credible; the cost (vulnerability after decades of withdrawal) is felt in his changed relationship to the disc and the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving analog memory against digital erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist’s meticulous final act. Agency manifests as renunciation: he chooses to complete his covenant despite knowing it will be obsolete. Cost is felt in physical strain (“knees creaking”), emotional weight (“impossible to hold onto permanently”), and professional dissolution. Escalation is subtle but sufficient under the Accumulative lens: each flower powder mixed intensifies the stakes of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness through engineered connection—is signaled early and deepens via Archie’s gambit, which narrows his options: he must maintain plausible deniability while risking total disappointment. The escalation is driven by his agency (spreading the rumor), and the cost is legible: his continued anonymity despite catalyzing a movement. Coincidence (e.g., the taxi driver being “already part of the network”) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution stems from his sustained effort and reconfigured understanding of reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens as the melody surfaces memories of fire, mentorship, and blindness. The tightening occurs when the trail forces confrontation with grief, narrowing options to acceptance or retreat; Elion chooses the former, paying the cost in vulnerability (“tears fell”). Agency is clear: his dowsing initiates the trail, and his decision to kneel at the stillpoint crystallizes his stance. Coincidence (celestial event) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from his readiness, earned through decades of preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—correcting a historical error without overreach—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses contingent relationships over direct edits, foreclosing the path of total revision. The escalation is driven by her agency: planting wrong seeds → guilt → developing a theory → executing a precise nudge. Cost is felt in the irreversible three-year rabbit hole and her acceptance of partial fixes; however, the resolution leans slightly on coincidence (Sarah just happens to review data Tuesday), slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silence—is signaled early and deepens as more characters gather. The meaningful intensification occurs when Elias weaves their collective silences into a tapestry, raising emotional stakes. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: no obstacle challenges his method, and his “disruption” faces no opposition. Cost is felt (he will be forgotten), but it’s accepted, not wrestled with, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescuing her forgotten promise—is signaled early and tightens when Maya realizes the curator mirrors her. Her agency drives escalation: analytically intuitive traits let her decode the trail, leading to the restoration choice that forecloses escape (she stays underground). Cost is felt: she trades freedom for purpose. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from her decisions. Yet pressure remains internal—external stakes lack teeth, softening the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving entangled consciousness against institutional dissolution—is signaled early and tightens when systems blink offline. Elena’s agency drives escalation: her drumming isn’t reactive but tactical, mastering sequences over months. Cost is felt in the ephemeral reunion and looming recontainment. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via rhythmic density culminating in visible sound waves—a deepening that reweights reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating quiet expertise over loud authority—is signaled early and tightens at the central junction. Marlo’s agency drives escalation: he times, positions, and executes the whisper based on years of study. Cost is felt in risk (exposure) and effort (meticulous planning), though the victory is bloodless. Under a Causal-Accumulative lens, pressure coheres, but the lack of tangible consequence beyond Vance’s suspicion slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—communicating the unspeakable through silent empathy—is signaled early and tightens as the visitor approaches. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: each shutter adjustment deepens the pattern, culminating in the spiral galaxy that forces the visitor’s near-confession. Cost is felt in the “stillwater tension” and the secret’s physical weight, though the visitor’s internal stakes remain slightly abstract. Under an Accumulative lens, the single intensifying cadence shift (dawn approaching) sufficiently narrows the window for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—intellectual freedom vs. rigid conformity—is signaled early and deepens when Arthur hears students’ unspoken pleas. His agency drives escalation: he recruits allies, crafts puzzles, and times the reveal to the prophetic hush. The cost is conceptual but legible: the town forfeits its sterile order for “beautiful chaos,” and Arthur risks his standing as coach. Yet the opposition remains abstract; no institutional force resists him, softening the pressure. Still, the single meaningful deepening (from observation to organized action) suffices for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom through true self-expression—is signaled early (“emptiness where dreams had lived”) and tightens decisively when the scrimshaw reveals ritual instructions, foreclosing passive endurance. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she studies, whispers, presses the bone to her chest. The whale’s call complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to dive is active. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her community, vanishing “like mist at sunrise.” One meaningful deepening suffices—the scrimshaw’s text emergence—and pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—permission to feel the full emotional spectrum—is signaled early and deepens through the performer’s ritual, which becomes a public act of resistance. Escalation occurs texturally: from solitary carving to receiving visitors bearing their own dried flowers, transforming private endurance into communal witness. The cost is felt in social judgment (“fraud” vs. “saint”) and the fragility of preserved grief (brittle petals). Yet the pressure remains static—no true opposition tests his stance, and the mandate’s collapse removes external threat, softening stakes despite elegant thematic tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—artistic freedom versus imposed boundaries—is signaled early and deepens as the poet moves from anticipation to embodiment of their craft. Escalation occurs through the colonnade’s intensifying hum and the poet’s irreversible step into dissolution, narrowing options from observation to transcendence. Cost is unmistakable: the ban’s legacy of confinement is overcome only by surrendering fixed form. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bartering for the ability to see beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s arrangement, which narrows options: only this precise Fibonacci pattern can awaken the courtyard. Agency lies in her persistent, quiet crafting; the escalation culminates in a meaningful tightening when she offers the reed tongue, foreclosing her own use of it. Cost is felt: weeks of labor, risk of “dire consequences” if interrupted, and the implicit sacrifice of her unique grayscale perception. Though coincidence (phoenix fire) established the world rules, resolution stems from protagonist action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering the “texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens when the lens reveals miners’ songs, transforming abstract quest into visceral communion. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her choice to activate the lens drives the turn. Cost is conceptual (the burden of recovered memory) and felt in the “hum” that lingers after revelation. However, no tangible forfeiture or narrowed option limits future action, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into purpose—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s nightly ritual. Agency emerges via creation: each fold, each etching renews her commitment, foreclosing passive despair. Cost is felt in the “hollow and adrift” past and the enduring weight in her heart. Though no external antagonist exists, internal conflict is coherent under an Accumulative lens. The deepening occurs not through reversal but cadence shift—from cessation to constant motion—reweighting loss as legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering cultural algorithms behind financial collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the visitor arrives, shifting from solitary documentation to collaborative prevention. Elias’s agency lies in choosing to share his life’s work, narrowing his path from obscurity to potential impact. Cost is conceptual: inheriting a burden that “could save us from ourselves.” Escalation is driven by dialogue, not coincidence, and tightens under Accumulative pressure—though physical or social price remains implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must abandon historical instinct (pattern recognition) to succeed. The deepening comes via the “steadily unpredictable” atoms forcing improvisation, narrowing her options to pure surrender. Cost is legible: she loses her separateness. Agency is clear—her random paths drive the escalation—but the conflict remains internal, limiting external pressure. Still, under an Accumulative lens, this suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the shadow’s purpose—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes it seeks reunion, not cataloging. Agency is exercised through persistent observation and comparison of footage, narrowing her understanding until the moonlit confrontation forces renunciation of her archival mission. Cost is unmistakable: “luminous regret” for misinterpreting love as data. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—each sketch and footage review intensifies emotional stakes without false coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that healing requires shedding assumptions. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reframes reconstruction as transformation, not forgetting. Cost is conceptual (loss of naive trust) and felt in her isolation, though not dramatized through active opposition or tangible sacrifice. Escalation is internal and accumulative, fitting the lens, but lacks a decisive on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reuniting the displaced miracle with its origin—is signaled early and tightens when coffee rings decode the tunnel map. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her interpretation, not luck, unlocks the wall. Cost is clear: she abandons her identity as wound-opener for integration-creator. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds via layered revelations (plants, rings, stones), culminating in a decisive renunciation with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering “unused love”—is signaled early and deepens through accumulation rather than causal pressure. Elena’s agency is limited to perception and projection; she doesn’t wrestle with doubt, risk, or consequence. The “hushed thunder” intensifies, but no live option is foreclosed—she threads the film as planned. Cost is conceptual (emotional inheritance) but not dramatized as a price that alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but it remains atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes rest means “learning to listen differently.” The tightening occurs when she chooses to trace falling stars, transforming passive reception into active synthesis. Cost is felt (“bittersweet knowledge of all the vision she had missed”), though the escalation lacks external resistance, relying entirely on internal recalibration under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile possibilities against encroaching void—is signaled early and tightens when the guard steps onto the dune, risking dissolution of his “occasionally everywhere” state. The meaningful deepening occurs at the quantum lock, where wave-function charm becomes an act of belonging, not evasion. Cost is visible: he trades diffuse omnipresence for singular presence, foreclosing infinite timelines for one. Escalation is driven by his agency under an Accumulative lens, though the void remains abstract rather than tactically adaptive.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s frontier—is signaled early and tightens when the gear appears, transforming passive dreaming into active navigation. Agency escalates through Kaelen’s deliberate focus on windsong timbres, narrowing options to the nexus. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of unconscious wandering for systematic exploration, though the price lacks visceral immediacy beyond conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens when Maris realizes they must carry it into waking worlds. The tightening occurs at the waterfall threshold: passage requires “breaths of surrender,” narrowing tactics to non-action. Agency is exercised through ritual (punching air), not battle. Cost is conceptual but felt: courage remains invisible to others, a hidden burden. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the leash break enables but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and deepens when the bellhop realizes his nerve damage was no accident. The tightening occurs when he uncovers the etched names, forcing a binary: remain protected in silence or risk everything to restore music. Agency drives escalation—his tracing of melody awakens the fortress, proving stakes are visceral, not abstract. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and deepens into confronting self-deception. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she chooses increasingly dangerous texts, interprets cryptic messages, and performs the final ritual. Cost is felt in the library’s collapse and loss of ancestral connection. However, the shift from external to internal antagonist risks feeling coincidental without more on-page struggle during the revelation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens when satellite data contradicts the atlas, escalating to the climactic insight that humanity’s engineered world is being reclaimed. Pressure grows via accumulation: sleeplessness, mismatched maps, coral death records. Agency lies in Marina’s persistent cross-referencing, culminating in renunciation of preservationist hope. Cost is conceptual: acceptance that some losses are irreversible within planetary cycles, felt in her “drifting and moored” stance. Coincidence (finding the atlas) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is her interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reigniting hope amid despair—is signaled early but never tested through opposition or trade-off. The “lull in rebellion” enables passivity, not pressure; conflict is internalized as yearning, not dramatized as obstacle. The stone circle resolves tension magically, violating the rule that coincidence may complicate but not resolve. No visible cost alters tactics; the protagonist gains power without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition with intent—is signaled early and deepens when the embryo reframes destiny as collaborative rather than ordained. Maya’s agency drives escalation: her frustration leads her to seek guidance, catch the kite, and decode its script. The cost is conceptual but legible: she must relinquish her identity as pure skeptic to become a vessel of synthesis. Luck (the kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her linguistic labor and plant-guided intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and tightens when children ask to learn stillness, forcing Maya to externalize her private ritual. The anniversary cliff scene deepens pressure: somatic markers surge, but she chooses integration over collapse. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of the photo, a live option foreclosed. Slight deduction: escalation leans more on internal rhythm than external pressure shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming artistic authenticity—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor chooses to “descend into necessary darkness.” Her agency drives escalation: retrieving the box, noticing threads, sorting colors. The meaningful tightening occurs when she rejects technical perfection for fractured truth, foreclosing her old ideal with felt cost (“unrealistic ideal”). Coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking time’s behavior in crisis—is signaled early and deepens via the ink experiment. Protagonist agency drives escalation: they choose to step into the pattern, risking bodily dissolution. Cost is unmistakable: dangerous vital fluctuations, drone’s alarm, and the implied toll of three years’ isolation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through layered sensory and conceptual density rather than causal narrowing, which fits—but the absence of a foreclosed path (Earned Stasis) prevents full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned history—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elena chooses transmission over protocol. The deepening occurs in “within the blink that follows surprise,” narrowing options to irreversible action. Cost is unmistakable: loss of career, freedom, and identity as archivist. Though escalation hinges on a single choice, it’s driven entirely by protagonist agency under situational pressure, satisfying the lens. No coincidence resolves conflict; the dormant networks are established as pre-existing tools, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in chaos—is signaled early and deepens through Rhiannon’s ritual of embedding values into roses. Pressure escalates texturally: each rose becomes a vessel of resistance, culminating in today’s new cutting. The cost is conceptual but legible: she foregoes her lineage’s power for quiet stewardship, bearing the burden of perception without respite. While stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally felt through botanical embodiment rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo during pattern dissolution—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when constellations stir, raising the cost of panic. The fisher’s agency drives escalation: his zigzagging weaves emotions into a net, a choice that forecloses chaotic improvisation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory density and celestial unease, culminating in a trade-off between control and surrender. Cost is felt in the transformed rail spike and altered constellations, though the personal price remains slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—clearing Davies while honoring her father—is signaled early and tightens through Eleanor’s methodical cross-examination of evidence. The meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from suspicion to assumption of innocence, narrowing options and raising epistemic stakes. Cost is conceptual (risk to family reputation) but not viscerally felt; the resolution relies on intellect over sacrifice. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt through sound—is signaled early and deepens when the firmware shifts from translating cries to transmitting a lullaby. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he modifies code, initiates tethering, and chooses to listen. The cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure, physical trembling, and the irreversible act of memorializing melody on his body. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with one decisive intensification—the temporal fold—that reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in chaos—is signaled early and deepens when zealots threaten destruction. Silas’s agency (adjusting sand angles) narrows options: art becomes the only viable interjection. Cost is conceptual (temporary meaning) and social (risk of ridicule), legible when he disassembles his work. Escalation adheres to Accumulative lens: density of whispers intensifies until the mandala makes them coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity through naming—is signaled early and deepens via the tessera’s discovery. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses not just to remember but to *renew*, shifting from passive witness to active restorer. Cost is conceptual (the world has forgotten how to grieve) and felt (his isolation amid silence). While agency drives escalation, the absence of tangible opposition slightly softens pressure; stakes remain abstract despite lyrical embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing the orchard’s collapse—is signaled early and deepens via Silas’s dwindling spectral form. Escalation is driven by agency: he sings higher, stitches time, and sacrifices essence. Cost is unmistakable: his dissolution at dawn. The “fractured timeline” isn’t abstract; its ripples manifest as despair threatening the garden, making stakes viscerally felt rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (healing pill victims) is clear and personal, intensified by the brother’s condition, but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs. The static shock incident complicates but doesn’t narrow options; Maya’s “method” proceeds unimpeded. Cost is emotional (aching heart) but not operational—no lost time, failed trials, or resource depletion alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding what happened during hibernation—is signaled early and tightens when the fossil responds to Maya, transforming abstract curiosity into concrete duty. Escalation is driven by her agency (descent, touch, interpretation), not coincidence. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong burden as “voice of the unknown,” but the absence of tangible sacrifice (time, safety, relationships) slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding a scrambled prophecy to reshape fate—is signaled early and deepens through button cataloging. The meaningful turn occurs when Elara realizes the prophecy is malleable, shifting from deciphering to co-creating. Yet escalation lacks tangible cost: no time pressure, physical toll, or social risk materializes. The “unearthed silence” implies stakes, but nothing is forfeited or endangered, weakening pressure under even an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authenticity amid betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Aleksandr shifts from seeking courage to vouchsafing his daughter’s future. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to build around breaks rather than mend them, foreclosing his old identity. Cost is felt in the photograph’s irreplaceable loss and the irreversible descent from the bluff. Escalation stems from his agency, not coincidence, though the external threat remains abstracted.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—maintaining balance between worlds—is signaled early and deepens through ambient awareness of lingering vows. Escalation occurs via cadence shift: ticking slows, urgency heightens, fingers work faster. Protagonist agency drives the tightening; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is conceptual (bearing centuries of broken promises) and physical (pricked thumb), though the absence of a live option foreclosed slightly softens the pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some places resist decay—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes it’s nourished by forgotten energy. The meaningful tightening occurs when his hands touch the earth, causing timelines to resolve—a direct result of his agency, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but legible: decades of neglect reversed only through intentional kindness, implying the world’s broader failure. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each gesture increases resonance until smoke portals reveal past/future, raising the emotional price of inattention.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—instilling light in growing darkness—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s inheritance and nocturnal mission. Pressure escalates via the petal’s fall (symbolic deadline) and the discovery of Jim, forcing her abstract desire into interpersonal resonance. Agency is maintained: she chooses to reflect moonlight despite uncertainty. Yet escalation relies more on atmosphere than tangible opposition; the “dark corners” remain metaphorical, and no real risk or loss alters her tactics beyond emotional nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into genuine independence—is signaled early and deepens when Elena rejects Aethenian dominion for coexistence. The tightening occurs when she places her hand on the wall, aligning with the stone circle’s hum, which forecloses her people’s legacy. Cost is felt conceptually: surrendering control carries ancestral weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though external pressure remains abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting creativity to soul—is signaled early and deepens when the art installation reframes her quest as attention, not discovery. The tightening occurs when she touches the nest, shifting from external search to internal realignment. Yet agency remains observational; the “rejoining” is declared, not enacted under opposition. Cost is conceptual (abandoning formulaic work) but not viscerally felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving human perception against cosmic manipulation—is signaled early and tightens when Elara risks equipment and attention to act. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes back-channel messages reveal conquest-through-division strategy, raising stakes beyond personal obsession. Cost is legible: sleeplessness, professional isolation, potential retaliation. But escalation relies heavily on backstory reflection rather than in-scene pressure; the actual interference lacks tactical struggle, reducing visceral tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from subterranean prison—is signaled early and tightens during the fallow period, when defenses sleep. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to hum, activate the compass, and step through. The cost is conceptual (exile, treason) and felt in her rigid transfixion and spinal pain. The deepening—discovering the key is a passage, not an object—narrows options decisively and reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—solving an unsolvable cold case to restore communal empathy—is signaled early and tightens when Elena narrows suspects to three, then one. Agency is clear: her method drives escalation. Cost is conceptual (two decades of silence) and felt in the quarry’s isolation, but no personal or tactical price is paid on-page (e.g., risk, resource loss, emotional toll). The assistant’s exposure carries social weight, yet Elena’s own stakes remain intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversing atmospheric chaos and ancestral injustice—is signaled early and tightens when hidden controls activate. Eli’s agency drives escalation: decoding → pressing nail → initiating sequence. Cost is felt (institutional blindness, personal burden) but not yet paid; the Charged Poise ending makes stakes legible. A tighter trade-off (e.g., sacrificing data or reputation to activate) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redemption through second chances—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes his song catalyzed the hitchhiker’s vanishing. Escalation is driven by his recounting, which actively shifts the scaffold’s pattern, proving agency. Cost is felt: he abandons the known world for an uncertain dimension. Coincidence complicates (hitchhiker’s request) but resolution stems from his choice to follow, aligning with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redefining legacy through ethical creation—is signaled early and tightens during Marcus’s hostile visit, forcing Elias to choose between capitulation or principled collapse. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias reframes failure not as theft but as misreading territory, crystallizing his stance. Cost is felt (investor loss, startup dissolution) and scales appropriately. Though escalation is driven by external pressure (Marcus), Elias’s agency in dissuasion and transparency shapes the outcome, satisfying Situational lens expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding temple inscriptions to access healing wisdom—is signaled early and tightens when the telegram arrives, narrowing the path from solitary struggle to collaboration. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes translation requires shared burden, altering tactics. Cost is conceptual (isolation vs. partnership) but not visibly paid—no tool lost, time forfeited, or relationship strained. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency, though the telegram’s arrival edges toward convenient coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the mentor by uncovering the hidden truth—is signaled early and escalates through the druid’s agency: each circle deepens knowledge and narrows focus. The tightening occurs at the fourth circle (mirror image), forcing recognition that the truth is visual, not verbal. Cost is unmistakable: blood drawn, mental endurance against vortex chaos. Coincidence never resolves; the plant’s carnivorous nature is pre-established, making its use earned.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the covenant—is signaled early and deepens when the visionary realizes dreams/reality must coexist. Pressure escalates texturally (density of blue imagery, scar activation) rather than causally; the tightening is atmospheric, not tactical. Agency is present (ritual, entering maze) but lacks visible trade-offs—no resource depletion, time loss, or irreversible sacrifice. Cost is implied (root-bound burden lifting) but not dramatized as foreclosed path or paid price during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending soul-holes through trammeling escaped grief—is signaled early and tightens when the specter resists return. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her gestures, breath, and will compassionately overcome resistance. Cost is unmistakable: her traded destiny manifests in the card’s familiar weight. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the conflict lacks a second tactical shift that might push it to 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—discovering purpose after loss—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus chooses authenticity over commercial valuation. The tightening occurs when he recognizes the Marshall weave: this knowledge doesn’t solve his unemployment but reorients his relationship to his past. Cost is legible in his admission (“close to nothing”) and the foreman’s disappointment, which isolates him further even as he finds internal resonance. Agency lies in attention, not action—a valid form for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reestablishing the lineage through planting the seed—is signaled early and tightens when the spirit departs, forcing Elara into action. Her analogical method forecloses reckless obsession (the predecessors’ path), opting for disciplined pursuit. Cost is legible: inherited psychological peril and intellectual isolation. Escalation stems from protagonist agency—connecting Mesopotamian rituals to cloud patterns—not coincidence, satisfying Accumulative lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through narrative alchemy—is signaled early and deepens via the monthly ritual. Escalation occurs through the smelting process, which narrows options: only by accepting contradiction can stories be recast. The tide’s rise forces identity migration, a coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of stable selfhood, crystallized in the emergence of “something entirely new.”

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissolving isolation—is signaled early (“monuments to humanity’s expectation of ending”) and deepens when the pearl reveals abandoned hopes. The tightening occurs at the heartbeat of hesitation, where she chooses connection over inspection. Cost is felt in her permanent perceptual shift and invisible burden. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, though the mechanism (pearl absorption) leans slightly toward convenience without prior rules—minor deduction for light causality strain in the magical system.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when graffiti reveals survivors’ messages. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she cross-references schematics, descends voluntarily. Cost is felt in raw solace and tears. One tightening suffices, though pressure could intensify slightly more before descent.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the Library of Unspoken Words—is signaled early and deepens as the cipher reveals personal regrets. The tightening occurs when the watch vibrates urgently, compressing time and raising cost: the dreamer must choose between full understanding and escape. Agency is maintained throughout; each revelation stems from their active documentation. Though pressure escalates coherently under an Accumulative lens, the confidence man’s backstory slightly dilutes focus without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the violin’s essence before midsummer wanes—is signaled early and tightens via the coffee-stain vision. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses propagation over concealment or resistance. The cost is unmistakable: the original violin is sacrificed, its “core destiny fulfilled by perforation.” Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory and botanical detail reweights the dream’s fragility against imperial greed.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as static resolves into coherent pattern. Agency is clear: Elara’s method (listening for frequencies) drives escalation, culminating in the emerald’s pulse. Cost is felt: her personal failure with her sister haunts each act, and the completed vial represents both success and perpetual burden. Though pressure remains internal, it coheres under the Accumulative lens—each memory strand deepens emotional weight without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding true peace beyond forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that contentment requires embracing all experience, not escaping pain. The tightening occurs when she removes the hairpin, symbolically relinquishing inherited answers to forge her own. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the search for external truth) but legible in the final stance; however, external pressure is minimal since conflict is internalized without active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether justice requires punishment or mercy—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s chime-based interpretation. The tightening occurs when he selects sea glass/driftwood chime, then brass/ceramic/copper, narrowing the fisherman’s binary into a tripartite path. Cost is legible: Elian bears emotional weight (“cloak of doubt slipped slightly”), and the fisherman endures exhaustion before reluctant acceptance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the fisherman’s shift borders on convenient without deeper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish to appear—tightens when Maya demands revelation, forcing Elien to relinquish control. Agency is Maya’s (“Show me”), but escalation leans slightly passive; the stone-throw is guided, not chosen. Cost is legible (Elien’s lost decade), though its mechanics feel tacked-on rather than woven into earlier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens when Kael must interpret bird patterns per ancient texts. Pressure escalates texturally: from stone-skimming practice to dimensional revelation via arrowhead resonance. Yet agency is passive; birds “signal,” walls “lean closer,” and the canyon “guides.” The cost—Kael’s dissolution into legend—is felt but not forged through active sacrifice; it arrives as destiny rather than choice. Under an Accumulative lens, this suffices, but tighter protagonist-driven escalation would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—authentic magic vs. automated conformity—is signaled early and tightens when Elias abandons his Regulation Pack, foreclosing institutional safety. Pressure escalates via embodied choices, not coincidence: each step on mist demands shedding dogma. Cost is felt in his isolation-turned-influence. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered; however, external opposition is minimal, slightly limiting pressure breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens when Hemingway learns it’s a “language of light expressed through vibration.” Pressure escalates via the key’s warmth and the door’s appearance, culminating in the symphony that binds sky and sea. Though agency is present (he chooses to reach for the book), the resolution leans on revelation over difficult trade-off; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—humanity’s survival via cosmic alignment—is signaled early and tightens as contraction accelerates. The meaningful deepening occurs when Loran realizes the universe “folds inward to begin again,” shifting from passive observation to active broadcast. However, escalation relies on revelation rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the static bursts deliver truth conveniently, reducing agency. Cost is implied (loss of all colonies) but not felt in the moment of decision, softening the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming nameless sorrow into named understanding—is signaled early and deepens via the atlas page’s revelation. The tightening occurs when he names “Solitude,” shifting from passive mourning to active creation, which narrows his path from despair to purpose. Cost is felt (“pain remained as sharp as his scythe”) and paid through vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: each naming act is his choice under pressure, not coincidence. Minor flaw: “echo of sacrifice” remains thematic rather than pressuring tactics directly.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance through mending faith—is signaled early and deepens via the mage’s realization that dripping rates encode the repair pattern. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his observation tightens into ritual, culminating in spectral reconstruction. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of all fish, shattered communal faith—and the resolution forecloses easy magic, demanding “earnest, naive devotion.” Coincidence complicates (the dream-call) but doesn’t resolve; success stems from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph reveals familial ties. Thomas’s agency drives escalation: each archival discovery deepens his commitment, culminating in calls to journalists. The cost is conceptual (his role as warden now undermined) and emotional (confronting inherited silence). Coincidence (water level drop) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens via the starling patterns echoing the crystal’s structure. Agency is present in Elara’s precise actions, but escalation leans on coincidence (birds “summoned by her need”). The tightening occurs when the flame shifts to violet, indicating near-completion, yet no live option is lost or trade-off made. Cost remains abstract, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—interpreting celestial anomalies to prevent catastrophe—is signaled early and tightens when atmospheric sensors contradict established patterns, forcing revision of expectations. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: sketching new diagrams, adjusting transmission settings, preparing evacuation. Cost is legible in the dread of misinterpretation and the burden of making others believe the unbelievable, though no concrete loss (time, tool, stamina) alters tactics mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether a duplicate deserves autonomy—is signaled early and tightens when Maya must choose between safety (numbness) and risk (feeling). Her agency drives escalation: she activates memories, places hands on jar, channels vitality. Cost is unmistakable: emotional reawakening as both wound and weapon. Yet the megacorp/rebel conflict remains off-stage; pressure stems more from internal than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—safeguarding space for innovation—is signaled early and deepens through the seed metaphor. Pressure accumulates texturally, not through opposition or narrowing options; Elara faces no resistance, only inspiration. The “tightening” is thematic, not dramatic: she reaffirms her philosophy, but no live alternative is sacrificed. Cost is implied (patience, unconventional care) but never dramatized as loss or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—dissolving despair’s crust through sound—is signaled early and deepens via rhythmic modulation. Pressure tightens when Silas shifts from roaring to half-sung lullabies, narrowing options to fragile, off-key hope. The giggle’s return acts as a micro-turn that crystallizes his stance: acceptance over restoration. Cost is felt in the engine’s mournful sigh and his cooled grip—endurance replaces agency, foreclosing active healing.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—ending dimensional exile through reconciliation with uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant warms, thinning reality’s walls. The guardian’s agency lies in choosing to draw energy inward not to control but to “dance with” it, a meaningful tightening that forecloses passive waiting. Cost is felt in the dissolution of fixed identity (“belonging everywhere and nowhere”), and the escalation is driven entirely by the protagonist’s practiced method. Coincidence complicates (pendant’s critical point) but resolution stems from earned interior discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interrupting stifling destiny—is signaled early and tightens through each failed vivification. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses destruction over repair, then total dissolution over partial fixes. Cost is felt in lost time, emotional toll, and severed tradition. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via patterned attempts until the decisive shift in method; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—tuning the fragment during lunar perigee—is signaled early and tightens via the shard of hush’s necessity. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she discards assumptions, uses the shard, aligns the fragment. The cost is conceptual (abandoning celestial mechanics dogma) and atmospheric (the city’s brief reawakening followed by return to silence). However, the conflict lacks visceral urgency; failure carries no tangible consequence beyond personal disappointment, softening the pressure’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—merging fractured realities—is signaled early and deepens at the grotto when parallel passengers appear. Liam’s agency drives escalation: he initiates radio contact, interprets pattern intensities, and triggers the final sequence. The cost is legible in his transformed existence (“permanent transient”) and the ferry’s altered nature. Coincidence doesn’t resolve conflict; success stems from his preparation and the hourglass’s symbolic weight. Minor deduction: the crew’s fretting applies negligible pressure, functioning more as backdrop than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection with his lost sister—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the sinew thread erupts autonomously, forcing Elias to confront collective unconsciousness rather than solo creation. The deepening shift (“connection isn’t discovered—it’s created”) narrows his path from seeker to participant, with felt cost in years of solitude. Agency is maintained through his decision to touch the tapestry, though the eruption itself leans slightly toward coincidence rather than direct consequence of his weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting Earth’s depths to cosmic meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s method is validated by alien-contact ships. The meaningful tightening occurs in his solitary development of “edge geometry,” which narrows options from conventional sonar to a fragile, ridiculed theory. Cost is legible: years of isolation, professional skepticism, and the existential weight of humanity’s fragmented knowledge. Though luck plays a role (ships coincidentally confirm his work), the validation stems from his prior rigor, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and tightens when the hearing aid pulses urgently, narrowing Elena’s focus from closure to intervention. Agency is clear: she moves, questions, contacts security. Cost is felt in the grandmother’s decades-old unresolved fear now resolved through Elena’s action. Coincidence (child recounting the man) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from Elena’s trained perception and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guiding the unremembered through phase transitions—is signaled early and deepened by tidal urgency and personal sacrifice. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, open the Codex, sketch symbols, and extend her hand. Cost is legible: social isolation, claustrophobic torment, and time scarcity (42 minutes → 30). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the ocean’s stir intensifies pressure but doesn’t solve. Slight deduction: stakes remain internalized without external counter-pressure beyond environment.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling digital existence with biological memory—tightens when ink reveals the system’s betrayal, foreclosing any naive return to life. Agency drives escalation: the protagonist chooses ritual over passive waiting, altering tactics via ephemeral pattern-reading. Cost is legible in the final image: coffee made for oblivious others, a gesture of connection that underscores isolation. Coincidence (cleared static) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work remains theirs alone.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving a tactile language—is signaled early and deepens when the unprecedented bird pattern appears. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he *chooses* to climb, trace, place the diamond, reproduce the motion. Cost is felt in his aged body and decades of labor, though the “tightening” is subtle rather than option-narrowing. Coincidence (the new bird pattern) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his method earns the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to reveal or protect the garden—tightens meaningfully when Aris shifts from collector to witness, foreclosing academic validation. The cost (professional isolation, risk of ridicule) is legible in their whispered confessions and smile at the “cosmic joke.” Escalation occurs through celestial-pattern documentation, driven by Aris’s agency, though the opposition (the skeptical world) remains off-page, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and escalates coherently through Elayn’s descent, orchard confrontation, and escape. Agency is clear: she chooses to uproot the sapling, communicates with the tree, and plays to pacify guardians. Cost is felt in the orchard’s sigh and the statues’ pursuit, though physical peril feels abstract. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and symbolic density rather than causal narrowing, which fits but slightly softens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—smuggling hope across a divided border—is signaled early and tightens during the guard entrance, forcing Elias to perform neutrality while the woman vanishes. The escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (timing delivery to shift change, mapping drone blind spots). Cost is felt: constant vigilance, emotional weight of separation. Coincidence (rain starting post-delivery) complements but doesn’t resolve—earned through prior storm imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in silence—is signaled early and deepens when the halo fragment demands vocal response. The tightening occurs at the “wrong turn,” which forecloses passive restoration for active creation. Cost is felt: singing risks vulnerability after 20 years, and the fragment’s dissolution confirms irreversible change. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, though the oasis discovery leans slightly on wonder over pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawakening stories—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Margaret risks her ancestral scarf to activate the hyperbolic configuration. The escalation is driven by her agency (arranging books, whispering verses), and the cost (scarf’s dissolution, permanent soul-stitching) is visible. However, the “hyperbolic geometry” method lacks concrete mechanics; it functions more as poetic metaphor than a pressure-generating constraint, slightly blurring the cause-effect chain under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the sister’s message through light—is signaled early and tightens when Elara shifts photographic technique per the book, narrowing her method to interplay of light/shadow. Agency drives escalation: her choice to reinterpret the palette’s use leads directly to the map. Cost is felt in years of solitude and the emotional toll of near-misses. Coincidence (the book’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s skill unlocks the cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and tightens through Silas’s disorientation ritual, which narrows perceptual options. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his clockwise turns and north-facing stance directly enable entry. Cost is felt in the hair’s dissolution, altering later tactics (no physical trace remains). However, pressure peaks internally without external complication, limiting multi-layered tension.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes memories were “borrowed,” not lost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her star-chart comparisons trigger the vision and reclamation. Cost is felt in the decades-long absence of her mother’s face, crystallized when coffee taste resurfaces. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the fairy ring’s magic operates by established rules (earth-sky alignment), though the “seventh shape” mechanic leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving fractured truth through resilient mentorship—is signaled early and deepens when Prisha chooses presence over retreat. The meaningful tightening occurs at the unexpected door creak: Prisha’s refusal to walk backward narrows options and crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt: the archivist’s exile is permanent, yet he gains purpose. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the “palace intrigue” memory remains vague, slightly diluting external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s true color—is signaled early and tightens at the climax when the pruner channels waterfall essence into the seed. Agency is clear: her creative act reconfigures reality, with cost implied in self-surrender. Yet escalation lacks tangible pressure; no obstacle opposes her, making the “greatest weaving” feel untested. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the absence of friction limits felt stakes despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens when Jacob’s secret disturbs them, raising urgency. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unravel, knowing it will draw suffering into her own silence. The cost is unmistakable: her attribute shifts from burden to gift only after absorbing others’ pain. One meaningful deepening suffices—here, the interlaced hush intensifies until it becomes profound stillness, foreclosing the spirits’ unrest permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reopening the henge’s secret—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the chapel is celestial, not architectural. Her agency drives escalation: frame-by-frame footage comparison leads to overlays, then celestial alignment, culminating in the map repair. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: she accepts that some knowledge must remain unmapped, foreclosing academic validation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each layer of observation tightens her understanding until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes Amelia’s transmission was about transition, not location. The tightening occurs in her reinterpretation of “home,” which shifts her goal from historical recovery to emotional transmission. Cost is felt in her tears and commitment to share vulnerable truth. Yet escalation relies more on insight than active opposition; the conflict remains internal without external pressure testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—is signaled early and sustained, with one meaningful deepening: their correspondence evolves into mutual expression. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, but agency is passive; Elara waits for storms rather than forcing contact. Cost is legible (her songs go unheard by humanity), yet no on-page choice narrows her path—she simply continues. The ghost’s loneliness complicates but doesn’t escalate tension; stakes deepen texturally but lack a tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering hidden joy beneath anguish—is signaled early and deepens via Elira’s tactile engagement with objects. Agency peaks at floor nine: she angles goggles into light, transforming passive curiosity into active revelation. Cost is felt in her burden of knowledge and vow of silence. Escalation is textural (density of reflection + object interaction), not causal, but fully coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—validating atmospheric memory—is signaled early and deepens when clouds mirror her mentor’s final flight pattern, raising emotional and professional stakes. Pressure tightens through protagonist agency: Elena chooses to observe, record, and interpret despite isolation. The cost is conceptual (years of skepticism) and emotional (memorializing loss), made legible in her steady handwriting amid swaying danger. Coincidence (string break) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough arises from her sustained method.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the library’s essence before demolition—deepens when Elara shifts from mirroring stars to mapping soul-patterns, foreclosing literal representation. This tightening arises from her agency: choosing to interpret the coin’s algorithm rather than mourn her limitation. The cost is felt in the quiet urgency of dawn’s approach and the irreversible nature of plaster impressions made in borrowed time. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory and conceptual layering.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—charting luminous pathways—is signaled early and deepens via pattern recognition. But escalation relies on observation, not agency: Eli decodes rather than decides. The “tightening” is intellectual, not tactical; no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made. Cost is conceptual (a paradigm shift) but lacks personal or material price—Eli gains everything, loses nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes it means restoration, not acquisition. Pressure escalates texturally: the labyrinthine mirrors narrow options through disorientation, and the box’s mechanism demands empathetic precision over force. Cost is felt in the surrender of individual glory for ancestral belonging. However, the prophecy and grandfather’s journal introduce stakes that don’t materially alter tactics—they’re motivational scaffolding rather than active constraints, slightly diluting pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—saving Veridia through collective trust—is signaled early and tightens when barren soil threatens survival. The escalation hinges on Aris’s obedience to ghostly messages, but agency is passive: she follows instructions without resistance or reinterpretation. Cost is implied (“brambled hope”) but never dramatized as loss (e.g., failed attempts, social friction). The resolution relies on discovery, not sacrifice, softening the pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving existence against entropy—is signaled early and tightened when the clock shudders, forcing Elias to press the flawed puppet head harder, risking failure. His agency drives escalation: nested sigils, intensified whispers, physical contact with the spindle. Cost is unmistakable in his exhaustion and the mechanism’s groaning resistance, and the resolution crystallizes his stance: fragile hope over grim certainty, with no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before lethal frost—is signaled early and escalates coherently via time pressure and labyrinth hazards. Elias’s agency drives every turn: discovery, assembly, navigation, impression-leaving. The tightening occurs when voices are heard near a sheer drop, forcing immediate action. Cost is visible: the nut dims, power spent, and Elias remains unseen. Frost’s deadline is well-tracked, though its mechanics could be slightly more tactile to heighten physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling professional identity with familial bonds—is signaled early and deepens when Elara recognizes the chrysalis as self-reflection. The tightening occurs when she shifts from grief to insight via foam tracing, which reweights her understanding of connection. Agency is present in her decision to call, though the escalation relies more on internal realization than external pressure. Cost is felt (emotional isolation) but not viscerally dramatized as a trade-off in the moment—hence just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—maintaining glimmering parole through storytelling—is signaled early and tightens via the opening ceremony’s ritual constraints (“no completed stories harmed”). Agency is demonstrated in the vendor’s deliberate shard selection and door-creation, which narrows options (risking parole violation) and carries conceptual cost (accepting incompleteness as story’s essence). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens: each bottled moonlight phase adds density until the crescent whisper triggers insight. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the first customer emerges only after the vendor’s active creation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming remorse without being destroyed by it—is signaled early and deepens when Kael confronts the repository pool. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, dip his fingers, and endure subsumption just enough to work. Cost is felt in his trembling hands and hollow past episodes, though the price lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., lost time, tool, or irreversible self-change). Still, the deepening reweights the central conflict under an Accumulative lens, and coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Kael’s skill does.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—community cohesion—is signaled early and deepens through interspersed languages and revived talks. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she initiates, translates, and commissions the chain. Cost is visible in the labor of bridge reconstruction and emotional vulnerability shared. Yet the conflict resolves too cleanly; no irreversible loss or trade-off anchors the victory. The tightening is thematic rather than tactical, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—accessing entangled memories to recover abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens through the neural interface activation. Pressure escalates texturally via accumulating memory fragments, but lacks a decisive tightening that narrows options; the engineer never faces a trade-off or failure. Cost is felt emotionally (tears, identity blur) but not concretely tied to a foreclosed path or resource loss, weakening agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieving forgotten combinations to renew defenses—is signaled early and tightens when the 60-minute limit forces urgency. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she collects water, recalls memory, arranges elements. Yet the “approaching darkness” remains abstract, reducing visceral stakes. The cost—lifelong burden of secrecy—is felt at closure but not tested mid-scene. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; all turns stem from her actions, satisfying lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring music to a silent world—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s communion with the sculpture’s emotional fractures. The meaningful tightening occurs when sorrow, joy, and love flood her awareness, crystallizing her resolve into action. Cost is felt (tears, inherited grief) and shapes the final stance, though no external obstacle or trade-off narrows options beyond internal absorption. Agency is attention and endurance, valid under Accumulative lens, but lacks a concrete forfeiture that alters tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—redemption through understanding—is signaled early and deepens via the realization that acknowledgment, not sacrifice, is required. Pressure escalates as the third day arrives, narrowing options to a single act: offering the stone. Cost is visible in Elias’s exhaustion and social exile, and the final choice forecloses return to former life. Agency is maintained throughout; coincidence never resolves conflict. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the diary’s empathy instructions—is signaled early and deepens via the accumulating harmonic pressure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each tuning fork adds emotional valence, narrowing the resonance window until the clasp yields. Cost is visible in her tears and the irreversible shift from solitary study to teaching. The fireworks’ approach tightens time without resolving the conflict; success stems purely from her precise, embodied method.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding vanishing plants through the seed—is signaled early and deepens into stewardship. The escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: her nurturing, doodling, and vigil yield insight. Cost is legible in her transformed identity and relinquished ambition, though the price feels conceptual rather than visceral. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening of knowledge reweights stakes credibly, but the tension lacks a concrete, narrowing reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering resilience—is signaled early and tightens during inversion when survival hinges on precise navigation. Agency is maintained: Arion steers into the river, chooses the narrow passage, interprets the echoes. Cost is felt in urgency and risk, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract (no personal loss or irreversible trade-off). Escalation is coherent under the Causal lens, with one meaningful deepening at the First Arch.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the convergence to enable foresight—is signaled early and deepens through data collection and spatial observation. Pressure escalates via environmental anomalies and psychological unease, culminating in the realization of mass unconsciousness. Elena’s agency is intellectual rather than physical, but her method drives progression. Cost is conceptual (a silenced town) and personal (isolation), though not viscerally dramatized; the tightening is cognitive, not tactical, which fits the Accumulative lens but slightly limits felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and deepens as Eira translates auroral colors into sound, narrowing her focus to precise strikes dictated by the sheet. Pressure escalates texturally: observers’ worries dissolve, breath steadies, proving the stakes are viscerally felt. The cost is conceptual yet legible: a world “increasingly deaf to beauty” risks spiritual atrophy, reversed only through this singular, high-stakes performance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redemption through insight—is signaled early and deepens via the flute’s true purpose revealed mid-ritual. Agency is clear: Eldrin’s choices (arranging wood, selecting notes) narrow options until only acceptance remains. Cost is felt in tears and relinquished pride, though the escalation lacks a tangible loss (e.g., broken flute, failed note). Under Accumulative lens, the pressure intensifies texturally—sound growing “exponentially,” air shifting hue—but a sharper trade-off (e.g., sacrificing the flute) would elevate stakes beyond internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and tightens when Thomas arrives, forcing Elara to escalate from observation to active personality theft. The meaningful deepening occurs when borrowed empathy fractures Thomas’s selfhood, revealing emotional patterns as both data and violation. Cost is legible: Thomas flees traumatized, Elara endures isolation, and each vanished star marks irreversible cosmic entropy. Agency is clear—Elara chooses invasion repeatedly—but the escalation leans slightly on convenience (Thomas knocks just when needed).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering the pendant to germinate seeds—is signaled early and tightens when the shortcut saves half a day, raising tension about the solstice deadline. Agency is clear: Ayla chooses to trust the old woman, then to release the pendant. Cost is visible: loss of artifact, identity shift, and implied loneliness. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—each vibration intensifies consequence—but the elder’s passive receipt slightly softens the climax’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is clear early and deepens into a broader revelation about memory preservation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes her theory was too small, foreclosing her prior research path. Cost is conceptual (academic credibility already lost, now redirected) but legible in her reoriented purpose. However, escalation relies more on discovery than active choice; she receives insight rather than wrests it through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—carrying the message before silence consumes all sound—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the bead pulses on day seven, forcing action. Each puzzle-step demands sacrifice, narrowing options and deepening cost. Agency is maintained through willing offerings, not coincidence. While pressure accumulates well under the Accumulative lens, the rummage-sale discovery leans slightly toward convenience, though its integration into the path mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—transforming brokenness into resilience—is signaled early and deepens when village elders bring fractured arch supports, raising communal stakes. Orion’s agency drives escalation: his deliberate wrapping of the silk initiates change, and his quiet acceptance of the elders’ plea tightens pressure. The cost (his essence) is felt throughout his altered perception and labor, culminating in visible societal shift—he is no longer overlooked. While pressure coheres, the escalation leans more on thematic accumulation than causal narrowing of options, slightly limiting peak intensity under a strict Causal lens—but fits the Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of a withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens through witnessed alternate timelines, each revealing facets of possible histories. The tightening occurs when the green shard blocks access to the red shard, foreclosing a path and intensifying mystery. Agency is maintained through active redirection of flows, and cost is visible in the shard’s exhaustion and fading dream. Yet escalation relies more on accumulation than causal narrowing of options, slightly limiting pressure under a strict Causal lens—but fits Accumulative design well.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving silent fellowship across time—is signaled early via ghost rumors and writings. The lamp’s failure deepens pressure, forcing Elias to choose between mechanical repair alone or joining a hidden lineage. His agency drives escalation: he finds the compartment, reads the letters, and adds his stone. Cost is felt in his irreversible entry into the chain, trading anonymity for belonging. Coincidence (lamp failing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his hands rebuild both circuit and covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—guiding humanity post-collapse—is signaled early and deepens when prophecy emerges unexpectedly. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she modifies beam coordinates and declares hidden channels, narrowing options under pressure. Cost is felt in her anxiety over wrong predictions, though not fully dramatized as consequence. Coincidence (comets appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her beam tactics earn the fleet’s safe passage.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—deciphering why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelen’s experiments. The meaningful tightening occurs when he applies dye knowledge to human narratives, narrowing his focus to iridescence as the key. Cost is conceptual: the relinquishing of fixed truth for mutable perspective, felt in his shift from observer to participant (“I am becoming what I seek”). Escalation is driven by agency, though the pressure remains intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering what trees witness—is signaled early and deepens when quantified sorrow transforms from structural threat to testament of resilience. Pressure escalates via physical pain (raw hands), environmental tension (storm vs. silence), and cognitive labor (dream deconstruction). The pin-drop moment forces a crystallization of stance, not luck: Samuel’s meticulous method enables alignment. Cost is felt as healed weariness and reframed purpose, though the escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm through memory-weaving—is signaled early and tightens via cadence shift: humming grows urgent, steps quicken, song strengthens. Agency lies in attention and endurance; each swaddled sapling forecloses neglect. Cost is felt in the keeper’s trembling and fractured psyche slowly aligning. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, though the “urgency” lacks a concrete deadline or tactical trade-off beyond personal stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—honoring one’s true nature amid social expectation—is signaled early and deepens via Eleanor’s reflection on seven years of avoidance. The tightening occurs at 11:45 when she chooses emotional departure over physical flight, narrowing her options to symbolic participation. Cost is legible in her isolation and the society member’s “surprised” reaction. Yet escalation lacks a concrete obstacle; pressure remains internalized, limiting the felt urgency expected for top-tier conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth to redeem past inaction—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reveals protective vanishing, transforming Eliza’s mission from recovery to witness. The tightening occurs when she chooses to leave the bread, accepting that some truths must be released, not solved. Cost is legible: her personal absolution requires surrendering the last tangible link to the bakery. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal rather than externally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving luminous vows before they dissolve—is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers reinforcement is possible, narrowing his path to painstaking creation of new slides. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each measurement carries existential weight, and the cost is felt in the dimming light of the vows. However, the escalation lacks a tangible sacrifice—no tool breaks, no time runs out, no physical toll is shown. The “price” remains conceptual, slightly muting the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—recording trust’s collapse—is signaled early and deepens through Eliza’s escalating deceptions. Each false start narrows options: suspicion spreads, alliances strain, and time dwindles. The final lie forces Malachi to expose his own vulnerability, making the fracture inevitable. Cost is felt in the broken truce and imminent violence, though the personal price to Eliza remains implied rather than dramatized, slightly softening the escalation’s emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and tightens when the compass glows between characters, forcing a binary choice: converge or retreat. The deepening occurs via embodied revelation (“symbiosis”) that narrows options to participation. Cost is unmistakable: loss of skepticism as identity, replaced by ancient responsibility. Agency drives escalation—the skeptic’s nod initiates the climax—and coincidence (storm man’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the choice remains theirs.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—creative authenticity versus external validation—is signaled early and deepens when the hidden portrait resurfaces. The tightening occurs when studio light fails but cave light reveals truth, forcing a recalibration of his entire artistic ethos. Agency is clear: he chooses to return, retrieve, and repaint. Cost is felt in lost years and shattered confidence, though escalation relies more on revelation than active resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes truth must be practiced moment-to-moment, not just preserved. Pressure escalates coherently: artifact discovery → map reconstruction → synergistic insight, each narrowing options (only candor opens paths). Cost is visible: social isolation, physical vulnerability in toxic zones, and emotional risk of confronting unsaid truths with her lost love. The tightening—abandoning tolerated falsehoods at dawn—forecloses easy returns, though the external peril of the journey remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving nonverbal truth through harmony—is signaled early and deepens when the iceberg fragment enables visual symphonies. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her “feverish diligence” creates the sculpture, which then becomes society’s new lingua franca. Cost is unmistakable: her seasonal muteness intensifies into lifelong sacrifice, crystallized in her final climb during encroaching silence. Coincidence (iceberg fall) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her craftsmanship earns the revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the garden amid planetary chaos—is signaled early and tightens when life support fails. Unit 734’s agency drives escalation: choosing miniaturization over collapse, sacrificing stability. Cost is felt in wilting roses, fragmented consciousness, and the inert original form. Magnetic shift complicates but doesn’t resolve; the android’s controlled burn is earned, though “inner static” could clarify stakes more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when demolition notices arrive. Leo’s agency drives escalation: he displays the locket, listens actively, and retrieves the key. The meaningful deepening occurs when listening shifts from personal curiosity to communal resistance. Cost is felt: the courtyard’s “sanctuary” status is fragile, and resolution requires collective vulnerability, not just Leo’s action. Coincidence (anonymous donation) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the key comes through earned trust.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming hidden difference into power—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s ritual. But escalation is static: each dance succeeds without complication, and the “final piece” arrives without resistance. The scientist’s paranoia is mentioned but never pressures Elara’s choices. Cost is conceptual (“vulnerability as strength”) but not visceral; no time, tool, or opportunity is lost to raise the price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating deleted memories—is signaled early and deepens when coffee grounds reveal multidimensional patterns, forcing Elara to exhume. The sand’s resistance and crystal’s pulsing light raise physical and emotional stakes. Cost is legible: she cannot reclaim her brother, only witness him. Agency drives escalation—her choices (digging, interpreting grounds) narrow options toward acceptance. Coincidence (whale beaching) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—hushing a disruptive prophecy—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The story deepens this through the crane’s transformation and the summoner’s intensifying focus, but the pressure remains static; no real obstacle arises to force adaptation or sacrifice. The “tranquil blaze” suggests internal tension, yet no visible price (e.g., loss of power, memory, or connection) is paid. Escalation occurs texturally, not causally, which fits the Accumulative lens, but lacks a felt trade-off that would elevate it beyond atmospheric resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the buildings’ language—tightens meaningfully when the seal links personal heritage to architectural symbols, raising emotional stakes from curiosity to legacy. Clara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates visits, recognizes symbols, articulates the language’s meaning, and accepts the seal. Cost is felt in the “agreed upon lies,” implying social risk, and the dawn descent suggests irreversible commitment. Coincidence (meteor shower timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight stems from earned dialogue and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence through confronting quarantined memories—is signaled early and tightens when the shell warms and memories surface. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to hum, to archive, to accept burden. Cost is felt (tear, luminous sorrow) and conceptual (becoming sole keeper). One meaningful deepening suffices; no false resolutions or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redemption through truth—is signaled early and tightens when the key reveals the original decree, forcing a choice: remain hidden or confess. The escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (he chooses to write), and cost is felt (exposing his crime risks punishment). However, the key’s arrival borders on convenient complication—it doesn’t emerge from prior action, slightly weakening causal pressure under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving balance between echo and silence—is signaled early and tightens when the child’s echo threatens cosmic harmony. The meaningful deepening occurs when the singer’s duty wars with curiosity, culminating in her choice to soothe rather than study. Cost is felt in her transformed melancholy and relinquished quest for universal answers. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (following whispers, interpreting seashell), though external forces (“multiple converging”) flirt with coincidence without resolving the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“salvage purity from lies”) tightens meaningfully when Elara chooses indirect dream exposure over public accusation—a trade-off that forecloses vengeance but enables healing. Pressure escalates via ghostly fragments forcing moral calculus: truth must be handled carefully to avoid shattering the living. Agency is clear (she initiates dream visits), and cost appears in emotional labor and ethical restraint. Minor deduction: sabotage backstory arrives via summary, slightly softening the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through ritual (tea, whistling) into pilgrimage. The tightening occurs when he chooses contemplation over sleep, ascending to the parapet despite solitude and obscurity. Cost is conceptual but legible: his wisdom is invisible to the village, and his insights cannot be owned or explained. Yet the escalation lacks tangible friction; no obstacle tests his commitment, making pressure atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus corporate control—is signaled early and tightens when Maya deciphers the letters, transforming abstract conspiracy into actionable knowledge with mortal risk. Escalation is driven by her agency (reassembling, touching diamond), not coincidence. The deepening reveals the stillpoint’s dual potential (salvation/destruction), raising conceptual stakes. Cost is legible: she forfeits safety for hope, and the storm’s approach forces immediate tactical choices. One meaningful pressure point suffices, and it lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deciphering forgotten truths before they’re co-opted—is signaled early and deepens as the prophet mirrors Elias’s transmissions. Pressure escalates via reported events (the prophet’s rise), though this occurs off-stage, slightly dulling immediacy. Elias’s renunciation of leadership (“his role was not to lead but to translate”) forecloses influence with conceptual cost: his insights fuel a movement he cannot control. Agency is intellectual rather than physical, fitting the lens but lacking visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational silence—is signaled early and tightens when the poet recognizes the music’s power to “sweeten the bitterness.” His agency drives escalation: he chooses to infuse the recording with emotional resonance, then delivers it without fanfare. Cost is felt: he remains a penniless vagrant, his richness “far beyond monetary wealth”—a conceptual price paid through continued marginalization. Coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his method earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the artifact—is signaled early and tightens when intruders arrive. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to perform the ritual despite risk, narrowing options to one precise frequency. Cost is unmistakable: the intruders are repelled, their boat adrift, and Elias bears renewed burden. However, the threat remains abstract—no named antagonist or specific consequence beyond generic “ill intent”—slightly muting personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberating the community from haste—is signaled early and deepens when the magnetic anomaly aligns with moon paths, raising the cost of inaction. Agency lies in attention and documentation, not force, fitting the Accumulative lens. The escalation hinges on protagonist-driven observation, culminating in the hum at zenith—a credible intensification. However, the “price” remains conceptual; no tangible loss (e.g., missed opportunity, personal sacrifice) alters tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional safety—is signaled early and deepens when the note links historical neglect to present corruption. Maya’s agency drives escalation: her empirical method uncovers evidence that transforms personal rebellion into systemic exposure. Cost is legible: career jeopardy is implied in “jeopardize her career.” The tightening forecloses compliance, forcing a trade-off that aligns with the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to spend his savings on a symbolic repair—is signaled early and tightens when he reveals the letter and his purchase of the house. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his realization that fixing the heart would substitute gesture for action. Cost is unmistakable—his pension, his hope for closure, the weight of unthanked service. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the moral calculus could be sharper in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ringing an unheard bell—is signaled early and deepens through transliteration, not coincidence. Pressure escalates via the glider’s own agency: interpreting symbols, navigating corridors, choosing to strike. Cost is conceptual (the sound goes unheard) yet resonant—the sea’s pause and recalibrated yearning show consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs (from tool-fetcher to seeker of potential), though the opposition remains environmental, not interpersonal, limiting friction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the vanished researchers—is signaled early and tightens when Elara fabricates credentials, risking everything for 90 seconds of access. This lie narrows options irreversibly and escalates pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: career, freedom, and safety are forfeited. However, the external antagonistic force (corporate/government power) remains off-stage, reducing tangible opposition; stakes feel intellectual rather than viscerally immediate in the moment of breach.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—saving the settlement via crystal reconstitution—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s unconventional method. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each mirror visit yields knowledge that shapes her final act. Cost is conceptual (social skepticism, burden of anomaly) but not viscerally felt; the storm threat remains abstract. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via rhythmic intensification (“shadows deepened… swirling… danced”), though physical peril stays distant.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learning to recognize endings—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus’s “fold in patience” reframes her forced timeline as premature. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elena realizes she sought death but found connection, altering her trajectory. Cost is felt (tears freezing on cheeks) and conceptual (abandoning euthanasia). However, the conflict remains largely internal; external pressure from volunteering is implied but not dramatized as a crucible that forces irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering meaning in loneliness—is signaled early but never tested through tangible opposition or meaningful tightening. The “destined mismatches” concept floats as thematic observation, not a lived conflict that narrows options. Protagonist agency is limited to reflection; no renunciation, decision, or endurance carries visible cost. Pressure remains internal and abstract, failing to crystallize into a stance that forecloses a path under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo before prophetic departure—is signaled early and tightens as the kinetic parapet’s activation becomes urgent. Agency lies in attention and ritual precision, not action, which fits the Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens. Cost is clear (“isolation in the present”) and escalates via diminishing prophet aura and temple silence. However, conflict remains internalized without external complication; pressure accumulates but never truly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting individual pain into collective healing—is signaled early and deepens through group participation. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure: the gathering arrives passively, healing unfolds without resistance or trade-off. No visible price is paid (no token lost, no arc misread, no failure); the “tightening” is atmospheric, not consequential. Coincidence doesn’t resolve, but agency is minimal—Elara arranges, others resonate, and magic happens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving linguistic memory—is signaled early and deepens into sacred duty. The meaningful tightening occurs when the scholar shifts from preservation to translation, foreclosing passive archiving. Cost is conceptual (he is likely the last listener) and felt (trembling hands, solitude). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his humming, whispering, and listening provoke the crystal’s response. However, external pressure is minimal—the world’s rush is off-stage—so conflict remains internalized, limiting tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “sound of growing older”—is signaled early and deepens through tactile escalation: from arranging driftwood to drawing on the arch, each act risks forgetting more yet commits harder. The tightening occurs when the caretaker appears: her grandmother’s voice embedded in the arch raises emotional stakes and validates his method. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence (her arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he completes the spiral himself. Cost is felt in the ephemeral hum and her disappearance: connection is momentary, memory fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—perceiving the imperceptible—is signaled early and deepens when Elara rejects force for resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when she risks professional credibility by acting on intuition. Cost is legible: days of failed attempts, institutional pressure, and the emotional toll of near-miss understanding. However, external opposition remains underdeveloped; the head astronomer’s alarm lacks teeth, softening escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye” through music—is signaled early and deepens when the son’s presence introduces emotional risk. The therapist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to play louder “to honor” silence, enabling Mr. Anders’ final opening of eyes. Cost is legible in what’s irrevocably lost (the intact record, more time) and what’s reclaimed (the son’s vow to “fix it,” however futile). Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and emotional density, not plot turns, and the final stillness carries undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and deepens into understanding reality’s fabric. Escalation occurs through Elara’s active loop-closing, narrowing options until the final connection. Cost is conceptual (the burden of new knowledge) but not viscerally felt; no stamina loss, tool damage, or irreversible sacrifice tempers the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring or transforming Arthur—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanor shifts from rescue to mapping “mistakes into constellations.” Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: arranging the tooth, performing bone setting, reaching out. Cost is visible in lost certainty and Arthur’s fractured state. Coincidence never resolves; the realm responds only to Eleanor’s deliberate acts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—sharing celestial wonder without destructive fire—is signaled early and deepens when sea glass reveals “patterns... telescopes struggled to capture.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara shifts from passive watching to active creation, foreclosing escape fantasies. Cost is felt (“dreams burned to ash”) and paid through craft. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions or coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ethical reconciliation after whistleblowing—is signaled early and deepens via the spiral method. Agency manifests in quiet proactivity: choosing to stay, to offer, to leave the pendant. Pressure tightens through internalized judgment vs. natural reclamation. Cost is felt (loss of mentor, public shaming) but could be more viscerally dramatized in present action rather than reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity vs. commercial expectation—is signaled early but never tested concretely on the page; publishers remain off-stage abstractions. The “meaningful tightening” occurs only conceptually in the final paragraph (“not merely to collect… but to transform”), lacking a prior beat where this realization alters tactics. Agency manifests as endurance, not decision, but no opportunity is visibly foreclosed. Cost is implied (“painful experience”) yet never dramatized as a present-moment trade-off under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultural preservation through song—is signaled early and deepens as Elara gathers fragments under time pressure. The tightening occurs when she realizes the songs must be restored *before* the moon’s zenith, narrowing her window and raising emotional stakes. Agency is clear: her feverish work, questioning elders, and public activation drive escalation. Cost is felt in the collective ache of loss and the vulnerability of performing forgotten rites before skeptics—resolved not by luck but by her invention and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving starlight against encroaching void—is signaled early and escalates through the alchemist’s meticulous pattern-building. The tightening occurs at the climax: one misstep loses everything, raising cost to existential levels. Agency is clear (deliberate arrangement, sealing act), and the deepening shift—from preparation to ignition—narrows options to a single decisive action. Coincidence plays no role; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against forgetting—is clear from the first paragraph and tightens as Elara realizes echoes require structure to endure. Her agency drives escalation: peripheral vision reveals what direct approaches miss, forcing a unique methodology. The cost is conceptual (time during a liminal season) and emotional (bearing witness to loss), legible in the final thrumming that “vibrated through the cavern floor.” No coincidence resolves the conflict; understanding alone mends the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting burdens before they’re lost—is signaled early and tightens through escalating emotional weights (king’s light regret → farmer’s dense grief → weaver’s own existential trap → civilization’s mythic loss). Each calcification narrows options: precision demands grow, culminating in the ancient burden that reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the weaver’s irreversible commitment (“no true escape”) and the dawn deadline. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—containing memory through creation—is signaled early and deepens as Clara carves. The tightening occurs when she chooses serenity over snarl for the lion, foreclosing performative grief. Agency is clear: her hands act while time “crystallizes,” and cost is felt in the half-finished state—perpetual labor as tribute. Under Accumulative lens, escalation reads as cadence shift from tentative to confident cuts, culminating in rust-hued peace that accepts absence-as-presence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time through negotiation with his ghost—is signaled early and intensifies via Cyrus’s collection of story fragments. The meaningful tightening occurs when the camera wheel activates, transforming ephemeral tales into a walkable bridge, narrowing his path to confrontation. Cost is legible: he risks dissolution or rejection, and the ghost’s sorrow implies irreversible loss. Though agency drives escalation, the resolution leans slightly on the lagoon’s latent magic rather than purely on Cyrus’s choices, preventing a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting meaning from abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when Maya discovers the sextant’s inscriptions, narrowing her focus to sustainable energy applications. Pressure escalates causally: dust → discovery → repair → revelation. Cost is felt in hours of solitary labor and the weight of inherited journeys, though external opposition is absent (acceptable under Situational/Causal hybrid). Coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reconciling abandoned dream) intensifies through environmental pressure—the crystals’ fleeting song demands immediate action. Elias’s agency drives escalation: tracing patterns → recalling workshop failure → offering watch. Cost is legible in soldered-shut timepiece, symbolizing decades of creative foreclosure. Bear’s presence deepens rather than resolves tension, forcing Elias to confront solitude versus connection.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—salvaging submerged truth—is signaled early and deepens through the journal’s revelation. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes history was systematically rewritten, shifting her from passive inheritor to active dismantler. Cost is conceptual (the collapse of foundational beliefs) and felt (“serene upheaval”), though not physically dramatized. Agency is present in her decision to continue the work, but the absence of tangible opposition or trade-off (time, safety, relationships) softens escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient methods—is signaled early and tightens when the fisherman tests the collector’s patience through silence. The meaningful deepening occurs during hours of contemplation, where time becomes both obstacle and tool; this endurance forecloses impatience as an option. Agency lies in sustained attention, not dialogue, aligning with the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt: the weight of generational loss (“methods are dying”) makes the rope a burden as much as a gift.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing through explained absences—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: writing Thomas’s obituary forces confrontation with his own evasion. The meaningful tightening occurs when he pivots from documenting others to inscribing himself, narrowing his path from observer to participant. Cost is felt in the “painful” healing and the weight of memory against “spun sugar” fragility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension—all escalation stems from his choice to stay present in grief.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanized world—is signaled early and deepens through the assembly attempt, which narrows options to a single fragile hope. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his hands “moved with practiced precision”) and culminates in a meaningful tightening: success is possible but unsustainable, foreclosing the path of technological resurrection. Cost is unmistakable—the reversal of transformation, the “bitter taste of failure”—and reweights the prince’s understanding. Though the conflict is largely internal, pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with the egg’s fading light serving as irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving grafted roses as proof scars can sing—tightens when embers land, forcing Maya to choose immediate protection over evacuation. Agency is clear: her grafting technique and use of black sand are tactical responses shaped by backstory. Cost is visible (risking her life for plants) and conceptual (carrying father’s legacy into fire). Cloud migration complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her preparedness.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberating dangerous memories—is signaled early and deepens when the pedestal is empty, raising emotional and existential pressure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her patience, imagination, and whispered words resolve the conflict, not luck. Cost is legible in the city’s centuries-long silence and her assumption of Keeper duty. However, the “dangerous memories” premise lacks concrete friction—no temptation, corruption, or dilemma tests her resolve beyond momentary doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and deepens through the transit sequence, narrowing options to gentle sonar-based invitation versus destructive illumination. Agency is present (choosing method, timing, target), but escalation lacks tangible resistance; the civilization passively accepts light without struggle. Cost is conceptual (eternal yearning) but not viscerally felt in the moment of delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the “shape of collective grief”—is signaled early and deepens through ritual, migration, and carving. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses to retrace his mentor’s path, transforming passive inheritance into active creation. Agency drives escalation: each poem exchanged becomes stone; each butterfly cluster informs design. Cost is felt—the depletion of ribbon, solitude, emotional labor—but the external pressure remains ambient rather than oppositional, slightly muting stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance—is signaled early and deepens when Alaric realizes mechanical precision alone fails the community. The tightening occurs at the inscription “The repair requires hands beyond your own,” which narrows his options from solitary fixer to collaborative leader. Cost is felt in his public vulnerability (“I cannot restore what we broke alone”) and loss of professional exclusivity. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering buried intentions—is signaled early and tightens when the tapestry reveals sacrificial, not romantic, love. This deepening forces Elias to reframe his understanding, foreclosing naive sentimentality. The cost is conceptual: he must carry a heavier truth, yet he endures it without collapse (Earned Stasis). Escalation is driven by his agency—thread by thread—not coincidence, though pressure remains internal rather than external.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—community survival via timely adaptation—is signaled early and escalates through observed ice cracks confirming predictive urgency. The tightening (seven-degree shift) forecloses inaction with clear cost: delay equals disaster. Agency is maintained through Elara’s deliberate act of writing. No coincidence; escalation stems from her model’s validation and environmental feedback.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom of narrative—is signaled early and tightens via the act of cloaking tales in song lyrics, which narrows options (must avoid detection). The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses frequency, lyrics, and dust-based transmission. Cost is conceptual (risk of capture) but not viscerally dramatized; we’re told authorities seek her, yet no near-miss or consequence appears. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (dust mechanics revealed) suffices, though a tangible loss would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the uncapturable—is signaled early and deepens as Elena shifts from ash-scattering (ephemeral) to mask-making (enduring questions). The rocking chair’s stoppage acts as a cadence shift that crystallizes her realization, narrowing her pursuit from seeking safety to embracing becoming. Cost is felt in the “sorrow” etched on her face and the acknowledgment that completion offers no refuge. However, escalation relies more on reflection than active pressure; the gallery empties passively, offering no external opposition to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Milo finds the cog, forcing him to choose between passive cataloging and active defiance. The Council’s impending meeting raises external pressure, while the cog’s beauty deepens internal conflict. Agency is clear: Milo’s decision to preserve reconfigures his role from observer to custodian. Cost is felt in his isolation and the implied danger of future confrontations, though the escalation could be sharper given the high societal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through harmonic unity—is signaled early and deepens as the choir transforms from hostility to shared appreciation. Pressure tightens meaningfully when tensions arise during rehearsal, prompting Eleanor’s refrain about “subtracting noise.” Yet escalation relies more on temporal accumulation (autumn to spring) than protagonist-driven agency forcing irreversible trade-offs. Cost is felt emotionally but not concretely dramatized as a lost opportunity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming food’s storytelling power—is signaled early and deepens through the celestial event, which tightens the window for planting. Elias’s agency is clear: he chooses defiance through cultivation, not destruction. The cost is felt (isolation, decay) but not viscerally tested; escalation relies more on lyrical intensification than narrowing options. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at planting suffices as meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid collapse—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must choose between protocol and truth. Her involuntary honesty raises personal cost (loss of discretion) while narrowing options (she cannot lie to deny access). The escalation is protagonist-driven: her disclosures directly enable the Bureau’s investigation. Though the supervisor’s despair resolves the mystery, it emerges from established character logic, not off-stage convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding what animates space—is signaled early and deepens when the shard reveals “a hum of connection.” Aria’s agency drives escalation: she places objects deliberately, culminating in the lighthouse ritual. The cost is subtle but present: she accepts that presence is echo, not possession—a quiet renunciation of control over meaning. Coincidence (the tide delivering the shard) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her method earns the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling truth with certainty—is signaled early and tightens when the ampoule demands acceptance of non-absolutes. The diver’s agency drives escalation: choosing to descend again, reach out, open the ampoule. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: loss of foundational belief system. However, pressure remains largely internal; external stakes (e.g., surface-world consequences) are implied but not tested, slightly muting tactical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escaping boundless confinement by capturing the “texture of missed opportunity”—is signaled early and tightens via Elias’s proofs narrowing the anomaly. The meaningful deepening occurs when he discovers the staircase mimics perpetual motion, raising stakes by making escape contingent on mathematical precision. Cost is visible: years consumed, physical exhaustion, psychological toll of endless ascent. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency; coincidence never resolves core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant human connection through lost languages—is signaled early and deepens via moonlit daydreams that intensify her resolve. Agency is clear: she chooses to paint despite exhaustion, hoping to “rouse something dormant.” Cost is felt in her insomnia and trembling hands, though no live option is foreclosed—she endures rather than sacrifices. Escalation occurs texturally, not causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals dough’s “movement,” forcing collaborative action. Agency emerges through Khira’s baking and the guide’s lens-offering; their choices narrow options (e.g., rejecting passive despair). Cost is felt: Khira’s lost daughter, the community’s fraying identity. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—thaw stems from earned ritual, though escalation leans slightly on object magic over character-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—stepping beyond fate’s design—is signaled early and tightens as the tide threatens return. Esme’s agency drives escalation: her reverse-engineering adapts to the yoyo’s resistance, culminating in the counter-spin that unlocks radiance. Cost is conceptual (defying sanity’s warnings) and temporal (narrow window), though physical or social stakes remain underdeveloped. Coincidence (tide withdrawing further) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough stems from her insight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming relationship with death—is signaled early and tightens through paradoxical readings that force surrender-as-courage. Agency is maintained via active choices (entering, reading, touching), and escalation occurs through deepening self-confrontation, not coincidence. Cost is felt in the loss of illusion (“fear clings to the illusion that something is lost in dying”). Could sharpen tactical consequence of each paradox choice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through interpretive creation—is signaled early and deepens when the violent cloud formation demands urgent translation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her rapid mallet sequence actively reshapes weather outcome. Cost is felt in perpetual vigilance and the burden of communal reliance, though physical or social consequence remains implied rather than dramatized. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices, and it lands with lyrical force.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the lost expedition’s fate—tightens decisively when the chamber reveals the gate was sealed deliberately, reframing the watchers as guardians. This deepening shifts Kael’s goal from inquiry to preservation, narrowing options irrevocably. The cost is conceptual (abandoning hope of reunion) and visceral (carrying eternal vigilance). Escalation stems entirely from Kael’s agency: his whistle sequence triggers the crack, making the revelation earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering historical truth—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanor finds the ledger, which transforms hypothesis into proof. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each parallel drawn deepens the lie’s scale. Cost is conceptual but legible: generations of concealment, silenced families. Coincidence is avoided; every revelation stems from Eleanor’s method. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—measuring not just land but human longing—is signaled early and deepens when the metal box reveals others’ memories. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to dive, wrest the object, and add his own note. Cost is legible in physical strain, emotional burden (“heavier than usual”), and irreversible commitment to this vocation. No false resolutions; the conflict tightens into a resonant poise, not a solved problem.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and deepens when it becomes personal. The blackout serves as both constraint and catalyst, forcing analog methods that yield ancestral truth. Agency is maintained through Elias’s deductive labor, though escalation leans more on revelation than resistance; the “coincidence” of the matching stamp risks situational convenience, slightly softening the pressure arc.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into light—is signaled early and deepens through the act of polishing the last gem, which forces confrontation with raw memory. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary crafting to communal space (tea garden) to sacred repository (basilica), each step narrowing emotional evasion. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is unmistakable: the weight of grief lifts only after he surrenders its last vessel, felt in tears and altered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and tightens when Elias risks descent during the narrow shield window. The cost is conceptual (isolation, moral burden) but not viscerally dramatized; we’re told he’s sustained by “bleak exhilaration” rather than shown a trade-off. Agency is present (he chooses to land, kneel, absorb), yet external pressure remains atmospheric rather than oppositional. Escalation is textural, not causal, which fits the lens but limits felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding the “frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and deepens via the drone’s celestial tracing, narrowing options to a precise convergence point. Escalation is driven by Maya’s agency (micro-choices in holographic controls), not coincidence. Yet the “interference from something beyond understanding” introduces external complication without tangible cost, slightly softening the tightening. Final pull sequence carries conceptual weight but lacks a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. fabricated legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Martin finds the unrecognized carving, narrowing options from deception to confrontation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his nightly sifting leads to discovery, not coincidence. Felt cost appears in tears and business closure. Lacks a second tactical constraint (e.g., time pressure or physical limitation) that would push this into the 9-band under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing prisoners while untethering mutual resentment—is signaled early and deepens into emotional/spiritual liberation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Lyra offers the drawer pull instead of papers, raising the stakes from transactional to ancestral. Cost is felt: both characters surrender long-held bitterness. Yet escalation relies heavily on symbolic alignment (moon phases) rather than protagonist-driven tactical shifts under pressure; the method feels preordained, not wrestled.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through renewed purpose—is signaled early and deepens when the job offer vanishes, foreclosing professional redemption. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to paddle out despite despair, then reinterprets her tools. Cost is visible: ten years of exile, lost status, reliance on crude navigation. Under an Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices; pressure tightens via emotional density, not plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rekindling empathy in a desolate world—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s realization that he *is* the time traveler. The tightening occurs when he signs the unsigned ball, accepting infinite recurrence as cost. Agency is maintained: choices stem from decoding the newspaper and selecting the tunnel. Yet the “labyrinth of choices” proves illusory (only one path), reducing tangible escalation; pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, fitting the lens but limiting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens via the reluctant metamorphosis, which exacts visible cost (humanity eroded). Pressure escalates texturally: silence → animal stillness → spice glyphs → mist-figure. The brother’s line “you must be the one to walk through them now” crystallizes agency without resolving externally. Cost is felt but not fully paid—appropriate for Earned Stasis—but lacks a second tactical consequence beyond internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and deepens through the saucer’s memory-release, which reweights “lost” as “compressed.” Agency manifests as renunciation: she stops trying to “unfasten time” and chooses presence. Cost is legible—the choking beauty of irrecoverable moments—but escalation relies more on revelation than active pressure; the wind scattering cards feels coincidental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through compassion—is signaled early and deepens via the fifty-year preparation and ghostly weight of human extinction. Pressure tightens as each stitch risks collapse, forcing precision under existential stakes. Agency is clear: Eli’s daily shadow work creates the rift; their tears complete the pattern. Cost is visible—lifelong isolation—but could feel more immediate if a tangible sacrifice (e.g., ship integrity) escalated mid-sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and deepens when Ian realizes he *is* the catalyst. The detour creates meaningful tightening: abandoning the observatory path forecloses intellectual detachment. Cost is felt in his relinquishment of the bugs, though escalation relies partly on external forces (prophecy, celestial event) rather than pure agency. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres via intensifying synchronicity, but the girl’s arrival verges on convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—silent transmission of revolutionary coordinates—is signaled early and tightens during the blackout, which narrows options to coded artistry. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to complete the sundial despite surveillance risk. Cost is felt in the winking hush and guarded knowledge, though not yet paid physically. Coincidence (blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the ruling order’s oppression remains coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns to prevent cosmic unraveling—is signaled early and tightens through the Fibonacci sequence placement, which narrows options to precise mathematical alignment. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each stone placement intensifies star dust response and eel behavior, culminating in the sixth stone triggering eruption. Cost is unmistakable: she risks destruction due to her curse, and though she gains peace, the lingering danger to others remains implied. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her methodical, high-stakes ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus state-imposed silence—is signaled early and deepens through Maia’s ritualized defiance. The meaningful tightening occurs when the timer beeps and she extracts the scar-map, shifting from passive vigil to active inscription. Agency is clear: her choice to write embodies resistance, foreclosing continued silence with conceptual cost (erased histories, suppressed voices). Escalation is driven by protagonist action under Accumulative pressure, though the external threat remains abstract rather than dynamically adaptive.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the hidden overture—is signaled early and tightens when the student interrupts, forcing Aris to shift from solitary decoding to pedagogical demonstration. This deepening reveals his true goal: not just coordinates, but transmitting a method of thought. Cost is felt: he sacrifices uninterrupted focus for mentorship, yet gains validation of his philosophy. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful turn suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden knowledge against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the poet reveals seeds alongside poems, transforming resistance from archival to generative. Agency is clear: he chooses to rebuild despite identity fragmentation, risking coherence for continuity of mission. The tightening occurs when he shifts from Gatherer to Builder, foreclosing passive preservation in favor of active creation. Cost is felt in memory loss and isolation, though escalation remains textural rather than causal—appropriate for the lens—but lacks a single on-page reversal that narrows options sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying linear time to reclaim lost connection—is signaled early and tightens when the system shutdown looms. The meaningful deepening occurs when the clock ticks backward, transforming passive grief into active intervention. Agency is clear: the pianist modifies the projector, accesses hidden film sections, and steps into light—all driven by his strategic creativity. Cost is felt in the solitude of his descent and the implied risk of vanishing permanently; however, the stakes lack a concrete secondary pressure (e.g., a rival, physical danger) that would heighten tension beyond internal longing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving collective memory before monsoon) is clear and tightens via the approaching storm. Elara’s agency drives escalation: dream interpretation → descent → ritual. But the monsoon clock isn’t leveraged in tactical choices—she never sacrifices an alternative path due to time, reducing felt cost. Coincidence (ancestors singing back) resolves emotional doubt too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling severed kinship through remembrance—is signaled early and deepens when the lace reveals a “diffusion” pattern. The tutor’s agency drives escalation: he interprets the lace, arranges bonsai, confesses aloud, and names his brother. Cost is felt in trembling hands and cerulean regret, though the “price” remains emotional rather than tangible. Under an Accumulative lens, the single deepening (lace pattern shift) suffices, but lacks a second tightening beat.
